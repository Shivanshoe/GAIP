hi everyone and welcome back to more call of duty vanguard so this is day two of the multiplayer for me we played some yesterday few hours and we also hopped on some zombies at the end of that i did unlock a fair few weapons and we're up to level 29 as well spent some of those xp tokens too i was thinking what should we do today now i want to level up the automaton because that seems like it's the meta assault rifle outside the stg which i've already almost got masked so we'll be using that but i also wanted to try a couple of the lmgs like the dp27 is supposed to be pretty decent and also just snipers in general i mean i've got to get to level 43 before we can pick up the car 98 which is quite far away we'll get there in the end well thank you for coming along to the stream guys i hope you're well if you're watching it live hit the like button thank you great way to help support me and if you're watching it as a vod do consider doing the same and leaving a comment below also a big thanks to activision for sponsoring this one we'll be playing for about three hours and 45 minutes tonight might run over a little bit three to four hours that's just gonna be pretty chill we'll just be playing the multiplayer you guys have any questions or topics you want to talk about in chat feel free richie thank you for the 10 months appreciate that let's get into it i've put a lot of game modes on for the first game i was thinking we could try s d at some point maybe champion hill as well looking forward to it what's up garrett jake adam hello mark almost full pc lobby this one this is going to be sway berlin did i play this map yesterday domination defend the objective training's over this is i think i did but i was on the other side i don't have a a barrel for this [ __ ] oh yeah i put stims on as well a little while to stick in there i don't remember this at all so maybe i haven't played this part it's kind of cool that after like three hours or something there's still maps that i haven't played in multiplayer [Applause] i've got a nice headlight what's up ripper hello jasper andre how you guys doing [Applause] uh yeah jp i did it was very good hostile record uh the cs he was asking about the major [Applause] cheeky long shot there hello first kill of the night oh my goodness i was thinking about playing later on as well with crossplay turned off and just seeing how that is spies in the sky apparently that carried for me barely touched that dude how many maps i think there's 20 tempex is that correct chat am i right are there 20 maps at launch it's either 16 with four champion hill or 20. something like that i should have warmed up my aim i am cold right now should have killed us [Applause] i thought i could get that guy before he turned king baker shipment is the only map that matters yeah i think we established yesterday that's coming like november 17th for november 19th or something like that so you know you don't have long to wait until you can play that jack got in the way hey richard thanks for the fight what do i think about zombies we tried it last night um i don't know it's a bit underwhelming for me personally i think the black ops cold war zombies was a bit better it was you know had a lot more depth to it more variety not just variety in the map but also in the enemies that you fight upgrades what are those dogs have friendly icons on i feel like they need to put shipment 24 7. oh dude i forgot to put my xp on again i'm a dummy i always forget first game i'm just so focused on making sure the stream's live and everything's working i always forget to put my xp on can't go up again can you what's up charlotte good to see you streaming again it's nice to relax and watch you before heading off to sleep for work that's very kind charlotte thank you for watching mitchell the round is almost gone turn the tide these days he'd be down to play battlefield with you teach him the ways okay you have to jump the gap okay so you can get up there out of a guard dog the sky body went flying then don't let me forget my xp guys okay next round just everyone's saying the chat xp xp [Music] i thought that i grenaded myself then how embarrassing that would have been teammate called a bombing it's bars in the sky [Music] and that's the egg sir i wonder how many times we can blame dice as well tonight yeah i'm not feeling the gun i think i need some more unlocks on it just keep losing a lot of firefight so i should be winning [Music] [Applause] every conflict hit the headshots though it's not bad i'm dead oh turned around then oh that little bit up there that got me so many signs yesterday as well [Applause] recon sweeping the sector [Applause] we flagged their recon fly nice little line up there at the top again what's up mercy david yeah i did hear about that it was just one person we talked about it yesterday i think [Applause] someone on xbox managed to download the game and then play it i think it was just a glitch or something alex [Music] what's up emily how you doing [Music] you have to just see the end all the time it's locked i don't want to see it every time just let me queue for another game two days in a row sent to yeah you've got the automatic level 46 and it's still pretty weak in gun fights all right sean i'll try a different one hey gluco what's up gabby good to see you again hey john [Music] hey ben welcome to the stream what's up tactical biscuit great name xp yeah you guys you've always got my back don't you you've always got my back i can't forget about xp look at that you know what's funny i did actually forget but now that you've told me i'm gonna whack that bad boy right on there um so i've got one hour double weapon xp [Music] one double xp operator xp is that another form of xp they introduce what's the point of that what does that do is that for challenges or something no no [Music] you don't unlock much then [Music] ads speed i like that site [Music] accuracy and recall during sustained fire initial accuracy and recall fmg i mean you might as well put some stuff on right you got those 10 attachments you might as well use them [Music] the skins and stuff okay kalana thank you you have to level up your operator yeah but in modern warfare the operators didn't have a separate xp did they they were just tied to your xp i think your base xp uh damocles thank you for becoming a member jarrod thank you for the 179. gonna get a who get there you go bud r2 do i use obs as capture software yes i do on my streaming pc my video is being sent via a capture card and then i use obs to stream on the objective am i dead i'm not dead i thought that glidebomb was landing straight on my head there's a guy above me here see damage wasn't great that was it [Applause] oh i can't see a thing there we're in the league [Music] there's someone above me that just hasn't moved oh they jumped down unbelievable intron what's up man this was the best map for you in world of war it's a great map in world of war i'm glad that they put this and dome in as well it's just solid maps you know fired and tested cod maps good map design anyway did i play elder ring um i'll tell you i've been playing elder ring all day an unhealthy amount about elder rink today uh yes i've been playing get along come on where's the damage that guy about ten thousand times i think that fmj's helping a bit [Applause] alden brings the reason that i'm so late today i should have been live like three hours ago or something it's fine you know late streams all good glide bomber assist coming in this reminds me of the matrix come on give it sometimes the kill streaks kind of bug out a little bit and you can't use them all metal johnson that's interesting nice that's ridiculous we've just farmed the point and they haven't moved that's weird come on behind everyone here no they spawned on the other side on the west might as well get some points here [Applause] ptfo boys let's go we'll play and we'll earn a hammer in that one yeah this map was called castle in world of war anyone that's asking in chat we've got 5 000 people in here that's insane thank you for coming guys i love that guy's face had rendered him 22 multi kills [Music] oh we actually got highest ed ratio i've got streamer mode on so did they actually see my name i don't want people to vote for me just because of the name i'd rather that they didn't vote for someone else instead i just voted for myself didn't i shouldn't do that dome as well yeah okay so the gun grew on me a bit there i kind of want a different barrel though the zac fa short zac efron sure what whoa anastasia [Music] 22 spider i mean that's that's kind of good isn't it because this game is a lot of shooting at name plates [Music] walter thank you for being a member for four months have you considered playing smd with handler i'd love to i think that'd be good okay this isn't i don't think this map is particularly good for this gun just because of the range of it this is sdg map for sure we'll switch it up pre-emptive still need to max this bad boy uh michael thanks for the five this hard point yes getting slapped around here do you know so thank you for the six months can you die on scariff that's a really nerdy thing to say i'm a nerd whatever any riders republic co it's not tonight if we do another riders stream yeah for sure because i can just get codes easily and give them away [Music] what's up hardpoint confirmed hardpoint activated [Applause] that guy must have been on 0.1 hb then [Music] oh let me in gregory watching with my cats they could care less gregory i don't think cats particularly care about video games or whatever's on the screen but i think it would be a better world if they did right imagine if cats could talk and play games and stuff how good would that be [Applause] well to be fair i have seen videos of cats that will look at what's on the screen and follow it and i've seen the fire hardpoint confirmed it's like a mobile game that you can get for your cats where things just kind of fall down the the cat just boobs it and it makes a little explosion enemy has the hard point so maybe i'm wrong or maybe counts to care or somewhere else spies in the sky our war mode on this would be brilliant i really liked war in cod world war two it's kind of sad that they didn't [Applause] right like i think there was was there one more map in the world to dlc for war and then that was it war mode was fun it reminded me of the old um unreal tournament assault mode i'm probably showing my age here but the enemy is taking the hard point tournament had a game mode which was essentially objectives or push and you would push through the level one team attacking one team defending and it reminded me of that and the omaha beach level was great that was one of my most popular videos for cod world war two i just had the mg-42 defending omaha beach death machine first time i've had this i it has splash damage on it do i get to use it still hard point is i'll just bomb in i thought it was just going to disappear there good job all right so still got 57 shots doesn't improve your health it's not like you're jogging or anything [Applause] oh come on how how have you not died i feel like it's it's actually detrimental i've died a few times here if i just had my stg i would have won the enemy has the hard point i'm committed to using it bro just want to run out will i be going back to cold war multiplayer nah i don't think so i might um i need to unlock the lapper you know that smg they released because i haven't got that so before i uninstall it i'll try and unlock the laptop zombies because apparently you can do it in about an hour and um one of my mates geeky he told me that it's quite difficult to unlock in warzone but in zombies you can do it quite quickly so probably do that to be honest still no footsteps yeah gabby there's just there's just no footsteps you just have to accept it i mean i've tried to accept it and basically i just don't listen to the footsteps at all it's just not in the game [Music] would i like them to be in the game yeah of course i'd like there to be a bit louder footsteps but oh someone behind me wasn't paying attention oh head glitch on the side of a tank eh ruined [Applause] [Music] under [Applause] there's a guy in here oh there was he's waiting right there what the hell [Applause] got him on the hill [Music] colby that's another one in the bag i knew you have i ran into any hackers yet kev no i haven't i've seen video of hackers though but apparently this isn't ricochet yet they haven't got the ricochet anti-cheating this [ __ ] [Music] but i haven't ran into any now [Music] spoons could be tweaked a bit shane yeah i feel like there's a quite a few times that you just spawned so close to someone why do you respawn so fast um that's cod isn't it jay that's how cod plays is this a step up from modern warfare 19 i think some of the maps are a bit better in terms of the design of them like this isn't as campy as modern warfare 19 you can't parkour as much it's it's kept a lot of the features of modern warfare 19 as well though like gunsmith movement tactical sprint sliding mounting stuff like that the operator system look at that barrel yet no 23. that's a shame guardian hey stand a man what's my crouch see royza dustin i'm on the ropes up to you buddy you made the choice and those player banners be disabled um i don't think so patrol move out and secure the objective oh this is the hell map isn't it oh come on bro where was that from didn't even see that guy what's my throne mouse four i just pressed mouse ball and go play it means that i can do it really quickly the i'm really being that guy right now there's just some dude running around with a knife look at this key i'm actually scared of that guy with a knife yeah they cut they kept stuff like the wall peak as well like with the doors i mean oh yeah you know uh how modern warfare put doors in though there's not as many doors in the levels on this i found maybe that's a good thing knew it it's this nice guy i know it's a different dude no it is ah come on bro this could be um a good shotgun map you know not really tried the shotguns yet i get those wallbangs i should just kept shooting shouldn't i 23. i think i can have that barrel now map is chaos yeah this map is just insane it's crazy i mean what did i call the stream guys this dude with a knife yes see that's where this gun excels dude give me a break stop running around with that thing [Music] i should have quit the knife myself is that guy the king really with the knife yeah he is he's got the most the limbs he's got a rocket launcher don't get me that easy yes come on die that's pretty good on this map we're gonna lie oh i couldn't get the four that was a bad spawn i don't even get that in there hey man what's up bro how you doing excuse me this turned your brain into a goldfish some people like that some people want goldfish brain gets them through the day yeah oh that was it hey from canada what's up gibbles how are you doing hey taraka give us alternate universe modern warfare 2 and i'll return to cod modern warfare 2's next year so the room is safe infinity wards i even pre-filed oh god where's the pentacle there's no pentacular crew today on this game why does republic mean by the way spectacular i can't believe the game said that will this game have spm can we can we turn it up to 10 yes hostile bombers they have am i playing at 1440p yes i am yeah i don't play any game at less than 1440p now 40p is like the sweet spot 4k is great for single player 40p 240 hertz is where it's out for multiplayer like colin battlefield 4040p they both look great especially warzone you get so much more clarity playing at 1440p over you what if this map comes up again i'll use a shotgun okay we should be on the point now look good grenade no one likes to play the objective i'll do it we've got 20 seconds stun grenade hey yeah we've lost this one one game gg what are the sights i don't know it's just um like a yellow dot i suppose i can't check i'll check afterwards for you it's called jack law what's an objective this was the guy that was just one digging everyone shotguns best on this map okay is that me [Music] why man oh yeah everyone else is voting for me so i might as well how do we do 77 limbs [Music] have you tried the bar yet no i haven't jf i got jack's hoodie it matches my initials and my new logo nice quality for the price thank you someone wanted to know what the name of the site was it's called slate reflector okay shotgun class if we get a small map i'll do it combat shotgun gracie auto okay i mean i don't know if that's a good shotgun but we'll just go with it anyway i've got overkill now why does this game have the overwatch voting system i know it's kind of similar to overwatch this isn't a very good uh shotgun map so i'll try out the dp lmgs i saw a post on reddit that said the dp is like insane which level capture the objective this will be intense i hope you came prepared taking charlie charlie locked down charlie locked down [Music] quite fast [Applause] really really slow air speed as expected for an lmg right [Applause] hostile recon in the air [Music] [Applause] a touch bigger [Applause] as well isn't it i don't know if it's the play for this map although we have kind of trapped them at the moment just hold this line oh they've got behind us there [Music] [Applause] i love the sound of it though got really good sound that's a bar two no problem man [Applause] i think that's almost as slow as the mg42 oh you can come on i was like right on the edge of the so you can't drop off the map at all [Music] i want to get back there that was a good position incoming grenade we'll be seeing you and matimo play bf together yeah for sure i was watching matt play last night he was playing vanguard and i was in his chat i think um we're gonna do spotter if we can get me x martin level [Applause] [Music] uh [Applause] i thought i was going crazy then i was like i'm sure i saw someone [Music] it's a rank four new platform oh you can move it up and down guys levolution crazy maybe this map is really imbalanced they've not really pushed out at all that's a friendly i suppose we could just be locking them down i wasn't sure if that was a player or not second guess myself yeah they used to [Applause] boom cowboy and azir back as well yeah yeah char posted a couple videos didn't they on beer that's the first one too i know that as he was playing with char but i haven't seen anything on nasa's channel for ages [Applause] yes indeed can't really take that grenade [Applause] behind us [Applause] i just got bombed spawns are flipped [Applause] they are attack dogs i can never tell i think so getting this little transport vehicle who's the most famous person i've ever met the most famous person i've ever met i've not really met many famous people i mean i've met a couple of footballers a couple of actors i've i've met plenty of youtubers content creators streamers but would you consider them famous i think you know being uh having an audience on the internet is very different to being a celebrity you know in mainstream although a lot of content creators and youtubers in particular are becoming mainstream now so maybe the lines are a bit blurry there aren't um i was at ea play for that bf1 event yeah i didn't meet him though he just he was just naming like uh zac efron snoop dogg kesha was kesha arizona i don't know i don't really care about famous people they're just people like like everyone else like you and me [Music] just trying to get by doing their thing you know most headshots this guy's got almost a 10kd that's insane come on like that's pretty impressive with spm why am i david beckham he seems like a nice chapter didn't he do it did snoop smell like panda let me tell you uh that ea play that bf1 event there's a lot of people on cloud9 put it that way [Music] would you like to meet germa del toro film director you're about to go see the movie he produced today the wendy guy he did a movie about wendigos today what's up joel thank you man have i seen eternals no i haven't k i haven't seen shang chi either i've seen all the other marvel movies i just haven't seen those two this can be a proper camping map this one you can get nukes on this [Music] do you guys think see how i'm mounted right now do you guys think they'll put this in warsaw where you can move and mount at the same time what do you reckon isaac cheers for the 15. it's very kindly [Applause] it's mine looks like you're zooming about yeah i do wonder if they'll put that in war zone [Music] [Applause] oh come on should be able to get in there [Applause] is it worth playing the objective i don't know maybe it gives you a lot of experience on that not sure there's got to be some incentive for playing the objective right otherwise no one do it i needed just half a second there oh this thing's pretty good man the damage on it does this work better than the beta did they work on optimization yeah it runs great i mean you can see my frame rate in the top left i've got it mostly on low settings though okey-dokey [Applause] [Music] live streamed on friday if so what time craig when it's live probably [Applause] okay i've got like an exceptionally busy week starting on monday starting tomorrow so uh i don't know i don't want to commit to any live streams next week i can commit to some videos streams i don't know yet if there are live streams next week it'll be friday or saturday maybe thursday i don't want to promise something yeah package inbound hostile recon in the air spies in the sky [Music] heads up enemy glide bomb coming in hot [Applause] i got a rocket launcher [Music] this is the hell map i mean if you could even dare to cross over you're dead my man tries to play the objective you see what happened to him [Applause] oh my head's gone [Applause] that guy seemed to know where i was instantly what the hell straight away beam me i become the slug how about that i can't turn left yes no stop looking at me man hi alert saves your ass so many times would i like to see some new killstreaks in warzone [Applause] yeah why not i mean i think i think there has to be right with the new pacific map it's probably going to be like artillery strikes bombing runs some of the warzone playlists are going to be vanguard only though and they've got planes in you fly planes around they've also got anti-air trucks anti-air vehicles [Applause] so for sure yeah there'll be a ton of new stuff with the walls literally just shooting nameplates though [Applause] like the time to killing this is so fast what's hardcore like and you guys played hardcore [Applause] ready for report running out of time get that zone you're waiting for the witcher 4 to come out have they even announced the witcher 4 i don't think they have on cd projekt red just concentrating on fixing cyberpunk in dlc3 or something [Applause] real machine or whatever it's called hey jonathan from canada what's up know what you're for you'll do better next time do you think they'll do a witcher 4 i've not seen junior either evie i don't need to watch that loving hardcore this dude was foreign a shotgun on this map like crazy they have announced that they'll make another witch game but if it's four we don't know right okay [Music] i was the highest ed with a 1.5 what kind of lobby oh yeah man what the hell yeah well there's there's plenty of witcher books aren't there so they've probably got loads of subject matter to look through and to make games out of but i don't know if the people who own the rights to the witcher and the guy that wrote the book would actually let cd projekt red just make their own witcher stories up maybe i think they did that to some extent with the quests right so just make an entire storyline maybe interesting to see all right we'll try a different gun if i use my xp eight minutes okay double wiper next [Music] could do some sniping what map are we on hotel oh this map is insane i could shotgun on this to be fair there's no axis operators no lucas does not as far as i know there isn't where's that shotgun team deathmatch you're ready for a real fight gotta get close though it's quite an open map that's not a good start what i have done from that distance maybe this isn't going to work out so well i think the stuns do 20 damage as well might have to go thompson or something [Applause] hold on to it i need to get close late i don't think the shotguns gonna work on this one maybe if i had slugs i heard that the snake shot revolvers are kind of nuts you remember when they were broken in modern warfare warsaw i'll give it one more go and then i'll change i think this is too many open sight lines for shotguns on this it's right here [Applause] great i didn't know you could get on here that's cool i mean that's a terrible spawn for that guy like literally right in front of me oh my this thing is terrible guys okay i'm not using that again sorry maybe i need to level that up a bit first like the damage there was awful the gore is bringing that memories from world war ii what is that animation baseball which shotgun is that noted don't use it hames it was the third one down people have actually got different animations now [Music] 13 multi kills in shocking is great for a second gun maybe yeah maybe everyone spam combat shotgun just send a message is that one better i really don't like it when it puts you into games that are nearly about to end on that shotgun yeah i think it favors skill based matchmaking over hey let's start a new game with this guy and let them have a full round because that was what how many minutes in that match two minutes maybe it just seems weird sometimes they just like i feel like they favor a good skill match over a satisfying game if that makes sense because that game for me that wasn't satisfying because i was in it for two minutes and it was it was nearly done by the time i got in defender oh this is better it's only just started [Applause] don't know this map at all we lost the hardpoint is [Applause] oh this is a ratty map you can just tell i'm not sure about this map on first impression it just it's rats then we control the hardpoint could be some nice lineups in the tunnels [Applause] where were they they were like i put towers somewhere where's that tower is [Applause] somebody he's on the tree there's a tree you can get up not liking the single player what's the old dogs is he actually in a tree guys let me get oh no someone else got me then you guys have got me thinking there's a tree you can climb or something you can get up there maybe he was just up there [Applause] away from me dog it was three enemies there brain cannot comprehend what happened then oh come on reload it quicker could i have that enemy has the hard point [Applause] [Applause] still haven't figured out where that guy was there maybe that's the tree [Applause] smg all real nice so yeah it feels nice i want the ppsh ppsh is nuts like i was saying yesterday how we uh we tested the ppsh in private games with everything unlocked and the time to kill on it was just ridiculous [Applause] oh that's a nasty english style [Music] look at this that's a nasty position i would hate to be on the receiving end of that let me tell you it's just a why it looks like a wishbone or something i'm dead come slide over here you specifically goodbye i'm on the next [Music] this just makes me want to play hell let loose with the boys i'll go play then a very different type of game i'll get a flank on here go the other way instead oh my god yikes i killed myself then i think i [Music] did located [Music] did someone get noob or something what's that noise bombing run i don't know i've not heard that before chad what was that noise corey thanks for the five nothing as insecure as a battlefield fan watching jack frank's play cod listen it's okay to like both games you know world isn't black and white i've always played cod and battlefield i grew up on both of those games i played battlefield since 1942 i played cod since the original played them all it's okay to like both games [Music] can you use the bren i've i don't think i've unlocked it charlie [Music] the noise of victory yeah maybe it's just a different type of game isn't it like battlefield's always been big and open a bit more tactical a bit more chilled out relaxed card stock it's it's always been an arena sure it's never really changed up until war zone war zone started to get a bit more like battlefield you know it's interesting crossovers what map we're playing why doesn't it show you the map have i unlocked that lmg [Music] no i've not unlocked the brand yet [Music] no spm in battlefields battlefield's never had spms it's not that type of game though domination capture the objective show them what's what losing objective maker is that a grenade i didn't even know it was there [Applause] did i just hear footsteps posing with charlie i think i just heard footsteps [Applause] [Music] why don't i rename my custom loadouts i can't be bothered that's why i don't need to the only thing i need to look at is the gun it's not really that stage yet because i'm still unlocking stuff you know i'm not at the stage where i'm like okay this is my favorite girl this is the metal whatever it might be do that in warzone where loadouts matter a bit more but in this no not yet shotgun i think i think the map's too big honestly planned to kill so quick you can't close the gap on people with shotguns unless i just camp in a building somewhere i don't particularly want to do that [Applause] oh look at this guy [Applause] charlie [Music] can you slam by this one they're taking charlie that was a bit better keep trying to slide cancel you can't really do it in this game it's so bad at any kind of distance both shotguns i've used patrick thanks for the 20. compared to cod world which one is better uh i'm definitely having more fun on this than i did on cod world war two i didn't really play cod world or too much outside of war mode losing objective as i said earlier that didn't really get any support or any dlc [Applause] securing baker ready for report it doesn't have quite a decent hit fire on it gotta close the gap though interesting just try out slugs if i unlock those see how good they are is that my grenade he was just hardcore camping [Applause] i think that's the max distance there you get the one shot that kind of range and i've lost it [Applause] they pushed as soon as i got flanked [Music] i don't know what that does i've never seen anyone slide that much in my entire life ever that kill gun was insane losing objective faker maybe i can slide more than that this make me a good player if i slide around like this am i good now is this good does that make me good the more you slide the better right i think that's how it works isn't it yeah the more you slide the better that's it isn't it losing objective charlie that crowd it's bad news if i stay there closing with charlie no what's the point [Applause] [Music] watch out dude [Music] sliding sliding sliding i see i didn't slide enough there otherwise i would have got a triple kelly [Applause] machine double kill there hello securing charlie trying to turn this one around this is sasha but that thing scares me oh man it's fine wasn't it no disgusting [Applause] jack jobs inbound for you yeah that shotgun is pretty good um thank you to whoever suggested it it was just someone in chat who went combat shotgun spam it was pretty good yeah you were right [Music] say hello to my little friend they're taking faker victory no dice oh dice that ledge it should have been mantleable but it wasn't like i'm sure you said you fixed that book but obviously you haven't so i know i'm dead so i'm going to go on reddit and complain about it we have actually turned this around guys unbelievable are you proud of me are you proud of me guys i'm i'm proud of you i'm proud of everyone here fungi is this stream yeah yeah this is stream look at that i didn't get play the game for that shotgun [ __ ] i feel sad inside boyce please watch going on boys [Music] there's no ray tracing in this crime pickle no they did have ray tracing in modern warfare but it was just for shadows it just made the shadows look really sweet you know what i want to do i wanted i want i want that old school cod feel cod one all action sniper iron sights that's

shouldn't you just like have them by default you could just take the scope off the gun surely i remember suppressors being used in world war ii jared apparently they did have them but they were very rudimentary and experimental they weren't in common use at all i'm not suggestion i'm not suggesting that but you know for the sake of this being a fantasy video game so there's some variation in the guns i'll get it eradicate oh my god the ads be so slow i can't wait [Applause] [Applause] i did not see that man i'm gonna have to just walk around like this why me have everyone on the map out

i can play games and edit that's it i mean that's so slow how can you get quick ads speed on the sniper rifles in this game guys does anyone know hayden thank you for becoming a member and dylan

instructions there how to get access i appreciate you guys man i mean we've got so many new members recently it's uh yeah it's really i don't know it just gives me a bit of confidence because um youtube live streaming is definitely um it's grown loads over the last what year or so maybe um but the behavior of people to actually become members it's not quite there yet it's not the same as twitch but i think a lot of people do actually enjoy watching on youtube now and you know i love the fact that you guys are here so thank you for being here i know it's it's it's a very different style of content to my usual like it's very raw and obviously unedited unfiltered this is all unscripted but a lot of you guys tune in and i'm very grateful for that so thank you [Music] where should we put this okay that's the bomb apparently you don't say enemy bombers [Music] did we get a collateral then i don't know [Music] server snapshot error cool there you go band just got backband well love the bitrate jack best looking stream i've seen in a while i hope so i spent a lot of money to get good quality on the stream [Music] it should look good we do 4k streams as well sometimes uh john belles thanks again bazinga save frames luke m thank you for becoming members [Music] joe murphy thank you man mustafa this is the worst sniper right now in vanguard don't use it i like a challenge training's over this is oh i think i've unlocked one more i don't know if i've got any attachments for it i don't think so who cares anyways one shot kill that's all you need i mean i'd like a few rounds in the clip definitely what is the other one no dice in the sky type 99 you don't get the car till level 43. we looked at earlier [Applause] no irons though it's got a scope on it that reminds me of hunt showdown look at that sway as well oh my look at that i'm not moving the mouse that is awful [Music] flinch as well bro come on gordo thank you my sound just my sound just disappeared for a second there did you guys get that on the stream as well friendly bombing run inbound feel like there's some jankiness going on with the game in the server tonight friendly setting up what did we get there this scope is full hunt showdown all good yeah it just dipped for a second she ran thank you [Music] [Applause] or maybe it is i that is terrible it's not one shot killing this one i feel like the one that we had before was always one shot killing you know not sure this is the play [Applause] nope oh man don't worry damn this way isn't it oh stupid incendiary bullets man i can't believe that they're in the game we've got it to rank four copyrights look at this that's snipe rival someone's got some unlocks on that bad boy got him nice just killed 10 people there with one bullet guys 10 out of 10. well done [Music] steam's in a world war 2 game yeah they're a bit slower than mw what the oh this is the guy with the incendiary stg just brewing in there that mouth's quite campy isn't it that's thomas de ruther thank you for becoming a member that's a cool map uh sick with it yeah yeah i play on low just for visibility and performance poorly drawn face you should play hunt showdown more it's plenty of fun i agree with you i think it is a fun game but i need more content in it like the i think it's quite a small team that work on that game and i love the fundamental design and mechanics of that game but the the content cadence of it is so slow that i just get bored of it too quickly i just want the contents yet that's all i want [Music] um mozinga it just exists [Music] yeah i'll show you the settings so 1440p 240 hertz medium texture detail and anisotropic fell ranges so it doesn't look complete garbo but the rest is just it's just low and then this turned on just gives the game a bit of sharpening pops the contrast and saturation a bit that's turned itself onto why has that changed that shouldn't be on that taking charlie domination move out and secure the objective i hope you like a little challenge charlie is out hope you like a little challenge i yeah that changed for some reason i don't know why maybe i'll know we have to leave keep it up [Applause] ads is a bit quicker on this now okay where did that where did that first bullet go the guy on the door i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i am dead i'm fine [Applause] i bet there's some mad glitches on this map [Applause] trying to locate that sound it's really difficult i think it's underneath me get out get out capturing are you coming back son are you winning make it stop kill they're taking faker am i missing something with these ball action sniper rifles or something losing the enemy has objectives domination pushback [Applause] you know that meme are you winning son how

that a bit canadian maybe yeah yorkshire accent that's it isn't it west country accent are you winning son by that texan are you winning son [Music] you give it a pirate accent well like johnny depp right you somehow hear alfie solomon's oh you shut coming like that imagine him sounding like mr rogers huh isn't it strange how you see things on the internet memes whatever it might be pastas and your interpretation of it could be completely different to someone else's lots of love for yorkshire tonight oh dust house okay shotgun time this is it shock it's shotguns then yeah i think it's shotguns then how i unlocked anything for it we've won a few games tonight cows are perfect cow lover great name i mean i don't know what it means but you don't often see a youtube name like that take the objective it doesn't make much sense but not many things too right idiot jack idiot you missed hey they have the patrol zone [Music] um the switch i mean sniper on this shall we should we do it for the mad lad uh i was gonna say smg but someone said sniper so [Applause] i'm not killed anyone with it yet oh dude ready it's a bad spot it's coming [Music] am i seeing things like i'm sure the ui there for my teammate was red for a split second kind of getting sick of these hit markers with the sniper rifle i have to be honest with you guys when i hit someone in a cod game with a ball action sniper rifle and it's in the upper torso it should be a one-hit kill alas sometimes it is not hello get dice on the phone you gotta protect me lads come on we can't be having us we can't we can't be having this now can we bye oh he's doing it to me he's doing it back [Music] you're giving me away dude you're gonna get the you get you're gonna give the game away lads what are you doing to me what are you doing you sent me down the river i hate you there's another one oh that could have been a collapse i would have been perfect i missed it that was an enemy i can't believe you're camping there bro i can't believe you've done this nicholas sturgeon just killed ready for report hostile [Applause] spawns are flipped have they me out ready for target [Music] [Applause] has literally just prone holding mouse on oh my god out [Music] yeah it is a bit of a challenge playing with a ball action on this map but i like it guys it's a bit more interesting for me than just running around with a [Music] i mean i could just run around with the smg this is way more fun i think i've died like eight times in a row zones up [Music] just constant death noises [Music] and come back stronger i feel like i'm watching someone else's fever dream i think that's a good way of describing cod you know [Music] who should we vote for most captures are in the objective uh rap boy i mean you you it's cod you just die it's fine there's no consequence die die die die die die die it's just you know it's die there it is lobbies are brutal that's that's what cause like in it like spm is um its way in [Music] used br [Music] i'd like to see the baby thompson this could be a good thompson man you're just sick of sweating your ass off every game that ain't gonna change full voltage isn't going to change i'm sorry hard point capture if you're an average player or better this is god forever hardpoint confirmed yeah at the top hardpoint is active i wasn't thinking about that [Applause] that's dead hostage in the sky hostile straight been found no [Applause] need more damage man it needs to be a one-hit kill every time hopefully i can change the attachment leave me alone dog on this [Applause] pain absolutely how many how many bloody dogs are there i just heard another one worth uh dude no i'm playing on pc oh i can hear another dog i don't like it [Music] [Applause] [Music] what game mode in 2014 when you try first just all that warfare i'll probably just play all that warfare for like four hours or something how's that guy doing i'm just gonna have to bust out the stg again as soon as it's playing the best weapon in the game i might have to guys i might have to do it [Applause] that [Music] how about she's gonna move buddy [Music] where i want to be the glide bomb are you kidding oh my god [Music] looks like roblox does this really look like robots hostile recon in the air spies in the sky hard points that's the place to be if i had ammo then that would have been great [Applause] oh [ __ ] yeah all i want to do is just get through somewhere to flank that's it we've been absolutely hammered this match grinding into a pulp it's a dust like you were meant to be i just got a quad kill with that grenade [Music] what a great game 10 out of 10. yeah it might be time to switch to the stg guys this might be time again play the game right there do i have the owen gun i think so rat boy yeah i've not unlocked anything [Music] i mean i'm playing stupid as well like i'm just running forward and dying when that when you get a lobby like that it's you either do that you can't or you leave those are the only options really [Music] [Laughter] 200 fps lol oscar p thanks for the 449 hi jack and chat oscar said hello to you guys where does the next cod go from here past present future remake was modern warfare too in it it's going to be modern day i would like them i would like the next card to expand on what they did with ground war i don't want to play das house again and i would like them to make some kind of extraction mode like escape from tarkov you know how hazard zone for battlefield is bit escape from tarkov bit hunt showdown i'd love to see god have a go at that especially in a modern warfare game oh dome dunn's a great level what's up my way from montreal welcome man thank you for coming uh they're taking charlie [Applause] what the deuce let's go with that molotov that'd be good take the objective [Music] what's the thing that you can get on the guns that let you see aim plates sorry aim plates name plates better there's an attachment isn't it [Applause] [Music] securing able capturing able i understand myself security table ready for report the round is ending not much hope for this one again it's put me in a game right in the end pathetic put me in the game at the start please flashlight it's flash yeah but is that in this game that is flashlight in cold war isn't it spotter where is it uh ratical thank you for becoming a member they're driving us back team deathmatch eradicate i'm you're ready for a really [Music] this machine is good i swear you just kill yourself right when you have that i don't understand what happens when you have that gonna just end up killing yourself any time okay anytime an ally runs in front of you as well [Music] it just does damage to you it's so dumb so excuse me while i reload [Applause] it's like that scene in saving private ryan where the is it the sergeant the sergeants fighting their german soldier and they both run out of ammo and then they just end up like getting their pistols out and they both run out of pistol ammo and then they throw their helmets at each other i've not seen that maybe for a while so good and please just put me in a monster i can start i do have a twitch coolio but i don't really stream on there like my audience is here so this is where i stream [Music] and it becomes a video afterwards as well everyone wins [Music] there's nicolas sturgeon again this map is low-key operation locker intron you watched bander brothers in pacific again recently yeah um i watched bander brothers about a year ago again and it it's so good i mean some of the cgi is a bit you know it doesn't quite hold up by today's standards but you can overlook it like the acting and the writing and that's phenomenal the music as well oh it's so good i've never seen the pacific though all the way through i remember when it came out i watched like the first three episodes and i was like you know what i'm not feeling it but i think it'll be one of those series that i'll have to go back to i've got the doggos got the um war machine mortar barrage is that advanced uav afro thanks for the five would i recommend this to someone who's never played cod um i mean it depends what you're into really right like do you like arena shooters if you like other arena shooters you'll probably like this [Music] security if spm's working as it should do then you should be matched up with people who are equal skill to you so hopefully you'll be playing against other new players so you shouldn't worry about like just being dumped on all the time because you should be up against people of similar skills i like this time again considering there's no attachments on it i'm just gonna go kill myself again with the death machine i can't i can't help myself like i just have to nice all she wrote [Applause] oh they're right on top of me oh we missed they're taking baker they're taking baker that's some alignment telbo what's up [Applause] i am the terminator dude are you saying i can't be the terminator let me leave my dream man go go go go [Applause] i remember when all the soldiers did this in world war ii this is how they engaged each other the americans and the nazis would go what like this what they jump around did they jump around the corner with their thompson and just start shooting jackson do the thing and then jackson would go around the corner like this and then the german soldier would also be like and then that's how the war was won you know the allies just had better skills when it came to jumping and shooting around corners so and that's history that's real history true facts for true people right now the allies uh had um nike air max germans they didn't quite have that they didn't have the uh air max technology in world war ii so you know they they just couldn't they couldn't jump around the the corners as effectively as the um the allies could and the americans shared the nike air max technology with with the rest of the allies as well like australians in particular they were they really really got into it the day was one fight drop shots [Music] oh it's so stupid you how dare you how's the thomas it's pretty good my field yeah i'm not trying it with a 30 round mag so i don't know i've just started using it seems pretty decent the rate of fire eyes nuts get really good mobility as well so pog as the kids say [Music] [Music] uh yeah that makes sense red costume where'd you get that one nicolas losing objective charlie [Applause] the minimap's gone what we're gonna do 360 no scope big ben oh off big ben [Music] losing objective charlie he wants it who wants it [Applause] [Music] i think we need more bullets there securing baker put one of these bombs on there how about that oh god head glitch this mate how glitch this i can't believe you've done this please i'm begging you oh why are you there in the corner what are you doing in there to be fair moving around just bad timing wait wait they had armor you can get armor in this how'd you get armor is that a kill streak or something field upgrade i didn't even know that was in the game to be honest guys hardcore is the best way to level guns it's also the best way to go crazy dude you have to move you can't stay there move you're gonna die you need to move [Music] oh he's been stunned now i couldn't save him i tried that was the famous ball jumper there stalingrad [Applause] shake it off round is almost done i don't want to lose i think we will lose quite like thompson though it's good he was project he was straight farming in that corner dude he was just living the dream imagine doing that in real life firing an ak-47 762 whilst jump sliding over a wall mid-air imagine the amount of recall the gun would just go flying out of your hand wouldn't it you're doing it one-handed do i have the pizza gun what's the pizza gun rat boy do you mean the the dp28 use the camping perk yeah corn there's nothing wrong with corner camping that's fine it's called in it so it's called then [Music] is this game going to have battle royale it has battle royale hydra blade it's called warzone there's a new map coming out december the 2nd [Music] this game has campaign yeah [Music] why does she have an ak in world war ii well it wasn't actually an ak it just looks like an ak [Music] why is it now called ed ratio because to make you feel better if you damage someone and they die from someone else you get an elimination so it's not really kills and deaths anymore [Music] campaign was pretty good i'll give it a 7 out of 10. it was only four to five hours long though so you know it's up to you if you think that's worth it for the price what's up mad soup skills quite a late stream thanks to that no problem matsu thank you for coming right okay it's full stg sweat fest this match hey dom hard point hold the objective take your time donna hardpoint confirm take your time and remember to think they really just tell people to think my aim was terrible then she said mate just think remember to think just remember the thing i didn't think i didn't think did i should have been thinking about taking the hard point thought about it that time didn't i look how good the sdg is man it's silly it's actually silly however it is compared to all the other guns let's just try playing the game on easy mode [Applause] i'm not thinking i'm not thinking think jack think use your brain idiot hardpoint is active enemy father is coming up in the air spies in the sky this is the worst map all the others are fairly good do you think this is the worst one oh behind me behind me okay [Applause] locations we're down but not out [Music] hard point is ours who's got me unlocked that's quite close though remember to think remember to think hardpoint located hardpoints under fire hardpoint activated hardpoint is ours hostile recon [Music] i think i was just camping back there the whole time after the point hot point is ours not thinking yeah this map is pretty pretty weird i agree with you whoever said that in chat [Applause] oh you were right there yes they are joshua i mean that's contract at the hard point that's what the game's like now press ct plan pc [Music] the shredder ah shredder [Music] that shot was personal enemy has the hard point not like this jesus christ locals gave the enemy our location oh no it's just a crack for frag isn't it trade kills post match as well must have been on the uh enemy i'm the only one on the team guys everyone else just left it's just so sweaty that everyone just left that's funny afro thank you for the two i like halo 3 multiplayer and doom so maybe cod um yeah i would say cod's a bit more fast paced than halo 3 though time to kill is so incredibly quick on this game halo 3 is a bit longer ttk because you've got the shields fire fights are a bit more drawn out crips and dry how does the gun play feel compared to modern warfare is it similar just with different guns um it's a bit similar yeah there's just more visual [Music] take the recoil steal yourselves this will not be [Music] don't bomb me don't bomb me ready this is my rock now this is where i live [Applause] i like it here death machine you know why they call it the death machine don't you because when they give it to me i just kill myself i live here now i'm gonna get killed by someone in that stupid tower [Applause] i like this map renee hostile recon in the air spies in the sky control zones just stick around like i do we got an empty control zone hostile record in the air spies in the sky allied mortifier oh come on we're going to dominate them i'm going to send you back in time to world war two you're going to fight for the allies you're going to get the death machine don't shoot it at the ground in front of you it's going to kill you jim walters thank you very much for the 19 months that's incredible man thank you yeah that's very kindly [Music] i mean you go from the previous game to that it's so inconsistent that's the problem with spm it's just it's just so inconsistent [Music] good night ben catch you later so someone in the chat said that um blitz is the play is that where i'm going wrong so just select blitz herb dub do you think they improved the operators in 2042 or did they go back to generic soldiers they're still keeping the specialist as far as i know hey val i kind of hope you have close neighbors that can hear that on the impression are like what is this going about uh no they they're not that close they wouldn't hear it [Music] [Music] is enemies ethan thank you robin thank you from a soldier is i hope you can sort that out man that sounds nasty airport oh [Music] triple kill quad kill monster kill okay friendly sending a glider do i play fortnite no i don't i used to i used to play fortnite then i ran out of g fuel and saw went down from there our point is [Music] [Applause] is the hard point now he must stop him and again that was an interesting map saving the victory right rest up get some chow they look like they're made of marshmallows they probably taste really nice very evil knives play it again the invisible man again check it watch i need to work on those will you be reviewing 2042 after it comes out i don't review games sahil i just kind of play them and just give some feedback and opinions and impressions on them if you want a review just go on like a press website or something i'll just be playing the game i'll just be playing it that's it uh ethan schwartz thank you for becoming a member you're awesome dude what's up mike i couldn't care less if uh oligarch was manager of man united or not mike i'm sorry i have no affiliation you should try puppet combo jack what does that mean rick sanchez what's puppet combo thank you vidal yeah what games are worth getting for the ps5 spider-man spider-man mars morales dark souls remake horizon zero dawn two is coming out soon get the god of war remastered edition because that's just sick um there's not many next-gen games there yet [Music] return is pretty good i'm just trying to think ratchet and clank i'm so bad at remembering like console exclusive games i think i said the main ones though ps5 team deathmatch subdue all threats win or lose on you you're supposed to destroy the sith not join them and my brother anakin i loved you [Applause] i did i played back for blood yeah that's not an exclusive to ps5 though um i streamed that on pc we did three lovely streams [Applause] we're dead yeah but that was uh ps4 as well right was it no go sushima was it ps5 only i don't remember that game was sick though last of us although that's on ps4 as well uh the blending i call that i couldn't even see that guy yeah i've already ate that oh yeah you're right i do have the 30 round mag don't i know shadowcaster i'm just watching these guys and seeing what happens on the way okay they're all gonna die [Applause] [Music] i like my bomber on the way any opinion on the guardians game it's really good yeah [Applause] i really enjoy what i played of it i've not completed it well i played a bit it was good uh good graphics animations interesting gameplay made me laugh a few times as well writing's pretty good i'm gonna put that mag on [Applause] i had really low expectations for that game as well being honest with you [Applause] thank you [Applause] possible finish on stream now i haven't got time to fit it into enemies yeah right on top of that [Music] they're going to upgrade warzone for the new consoles no i think it'll get filled with you that's it need to watch that angle there on the left keep dying from it hey smoke could be good wouldn't it i can't say that smokes useful in many call of duty maps but i think on this one actually might be [Applause] do i play new world i did hubbed up i got to level 25 and then i got bored of it [Applause] i did a dungeon i did a war and then there just wasn't enough variety in the characters or the enemies all the locations for me to keep playing so i stopped [Music] it's been uninstalled it's gone any planned gamer shows in 2022 i don't think so jim maybe e3 i'll probably go to e3 and gamescom if they do those again jason thanks for the five thank you robin first though i reckon warzone will get filled with your next-gen consoles i don't see it happening on previous gen i don't think they've got the performance unless the new pacific map just runs insane i don't see how they could do it i think the dance is probably not as optimized as it could be because it was the first map they've probably learned a lot [Music] wait everyone is camping yeah forex they are i think it's the map like this map is quite campy can you please move the logo to check the score is that blocking the score is it i'll just turn it off use code jack frags in the cod store all caps if you buy anything sounds gone again what the hell i will be playing halo yeah marsha marsha martia many ways to pronounce that thank you lee karate appreciate that audi shawn what's up eric hey prince geezer good to see you man what's up jaby the hutt jabby the hurt that's good i like that oh not this map oh no no no no oh no no what's up abdullah how are you doing man thank you for coming still think graphics in modern warfare 2019 yeah i agree with you here i think in multiplayer the graphics in mw are better in single player eradicate all threats i think vanguard's got the edge i might just see the environment stay tuned do live in the uk just some game here we have the league keep it up oh this is i'm getting awful deja vu here about what happened last time i played okay he's dead [Applause] where's cameron i don't know he's probably chilling probably in bed might be watching a movie with the mackies living the dream yeah do i like rts games yeah i do pablo i don't really play them anymore though i used to play a lot of artists like commander conker cc generals red alert starcraft um dawn of war world war ii company of heroes i used to love those games unfortunately um mobas just replaced them for me like goater and and i'm just bored of traditional rts games now it's pretty late here yeah it's half one in the morning [Music] no i never really played civilization or age of empires i think they just brought out a new age of empires it's supposed to be really good i've got some friends who uh play it and they really like it yeah she has one i wouldn't post rts games on this channel on youtube there's no way the videos will just tank they get like you know 50 000 views [Applause] it's annoying that you can't jump through those it's like you can't even do here just want to get through it oh eddie's pretty brutal i didn't hit a thing then that's funny [Applause] [Music] rts is a real-time strategy yeah it's correct hey frost what's up hello in hot where's egg fish brussel hello that's how it looks on the other side the guy next to me died again but i didn't you just stay here the whole match what do you think is this ultra settings no chl this is low settings is this guy getting sick of me being here this is farming right now all right this dude's like can you please move from my spot this was my thing and you've just come and evaded my space yeah william the sdg is by far the best country easily oh you've already seen someone do that a complete game really [Music] bologna i'm playing in low settings because i like to be able to see better and for more frame rate just so the game feels smoother i can show you guys what the game looks like on auto graphics if you like that and play around on ultra just to see the difference [Music] i want some fish and chips sean it's a bit late for fish and chips mate if you're in the uk at least sus hey that's our first max ranked vanguard gun now i've just got to do 26 more before the war zone map comes out on december the second what fps you can see up here i get about 200 in game but yeah we'll put we'll do a game on them nearly unmute the lobby there ever do that put everything on ultra there we go i think we got everything didn't we did we get everything domination capture the objective it looks smooth now it looks like this butter smeared all over the screen taking able [Applause] that's gonna make a big difference to the lighting there you go that's maxed out now allies called a bombing run incoming it was quite blurry i think you need that fidelity stuff let me turn that back on that's better hey look it's 20-21 [Applause] you literally just ran past me oh this level is quite grey [Music] the single player looks incredible though uh if you go to my channel and look at the uh single player walkthrough part one watch that in 4k graphics and nuts there's one level the second mission is set the night before d-day you play as a british paratrooper and as they jump out the plane they get shot down and their parachute fails so they have to pop their secondary shoe and it's at night time of course because it was a night raid and the lighting is just phenomenal like they've got so many uh nice effects with the fire and flares in the sky it's gorgeous inbound the environmental artist good job with that level the styling grad mission as well ton of detail there some of the facial animations [Music] also very good but you don't see any of that in multiplayer i still think the most realistic looking thing that call of duty's done though is the clean house mission from modern warfare 19. like i don't i'm i'm not really seeing a more realistic looking level in a video game than that [Applause] does your fps drop yeah a little bit not much though [Applause] i've gone from about two what was i getting 230 240 to 150 look at the top left you can see it bounce capturing faker talking about the mission you can't quite the baby yeah yeah town house mission the graphics in that are just insane is it blue summer [Music] yeah i still gotta use the mg42 before the stream's over oh there's two there apparently oh there's a little hole i see you have to get up at 4am for work tomorrow matt ah dude wounder i'm sorry and just slid in there this game is get two kills and die get two kills and die a lie most of the time for me it's getting one kill under you know gotta get that one gotta get that one kd [Applause] that dead two kills dead i'll go dead [Applause] play a little slower i can't be bothered to play slower it's call of duty isn't it like it's just a casual just one mess around game nobody care about my score okay there anything do you just want me to walk around like this is ideas i can play like that if you want teammates looking good for us [Music] that's me now excuse me [Applause] objective faker closing with charlie this is my life monkey thank you for the 25 man very kind teammate heads up no they flanked me i dare you to give the bayonets ago this game has bayonets is it really does it really now oh come on he's behind me boom i just get rallied by a controller taking call of duty is a controller game now man i mean it kind of always was in a way well i'd say modern warfare 2 is when it really started friendly bombing run inbound remember dust514 um i think so wasn't it like a massive multiplayer game or something moon said it's bedtime hang on wait wait 15 minutes it's bedtime thank you for the 50. like your stuff have a beer on me one that's very generous thank you buy a few beers without my friend [Music] there's always one around the corner waiting to go or behind you when you spawn eve yeah it was eve wasn't it not that i played it did it even ever get released that game i don't think it did there's like weird squares on my uh on my game since i changed graphics you said it's an artifact i'm not ready for the amount of content i'm gonna have to make though so [Music] so a snapshot error that's the second time that's happened there you go there's the game on high settings i hope you're happy uh makney seven i'm using an rtx 3090 graphics card and he plans to play crab game with tommo i think they've probably played that enough like there's not much to it really sometimes i feel the auto aim on console is completely overpowered what do i think [Music] console players need aim assist [Music] especially in a game like call of duty i mean it's just the way it is like 50 i think would stop playing call of duty if it didn't have aim assist on controller honestly i think it would be that i think people would hate it that much without aim assist they would just stop playing i use this bad boy can you make a video about battlefield 2 patrol can you even play bf2 still modded servers maybe kool-aid so i kind of love it patrol zone secured the league's hours reptilia i don't think i've got any good cameras for this [ __ ] [Music] chl thanks for the five you ever think about doing patreon away from company men on youtube more real talk about your opinions on games industry um no not really i don't really see the point to be honest like for exclusive content i don't think it makes sense you know you youtube for me has always been it's always been free that's why i like making content on youtube because you don't have to pay to watch any of it it's all free and if i suddenly had like exclusive content which you had to pay for i i feel like i'd be doing a disservice to my subscribers especially the ones that have been there the longest so no i wouldn't do it like if i i know to me like i watch quite a few content creators on youtube and some of them have patreon that's fine like that's their choice but i would never i me personally i would never pay to see someone's content when they you know when i knew them from their youtube channel oh [Applause] okay sending goods your way [Music] no replace the wrong ammo [Music] this isn't is this an sdg with an insane rate of fire they have the patrol zone what's going on here then what's going on there david thanks for seven months how do they justify world war ii weapons with attachments it's a game it's a video game it's a fantasy version of world war two [Applause] and i guess they justify it by like blueprints for example ah if still thanks for becoming a member yeah i mean there are there are plenty of world war ii games that claim to be authentic and realistic you know that you could play instead i guess um i'll let loose best example i think hell that lucy is great i love that game what was that [Applause] for grabs oh come on it's a very difficult game to get into but it's incredibly satisfying once you get used to it loose there's nothing like it really i mean there are other games similar like squads but like being in a a team where you have a commander and you know you're all different classes in the squad pushing on an objective and there's 50 soldiers in front of you that potentially kill you and there's no ui really you can see your teammates but you can't see enemies can't even see when you get a kill apart from literally seeing the soldier fall down [Applause] the thing is um the vast majority of people that play video games don't have much time and they like things to be easy to pick up and accessible that's fair enough and hell let loose is not an accessible game at all so that's why it isn't as popular though i love it i think it's brilliant i love the fact that the developers have actually stuck to their guns and kept the game as you know authentic and realistic as they want to really it's accessible to a certain degree but it's still a really steep learning curve and you have to have a bit of patience to play that game there'll be times where you just run forward and die over and over again but you don't know where you've been killed how you were killed you might get team killed hey but there are some moments in hell let loose where you know the flank pays off for you capture a control point like the center of the control point is worth more to your team so if you can get your squad there you might actually have an impact in a game with 100 players which you know it's quite a good feeling friendly bombing run inbound also the tanks and the vehicles they're super rewarding as well because ah it's not like a battlefield tank where you drive and shoot there is a driver's position there is a spotter position there's a gunner position the reloads take ages and it just has this level of immersion not many other games [Applause] where did everyone go i'm just behind the curb there did he just say nice one jack is that what he said uh kev nor angelo spongebob thank you hell let loose has commanders as well so the commanders can talk to all the squad leaders if they want and they can do stuff like calling recon planes artillery strikes they can drop supplies so there's a whole level of like team coordination that's required to do well what time is it by me now 2am [Music] [Laughter] what's up i think that should be it boys and girls thank you for watching hope you guys enjoyed this we did get a few levels there we maxed out the stg i feel like the sdg is just the best gun this one's going to be really good when i've got all the attachments first nah i bet you could make a sick warzone build though with that if you maxed it and this yeah that one is the one that looks like the ak and it's very similar isn't it as44 perhaps that was a prototype in world war ii i've no i've never heard that before got the thompson up to level 15. didn't really use the owen gun that's the one i want that one is sick for war zone ppsh double barrel that might be nice in multiplayer need to level that up i need to play this game so much oh my god it's just going to be shipment isn't it 24 7 shipment double xp i'm going to go to the store i'm going to buy 68 000 packets of mountain dew 69 000 packets of doritos get all the double xp codes and just play shipment 24 7 for a month and then i'll be ready for the new warzone map is there a battle pass not one that you can buy at the moment there's a free one but they've had this in war zone for a while but maxed out but you can't the only thing you can buy in the store is
