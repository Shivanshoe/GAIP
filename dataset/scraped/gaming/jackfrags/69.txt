let me tell you a little story does this shot look normal to you maybe yes maybe no something a bit off about it perhaps but a couple days ago i got a notification on twitter from a guy called rev saying that they would love to see me check out the small rocket launcher from battlefield 2042 portal i watched their video and that convinced me to give it a go myself something about it wasn't quite right so this rocket launcher was in bf3 from 2011 and it was always a fast firing rocket but i feel like the 2042 version of it has been turned up to maximum boomstick now it's not quite hit scan and there's a little bit of drop on it over distance but after using it today i think this is by far the fastest and best rocket launcher in any battlefield game and right now there's a featured gamer just running the battlefield 3 maps and factions so there's actually people playing it making it the perfect opportunity to test it out now i knew after the first kill that i got with it that it was going to be good but what you're about to see is my first couple of games using this and quickly realizing exactly how effective it is at taking out helicopters but also infantry who find themselves obliterated in an instant before they can even react i also managed to hit what i think is my personal best heli takedown ever in the first game i couldn't believe that the shot connected so here we go then if you enjoyed the video leave a like subscribe if you're new let's do this all right see what this baby can do then first i'm going to surf on this jeep i can actually stay on it as well oh my goodness how about this jet here oh that one was close that one was real close wow you went flying okay well that was the last thing i expected not scripted i swear thank god they don't sound that good in 2042 maps i haven't even got a kill with this here we go here we go okay that's pretty interesting the body look at this whoa dude that's some sick dancing right there man the lord of the dance over here living the dream look at that chopper i know it's gone uh that is instant isn't it who's gonna win look two attack helicopters going at it friendly's got less health at the moment enemies got the high ground both fled ah enemy wins fair play it's not cheap boom that was awesome that sound as well i've never heard that before hey come here come here oh my god yes another one another one i'm on the map in here oh oh they're learning they're fighting back i'm sure he was over here somewhere hello oh yeah that's the same guy isn't it got revenge man i'm the only one you can jump through i forgot right i'm the only small player around these bars no oh god get the gun out for that yes nobody else is more in the front here hey oh come on this is stupid it's born in this chopper here fail out i get that it's a huey isn't it out there no way no freaking way no way no way that just hit that's that might be the best damn that is another one oh what is happening there's more yes that might be the best chopper kill i've ever got in battlefield okay that's my new favorite thing like i wish there was more bf3 maps than this please okay caspian border so i know what i can do so let's try and maximize the efficiency here how many kills can we get [Music] what are you firing at what is it hey glitch no don't think so rocket beats head glitch and he's got a rez as well good job you no come on ow you're gonna regret that yeah goodbye what oh there's a bloody tank right here and i don't have any rockets cramming over that's dead good we get revenge on a different tank here using my instant rocket launcher yes on the top game off look you just that did zero damage terminator over there i don't know how that wasn't a kill oh the prediction this is so much fun man my there's a jeep coming i didn't kill him in one shot wow i love this ak though man so cool silent snake or suppressed ak always um oh there's a guy here it always reminds me of metal gear solid two not there a bit too low give me a second if you could just stand there sir bit higher oh there it is it's so dumb that looks really nice so they did a good job with it shooting a shot shouldn't have done it hey the fidelity of this is great oh you do miss him once in a while i'm not gonna miss that one though i can't believe this is the thing what is the velocity of it yes oh double kill double we're getting better value for money now oh there's another one no i'm using my gun whenever i use my gun i fail should just stick to this more yeah watch out oh you idiot bang you didn't need to crash through i got the small it's fine who's next you is that another double kill a helicopter come on come on come on come on come on oh too close too close i'll try this thing out i think i've ever used this it's like a wire guided thing isn't it you fire it and then you can kind of control it let's go in the tower there and the dead no kill notification though weird this tank here you can just roll up on the small and take the b objective not today they jumped out oh that was a mistake yeah big mistake simon you can't not when there's a s'more around helicopter did that go through it i'm sure that went through it come on there it is there it is love it oh the tower's coming i've never even seen that on this remake haven't played it that long goodbye oh there's more down here ready for a rocket launching no kill use the gun oh i feel dirty two kills with a gun in a battlefield game not using the small i'll have to make up for it before the round ends you can outsmart snipers with it and another one come on let's go 19 tickets you yes i love it they just explode so good any more no oh man that was incredible they put this more in the main game please that'd be great
