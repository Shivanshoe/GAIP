I hope you're doing well and welcome to some more bf4 live gameplay commentaries today we are playing a bit of final stand hangar 21 is that the right number I think it is hangar 21 and I've got this gun today 10 points if anyone can remember what this is without me saying one of my favourite smg's in the game simply because it's got ridiculous hipfire stats it's insane this is what it looks like when you reload I'm sure you've all got it by now as the PDW our that's what we're going with today I just fancied running an SMG to be honest with you look a gone boy gone oh that was just a bit low I've put a laser sight on it so I can try and hit fire as many people as my heart desires I wanted that helicopter dead I wanted it dead but the rounds just started here we've almost got a full server so that's cool should we get quality I've got some slums on the quarry this works doesn't it can't you just like drive this into a vehicle then it will explode you can't detonate them but I think if I just like run this into someone and then maybe shoot them it will blow up and it will do a lot of damage or if I find a vehicle I can just drive it into a vehicle but will there be any that's the question got some snowmobiles in here I think it's about to explode right feel like it's about to explode and usually that means fire down here maybe I could just kill myself for this slums what an idiot we've already got all the points except a I haven't done anything all I did was kill one guy and then drive a quad bike up here and kill myself I am NOT an effective unit right now it's such a cool dlc isn't it is like the whole vibe of it man just so different for beer for just didn't have anything like this and he just got sniped I put the box Ted you're just thrown on the ground what are you doing now we've got the high ground but to capture this flag you have to drop down don't you gotta get down in the mix please just afk all right let's sweep in hey blowing up again know what they're doing Oh Oh wanted that Oh what are you okay I guess it sounds now do I trust this guy to fly it out of here I think I do come on you can do it you can do it carefully duck you son please I see it now on wood on wood there we go what just did a Black Hawk just fly into us I'm not sure what happened then I'm taking it there it's mine now oh there's the Black Hawk over there I don't think so one I mean this guy's in a helicopter here that's the wrong side that's the right side I can't even see it now one more shot the dude jumped out I think there might be in here that doesn't even work how embarrassing I was expecting to just jump through the wall like a young warrior Calhoun he was there though my assumption was correct that was a little flying jet I wish I'd have had my rocket then I think I hear someone now you want some more you want something that's what would have happened the first time you say I'm gonna fly this in there this Black Hawk gets out of the way let's get these back helicopter in air along with a transport chopper and a jet apparently I think we're I think we're good you kidding how cool is this just the fact that you could do this oh alright we're in trouble now I'm so dead right that's it that's okay I've had my dice well they kept you in E oh yeah it's pretty bad in this range oh the helos here back again I like the fact that they like flying around and dammit how am I missing these shots but there we go this probably wanted quick reload I mean this is a round of battlefield isn't it this is typically this is yeah that's that's what it is that's the essence right there jets flying into the ground helicopters dueling each other you again my god it's that third time that I've been killed in action this match please oh thanks for the rest I appreciate you are there all over it now I've got a push ready to be effective with this same good grenade was all right there everyone's dead honesty cap it all friendly yeah we got this nice guy said I've got the robot gun I found it on the floor how do i oh yeah there we go right now I can fly around here they're trying to cap this point but Robo gun has got other plans auntie that's an empty ethic the anti-air thing walks onto this I can barely see a thing when I'm using that you just couldn't see a thing I do remember though we're not trailer came out for final style and we saw that people were like yeah what what is that is that real and everyone looked it up and it turns out the US government made a prototype of it especially just a flying gun I suppose that's bought that's what Jets are in a way right but they could have missiles too well I'm going to be the most effective attack helicopter gunner you have ever seen ragdoll though that was sweet put me in
