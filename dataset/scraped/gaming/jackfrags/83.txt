this is a game called crows i remember seeing the trailer for it last year and thought oh that looks kind of cool i can mix between battlefield and pub g and call of duty's bit of squad in there as well and it's just released on steam it's free so let me check it out so i can edit my equipment here i've literally just started playing it so i don't know what i'm doing but there's various weapon attachments you know all this stuff right you can pick and choose looks like all of it's locked at the moment oh i got a nice squirrel there pistols we've got different knives i think you can throw the knives as well incendiary claymore sticky bombs everything that you would come to expect i suppose with a game like this it's also got vehicles in it combat vehicles tanks aerial vehicles see what i'm saying about the battlefield naval vehicles nice little rip boat there and a parachute you can also pop a parachute with that said i'm just going to get into a game the different game modes we've got quick match squad operation blood zone capture the points i'm just going to go with the one that it had selected and see what happens saline valley blood zone take the flag i didn't get to read that oh my goodness we're in spawn in the middle here they reached 50 of them we must turn the tide so i suppose this is like it starts in third person but you can play in first person as well ads i think they're my squad mates what's this x i can buy stuff what's that an airstrike i can't really read that very well this is the teammate hello there's tabacus got a scoreboard here very nice 60 players oh no it's it's going up is it 64. it might be 64. not even sure what engine this is on nice little map here though that's a tank isn't it that is indeed a tank i don't know i can't really do anything about that can i think so we're just gonna it's gonna go down here stay away from the tank i'm not sure i've got any kind of anti-tank capability to be honest all right i can vault over things can i open that door oh i've got a leading machine i've got snake in the grass flag d there's an enemy up there i've got this enemies everywhere what is going on with this grass it looks crazy enemy there down and there was a guy that just ran behind here right hey first kill let's go instantly straight to level two i got damaged and then i was killed by a rocket launcher okay can i spawn on my squad mate here change pov i can see them in first person as well that's cool there we go let me let me spawn there oh i'm on a roof there's a lot of like sharpening going down the bit of destruction there is that gonna hurt yeah oh baby that grenade hello there was two there there wasn't there did i just get two then i did oh they go down as well die i don't even care he threw a grenade at me oh god what's up i want that nice station there get the refill someone's shooting at me then oh my god that's not that can't be right that must be like a rendering error or something i have to look at that i don't know what's up with my graphics that is there enemy pushing it am i supposed to hit anything oh hello tank this is pretty much battlefield isn't it it's modern day battlefield i've got a heel i have to heal as well i say you may be up in the air and i've got a pistol here looks like uh oh it is a 443 ally captured capturing mining machine enemy down i have to switch guns aren't i what did you have is that the oh that looks like an m4 help i can move around when i'm down dead looks like quite a big map as well how do i get can i just fly that helicopter capturing mining machine at point b yes okay player ready i think i'm controlling this that was weird okay it's quite laggy let's see i'll go third person rockets rocket missile is that just default okay it handles really weird it's not inverted either which i'm not a big fan of lock on alert trying to find a target here what the what the airstrike thunderbolts going in there i don't see anyone i think the other team have nearly won though i want to see people lock on alert where definitely someone at a isn't there in that building there okay the controls in the helicopter definitely leave a little to be desired kind of difficult to aim it i think i've been hit yes was that a kill that's my first helicopter kill on the point yes second combo kill eject right i'm going down get out okay so it's a little bit scuffed but you know not bad so far graphics aren't bad i'll land on this guy here oh they've been bound i think cheeky little combat role there what was that about it's cool man i wonder what the tanks play like can i get in that f yes okay am i a gunner what am i i'm just a passenger unless i can change suits yes okay i've got a gun i'm on a machine gun let's go let's go up there oh god that's really weird it turns with the turret suppose he's connected to it though right i'll go kill this person where'd they go a game like this when you've got the choice to play between first and third person most people would always play third person right because you get the advantage although aiming of course you know much better in first person at the end of the round yeah it is we got to level three operation failed let's try again next time first impression there it is okay next map next map let's see is that leonardo dicaprio i mean that looks so much like young leonardo dicaprio i knocked the shotgun oh i got a hollow sight okay cool i gotta put that one private second class oh baby we are moving up in the world customized weapon i don't put the sight on it oh it's all here i see along the top hollow sight boom angle grip got a laser designator on there different magazines okay and then i mean if i do another build i've got uzi lmg dmr that's the sniper these sniper rifles well it looks like uh the orb from cs or l96 isn't it something like that smg try an smg build okay so i've got two builds there emotes oh no not like this okay got an intro sequence a10 is flying over black hawks going in hey chinooks as you can actually just drop in as well at the start okay can i like cut my shoe as well i don't think so straight on to the capture point there onto h and we're down i got my uzi i mean the animation is so pubg isn't it just that running animation there refill ammo i've got my c5 i think you run faster with the knife as well sick roll dude all right where should we go can i drive this nope can't drive the tractor oh shame ally that sounds like bf2 is that friendly fire i don't think so i mean blood came off but the way that guy reacted i don't think they actually took damage there all members move out i can spend some currency guided rocket launcher uh okay i've got a javelin well that actually replaces your primary weapon can i just fire it apparently sir i'm pretty sure javelin's in real life they go up and down don't they lock onto a tank and then it hits it from above right so how do i get my gun back can i pick that up i'm sorry i didn't mean to let me check out the explosion not a couple trees down if i can get ammo back for the gentleman i'll go for this ml3 put that in there oh baby are there any enemies that i can hit oh it's a weird scope it's got some rgb shift on it there john rambo here boom i want to get killed with this i'd like to see the baby that counts looks like we're all attacking e as well as a tank okay the tank is air dropped in capturing mining machine at right i mean this looks like an abrams doesn't it tank cannon i've got a coaxial and the cannon you can kind of break the trees down if you go quick enough a bit jittery though oh can i do some destruction with this maybe did that blow up no does not like it all right why should i take this yeah i don't know what the plan with this game is if it's going to be free to play forever or just at the moment like i just saw it on steam because i had it on my wish list i'm stuck on this so i don't know if it's going to be like a fully priced title or half price or whatever please let me know down in the comments below i'll get down dude i can't quite aim down enough to get that guy there's a guy that i downed oh no that's a really really unlucky spawn for that guy right on his squad mate oh my why can i just see everyone yes this is going to be one of those games where tanks are just really appealing it might be i think it was a uav or something that's why i could see everyone there someone just fired a rocket at me right there oh it's really difficult to control this sometimes okay here we go who's on the roof that's unlucky [Music] smoke ready again we'll go underneath around this way i'm only getting like 40 to 60 fps he is on the highest settings though where you going buddy i want to fight another vehicle that'd be cool i don't have enough talk to get up there oh we were killed by an air strike nice fair play someone actually dunked on me there with an airstrike let's get some more boots on the ground gameplay i don't know go down here there's a guy that i cheeky down rifle here check that out i can actually use that site as well he just ran around the corner and annihilated me with a rocket launcher it's interesting to see though like a lot more games popping up that are copying the battlefield formula or trying to be battlefield it's not friendly no i think that's enemy tank no i think it's an enemy um do i have anything that could come back no i don't think that's gonna do any good is it what did i do then i just a bombardment location airstrike i don't know how quick it's going to come in though i mean if you're going to stay there buddy let's see if it works ice moved i get it yeah i did actually get it yeah i got the tag nice can you damage oh you can actually damage the light helicopter with small arms fire oh he's gone he's out quite a bit of horizontal recoil on that too i need to heal oh my god there was so many enemies there what the hell uh guiding rocket launcher any tanks i can't see any down there i mean there's so many here what the put the rocket in there yes long range kill i want to use this on a vehicle though it's intended purpose oh direct i hit it's a friendly airstrike oh nice kill you stop the bleeding okay right that's just like prolonging your death so you could wait for a medic or something to try and revive the other thing yeah i can read it now morphine box that's just a med kit guided rocket launcher that's a javelin artillery air strike squad respawn device that'll be a spawn beacon uav support some options there i think a game like this though like i would rather have made the distinction between first person and third person and just picked one i'd personally pick a lane with that one but of course it's up to the devs and the player base however they react to that enemy helicopter here find some rockets in out for the air strikes oh it drops off flares as it goes away tactical lawnmower spider wonder if i could use that i'm going to try the uzi for a bit although there are these transport vehicles back here what is this there's a name for this isn't there i don't remember what it is though i think i first saw those in 75 i'm a three maybe the first time i saw those i think so yes i get him i think so what good did you have oh that's an old right i've already used that it's smoking a bit look it's on fire oh god i'm being shot they're throwing grenades at me what if i switch seats i go in the gun oh come on time enemy down with someone else isn't that yet there yes does this have first person yes it does and an ads as well okay that was a nice little switch there if i could imagine come on no it fires really slow come and get me that's a weird looking child i'm a student are you just going to hover there like that recapture come on come on come on come on come on come on come on no what i think it just flies straight didn't it surely that's it come on that's not a kill really i deserve the kill surely it's an unguided rocket direct hit dice please i'll tell you what i am getting mad battlefield 2 vibes from this how much money have i got can i do artillery i think so um yeah there was a tank right next to me how did i not see that right where the enemies at there's someone over here vote up there ow i don't think you can oh cheeky i'm not sure you can slide maybe i'm doing it wrong we get the win quest complete yes we did it well there we go there's a first look at crows like i said it is free at the moment on steam if you want to check it out that's a couple games for you first impressions potential definitely a bit rough around the edges but i think this is like their first play tests maybe and here's young leonardo dicaprio signing off right guys if you enjoyed the vid
