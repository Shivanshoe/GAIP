hi everyone hope you're doing well today I've got a really fun solo game for you using my favorite solo loadout with the mp7 here's my build pretty common nowadays but it shreds I swear though I love and hate solos at the same time on one hand it's incredibly satisfying if you win because it's super competitive and you've got total accountability for winning or losing but also I don't like it because it's essentially a horror game but if you're active and you move around you can push people and just have some great moments and you'll see some of those in this video if you enjoy this leave a like let's get into the game I reckon if we go for that scab there's a couple of bounties there that we could perhaps pick up afterwards and this area is always really awesome looking for a fight we're going straight away still need to build a good I'll load out another giving out enough of the chunk yet here's some oh wow she just fired a couple shots of me and stop for some reason keep having a fight over here oh he's right here the guy running there where did you go hmm no thought I get lucky they're trying to go through the wall bank oh hi I'm not taking out fire he's got a really good head glitch there so drop off a little bit I think that window is open there and there's footsteps in here I've been shot in the back as well I'm dead there's one in here one outside I sure know something yeah that's the guy that was showing me in the back of thing it's not like if you might gonna push come back here you climbed up no it's fast there is where did he go now that dude just straight vanished just straight-up Houdini be I build his curse that I feel like if I go in now I'm probably just gonna die finish off this stuff that Jeep coming for the by here what are you doing maybe they just check-in how's it gonna shoot now look right there feel like pushing this guy don't just vanished where were these people going unless they went over here to the King and maybe Hudson Oh done yeah just didn't trust the mp7 there to get the job done you know why those satchel is just so hard to pick up I mean I could go for that King myself they're just camping in the car shop here you go through that window there you can he's gonna hear this though you may have a choice I climb up I might be able to drop down another way no one else around by the looks of it he's coming over there close the ladder how did he beat me then with a bison as well must have just been headshots I suppose but I didn't expect to lose that no mind horse bull my favorite think he's on the right now them crossbow only challenge that's one of those videos I need to do one day so thankfully it's lovely loadout here that's the one that I wanted I'm still annoyed about that mp7 how did PP buys and beat me [Laughter] this right here is peak solo war zone I didn't want to get the bounty but it seems this guy is here I'm gonna creep in I was lucky now second guy miss if I'm ghost what we wanted I'm gonna get you a V from the shop but that building there is always dodgy I told you I knew it every time there's always someone on that building two guys here that they're gonna fight somewhere think there's a guy here sleep tight I wonder why he was looking at her it was two on the UAV remember there's a lot of loot here and there's some footsteps above me how'd you how should we do this bank a couple studies up there then try different angle don't hear anyone usually they knew nothing on heartbeat I was right everything just faster mate sorry that's a body good can't wait until they add like another way to get on top of these buildings let's take the X 50 feel like I should no no I'm not no no there we go just in case see anyone there someone was looking at me can I get out of this oh this way there's a quality here after news oh please not looking at me though fine [Music] trip receive our mail and loot their new gas masks known on heartbeat just gonna wait here because there's a little like corner the Gasper I can be safe spot anyone as you go that's a different guy please don't fire another RPG really don't like this I'm gonna move I'm very lucky there the RPG guy was in this building here there is not bad I heard a crossbow is a living oh my god I didn't see that damn it and you're a bit worried about this crossbow guy though there are here and then I feel like I heard two little footsteps then not all big fan of this god I just gave you a heart attack and that was not a crossbow that's like I'm really carefully just riding the edge of the gas I'm thinking looking at the zones is gonna be maybe one or two in these houses there's a guy there I think you got a right shield hey do is start right kill them interesting tactic no one else there I'm just gonna go to this guy and see if I can shoot you in the back the bridge is pretty good spot here I like this sorry bud nearly got the drop on me there you haven't got any plates though my what they said there'd be plates to left there in a fire one left who won though I feel like this guy won they just hided behind the car or something I don't know I could see for it maybe it wasn't that guy I was wrong there we go oh that was good I have really enjoyed that I should be wearing a heartrate monitor for these the highs pounding right now so she could feel in the within the solo again though cuz it's just you you've only got yourself to rely on you make a mistake us on you that's fun I hope you enjoyed that guys if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe if you want to see more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
