here a little edgy legend it's a chicken legend oh i'll do it with one i might have one later here's all my money gold bars all right i'll put it in the little gap and then oh wait no we don't want that do we we need it up and away oh  there we go it's up there start the zip line if you go up the zip line you'll be able to get it okay it's on a roof okay are you joking mark that was dead then why can't i not enemy you can jump up on the rock and get it does it it wouldn't let me use the repel oh there a guy down there there's a guy down there yeah i just wanted one of the repels you can use one of them you can't yeah i tried both always one is one up and one down yeah i thought i tried both in mind uh restart yeah uh new lmg seems a bit messy rest when you get a chance uh oh did you die oh yeah there was just a man down there and i couldn't use a zip i'll see if i can get rid of by now jack thank you oh yeah the uppy one yeah okay here we go you ready i think i just went to the wrong one there's people shooting us from up here by the way friend okay thank you is loadout clear uh yeah you can use it yeah you can thank you you can use it but here we go any plates around eight if you want yeah [Music] i'm liking this map by the way i actually like it it's really nice i didn't get the finish up there there i hear someone coughing behind us to all right whoa uh 3 30 3 30. and now this wow that cluster comes there was a guy near us i heard someone coughing around there i'm going to get that might be underneath satchel yeah there might be someone on the east chat all right gold balls eh so is that is that just replace money on this map i think so yeah and then it turns into a bag once you've got so much of it you know a giant bag they're still up here by the way on red mark yeah yeah they're still out there the two that i down just got red guy's marking someone on purple he thinks there's someone behind he does yeah snap it no okay there you go down there see him he's under the ground right yeah yeah that's why he was coughing that no i bet he's on he's on my level is he inside the tent and it goes underground i don't know is that how he works uh there you go he's killing someone wow this map this map is just insane there's stuff he's gone i don't know what is he is he baiting us what's he doing no no i think there's something under the ground dude i think you can get under the ground there we need to we need to try and position yeah they've got such a horrible position there i mean they're gonna have to move though next zone so oh yeah i mean you know something nearby yeah here yeah [Applause] i mean that is just i mean i can't two guys in front here yeah that's unusable come down there's another one there okay i got the kingslayer they're both still up and left oh god okay okay dude this is a joke that's literally unusable but it's last team last team nice to see wow yeah well we're screwed now no yeah because they they're in this opening right here trying to push the brake one quick one there's your hit with your jack got daddy right in the gap there yeah that is impossible are they we have to move again another one right where he died he's a butcher put your skin there's a bug with this uh blueprint with a kimbo really yeah it stops me from uh sprinting oh that's horrible that's not good i have to switch weapons and then it comes back it's horrible uh wait can we stay up here i don't know this is like a little museum there'll be so many cool easter eggs on this map look at this stuff this just screams easter quite hard to see players though everyone's gonna blend in oh yeah yeah we know that oh yeah oh yeah where is this last guy no idea look how high uh a giant roof oh dude look at this it is literally assassin's creed i'm all the way up um this new map is it's like parkour central it's great it is quite parkour yeah it's kind of insane apparently the lmg blueprint that i'm running has got the recoil booster on it so no wonder it's going mental ggs boys and now spm hell yeah exactly yeah we expect nothing less and now it's spmm hell yeah that that build is horrible for that lng you want to make some quick changes um is there another blueprint for it uh the smg yeah cybernetic rifle jack it's from the battle pass geeky past times has already created a zombie he's created a zombie yes okay okay i'll go i've got 20 minutes on twitter apparently he's already done it he's already created a zombie [Laughter] oh goodness man that sounds like a cool easter egg whatever it is well someone else has already um remade the uh minecraft redstone system and they've uh calculated everything and now they understand the meaning of life yeah yeah it's pretty sick i mean you know you can expect that after 10 minutes yeah video's already out that's nice there's only one barrel for the new lmg there is one barrel you either use it or you don't okay that's a bit nuts just let me know when you guys are ready i'm gonna run around seven as well why not so that's an unusual choice for sure let's see how it works out for him i'll be right it'll be right yeah i need to do some new lmg all right jack the reason that blueprint the beach coral one but the lmg it's got gung-ho and the recoil booster on it okay so fire while sprinting and increase your fire rate okay yeah wait someone's found a ray gun on this map as well what a new zombies map confirmed what's for warzone in war zone are you talking or well where else where would it be well hang on no well shino numa is live for vanguard yeah oh so maybe it's done wait hang on a minute let me have a look let me have a look where's geeky past times if you found it already jack no no i'm just doing my guns i'm i'm ready by the way yeah yeah i've queued up geeky that's all i can type that into twitter and see what comes up there we go i made a zombie in fortune's keep by lighting three candles and then pressing f to pay respects you get some quick revives as a reward for killing it oh yeah i see the screenshots he's he's literally created a zombie it's at the graveyard wherever that is you wanna hear this yeah let's let's do this let's do this that's actually a pretty cool thing to i mean do you think they've done this because they couldn't make a new big map and they were just like no one likes caldera let's do this also this is this is this kind of like it could be just a modern day old city you know like rebirth like i mean look at the skin they give you in the battle pass this is clearly not it's clearly not uh not good have you seen the um the skin you get at level 100 let me have a look at jesus christ like a gladiator that's yeah he's a thick boy isn't he no one normally use him because he's too thick oh they've got a fortnite hammer as well level 89 look level 89 oh they do we couldn't beat fortnite so we became them it's not like [Applause] yes that's what it is it was captain america that did it yes steve rogers this is america's ass rank 85. look at that the stg blueprint there that's definitely world war two in it i do know what i love there's a little charm at rank 84. that's the best charm in the game that's brilliant that's such a good show mr inspector [Laughter] by the way i'm trying to find us a match and he can't find us once because we won our first game and not enough people have downloaded

from around terraces what does that mean is there a terraces on the map terraces yeah there is over there a bastion i have yeah i've done a bit of research into it thank you is this not better than rebirth i mean it's um it's a lot more complex than rebirth we've only played four games on it so i don't know we've won three came second in one it's um i like the flanking routes though like it's a lot more diverse in terms of what you can do a lot more verticality than rebirth places to disengage from fights places to flank places to hide i'm enjoying it man i don't think there's any reused assets on it either like it feels fresh and new which i'm quite surprised about yo jack your setups are wacky bro i'm just using the blueprint and the ram seven resurgence the new smg for your team when are you playing star citizen gas is approaching your position uh i mean i play it every now and again i just uh every time i play i record try and get enough content and then when i've got enough i make a video earn points to bring those back they've all seen geeky's tweet just wine balls it said and then you go and put them on every objective downstairs and it opens up like a bookcase and there's gold weapons and stuff inside we've spotted an enemy radar in your area i'm looking does it say where you find the bottles um hold on sorry he posted four pictures positive id on the back

at the top of keep so the banquet table yeah actually looking at the tweet now we need to find the bottles at terraces oh i see so you take them from terraces to keep that's what you're saying yeah that's what he's saying okay that's bloody hard yeah that'd be difficult i guess if you die you'll lose the ball yeah you probably were in these lobbies should we go back to assassin's creed yeah

the top of the tower [Applause] you don't always have to jump up and down there oh but you do jack it's part of the game that literally caused him to die because it gave me an angle the new jackhammer he's lying up here there are people up there by the way on the red mark there were anyway whether they're still there these guys up ahead here where is it in the graveyard in the grave [Applause] you

tower as well i think i'm just on top of it [Applause] you're down in westy i think it's a rebirth pistol kill them all rebirth players aren't going to like this map because there's too many campy points you see what they're doing though they're doing a daily rotation of the map good after the first week i think that's that's a good shot actually yeah then they can rebirth i think this is better i gotta be honest i i like it because it's escape routes you know you dip away and be like bye can i get my loan out yet or is it pain uh i just got mine we'll cover you stud come on go get it they still on the lighthouse here they are i'll just pepper them be aware you show the door now you're fine [Music] where are the other players in this lobby what's happening uh they're probably just all over the other side we can go and try and find our uh black market thing maybe there's men there yeah yeah let's do that we haven't done it here we nope so it's like a bounty but it's just a crate and you have to narrow it down yeah but then when you get it it uh lets you buy like special stuff oh i like that special grenade there we go have a frag there we go oh it's moving in a bit you got guessing wow mercenary helicopter over here look you want to go and kill i just want to go and see that's a player isn't it [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we've spotted an enemy radar jammer

just need to buy try and find a portable just get lucky yeah maybe taking shots here blah blah blah we're kind of stuck here but i don't mind staying here for now but it'd be difficult to get a res i think it looks like they may be pushing up we might have to move right here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] yeah i mean i've never been down here i presume it goes somewhere oh oh my god there's two people chilling there and dead are they downstairs right yeah you can go underneath there's a whole cave system there how many were there two okay jack so uh you did yeah yeah i mean if you wanted an absolute risk station you never know oh it's right there dude no it's right there no i literally ran past that thinking it was on top you get a double red as well no way contract failed if you guys drop straight in as well put your money together down the hovel down the hovel on the bye drop him in two two a little bit never more broken i just got snapped yep same i don't know where they are one is [Applause] i mean we could go back underneath right you can go this way [Applause] this isn't a great grammy weapon but we'll take it i just don't want to get us stuck down here you know yeah we have to go oh my god there should be people here right in front of me you have to go up the zippy don't you no no you're staying under [Music] [Applause] he dropped [Applause] thank you and we could get a load out we're getting those to get positioned you could get a loader do you want to go get a procedure if you can get there no okay right above the car just put it right on top of us [Applause] what the hell that was epic oh my god i'm back oh literally i was literally talking to my chat and i'm like there's no way we're winning this one chat and then here we go i can tell you right now rebirth players will not like this man no it's too it's way too cavenous so many angles but it it changes up the game massively it's it's a mix between caldera and rebirth yeah it is yeah it is [Applause] that's a that's a big that's a big pogging win there is that four wins now i think that's fine five yeah well i think we should quit when i quit my head i'm going to just do a what how long have we straight yeah i'm going to do a client reset i'll be back too yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and starts not resting and i'm restarting i'll play one more and then i'm done it's like i'm getting a single fps starde enjoys the map what's this i think i didn't say that i'm sure he'll get two weeks in this is fun i mean i prefer this over caldera i think on first impressions just because it's so if i don't know if it feels like um a ground war map like broken mentioned i think you know there's a lot more options for moving around and squirreling away you know clutch plays and stuff like that on rebirth it's really easy to get chased on this you can juke people i mean i've done it a couple times people will be a lot better at it than i am but it's uh yeah it's cool in that respect you need a mod for your chat i think i have a mod chris there should be a mod here anyway but yeah i see messages being deleted and stuff it's fine dude ever been on a holiday to the isle of mall jack no i haven't paul but i've heard about that place i have a friend who lives there they would tell me about how difficult it was sometimes to get to the mainland if there was a storm because it's just one ferry right to get over it's faster pace kevin yeah i think so class setup for the ram i don't know i mean i just whacked it all together i think that's you might want to put attack laser on instead of like the full grip but the side to side recoil on it's pretty bad if you don't have the commando full grip so that's what i'm using i think like um car 98 might be actually pretty good on this because it's a bit closer range isn't it but that's the vanguard card right here i don't know it's a marksman rifle isn't it yeah uh orestes dude that's so kind of you man thank you loving the stream been following for five years and just wanted to say a massive thank you for all the epic content you seem like stella guy too wish you all the best yes i've heard the more wine you drink the more bads you get arrest this i would agree with that sentiment definitely are you boys are going to check out caldera they've got all the changes on it i haven't even thought about it to be honest maybe we'll do caldera tomorrow i could do do you want me to do another stream tomorrow on caldera or something i don't really need that no attack laser don't you build like an ads speed build ability hmm [Music] go with that flight of hand okay so a lot of you said yeah live stream tomorrow maybe i'll do that you have to put a sight on this don't you what can i sacrifice though stock it's called the sniper scope isn't it am i just being stupid like where is it doesn't have a scope on it by default there it is it was higher up in the list coffee shots the best i'll get that recoil booster soon precision consummate okay you got paint tomorrow just run iron sights nah what's up normal guy we're just normal guys uh matthias drop storage tomorrow thank you man thank you matthias 24 months as a member i appreciate that are you on the discord materials i don't recognize your name or your face [Music] samo what's up been great watching live for the first time catch you later keep up the good work thank you samo hopefully you heard that if not you'll hear on the vod cole cooper thanks for the two do you think devs will ruin war zone two like warzone one i mean that's subjective depends on what you like or don't like about it right i think a lot of people stopped playing warzone when it changed to vanguard right like cold war integration was okay and they changed the map and they changed the colours slightly but there were some really broken matters in cold war and it started to get a bit wacky after that so i think that's what you're saying you know when they kind of took the dance scout but we'll see i mean it'll be a brand new map for war zone 2 swimming new game play types i think there'll be extraction mechanics there'll be lots of ais it's going to be very different very different i'm going to see what's going on with the boys uh what's going on lads we're waiting for yao sorry i didn't get an invite or anything i didn't realize it says you're offline jack oh yeah my apologies i didn't realize wesley cried a bit but he cried yeah yeah he cried he's back now sean thank you fine we fine yeah new map's good i'm enjoying it all those easter eggs they'll be done in a week and then lightstart said when's the next one when's the next map yeah there's no way what's every six months jack actually you know yeah but in six months wall zone two be honest i know new map in six months [Laughter] but we do have the updated cow there we've got storage town on caldera yeah they've updated all like the pois they've got more cover on them now no bushes no bushes anymore took them away um i was just saying to my child like do you want to do caldera tomorrow maybe yeah i'm down absolutely what time yeah in the morning eight a.m it has to be in the morning yeah um six a.m yeah i could i could be ready for um about 10 30 11 that's my normal time my normal time it's normal time it's just a noble time good to hear that sean tom thank you for the five go back to bf3 man i haven't played bf3 for a while i did do a video on it a couple months back right good game still good even though that came out in 2011. uh colt just with five yes it's subjective but by and large people long for 2020 for dance without cheers yeah cheese were quite rampant on the dance and then they did the whole ricochet thing so warzone 2 you know that they said that that's launching with ricochet or the new version of ricochet so cheating shouldn't be as much of a problem i think glenn thank you for becoming a member if you want to join the discord jackfraggs.com discord head over there instructions have you tried the ral mg recently and then no i haven't the last time i used the route was when i did a rebirth game using the hipfire build that i copied from pawneehoff and it was a really good video that people really enjoyed it got good views i think we'll do caldera tomorrow hey james [Applause] is the violet stealth pack out uh is that the purple power ranger yo-yo so then yeah can i make that fire faster [Applause] what attachments effect rate of fire i don't know study them yeah what attachments effect rate of fire on the corner yet none of them none of them thought so yeah it's only the sbr that has a rate of fire attachment yeah um but i use sleight of hand for the reload speed yeah so you can just put loads of bullets in training's over time to see what you've learned thank you for 25 months what's my go-to snack um i just like uh crisps or chips as they're called in the us like a sandwich cereal probably that many snacks to be honest i'm all

menu uh for the day bugger off this service is terrible come on hurry up what's that chopping crisp sandwich cheese and ketchup for you get out of it what if it was melted cheese how did this um cheese and ketchup sandwich meme start what's uh i think broken's best place to explain that well lucky had one and then wait lucky actually had a cheese and ketchup sandwich yeah he did and then i i don't know i don't know what happened after that wow so much i don't know i don't know [Applause] it's uh it's a mystery it's true truly deceptive did he put butter on it at least oh i don't know mmm

got depression but then he goes on a job and um his target is in an acting class and then he decides he wants to be an actor instead of a hitman it's it's like very funny it's uh bill hayder it's kind of like breaking bad vibes but not quite serious okay they're pushing us by the way guys i'm not right he's he's an ex-marine okay from our rights dodger yeah they're um south southeastern oh there

it's so cool [Applause] yeah i think there's going to be a lot of verticality in that new warzone map [Music] like do you remember playing for dance and sometimes it did feel very like two-dimensional didn't it it was like yeah whereas cal there is a little bit better this map kind of feels like where they want to go with the new [Applause] [Applause] here's one shot [Applause] [Applause] yeah definitely i didn't expect them to do that all right yeah i know i'm just staying alive what map is this this is the new map fortunes keep cal it's just come out it's really fun i'm enjoying it

later please see you chat that was really good just gonna spend a little bit of time talking to you um because we didn't really chat at the start you know just threw myself straight into a match am i live often no nick not really i haven't streamed for a month last time i streamed on youtube was uh the godzilla king kong event yeah hey lucas i'm doing good thanks hey josh jack is freaking out yeah there was a lot of grenade kills in that match wasn't there disappointed a little bit bigger than rebirth james um a little bit the cheaters and scammers are working overtime on my channel yeah i spoke to youtube about it as well i mean hopefully they're gonna put more of a concerted effort into trying to fix the problem yeah the car wasn't working gabby just wasn't working for me hdr is my bread and butter though i think i'm just much better with it um there'll be more star citizen vids dude don't worry it just takes a little while to put them together i don't just like to put anything in them you know i like it to be good content put some interesting stuff in it how do i leave the pies up here isn't it yeah that's why the videos get good views though because they're just there's no wasted time in them you know it was it's all interesting stuff there was a spam cheap part in the chat i'm not surprised [Laughter] i like finding you in other people's streams just like where's waldo but where's jack that's good what do i think of 2042 right now nicholas the new map is great i like the new gun the crossbow is pretty sick the new cell choppers are good uh the season one content needed to be like three maps and four guns and four vehicles you know like the new content's really good it's quality but there's not enough of it and i think for the next season if they keep up that cadence then you know it's not a good look for the game i think they need to increase the amount of maps because maps are the most important thing for battlefield players i think maps and guns that's what i'd do if i was in charge i'd just double down on making maps get all the guns in get the ones from portland straight away do the remakes as fast as possible it just needs more it needs more content for a live service game battlefield doesn't really work that well though as a live service game because the whole ecosystem of like multiplayer fps has changed and people just want all the time like we've all got really short attention spans now and battlefield has always thrived on map packs and that's where you build the memories and the experiences on new environments new things new things that you can destroy new bits of evolution new guns new gadgets every dlc had a theme you know and it was always packed full of content but i don't feel like one map per season is enough and if they keep that up yeah they're gonna have to improve it hey evan do i miss for dansk yeah i do sas it's good it was a good map um hell there is a good vr map i just don't think it's as uh fun as the dance was you can't use vehicles as much on caldera you might be able to now though now they've changed it but you know um with warzone 2 coming up they said it's this year i think december it's not that far away really are you able to see how long i'm subscribed lucas i don't think i can actually you might be able to tell me though what do i think of the new ob1 series episode one was okay episode two was better episode three and four were terrible apart from in episode three when darth vader murders everyone episode five and six were good episode six was like it was made by a different person the budget the choreography the scenes just it felt like a movie it was just so much better i kind of wish that they'd have leaned into the flashbacks a bit more with like anakin and obi-wan but i don't want to say any more because i'll spoil it for people who haven't seen it um akira's thank you for 21 months let's play chris we've just been playing for the last nearly three hours so we're just wrapping up here i'm gonna end uh was there anything interesting in the battle pass it just seems like a lot of filler the panda bear shoots and leaves very funny what's that well that's for the new smg isn't it the new uh level 100 skin's a bit mad i think that's the blixon isn't it what do you call it wait is that in twice i know what was that there's a rubber duck hey look level 96 there's a rubber duck quacked up i've got to get that it's a duck smoking a cigarette i didn't expect to see that maybe i was already looking in the wrong spot for that panda i think it's only at once yeah the level 100 skin is mad look at that if you wore that you would stick out like a sore thumb wouldn't you i remember in uh world war ii when the uh the axis used that i saw a documentary about it when i was 16. right anyway guys i'm gonna leave it there thank you so much for watching appreciate you lots uh once again if any of you guys do pick up the battle pass or anything today do consider adding my creator code here jack frags and caps other people have codes as well like westy has one he's code west loads of other content creators do as well and it basically means that add it and then buy the battle pass and then the creators will get a bit of kickback if you want to help support us completely optional you don't have to but there it is right i'm off we might do another stream tomorrow on new caldera just to check it out if not there'll be a video i reckon right guys enjoy the rest of your evening your day wherever you are take care of yourselves i'll see you next time bye [Music] you
