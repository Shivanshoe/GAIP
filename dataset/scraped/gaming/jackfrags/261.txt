welcome to jurassic park no it's writer's republic big thanks to ubisoft for sponsoring this one we're playing the beta for a couple days and i'm going to show you the madness that this game is [Music] i'm a t-rex that offers free hugs why not there's a green man who's dressed as a giraffe and there's also a dragon around here somewhere oh yeah there's the dragon anyway so what we're about to do is a mass race and this is 64 real players over three stages of varying different sports and the first round it's it's a bit it gets a bit crazy now this one starts off with skis everyone is orange people here we go now collision is on so you can often find yourself getting bumped around you can collide into trees [Music] gates and if you go hard enough you will fall and you have to get back up or you have to do the rewinding so there's not a bad start so far i'm feeling it do tricks as well if you want but i prefer to just oh my god focus focus on the the racing and these big mass events are in three stages and in each of these stages you switch sports so there we started with skis and now i'm a t-rex on a bike which is perfectly acceptable somehow i'm in second place that's not gonna last very long you could sprint as well on the bike like that oh that was nice oh no if you go in the snow you slow down a lot yeah no tricks from me we'll go left [Music] following the leader oh the rocks oh my god start from there now we're 15 16 17. not great oh it's difficult riding a bike in an inflatable dinosaur suit oh beautiful there nice little flip it's a big jump yeah if you go on the bits of dirt as well when you're on the skis that's game over i'm playing this in 4k it looks really nice i mean if you're watching the video make sure you're watching it in 4k we called it back tonight um is that fair that doesn't seem fair surely you can stay on some some rocks and dirt right i've never been skiing i've only been snowboarding once twice once i think i've moved once i wasn't very good at it oh check this out it's like a roller coaster for bikes they make those in real life hashem i don't have a gun ferocious we have a winner someone's won already oh that was tight was that on the screen there in the back 12 okay not bad we still got two more sets of races so see how we do all right what we got then we started with a snow race and then rocket wing explo and toys specials i don't know what that is [Applause] i don't like the fact that we're all the same as well and then it changes when you switch [Music] i mean i can barely see guys i don't even know which one i am i think that's me yeah look at this oh i was about to say switch to first person it's much easier when you're skiing but i just went straight into a tree i feel super fast though like this [Laughter] straight into the sign well it's not started as well as last time has it 48 right now beautiful you got to throw in a bit of spice you know get off me oh my god nice oh bump me down there careful over the trees you've got to really try and predict oh i just got nudged into that come on oh what what even happened then this is treacherous okay it's open up a bit here over there oh we're flying it's fine we're now on a rocket back i can boost as well this is sick slow down with that okay i'll pull back a few places here although that's quite tight that one it's good that the boost recharges we are going back uphill right now you can hit the side i like it i didn't know you could hit the side have they been held up there by drones all right at the top beautiful and we've caught a few places back here oh we're going quite close to the ground now reminds me of that movie that i used to watch all the time as a kid i think it was called the rocketeer oh we're on skis a bit more of an olympic track here stay low profile all right final push tear it up and chase down those positions you're speeding oh i don't like this no i'm gonna hit one of these for sure stay to the right right turn here oh there's too many of them and into a jump are we flying again after this yeah awesome oh okay now we're really low to the ground watch out for the tree oh my god went right through the middle there can you hit those flags i presume that you can i don't want to find out i'm sure i'll be forced to at some point because of my terrible flying ability someone's won again well ahead of me go too low to the ground there i have to hit oh there's so many i'm gonna hit one of these oh just the ground rewind i guess i could have just started flying there from the ground maybe i've got 15 seconds to go oh i clipped it this is unforgiving man i don't think i'm gonna finish oh boost it i shouldn't have done yeah i'm not gonna finish it's a dnf unfortunately stage two pop the shoot i was right near the end i was right there don't worry guys final stage i've got this it started with bikes my favorite thing in the game there's the dragon lad we're gonna go first person bit of immersion get out the white dragon this is oh my god that dude went airborne oh that's a bad first corner there from me i'm off the track already terrible 48 i've got a lot of work to do here go as fast as we can [Music] no didn't want to risk it push past a couple spaces there oh that looked awesome didn't it all those bikes in front of me there's a bunny rabbit get out of the way right my mountain dinosaurs came before rabbits right no the rabbit's back not the rocks oh i just clipped them nice terrain information though oh who puts a tire in the middle of the track is that a joke i was doing all right then not the pow pow shooting the bell bear bro is that what no that's what they say pounded the power on the narniar so just kind of stuff like that i'm so stupid not more trees baby i mean this map is massive isn't it look okay i'm feeling it i'm feeling it don't want to crash checkpoints right down there up ahead that's bad come on i don't think even though i'm 33rd i don't think there's much in this wooden skis that's not it's not a good match oh yes right it's my speciality i've instantly missed the checkpoint i went too fast again i'm predicting where the checkpoints are going to be incorrectly oh down the waterfall i am the rocketeer jennifer connolly [Music] right turn on the right don't go too fast push it you go back to the ground what is it is that a rocket bike dinosaur rocket bike oh it goes left and right there's some in the middle as well no no no no no oh my you serious again i was doing okay i just got ruined by the tires in the middle of the track that looks mad in first person come on come on come on smooth sailing all the way no i missed the checkpoint and i'm rolly polling dinosaur that's fine i think the end's right there and we got it well not as not as good as i hope but it was really fun really cool mix so where did we finish then 26. is that just on that last race so where did we finish in telus or what do you reckon guys guess down
