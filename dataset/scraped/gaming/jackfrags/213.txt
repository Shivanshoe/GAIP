guardians of the galaxy so this has released today and it's had pretty good reviews so i'm looking forward to this there's another content creator that i watched called skill up and i really trust his reviews and he said that this is just a good honest game i'm looking forward to it it's going to be a good time obviously if you're familiar with guardians of the galaxy and marvel you might enjoy this it's set in the guardians of the galaxy comic book universe though or it's its own universe it doesn't use the disney marvel characters obviously but it's its own unique story and we're going to be playing through the campaign for maybe three to four hours tonight having a good time we are playing on pc today on the epic game store a big thanks to epic for sponsoring this one the game is linked down in the description below and if you do buy anything on the epic game store consider using my code jackfrags so without further ado let's get into this have a good time enjoy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] rolling stone magazine [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is that your new tape these graphics are nice star-lord who's the guy with the scary eyes he doesn't have a name he's one of the space writers and he's not scary he's cool your spacewriter certainly got his hands full i love that 80s hair pretty far out nobody says far out anymore mom mom nobody says far out anymore oh well your mom maybe we should see if we could get tickets to see them live really [Music] your mom may not look it but i was quite the rocker when i was your age your father and i would just lie on the hood of my old chevy and listen to black sabbath you like black sabbath like i said your mom's cooler than you think oh we'd look up at the stars and he'd tell me all about the places he'd been mom how about some cake huh yeah i'll be up in a sec you said that 15 minutes ago if you don't hurry i'm gonna eat that whole cake myself no you wouldn't yes i would you wouldn't i would hey watch the hair oh peter we've talked about you leaving your toys on the floor it's not a toy it's an action figure more like an action landmine stab your foot i will he doesn't even never mind that's chewy it's chewy it's not yoda look at you where does time go i'll be up in a sec i promise right here playing on pc today maxed out the graphics 1440p oh my god he's got some that's some powerful it's a really powerful 80s right there look at that [Applause] [Music] keep hitting those dingers george he'll make it in the hall he's got some baseball cards rubik's cube tron it's been a very long time since i've seen that movie i think it's got ray tracing too got some sick toys here as well that kind of looks like the the dragon from power rangers but would this be in the 80s i can't be power rangers [Music] holy crap drax you gotta stop doing this man it's weird we are approaching the quarantine zone how long was i out for 15 338 ticks that's very specific the betrayer is ready to begin her mission she has requested your presence in the cockpit gamora's on our side drax she is the spawn of my sworn enemy a murderous and a traitor i do not trust him we're supposed to be a team i make no promises there's the jacket exhales loudly let's go peter quill who puts their own name on their jacket though you know football players got some nice blasters oh loves himself just the junkyard the quarantine zones the biggest pile of galactic war debris in the known universe just think of all the tech ah there you are hey tell group to stop worrying about getting arrested i'm not over confident i'm just the right level of confident hmm i mean you can't be mean to group can you reassure it arrested for what our ship just accidentally slipped into the quarantine zone oops our navigation malfunctioned oops how would we accidentally really detail the core force field details mr cockpit up here peter hey that's my chair oh then why aren't you in it i was uh strategizing it's one thing to get into the zone but we still got to catch that monster right so did i miss anything other than a ton of suspicious glares from drax not really now if you're done like a hat strategizing feel free to grab your seat we're almost ready to go groot is juiced up yeah he is apparently she's six foot two in this game gamora okay here we go rocket groot drax get in here we're going in we're going to find a monster window actually the next one nova core security guard resets every rotation we want to be in and out before our code expires or we'll get stranded if we wait for the next reset we'll get a full rotation to do this nice oh why is the nova net still up i thought we were going in it appears the assassin's contacts are as untrustworthy as the betrayer herself oh please don't tell me gamora's backdoor coats are bust we nearly went broke getting them relax rocket we still got a few ticks before the next time window the network just reset you can enter the sequence peter zero four five one that's it four digits suspicious these security measures are too simplistic for nova core zero it's not that simple the car only works on this date for this ship oh i get it gamora's there it worked i think uh your own streamer mode on means that there's no copyright music playing so i won't get a copyright strike it replaces all the music it's really good that they've done we're in incredible people realize there was so much stuff left after the war restraint wasn't very popular in the shotari army especially with thanos in charge yeah it's probably all harmless now i mean novacore had 12 years to get rid of the heavy-duty explosives right that's why i like you quill you're so pure oh the wonderful and terrible things i could do with all this stay focused we did not come here to scavenge why not the milano's weapon systems could use an overhaul plus there's good money in it the peace that we seek is far more valuable to the monster queen of second official than any illegally acquired salvage whoa that's a bit close place is really shifty i'm not seeing a monster but that big cylinder up ahead looks like the mining ship peter's friend set to look for friend or a knight and you'll see the monster soon as we place rockets monster summoning thingies flark yeah groot quilt suit up team rockets up first i still do not understand why i must remain on board with the assassin oh because you're part of green team assigned me to the team before you named it my skin is not green steel it is tail teal it's not wrong we want to trick the monster into going inside that mining rig we need to place thumpers on both sides two sides two teams [Music] don't worry once the toppers are placed there's a thumbnail and we'll capture the monster together very well seymour is the car no it's just single player no multiplayer no co-op no live service just single player thank you for the two more okay take care of my baby not a child oh can you imagine what a pink coup it's custom nano wrestling designed to keep all this war stuff from floating away i've got a visor basic components we use those for upgrades look how tall gru is i heard novacore once wanted to cover entire planets and nova net nah it's totally safe now could we please focus less on the toxic goo and more on all this cool war junk that's holding together you find something slow nah just some old correspondence you know how i like to brush up on galactic war history um no don't think i've ever seen you read anything without pictures plenty of non-picture stuff i mean this place is insane for any good scrap or components oh rock is adorable i know the monster is the first priority i'm just saying if you see anything good along the way pick it up i'm thinking that big cylinder thing is our rendezvous yeah that's the mining rig so weird seeing it all clustered together like this bits and pieces of a war that span the entire galaxy held together by pink goo abrian based nano resin whatever i'm just saying it's a lot to take in it's awesome come on great let's go oh look yellow and blue looks like an old nova core frigate nice come on dude people probably died on that ship killjoy why'd you even bring us here if the place is so sacred i can name at least a dozen planets with monsters on them so why here you think it's to impress gamora like hey check out the serious intel i got from you know shady sources don't know if you notice rocket but people aren't exactly falling over themselves to hire us some dialog options if this job pans out sure we'll get money but also a rich new client we need to impress lady hellbender with a monster she's interested in not just any old critter which is why we should have gone after him we will that was horrible almost made yourself a very late war casualty not funny doing the things playing at 1440p the three of us hanging out just like when we started this gig before you know who joined us i do not hate everybody i tolerate quilt quote's a swell guy i hope you get that promotion rocket come on rock it drax and gamora are valued additions to the team you're only saying that because she's listening is that i'm doing this careful on that thing quill you spot something out there i don't think so interesting that there was a bit of contextual audio there more nova core yeah well at least the dead ones can't arrest us oh thank you modern warfare it's very connie i love how he can just sprout new legs and jump over things he's gonna get caught whoa pretty sure that weighs a dead end yeah you sure ah there we go pass this way come on how can you even tell just trust me all right hey group you think we can find pieces of the tryon shard in here why would they do that there's gotta be something down here pyramid that corrupts everything it comes in contact there's nothing here you happy quilt you found the thing i told you was there but you didn't listen a dead end the mythical void that's it walk of shame of course he could know i told him but how would you have known rabbit more deep rich law you have a feeling they're gonna get caught night hunter maybe you're done gloating oh i am never done gloating yup classic me whoa whoa i'm okay ah i'm okay didn't scare you did i it scared me ah you were worried upgrade available shut up both of you i will find all these parts hidden away from me i say we head to nowhere do some gambling oh good no worries i can shoot step how does rocket know what groot says i've always wondered i guess he can just speak groots i hate i don't know they're beating parasites clarke's would shoot right through the milano in two cycles oh he's just making it up it's all about the inflection and the delivery right looks like nice and fat dying and undisturbed in here for 12 years nice splatter hey 50 units says i can clear more of these suckers than you he's got a little groot thing in his beard what the rocket did you do that the scoreboard you like it hacked it into your visor cover last time you took a snooze you hacked into my stuff considering how many times i fixed the flarkin thing it might as well be my stuff optimal thump replacing distance should be just up ahead he's made it into a game i'm thinking right in front through the giant game within the game well that's grim uh yeah try not to think about it it's better not to wonder what happened to anyone working on these old wrecks it was a long time ago we all got turned into pink goo obviously oh wow you're amazing i should have been recording break over i want to see if he's alive i don't know but he's twitching clark and scott stain quilt you okay down there yep yeah i just uh thought i saw a shortcut right go ahead without me i'll catch up how tall is rocket i don't know it was flavored it's a cracked out nova core missile bait just three foot maybe we'll meet you there tracking visor got it squeeze through here okay crawling through creepy old ship no big deal easy bear quill pretty sure nothing's gonna jump out at you except maybe me and crew it's quite satisfying though now this brings back memories an old watch it's weird a guardian collectible assessing stuff if all else fails like you said i've got a way forward see never fails yeah the lighting's really good giuseppe it's got ray tracing on what's this [Music] is that a swear word then in the uh marvel guardians of the galaxy i should have seen that it was this weird melee outside not falling for this again melee attack oh my god he just eats it stay back that's great go away eat that's too funny okay over there quill nearly got himself or at least die with it not funny it was just the blobbing it's fine don't worry nothing unusual happened then remember if they're in the wrong place don't worry drax took notes they are rich in detail i've not seen any more of those things to shoot so it's still 1-0 we got a lot riding on your gal pal's mystery monster tip i hope she's legit i think it crashed did we crash i think we crashed that's a shame i'll just reload the game i was enjoying that so far though really good fun i did just install the new drivers as well so i wonder if there's a problem reload the game what's up serger hello craig did i miss lou i don't think i missed any loot there too sorry did i maybe i did [Music] i've seen the chat [Music] will this be coming to console andy crawford i think it is on console as well yeah [Music] hey brandon x in the chat boys [Music] i like that little marble sting see where it's saved hey shot what's up carolina all right where we left off [Music] how much of the war did you zero oh yeah i did miss those that happened great thing about a war nobody was paying much debt could do pretty much whatever we want uh quell we got a lot riding on your gal pal's mystery monster tip i hope she's legit like you could even tell if she had an honest face but trust in the plan trust in the plan guys everything is checked out so far right down to the mining ship our thumpers in the right places and we'll bag that monster quill knows all about putting pompous in the right place oh that's not good are you kidding me quite precarious that was too close you okay groot well we're fine but we can't jump that you don't gotta jump there's a sturdy support beam on this side get groot to grow a brick across just ask him nice light he does it for me all the time grow a bridge for me all right groot let's see that cool vinyl thing it's an impressive bridge hell of a party trick big guy gross more ship eaters ah they're everywhere basic components no dude he's beating me now i can't have that will win rocket of course there ain't any plants here it's a junkyard plants grow where they got food we got to go that way across the gap somehow oh shoot these nova centurions probably had to tow all the scrap to one place do it again great hey greenies you see any blue and gold chips out those cops are all connected through the stupid helmets if they do spot us all they have to do is close that barrier and we're stuck in here with the rest of the graveyard if you see cops you can get [ __ ] out of there that means leaving us behind that trust me i've dealt with nova corps before even helped him catch real criminals i could talk my way out you think that milano can outrun a fully powered over centurion she's done it before okay here we go all right now only says i am groot skyner that's the only thing he no says flark and skagging attacking batteries fried that's what's wrong maybe you put it down too hard let's just find a solution looks like this med kit is tuned to cree biology a shame we don't have any cree on the team maybe we do stop barking around it's busted do i look worried the resin will hold i've got to help him find a battery sometimes atari's a dead battery is there one oh there's some up there is that the one i found something with a charge yeah it kind of looks like a spacey car battery i use that okay thank you val this thing isn't gonna zap me right the chances i'll get donuts minuscule at best you'll be fine does that work rocket that'll do nicely just let me tinker a bit i want to do some tweaking once i see how much juice this thing puts out so uh watch my back i don't know what the components do yet average oh hello [Music] rock it help me scramble some critters no no scott i can get greek to entangle yeah look at that the last floor of colossus root is a vigorous defender able to withstand high amounts of damage he focuses on crowd control his basic ability entangle and enemies in a small area for a short amount of time well that's useful i can then just line him up like this oh no i'm gonna kick them off i feel like that's the most effective way of dealing with them you just need them that's a bigger one oh dear i agree get him good job i like that dash it's kill them cool you overheat really quickly it's like [Music] oh wow just in time i'd like to see you fix it next time come on two down two to go he's still winning unacceptable [Music] i don't see any way out of the missile bay accept that passage but groot's wondering if the reward's going to be worth all the risk we're taking for this job me and groot are nearly unkillable but what if the rest of you don't make it out alive guys this job is a huge deal it's for the freaking monster queen of sec narf 9. she just doesn't know it yet we pull this off tell the dream katie hellbender's intergalactic monster wranglers i do prefer that name but the acronym is well man that thing is ridiculous i think it was a ship or a robot that's a pre-sentry a robot but it would have been space worthy that ain't even the biggest one they designed at least five experimental models twice that size how do you know all this because they were my fellow experiments back on the pathway most of my parts came from the cybernetics hangers so uh i got a sneak peek at all the new killbots i could see the parts come and go from my uh uh my cage wasn't rocket cooked up in a lot of old wounds most of them are just scars now anyways this old cretac gets me wondering where would i be now if those blue butt scots manage to keep me locked into their half-world experiments yeah chances are you'd be climbing over bits of me right now more like a real smart walking gun a very talkative gun he doesn't stop talking that's the thing isn't it they tried to fix it no there's got to be something over there the entire facility was the problem i wish i'd gone back and blown it up before the end of the war yeah i knew it oh yes okay i've made it even what no he's got he just got one out of nowhere that's cheating of course we're going the right way just keep your eyes on that mine and ship that's where we want to end up it's a mining ship doing in the middle of all these fighters anyway they don't call them casualties of war for nothing all right groot do the bridge groot need you to shoot a bridge right into that eye socket oh did you see that one did you rock it can you do that to something in combat wait oh there's loads yes i'm about to win this back well you leave them alone rocket i'd win the game not you the double agent is trying to and i got robot parts inside my parts head your head inside a giant robot head you guys hey group what do you think i should do when i win this bet found a nest maybe i won't have that little rabbit beat me there's no way how's that bed going over there well i know what i'll be doing with my winnings oh dude i'm hammering him 19 to 7 you're so predictable whoa i nearly fell off the map there oh we can't take the giant robot home and believe me that's a painful sentence for me to say don't congratulate him 20. you know what quill i think it's unfair you got two guns i got one how is it unfair to count double from now on no cheating all right bumper goes there quill these points he's just going to double his points that's not fair right sorry quill not taking no chances after the last one i got to test it real quick not again oh here we go i only flipped the switch on and off oh you see what rocket does tell them that close to flank bomb oh damn look at that big grenade rocket is a weapons expert who attacks from a distance he focuses on damaging multiple targets at a time cluster flag bomb deals moderate damage to everything in the impact area got you ma thank you for the time [Music] right um so i should use groot here i am [Music] i'll use another one of those big bombs [Music] oh there's more of them not a chance i've gotten way more no okay groot hi mark use that beer kill big slug again yeah you gotta get kind of close ow the star lords guns to be effective you gotta get really close [Applause] this is kind of like that final fantasy at least they game a good splat that's the spirit i'm loving this could dodge that you're supposed to squish them oh my god that one went miles in there nice bladder rocket i know right what was that worth an ability point oh come on you just gave himself no you can't just give yourself points ability point so this will be peters peter quill vantage point star-lord initiates a prolonged burn of his jet boots rising to a tactically advantageous position to give orders or attack enemies okay i like that so you can fly around and be super quick and damage people did i miss anything here oh man yeah one of those i could be rocket the ruthless because i'm pretty sure i ain't never had no roof all right mining rig is right there of course it's secure as secure as a broke down shitari ever going to be come on groot we need to get across here at risk right that's right it's out zakoya it came out today this game nah it just looks unstable like everything else in you i'll get your twigs in a bundle all these robot faces it doesn't feel stable i have to be honest yes the resin can hold the stupid warship i'm telling you it's totally safe see i'll even prove it huh look at this no you've ruined it having it here could see that coming no rabbit save him group he's fine too early in the game yeah buddy you're okay fine you flock in piece of moldy driftwood you could have died saving me [Music] he's fluffy tail it we're not going after him he says it's fine we'll meet him later there's many flocks so far yeah that gun is massive his radio must be broken what happened to your timber companion uh group just took a different path he must have felt why would you blame him that's horrible that's it why take a different path team rocket over hope that got rid of him i can't throw my squad mates there's nothing to worry about whatever right like you said true's fine yeah nearly died no big deal fine exactly we're all fine sure sure fine you leave those bugs alone rabbit are you good you don't help me make a pretty dynamic duo rocket ah keep your shirt on star pants you ain't no group i may not have his stretchy arms but i've got a killer soundtrack ugh that terrance gut you're always listening to you ain't helping your case he loves the 80s unfortunately youtube dmca does not love the 80s so it's streamer mode if that afterburner kicked on right now we'd be toast let's hope it don't because we have to find a way through this thing this turbine's right in the way got to get through it a small hole here look these things open up to let gas through right yep you saying we're the gas today we are if we can get it open i can hear your visor working better not be cheating on our bat quill there's a drone access tunnel over here get in there rabbit can you squeeze in there rock it fix the thing rock it clean up the mess rock crawl into the mystery hole see anything yeah a manual override can you squeeze in there i love that because i've got two guns doesn't seem fair great another turbine yeah that is how these things are usually though look it's stuck on something someone's been practicing come on let's get out of here you're gonna have to jump up very red lots of atari ship husks out here on the edges we're back on track the mining ship ain't too far i think root's already ahead of us oh no oh there's point don't bugs before dead this position is oh no oh no we fell to our deaths pequel came we're over a lot of movements yeah scott's getting real violent out here uh just trying to hold her still for us that's not going to be an option soon this position is untenable the track says bring it up peter i do not like those quick time events all in one meet you in a piece no rush it's uh nice and cozy in here not so much when you can't see in the dark ah i think i felt the panel there's wiring in there i can't see a thing back on how long is this hey breecher oh come on clark contents are going just neat yeah wiggle v okay so life supports food back up what's it look like out there is that an infinity stone hello [Music] it's the mine stone isn't it the yellow one cool you okay yeah yeah it's just man [Music] bell well that's concerning what was that uh it's a swarm of old cleaner bots no definitely not maybe old cleaner bots you don't know they look like a shower you okay buddy [Music] you're just gonna leave it there [Music] you're just gonna leave an infinity stone [Music] yeah thought you were that freaky thing we accidentally released we saw we saw some cleaner bots accidentally at a distance we're totally all right they just ran away when it saw us right quilt rocket i'm not so sure that swarm thing was inoffensive i feel kind of bad about releasing it quill took a pot shot of this massive warm nest chunk of something fell off and the big floaty creature came out of it that's all um it was quite unusual hey philly frames are really good yeah great performance i've got this maxed out as well with ray tracing i'm playing native 4040p as well i don't have the lss i'm worried about just because it runs really well i didn't think that i needed it 680 i don't see any bugs in here here you go rendezvous coordinates are that way but we'll have to find a way around the rubble i'll try to find a side passage give me a hand group group means big in dutch is that true a table this is a vintage model t engineering workbench they don't make them sturdy like that no more hey come on cool let's see if this beauty still works is this where i can spend the points workbench with rockets help user work and just craft perks you have enough components to craft this part rapid reload [Music] i still got 680 quickly pressing fire weapon twice charges a shot [Music] firing rate doubled when health drops below 25 oh there's loads of them [Music] shield regeneration try this one doing doing done i like his goggles additional move you can use to deal stagger damage oh yeah all right let's squeeze our way out of here rapid reload rapid reloads allow you to cancel your element guns cooldown extra damage so it's like the gears of war thing isn't it hit the green and then it does a bit more damage doesn't look safe [Music] oh that's horrible [Music] what is it it is kind of gross i wouldn't even touch that with my own hands there's no way you really missed out that was amazing team rocket finally [Music] was that supposed to be a reference to dj khaled another one we're trying to catch up guys yeah that's a good description i will find you peter quill describe your surroundings uh old metal old mining equipment just oh what is that i wonder if rocket knows what this is looks like a weird headset or something i'll take that spinal control see um this whole place is old equipment that does not narrow my search no it does not see he sounds a bit like batista i think rocket does as well he sounds like um what's the actor's name that plays him in the movie i remember his name peter make some noise can find you drax hey you want to mute your con hello bradley cooper is it i think it's probably cute some enemies have a stagger bar making them much more resistant to damage i think it completely will momentarily [ __ ] them cool nobody's hiding it looks like they've each got four though doesn't it look one two three four destroy [Music] well enemies completely filled up the stagger bar drax is a durable brawler able to take on many enemies at once he specializes in staggering enemies impervious to regular attacks his base ability destroy deals light damage and heavy stagger religious suffering will soon be ended pokemon can find us too i do not share your hope i like being able to fly around like this that's cool deadly strike that'll be like a ton of damage in one hit or something [Music] that's cool gamora is a skilled assassin who swiftly eliminates targets she delivers quick high damage attacks her basic ability deadly strike deals heavy damage to a single enemy so she's kind of the assassin class i suppose a three-day planet thank you for the five finish the game this mission is nothing compared to the rest of the game this mission is just a tutorial decisions without a timer matter a lot okay yeah i've not seen june yet joseph i really want to go see it though oh it's crashed again that's the second time it's crashed maybe it is the new drivers that i installed right we'll reload sorry about this guys i mean we are live [Music] this will happen i guess with with pc games and console games her entrance was pretty cool corey yeah load it back up hopefully it saved there at that point [Music] haven't they just announced a sequel for june as well they weren't sure if they were gonna do a part two but i think because of the reaction it's had they're gonna make the sequel because i don't know much about it like i haven't seen the original movie and i haven't read the book either but apparently part one is a lot of setup for everything else so it's good that they're actually doing a sequel and that's coming out in 2023 they said today if it's not delayed i suppose is the game pvp no mass it's not it's just single player it's just a good old-fashioned single-player game no micro transactions no live service no co-op or multiplayer found and saved hey go on a headband we'll catch up just making a uh pit stop i parked the milano near the last thumper spot we'll head that way and keep an eye out for you locate an object for gamora to cut yourself if you can get back up there let's see that fancy footwork gamora i bet you can't do this and that was physically impossible drax can lift heavy objects think you can have that contained oh i can tell him where to put it it'll look real good right here i am on my way he's strong very strong remember this moment should you ever think of crossing me assassin i'll remember how slowly you moved what the hell all right rocking we're back on track i knew there'd be secrets up here rocket perhaps he has located our monster we don't even know what it looks like the intel was extremely vague it wasn't vague it was rushed it's probably some cute little nightmarish abomination lady hellbender is a renowned warrior an ideal specimen to reflect that strength like i said something scary i disagree but i'm scary but i'm cute my little commeria and her mother hovak were two of the strongest people who ever lived i think it's cute i bet it's something cute women dig the cute stuff right yes all women in you've never seen a baby otter playing with its hands no i cannot refute this otters are adorable just want to check if there's anything else yeah i knew it oh see you guys notice anything weird about this place you mean besides the comms going dead for no reason there was a reason you collided with that column of scrap you what i was dodging a hailstorm of flaming debris and the comms went out before that get up there yikes ever see the remains of a planet after one of these things mind it remind whole planets everybody needed more resources as fast hey funk yeah it's good fun so far there are now just scattered debris were those systems uninhabited depends on who was doing the drilling [Applause] you got some timing we got company oh the whole crew's there now whoa okay are they down already oh no everyone's dead yeah this isn't good the huddle i think that was supposed to happen when your huddle gauge is full trigger the huddle with off action you perform me bam build up your huddle gauge when filled call the huddle reset the odds [Music] so this is like a second wind it feels like they're everywhere laughing at us and yet we cannot retreat no one wants to retreat big guy but i gotta say it's [ __ ] scary out there quill laugh in the face of danger um yeah danger on all sides then it's time we stand and face it and make sure they're nullified are we heroes to be laughed at no i'll laugh with them instead who's with me i think we did it okay so what does that do huddles have three possible outcomes you motivated the team by answering correctly both you and the guardians get a damage boost had you chosen wrong only you would have gotten it when losers say nothing all guardians are resurrected okay so it looks like you have to listen to what they say to you and then choose the correct answer to inspire them i suppose but we got the correct answer there you know they were down they needed a bit of fire so that means that we've got a damage boost and i think everyone was revived okay right we'll get rocket frozen grenades get gamora get the big guy it'll be a slice we ain't such a bad team after another nice to meet you boom oh my god drags just threw it at the wall [Music] yeah that is an interesting mechanic this is ridiculous i love it come on last bumper spot is this way how do you know my senses are fine-tuned to measure even the tiniest vibrations really no i'm tracking it on my display i think we got another upgrade so can i upgrade these guys as well they've got their own ability level there by the looks of it one two they're all one two five at the moment that's their ultimate ability i would guess cool yeah i need one more point don't lie for that fan the hammer rapid fire blaster shots interesting it should be right on the other side of this door it was open when it came through here i am group who says i tripped on something murder mom probably closed the door behind her excuse me a murder mom oh i can get rocket to do

peter quill i am putting you and your crew under arrest no can i call you back what please tell me that is not a creative super illegal tech it is a crate of super illegal tech which also happens to be very valuable really what we're on a ravager ship even the flark and bulkheads are stolen well we can't fit both in the compartment i will eject the crate into space the crate and i melt your face the milano's weapon systems are four generations behind quilt we need that tech more than we need some stupid farm animal that farm animal could be a class 3 biohazard you want to end up in the kiln

corps licensing permit 67398-2 gardeners of the galaxy what no rocket so i let groot fill out the paperwork i fixed it with an addendum not the most well-known heroes you could hire but definitely in the top five of most awesome names contributing members groot of flora colossus last of his kind fearless in a firefight an awesome best friend that's true rocket bonafide super genius and a wizard with explosives definitely not a raccoon it's a rabbit gamora adopted daughter of thanos deadliest woman in the galaxy need we say more drax the destroyer convicted serial murderer and galactic war

jet boots are in clear violation they're decorative good work that gold great there goes plan b we don't need a plan b i got this no you do not got this pirate i got this now fall in line not to go prisoners what's that circuit that was rude this little child is helping legitimate us folk on legitimate-like business we're not hunting an illegal creature in illegal space everyone just do what

energy no power no power no containment a singles techs are looking how can they fix what they cannot understand what the grand unifier's mind is he's talking nonsense run the scanners again but the flark is a grand unifier grand unifier breaker leader of the church of universal studios he was floating dead in the quarantine zone looking for god pirates let's go he's a bit crazy difference is i

keep moving if you're enjoying the stream guys uh hit the like button thank you it's great as i'll support me i'm enjoying the game so far they're sharing about the crashes though twice now blast doors kick in during emergencies pretty sure i can override them with my crafty they give out override keys to trainees not exactly just give me a sec um yeah turn the handkers off probably up with the door if we undid these cuffs regulation 3b never undo restraints you clearly need my help no you're my prisoner and i got this obviously ah okay we're gonna have to find another way we sure there isn't a way through here i'm in charge here a senior officer you okay yeah i'm fine you oh dandy dandy this way are you kidding fish i me how useful my jet fruits will be right now okay or anything almost there open the door come on nice work thanks you didn't do too bad yourself pirate only star-lord or peter or you know pirate could have bloodsaver okay peter so listen i have some good news and some bad news about your friends bad news first did you hear me uh start with the bad i guess your friends have been processed and put in the brig so what's the good news they're not dead come on we'll be safe does that count as good news is this gonna kill me where do you think you're going just making sure this place is safe i'm just looking for collectibles fire that's all is that a problem right right just taking it all in she's gonna turn out to be your daughter maybe so what are these like maintenance tunnels or something i prefer to think of them as secret passageways yeah could you please try to keep up hey you try walking around in cuffs really nice lighting effects should we try using that thingamajig of yours to call someone we don't need help i know what i'm doing now help me block this fire so we can get through sure just that everyone must be worried captain's kid goes missing captain's kid is still a corpsman easy does it solve the flames why doesn't he look like mario you don't need to worry about me so this isn't based off the disney version of the characters as i said at the start for what it's worth i think you're doing great it's based off the comics i've ever had how many of you had not that many i mean i feel like i want to go through here just to see no i'm just checking for it's crash today just said i was doing great no we're back you are doing great it's whenever it loads it just seems to cool it's 50 50. please just show me the same respectively that's exactly what an overlord outfit i've got different outfits how do i characters and there's a space llama it's a journal outfits i can't select them maybe it's because i'm currently hostage unbelievable yeah i get that a lot yeah i'm using the new driver penguin nandy oh yeah that's just it's i am i know all the bots down here they're kind of my friends these are cool i reprogrammed most of them i'm just stealing everything don't worry maybe no i mean it's cool it gives a personality very cool come on this way you can't just tell me to go places because i know i know the secrets for your information there's an escape hatch back here i could totally use to run away but out of respect for your authority i'm gonna you know ignore it i like the contextual audio there's a lot of that going on i appreciate that diesel down here probably not reminds me of the last of us a bit not like there's any other kids on board you know i didn't have a lot of friends at your age either granted i was in prison but still so mom was right about you it was a shitari prison i was just a kid i have so many questions were your parents in prison too no my mom died i didn't know my dad his dad's ego although i don't know if that's the same as in the exactly uh we fought together comics in the movie she was is a real spitfire more like real controlling and bossy and judgmental you're just a kid nikki you don't know what's good for you nikki stay out of the escape pods nikki i kind of know what you mean you do this is a new low peter even for you peter it's restricted space peter yep that's her yeah this is i think this is by the same studio that made that avengers game as well like i didn't really enjoy that to be honest is it edos montreal of course you are i feel like that avengers game would have been better if it was more like this a bit more linear without all that like online nonsense and gear stuff keep in mind these could be my last few moments of freedom oh just chill reminder that only one of us it's a dead end trust me of course i trust you i can interact with the makeup robot this another one of your bots yeah her name is joe casto uh she keeps an eye out for stuff invaders trespassers prisoners your customers wandering off do you like not believe that i know the way i've got my doubts this is an attempt to escape your mom's ship i really need to know because i may or may not be super interested just really need to make sure it doesn't look like the deus ex guys right oh wow this is cool don't laugh no no this is cool it's like your secret stop copying me peter definitely prefer this to the brig we're not staying i just need to check on ultimo these gyros have been all screwy take your time yeah the avengers game had a lot of mtx stuff that was it just seemed weird is this your mom single-handedly winning the war obviously i know she didn't do it by herself no that final push was uh it was a massive team effort were you there uh i contributed the war effort differently pirating raiding which is you know is this creelar uh yeah long time ago kit stuff i could do it way better now no no it's good morbid but good oh yeah it was crystal dynamics that did the avengers that's right same publisher though right square enix i think hey this is mercury right uh-huh it's supposed to represent this big battle mom was part of you said you were there right oh yeah your mom was dead in the water until you just messed up showed up you should really fix this you want me to draw you in in the interest of historical accuracy something tells me you and rocket would get along or really really not get along one of those two the raccoon thing yeah it's a rabbit real charming i just mean he's also really into all this tech stuff need a hand nope but thanks i'm almost done now we go off limits no adults i get it anyway i'm all done here we should probably get back before mom completely freaks yeah i've seen your mom overreact before it's like i'm not a kid anymore you know tell me about it so you get where i'm coming from right like if you do end up talking to my mom the subject of me happens to come up because the truth is i'm a good word for you say no more i'll make sure carell knows what a good job you did no i mean thanks but ideally mom never needs to know i was in the hangar at all so i never saw you exactly never saw me never saw my passkey you may have heard of nikki gold and how cool she is but that's it almost at the elevator we're home free need a hand yes got it oh no i can explain nikki i'm fine mom seriously a-okay barely a scratch what in hall's name were you thinking sneaking out with an arresting squad running around with criminals alleged criminals you almost died do you have any idea how grounded you are right now mom you promised to give me more leeway leeway doesn't mean lying to my officers or sneaking around behind my back look it's my fault some guy's ship blew up restricted areas are restricted for a reason you treat me like a prisoner you're a child are you even listening whoa whoa we've all been through he looks like a novice just all take a deep breath recognize that maybe we've all made some mistakes make sure the fire is out and the hanger's secure and the blue skin and find out why that churchman's shuttle exploded grand unified raker has been less than cooper make him cooperate and you two with me the lip syncing is really good i knew you'd overreact you always overreact even peter was saying so oh he was was he i suspect peter misspoke something he often tends to do so i suggest you worry less about what he said and more about what i'm saying now for what it's worth nikki totally saved my butt she handled herself really well you have every reason to be proud of her coming from you peter is worth extraordinarily little why are you being mean to him just listen to what he's saying i don't care what he's saying upper level captain's quarter initiate log down what are you going to kill us in theory she looks like a young version of katana from halo yeah i know how lockdown works i don't think you do because somehow you keep bypassing every security measure on this ship and i want to know how or you can just show me just downloaded some hacks mom reactivate elevator i seriously have no idea what you're talking about initiate not lockdown all good for systems go activate voice print not authorized i'm just trying to help we don't need your help you're the last person we need help from oh you clearly need some form of help if you're trapping us in an elevator no one leaves until you tell me what i want to know you already know everything no i don't i know you're a magnet for danger and that you somehow keep getting caught in restricted areas of this ship i'm small okay i fit into places being small doesn't get you past security or through the hangar bay checkpoint or the maintenance tunnel blast doors or even into the sub-level i just found you in there was that system-wide glitch remember yeah yeah security was down for a while no it wasn't seemed pretty down to me are you seriously lying for a 12 year old right now yeah 12. oh wow i thought she was at least 16. peter what she really knew her stuff she's a smart kid too smart she keeps bypassing security unless you have a level of six access to my ship all of a sudden don't think i have that you collect gold empty your pockets no you empty your pockets nikki what i still have feelings for you it was me yeah all those locked doors back there i i hacked them i don't know what the consequences of this are stuff you know oh look at that nikki trusted you enough to give you her passkey so that's quite a different gameplay implication i don't know what to tell you mom your security staff have been sleeping on the job all i know is this is where that deus ex comes in i wouldn't do that to be continued disengage log down so can i go help secure the hanger now no you can go back to your quarters and you can stay there for the next 30 rotations but mom i can make it 30 cycles [Music] i think if you'd have said i still have feelings for you she would have just shrugged you off or slapped you or something [Music] so rough day huh exploding shuttles quarantine zone trespassers missing kid i have no idea julie what it's from the start i have him i can't believe he survived mercury was what like a thousand degrees more like a thousand cycles ago you can keep him if you want he is yours hey i ordered him to look out for you expect him to keep doing his job especially you now have a daughter apparently hmm ignore the math i mean this is quite an important decision i think because the time is not there 12 year old daughter we didn't have during the war 12 years ago when we peter when we picked up your ship part of me was excited at first but then after all this time you haven't changed at all you're still the same i've changed whatever the fine is i'll pay just give me three cycles let me prove that i'm not still whatever it is you're gonna finish that sentence with you're gonna pay 7 000 units in three cycles wow um okay that is a lot of money just play the lottery you'll be fine i was thinking that maybe the fines non-negotiable my search party found 7 000 units prohibited tech lying around your ship well that's all they found right okay okay you'll get your money on time didn't find the space llama this guardians of the galaxy thing we are this close to getting it off the ground and if i didn't have these handcuffs on i would show you just how very close we are no he's overstepped his boundaries there why do i feel like i'll regret this oh come on when have i ever you won't regret it i promise it's not supposed to be chris pratt you've got three cycles peter not four not five three contact me when you've got the units and if we don't the device we installed will deactivate your ship oh and you will all go to prison huh gotcha we won't let you down goodbye my lover you said you could get us out of this i did 7 000 units is a small thousand units that is a tremendous sum where are we gonna get that kind of money in three cycles by robbing a freaking bank apparently okay so we got fined so we have a nova tracking thing on our ship that's gonna shut down our engines if we don't pay that fine in three cycles at least we're not on a prisoner transport not yet come on guys you're drax the destroyer man you killed thanos allegedly are you a little slow you down and gamora you're practically an mi6 agent but way harder and cooler there's nothing you can't do here it comes rocky you're an actual genius and the scrappiest dude i know gamora isn't gonna know what mi6 is seven seven you are groot guys we're supposed to be a team all we need to do is figure out how broke we are and come up with a plan so check your quarters check between the sofas check under the crafting bench if you find any spare units lying around grab them i'll do the same in my quarters all right we're just going to search the ships as well why you don't sleep with cars they put bombs on my ship my ship surely they would know where all the credits were i am watching you rodent what's that supposed to mean it is common knowledge that rodents hoard nuts stolen technology units ah okay first off i ain't a hoarder nor a rodent peter quill tell the rodent that his selfishness endangers us all rocky we could really use any extra units you have how do i gotta spell it out for you mitchell don't got no units fair enough you believe his lies oh i ain't lying now why don't you leave me alone and bother someone else instead i intend to i spend some of those points here what do you want quill if you're looking for units check your own room open this door i know you are in there cindy and tree someone left the fridge over there i do not know what you were up to your rodent co-conspirator has clearly stashed his illicit units in there i am watching you tree you okay in there i think you could open the door for a minute you pushed his teeth toothbrush does he even have to does he even have teeth no i need a new toothbrush that's horrible any units i uncover will go directly to you but i am unsure the others will do the same so you're taking the whole find the units thing pretty seriously is a serious matter yeah yeah i totally get it we're all afraid of going back to prison i am not afraid of going back to prison oh good because i'm not either mostly in the kiln i was surrounded by criminals murderers and thieves they taught me a harsh lesson assassins and bounty hunters cannot be trusted okay wow don't you think maybe you're calling the kettle black i have not mentioned kitchenware it's an earth thing what i mean is you're a convicted mass murderer i used to be a pirate we're not exactly upstanding citizens you and i honor our word i cannot say the same for the others you could be wrong drax you won't know until you give them a chance we will see he's oh is that his family though his quarters is a bit messy hey gamora you're supposed to yoga what are you doing you're supposed to be looking for money i did and i don't have any also what's with the dolls do you value your life is that a trick question okay yes mostly i value my life good then pretend like you're the voodoo isn't it and get out see you in the lounge out got it voodoo dolls hey bluebird you copy i know you think i sold you out and gamora i was just who are you talking to what's a blue bird she got dressed quick um was oh yonder sign is john doing this blue bird and i was the kid [Laughter] let me get this straight yondu udonta leader of the ravager space virus scourge of the serious system and all around scoundrel used bluebird as his call sign even added embroidered on the back of his jacket amazing it was amazing pretty much from the day we met how did you two meet terrans and centaurians aren't exactly neighbors we met on shitari prime about three years into myself that's quite different to the movie then wait yondu was a prisoner of war i i thought the ravagers were neutral they were and they also weren't as in the movie doesn't ego his dad send yondu to earth to collect him whereas in this they met on a different planet yondu and i were cellmates first thing he said yeah this will be opposite votes don't be going and getting attached because i'm just here for the food and the food was pretty terrible so yeah that sounds like yondu i had cellmates before and none of them lasted long the shitari have these gladiatorial games and you got used to people dying not sure about that but i didn't expect anyone to last long i also didn't have my translation implant back then so i might as well have been alone but yondu he actually spoke english said he'd offered to translate in exchange for extra rations so even in the snake infested hellhole ever the schemer it's something we had in common i've been scheming for a way to escape since the day they took me i just needed someone like yondu to make it seem possible how did you escape let's just say it was equal parts simple complicated and kind of embarrassing but it ended with the two of us delivering a transport full of stolen supplies straight into the hands of the resistance for a buck a load of units too i bet anyway once we did there was no going back i was a ravager mind if we put a pin in this a pin pick it up another time i should uh get back sure they don't have pins in space check out your hair style mode i do think he is a bit old for that hairstyle though that's mom it's an old cassette tape cover it's cool to just look around these environments dazzler rocket i bet rocky's got a load of credits oh yeah we found that didn't we why does this thing i don't go into your room and touch your stuff quill what you hacked my visor and added a scoreboard to it while i was sleeping that was different i improved it also did anyone tell you that you snore no i thought drax was bad but wow quilt you should really get that checked you sound like a torque i don't snore that loud yeah okay so what is this thing anyway it kind of looks like a metal face hugger that is clearly a spinal control unit yes right of course a spinal control thingy back on half world cree scientists use these to keep us super soldiers in line uh they're the zap instant obedience holy crap rocket sorry man i'll give you some space i'm just going to keep looking through your orders here that's normal just rummaging around no biggie nothing in there i must have missed something then what did i miss well well well let's see if we can find some stray units in here really it doesn't look like much 50p 37 units we appear to be 6963 units short if we intend to keep our ship peter quill i know i know we clearly need a plan and reconsider my initial proposal oh no not finn thank fume again yes we should go after finn fang fool drax there are easier ways to get who's like what about selling gamora's crap what oh come on you've been hoarding them stupid knickknacks ever since you first joined us i mean don't tell me they ain't worth nothing quarantine zone was always my figurines are not knick-knacks team's in trouble then you can't be bothered to make no sacrifice i think we should hear our group for once great plan love it let's do it 10 out of 10. he says we should combine both ideas sell gamora's trinkets to fin fang fume it is brilliant yeah you know the only problem with your plan is that lady hellbender only buys monsters and you are not hellbender he's not he's the sweetest most no you don't this ain't something you can pretend oh yeah whoa you want monster i'll show you monster whoa guys that went from zero to 100 real quick groot are you really offering to no no he is not offering that okay it could work sell groot i guess we could bust him out after absurd lady hellbender seeks the monster within the small ugly one is clearly he's cruel sadistic and his soul is filthy [Music] do i have to choose a great sum for such a creature really how great how are you okay with this because i know what i am and i know what he ain't i am root i vote we sell groot i honestly think lady hellbender will go for it yeah well i vote for not i also vote for the creepy little beast two votes each peter i mean i feel like groot yeah groot's a more convincing monster well i think groucho is convincing in the traditional monster sense he's big and scary group buddy if you don't know first of all thank you and second of all i want you to know we're gonna bust you out of there right after okay all right let's do this let's go sell a monster so i think this will get us half the units we're not seriously flying into that they say the weather patterns of secnarf9 are tied to the temperament of its ruler that's not how women work or whether anyways i'm sure it looks worse than it is that looks dangerous fortress interesting close quill i don't want to walk in this he's not flying at all guys relax just one liner adjustment piece of cake you can't be serious what this way we can scope things out before we finish the transaction we're like a hundred clicks from her base you know how much i like scoping nope if i can spend those points then i'm flying are you sure the leafy world is ready for this nope he'll be fine [Music] 840. don't help because you're a constant complaining desk you you are complaining about the short one complaining we're all complaining happy emotional points that seems like a pretty and voila no brainer right there so about my rays let's see i think yeah i can change outfit now oh wow that's the one i picked up in the level with before isn't it that one's fancy team lord no i don't like that one you need bigger arms than that if you're gonna wear something like that that's cool social lord i go the sun lord goodbye space llama i'll miss you okay here we go i haven't mentioned how much i hate rain hellbender's cast i like the red bar and it's not a castle it is an impregnable fortress so how do we impregnate it peter let's just get closer we'll figure it out on the way he's just really good at impregnating things figure apparently as beast merchants we will easily gain access to lady hellbender good we've already got a beast all that's left is the merchant card what's up arty thank you for coming to the stream hey is my jacket all right at least you got a jacket some of us are soaking here less whining more walking hey storm lord we ain't seriously walking through this what about the groot suit wait hang on oh my god they've got outfits as well guardians of the galaxy 2014 so is that in the movie suit then impaler that's cool you know i didn't realize that i could change the looks of the other characters as well black vortex okay what did that say first appeared in guardians of the galaxy in x-men wait gamora was in x-men in the comics that's sick surely there's some mad costume for her rocket the stinger what the hell first appeared in rocket number one 2017. rocket had his old own comic then all right we're doing it can you place the other characters no tiego you can't oh don't like that no no no no that's not it looks like green goblin or something that's so stupid he has sunglasses as well the bottom way looks drier we got this just don't fall and we'll be fine looks badass now what's your problem duplicity and dishonor your reputation is why she tests us can we refocus here we're here to trick some lady not kill each other the floor's all gooey come on suit rocket let's go [Music] good advice okay this might be more dangerous than i thought you lived yeah [Music] okay [Music] a root like he sticks his hands on the ground you sure you never dated this woman oh it's moving [Music] tasty noodle floor yeah just kind of look like noodles you know this game is giving me jedi fallen order vibes now that's not a bad thing i love that game the old resistance doubt by this one and her chitauri friends uh so skin thank you for becoming a member ah guys it's a cube a cube not sure jelly [Music] but it ain't moving now strawberry jelly i mean i'll eat it uh you know when i survived freaking half world i think i'm scared of some he's not little get ready oh god yes this is the local fauna it's about to be an endangered species [Music] those are horrible you can do that really quick as well if you just cut the hotkey love that really useful ability um rocket see i think that does like aoe damage as well because they're close together what's that brax praxis oh he can throw it nice someone get me a look at [Music] one got it cool you can combo those abilities as well we are outside lady hellbender's sanctuary creatures here are not her pets we sort of do look like food it's interesting combat if we don't climb out of here i think he might be better on a controller just because you could quickly press the buttons so i'm playing this on mouse and keyboard oh my god why are his eyes red what the easier to climb than hell muddy terrain i ain't comfortable calling it a husk seeing as we're about to climb it at all clearly not a house it is the hollowed husk of a bygone time when the turmoil of war rage stronger than the storms of this world get ready this scoop having fun i didn't think i'd ever be shooting at a resistance ship drax gonna pull down pull this reactor out gently right if it were combustible the rodents would have shut by now he makes an excellent point until he continue i don't think there was any collectibles there was there what does your magical mask reveal give me a second there's something here it's out of range though i ain't seen one of these fly swatters in years working or otherwise it is not that's what they call them on the counter they were real good at knocking shitari's scouts out of the sky huh i get it great we made it happen come on kids now what maybe if we could lower that wing somehow [Applause] rocket can probably do something with that that wind control panel is all yours what's my team in premier league everyone i don't really support a team in premier league ali i do watch so i watch highlights we'll be lucky if there's only one booby trap on what if it can get a new ability no i need another point don't i rock it what the you see that you just went neat they say that lady hellbender's call echoes throughout the planet i'm gonna see what this thing was over here just some components careful looks like something big moved through here yay what's drax doing over here if you see anything with claws beside the tracks let me know what's she tracking this thing for sports nothing wrong with a little sport a girl has to keep busy here weird noises you sure you want to get lost out here relax i'm just looking around you need your kitten rocket after rocket raccoon that's a good name i bet there's a lot of those though we never go anywhere good point and she couldn't get us through here whatever it takes to find help maybe everyone could have done something then yeah if we want an audience we will have to start showing some respect this from the guy who calls me harlot spawn of thanos an accurate description we all know which charlotte spawned first the more is actually adopted so not even that accurate uh yeah also not a harlot right right that too we'll need to find a way out of this jungle why it's dry down here wouldn't you rather be wet than lost not particularly i think i would rather be wet than lost because you can get dry if you're lost it's more difficult to get found all those trees look like like giant strings of saltwater taffy dead end that's just right wait is that shitari tech over there ask that you're no no it is it's a retractable bridge they used them at the prison i was in too bad the controls are on the other side of the giant chasm what do you do not have time to dawl in this jungle i shall hurl the creature over the chasm so you may activate them i may activate a hole through your face uh yeah okay why not it'll be fine just curl up in a ball what drax throw no very well peter it's okay i guess that only applies to cats he's really pissed at least he's not shooting at us oh he is now he missed on purpose right order the beast to do its job [ __ ] it come on man cram it the bridge and we'll raise your cup by 5 i want 10. okay deal we'll take it out of groot's cut he doesn't understand money anyway yeah groot doesn't need money it's fine i feel bad now i'm gonna have to apologize to him okay i just want to see if there's something behind here just a little rain rocket what's shitari tech doing on a backwater mud ball like this perhaps lady hellbender repelled an invading swarm and it was among the spoils maybe a she was real mogus with the bug ridiculous thanks for the bridge rocket if you even think of pulling that again myself people oh let's see those branches [Music] genius [Music] he was not happy with me [Music] there we go no you don't let them he's on top of groot that's so cool what was that cue that came up then that was interesting enough of these inferior creatures not sure what that was marvelous encounter okay so that's two ability points now so i can buy fan the hammer star-lord unleashes rapid fire blaster shots dealing heavy damage but across one or more enemies that looks good i think they'll just level up by themselves the other guys as the game goes on it will just give them points maybe just look around why are we so sure this is the way the statues here didn't walk into place they were carried carried by whom for what purpose it was a secret time over the bridge what's up i didn't see it there was nothing in the pamphlet about statues obviously maybe they weren't carried maybe some muscle head threw them over the ravine [ __ ] go back i will all right gamora pretty sure it's this way look i slid down here no way are we almost there okay lady hellbender could cross this jungle in seven strides sure she could or she would have flown over the mountains oh she flies now she possesses flying creatures jack some of your lady hellbender tidbits are questionable you can say that again more or less questionable than your flying skills i don't think i can go back there guys i think it's chalked i think i missed it that bridge isn't the only thing chatari some of these statues look familiar if you catch my drift if these mouth breathers worship monsters maybe they'll miss the space fair and bugs as gods you belittle the suggests know nothing of their ways i know folks that car bibles worship them and i know anyone with half a brain don't worship nothing do i live in a cave no i don't live in a cave that would be interesting though imagine having a cave and an internet connection and a pc you would need power in there as well that'd be quite peculiar wouldn't it quick time eventually in combat do team finishes oh that's what it is theresa okay thank you i've not done that yet not watching us gamora mind cutting us you say that lady hellbender feels it every time you cut a piece of her jungle that cape is mad an old nova bomber i haven't seen one of these since the war i remember it used to take a dozen ships to bring one down dozen ships or one chitari infiltrator i'll take that one as a compliment still no sign of the fortress nope are we even sure this is the right way yes first i'll go first dangerous because i need to cover everyone right see it's fine perfectly safe fine not even think of pushing the assassin there are so many better ways to kill someone [Music] [Music] that looks like a creature rather than a plant i have to say yeah i knew it says there's something down there it doesn't matter of course it matters it's unstable either way and she told me to jump guys sorry [Music] nice catch you're welcome i like that outfit it's good oh no not more jelly you're not alone here it's fine can't we just talk to the jellies i got it oh no the demigorgon wants the jelly and it can freeze it as well monster [Music] health markers some enemies have multiple health bars when you deplete one health bar its marker vanishes revealing the next okay wow okay that did a lot of damage oh interesting if your momentum gauge is active a call to action prompt may appear during combat it's crashed again that's the third time it's crashed no worries we'll load it back up that was a nice little take down there though interesting mechanic that dark souls overrated yeah it's a bit of a mini busted isn't it orchestra intensifies is that what the subtitle said hey tom into souls games um i like them yahoo like i don't think i would really i might play elden ring well that's not really a souls game is it but it's a souls-like game but open world so they say i did play the original demon souls when that came out on the playstation 3 and i beat that i've not beat any of the other souls games since or bloodborne but i really want to play bloodborne because apparently that's just brilliant [Music] [Music] i think it'll put me back at the start of that boss fight [Music] yeah that's not a good start i shall break their bones [Music] can i help him out of this i don't want to use any of my abilities until the next stage [Music] [Music] please don't crash please don't crash get the tail off are you good [Music] it's gone cowardly beast finish the battle i kind of feel bad for it oh stumpy's running away he does look cute now though yeah i say we go after it we'll finish the job anyone ever tell you you're scary i wonder if i could have helped grew then obviously what's he looking at up there which is exactly what we need plus it'll give us eyes on some trees that is settled let's scale this down contraption yeah okay how do we do that good question [Music] long time since the war that's an upgrade thing all kind of wet feels like yesterday and all the worst ways rocket's gone there straight away looks like there's one of those vintage workbench things back here okay rock it let's see if this thing still works yeah all right this better not get jumped by any monster i don't think i can even afford anything because i've only got 340 yeah cheapest things 400 at the moment there was a prompt to help group okay i missed it i'm waiting for you so we can scale this contraption ah right maybe this hell lady is some old war hero and she can get nova off our backs gamora how high up this thing can you climb let's find out are you relishing this moment assassin what moment visiting the grave of your enemies no the core weren't my enemies drax they were my father oh that's neat i like that the teamwork [Music] i got eyes on this gunked up reactor there's another one there bring it down reactor thing there is pretty loose all right pretty sure that babies are taken upward somehow it is neither a baby nor a ticket there's a reactor you use tracks now drax moving that thing around ain't a problem right it is not just like the mighty lady hellbender i am exceptionally muscular we got it drax [Music] this race by the time we get there hellbender will have moved on from monster play this unit is tremendous it looks so stupid what next peter quill [Music] uh how about a boost gamora what would you do without me boost me i should go [Music] so what do you think made this place worth fighting over maybe it wasn't maybe the ships we've seen just got taken down by the storms you think this place was like a secret face could be middle of nowhere inhospitable surface storms provide cover from detection maybe refugees fled here i think i'd rather have been in the war the group can't do anything is there any way you could bring down that wing can you get up there now this brings back memories i thought it was something to do with gamora you just wouldn't do it that was easy great teamwork everyone that's a great good job all right slippery wind pummeled treetops here we come you know i uh really admire our team's commitment to safety we are not committed to safety one thing is clear i wonder if there's multiple ways of doing that though i am giving credit where credit is due it took you long enough we all know gamora is super cool and super valuable there it is lady helping this fortress it's gotten bigger that for sure it is not getting bigger we are getting closer thanks drax looks like hold on let me just get this collectible guys i mean one second just getting the things just relax guys there's this totally sweet pile of crap on the ground so interesting let's all stick our fingers in it i can hear you downwind was it more jelly oh no i'm stuck slimy guys it looks tasty to be honest i want to eat that come down here no you shouldn't have done that oh why the floccus is so deep in a jam boys no you think some smack race the sword will not work woman find us a rope yeah it fast where am i supposed to find a rope it's quick jelly he's adorable [Music] what the hell [Music] oh it wasn't really clear what i had to do there sorry i think i had to move the mouse and the keyboard in rocket's dead sorry guys a chicken thank you for the seven to help for tomorrow's donuts slimy uh guys i wonder if that was like this the stone or something there that he was using to come down here oh why the floccus is so deep i don't think the rocket boots would work in this aaron rich the sword will not work woman find us a rope yeah hit fast where am i supposed to find a rope i don't know i'm sticking in jelly here well do something like what do the thing pizza [Music] surprise quick time event [Music] oh what that's upgraded so what did he do then [Music] oh he's like a little baby adorable [Music] might tell us what happened i don't know my glasses they i've only done that once before when i was a kid i don't do it on purpose classic sparta his eyes have gone red again just when you think you've seen it all it pulls cut like this just leave the guns alone i just want to see how they tick otherwise it might as well be magic or sorcery guys here we go again can i use that ability now element shots you can now equip blaster element shots press one to equip the eye shot so that the cube is weak to [Music] ice [Music] i mean that's made it significantly easier [Music] my hands are filled with jelly yep why do you think is all right that's the takedown guys thing up [Music] i want to see if i get it right again we're killing it out there quill you see the look on their faces when they see me razoring down from on high haha or the ones they make when they realize groot's got entirely no never thought i'd say this but fighting with you guys is fun yes i get that it's all bubbling sparkly out there we're blasting shots of them and it's so much fun but if we lose our focus if we can't let go of these crazy thoughts spinning us upside down we're done who's with me wise words peter ready we got it that's rocket i don't wanna rock it [Music] quite satisfying combat but we're gonna need to get up there i'm thinking we can climb up and over ding ding ding give that man a gold star once you start to learn it and get the combos down hey stud streaming mode on yeah i don't know why they decided to that you needed that on basically if you guys see this at the top here streaming mode on all that means is the game's crashed that's the fourth time it's crashed start i'm gonna blame you for that no not really so it's yeah streaming mode on just means that you don't have copyright music in the game and it's been replaced so if you stream on twitch or youtube you're not going to get a copyright strike or a dmca or a content id or anything like that i was just going to show you guys in the options what that is [Music] i did um watch a video earlier and it's got all sorts of 80s tracks in it it's it had like um never going to give you up in it it had some classic 80s pop songs classic 80s rock [Music] that's the fourth time alex hey it's fine you know it is live we deal with the problems yeah the the music i suppose that is one of the best features of the game because star-lord and his character and obviously in the movie he's got his mixtapes and that's part of his character so when you when you go into all these instances where you're fighting people and different things happen you'll be hearing that epic 80s music but because i'm streaming you know i can't have it on let's figure out how to make it climbable stars are made of hydrogen not gold near planetoid barely any power maybe we can muscle those cannons out it would give us some steps to climb worth a shot can we just get one rex think he can drag this cannon out i will try it is more stubborn than expected he's got it impossible it will not stay in place yeah i've got to freeze it just hold drax when you try again why it does not stay i'm working it out trust me all right i cannot hold it forever impressive now we got to get the next one out drax do that one as well drax can you drag out that higher cannon impossible it is too far from the ground um can i get groot uh group any way you can bring that one down with vines or something he says his vines ain't strong enough to move them things gamora can you reach that cannon she can jump up to it i can but i won't be able to get it out if that's what you want rocket any ideas on getting that top one out not from this angle no how would we get that now come on let me get a look at them guns no you're not tinkering with my only means of defense fine i'll swipe him next time i can rocket i need you to squeeze inside that little hole and try to knock the gun loose from the inside hello shitari ship full of booby traps and death mechanisms but you love you're right i do and i always wanted to see the inside of one bye dead right in there oh you okay in the rocket i found the crew i guess not even the worms want to eat that shitari meat rocket relax just gonna re-roust a little bit of remaining power to the cannon and nothing you know what block it i'm blowing it up that will work hang on that's fine he must have jump started the thing rocky you okay yeah and dry now too gamora can you clear us a path through that junk oh man another murder tentacle careful it might be playing dead lady hellbender gives impossible tasks it's fine you can just clear the ship so no biggie i have the hurricane that's next well at least the left back to its brood mother lady hellbender oh yeah i doubt it drax rid of this in many ways this planet reminds me of my own world that bad huh can i squeeze through here for the week punishing weather and lethal predators force every catapia to fight for survival that's why you respect lady hellbender so much she survived a place like this i'm glad we know where we're going hey you think they look like a bunch of tiny rockets trying to get out of the rain anyone you're a cool dude hey uh since we got a sec i know you volunteered for this but i want you to understand that i don't really think you're a monster i mean you're super tall and intimidating and i think that's why this is going to work yeah agreed i think you look freaking awesome i guess the rest of us must look pretty weird to you huh that better not have been a comment about my hair i think it was mate could you move a bit to the right one your big butt's a nice windshield where did you guys go the employee oh why is the bridge always on the wrong side i could touch me again and i paint beast cliff's grain okay okay he's got his gun out no throwing and no shooting there's got to be another way across we'll just look around i do want to see what's through here though because i didn't go in let me guess he would have laid over the ravine and let us walk across on her back yellow this channel doing some exploring we've done enough of that already i'm pretty sure exploring can i get across there it means he went the wrong way but it's too stubborn no i'm just i'm going to see if there are things these are vital components for our success in the campaign guys right i need these firings he must be the first time everything okay peter yeah just you know bring water into ice no biggie i think i could see my house from here that's a lie scout type stuff scouting looks like we uh need to keep going towards the fortress and not away from it excellent word peter look i got all the things okay all right onward come on good morning i used to believe that was the most impressive firearm in our group they could have given root some more dialogue very funny they are versatile maybe but my sweet death cannon still got 17 000 different murder configurations such as yeah just to name a few you got kill kill big kill fast kill wide kill long crowd kill oh oh kill messi uh kill clean too but you know i haven't tried that one how are we gonna get across guys i've got something here it's deep this looks promising there is little room to maneuver if something should attack you're not going to be here long yeah i have upgrades available but you need a bench we'll make one so you have to as far as i know i don't think you can i know you can can you get them from here you can as well no i don't think i can buy them here maybe yeah you have to find a workbench i don't think there's one around here yes it smells putrid where is it coming from yep definitely something gross behind here thanks can you throw something at that please drax can you chuck that through the stink wall i fear i will regret this holy crap that is disturbing this looks disgusting i am clinching every orifice i don't like the look of that okay that got my blood pumping why would lady hellbender cage this creature because it's annoying perhaps it is food that thing's food yes monster food i wonder what it tastes like chicken why would it taste like that i can use this you know we really gotta not convincing is it gonna put gru in there because that worked so well for you last time we need a better plan of attack yes ideally one that guarantees mine oh no oh no this one's got a tail that's the one from before i don't like that i missed it [Music] hold on cool down you can't move when you're doing this [Music] whoa cracks was inside the container there scary okay you have to hold it oh yes we did [Music] [Music] oh it shrinks down and quivers not sure that was right first rain spinelli the slimy stinky crawl spaces and now all these monsters i hate the sparking planet you hate everything rocket true but especially the stinky slime tunnel part itchy fur is where i draw the line hey we're a team if we're gonna smell like butt we're gonna smell like butt together that is most eloquent peter quill i will smell like butt with you yeah thank you drugs really great speech so many things that i need to read says we should check things out over here oh you can definitely do something without growing give me a bridge here joseph thank you for membership 17 months good job i great freeze this this way but i don't see any sprays deep freeze can i try ice cubing something no [ __ ] it you leave my guns alone better not forget what we talked about earlier yeah rocket remembers that we needed them across he wants a higher cut now i think he deserves it as well five horsemen of the apocalypse outfit for group what the hell oh my god doesn't even look like groot anymore gamora's original outfit is pretty cool i mean i can't change rocket though like he looks so good in that suit thank you for the membership four months ready for 2042 of course says all this moisture is good for us and will make us grow your case that is doubtful i can't wait for 20. to stay hydrated come on tim i wonder what engine this it's lady is is it unreal engine or something else i don't know that is definitely my top 10 fortresses [Music] it's a big fish you said that quarantined zone monster was supposed to be rare [Music] so we wasted our time almost got killed for nothing and got arrested that was fun it was run tomorrow now we've got a ticking time bomb on the ship and we owe money to the cops guys every misstep was just a step in the right direction towards completing our best plan yet say that again what if we brought one of those ugly suckers all the way here only to find out lydia let's just get this done what if she's got another group nah no way you can't be serious okay it's further than it looked much farther it's a flocking infinity bridge is what it is what are you being dramatic rodents bridge ends at the fortress therefore it is not movement yeah that's super comforting guess we gotta go recycles we need to get groot in the cage aren't you forgetting something oh right the cage i the tree creature is not very monstrous i mean he is drax we're doing this just like we planned on the milano you're hey lovebirds let's go bridge ain't gonna cross itself i hope lady hellbender is as gullible as you expect she is you hang tight there bud when the time comes i'll get you out of there rocket style track good morning can you help me with this what why to guarantee your safety as a leader ah come on don't look at me i ain't pulling that thing okay please remember buddy menacing like me only bigger not bad not bad could be the leader in this scenario he's the big boss calling the shots don't know what you heard but we just want to bring you back a new friend i know it can't understand me but maybe it responds good to soothing tones how high up in the air are we does anybody have like a campfire song or something we could sing to kill the time oh oh i know one it's called stop right yeah okay wait is please stop the name of yourself no okay so how long before someone else wants to pull this thing we are 60 clicks from the fortress i'd say closer to 75. there is only one way to know for sure 0.1 clicks 0.2 clicks 0.9 2.1 0.3 clicks 4.5 0.4 clicks this is so stupid [Music] always like foreign [Music] you don't hurry i'm gonna eat that whole cake myself 13 whole years look at you where does time go i'll be up in a sec i promise right i'm back here again [Music] [Applause] we go through this time [Music] [Applause] tom says grandpa used to play this a lot when she was a kid but it's been busted ever since i can remember [Music] we'll bring him down [Music] he says you can get a brain parasite if you share a toothbrush that's not true imagine that something growing inside of you slowly taking over [Music] oh that was fast give me a sec i didn't think you'd actually come up maybe being on time is my new thing oh right we'll see about that when i have to go oh pacman cake look at that i think i'm too old for that too nice try smart alec sit thank you leopard don't worry

looks terrible man those are real photos on there or real faces at least i miss him so much grandma used to take me into town on sundays to run errands we'd stop for ice cream on the way home even in winter those ones were cgi i think some of these photos are real oh that looks like me when i was a kid what the hell did they steal a photo of me little guy put up a big fight wouldn't have been able to land him without grandpa's tricks i don't know much about art but i know that this is excellent grandma really had talent grandma painted that what here we go [Music] oh we're not gonna find out what it was [Music] at its entrance as i was saying you don't trust me rocket with brute flark i ain't putting his park solely in your hands your call peter you're just jealous my plan's better you're green with envy better than black and blue try it lady i got 12 000 volts with your name on it i'm sure you make a great point gamora but i gotta go with rocket for reasons ha eat scot wolberry and i mean i know what i'm agreeing to but just for everyone else can you explain that again i have no idea what i just chose we sneak back in and use my tracking device to find him and bust him out guardians of the galaxy never heard of you well you do live on a mud ball in the middle of nowhere what's that what he means is you will have we're huge in the cree system what's in the box a rare creature last of his kind and all-around swell guy looks like a bush it is a tree a talking tree that's new all right get going before i change my mind and if the lady don't like it i'll be cutting out what's left of you in that box thanks officer have a nice day officer he's got a good voice not exactly an easy way out if this all goes to hell it's gonna go great we got a killer monster and a solid plan the tree is no killer we should be selling the angry rodent lady hellbender will be displeased what i'm supposed to be scared just because she's got an elder name she runs a glorified zoo that's nosy what the hell it's a flarkin army any chance of the zookeepers with guns i have never seen ortho's team i have seen my trampoline pulp it's fine worse comes to worse we hightail it for the milano unless she's got a fleet of shia drop ships yeah like she's got a bunch of shifts to take her old monster mash on tour i stand correct oh cool oh those are some big gloves why did we not simply dock here avoid the planets in hospital the surface great question next time i'm flying indeed we needed time to iron out the plan now it's foolproof lady hellbender is no fool when her monster goes missing she'll assume it was us assume yes but not no not chases across the galaxy level at least are you flarkin kidding me look at this place huge it'll take forever to find root after we sell them peter quill expects you to use your insect device bug what's the matter rocket relax rocket we've got your tracker thing right don't exactly draw us a map quilt it's more like a hot warm sort of thing you mean hot cold right what the caleron skunk that is truly a priceless trophy before a woman with expensive tastes that's good news for our deal come on we're team we stick together do you think we made the right call here guys picking group that's surprisingly insightful did you just pick that up yep just now totally off the top of my head [Music] no erratic movements look like tennos from warframe here shoes i [Music] or suffer the consequence of every other would-be con artist i assure you i say this release [Music] we got this it's gonna get massive isn't it [Music] ugh [Music] [Applause] whoa [Music] [Music] you are free here [Music] [Music] bring in the next seller and transfer 10 000 units to that last one's next speak hey there i'm star-lord oh okay the destroyer the undoing of the mad titan in the flesh and such flesh [Music] your presence honors me you are much smaller than i expected oh and what were you expecting perhaps i can do something about it but an unlikely we'll see destroyer i can be quite forceful peter quill just play along man flatter her something you got this he's going to mess it up your negotiation skills are terrible lady hellbender i can see by the size of your weapon you must be a skillful warrior perhaps i can give you a demonstration sometime you would make an acceptable opponent tell me destroyer what brings you to segnorf9 peter quill show her the creature cracks is being smooth now i thought your kind had been wiped out i think we did it name your terms destroyer yeah 20 000 units 20 000 the creature is not monstrous like the creepy little beast but it is a capable warrior and it possesses regenerative qualities also is the last of its species 20 000 units is sufficient compensation no no what do you mean no i mean no well then you're an idiot lady group he's the best monster you could buy rocket drax has this name your terms then fifteen thousand and you stay uh-oh well you want to buy drax not buy invest i could use a warrior like you at my side i have other commitments shame we could have had such fun together 12 000 for the flora colossus then 12 000 is not not that bad for a flora whatever deal 12 000 units it is and we only needed seven right so looks like a boss from gears of war or something the storms of segknoff grow ravenous you will stay among my hellraisers and revel as one of us yeah this is great we'd be thank you [Music] a successful negotiation i would say i don't want to fight those things you were flirting with a beast handler who confirmed that groot is definitely probably being kept in the new additions pen which is where exactly well we didn't quite get that far good thing we're doing my plan tracker's pointing back the lady skull student's throne room so uh that's where i'm going tiny little problem [Music] boy when these guys go they go hard they're heavily inebriated doesn't mean they're not a threat my best blade work happens after i've had a few if a few scut knuckles got to die to save so be it whoa hey we are not here to start a war with the woman who's got her own private army now just rob her if we do things right and be quiet we'll be in and out with no one the wiser what part quiet don't you understand no killing dead is quiet peter quill no killing yeah that's right don't touch anything don't step on anything and don't break anything i could ride this don't do anything stupid if we mess this up it's game over for group and us oh stealth section we just sneaked dude gotta hand it to the lady she knows how to throw a party it was like this with the ravagers too yondu was a real work hard play hard sort watch out for the bottles we compare and scutty father figures because mine gave me a shock collar for my birthday rocket what are you doing i will show you guys a real party i will construct festive head where worthy of this sneaky raccoon [Music] gotta say this is not what i had in mind when you fix this whole hero for hire thing maybe hellbender will give you a job i'm not the one she was interested in she's right we should have just sold tracks not pimp's rocket and the plan is going just fine as is still you've got a stronger along a little gotten us closer to brewer or something i'm not use my sexual magnetism drax is clearly the best written character creepy creepy that's it dead head past another bunch of lightweights you're sure that tracker of yours is reliable trust me this baby's paid for itself oh you actually paid this dude i remember that time on sarah so if i messed this up are we just gonna have to fight muscles quill got caught stealing eggs from this place on cigar why am i not surprised my do dad let me straight to him hiding in a spike hatchery i was not hiding yes you were in minutes use the doodad did you rock it it is not magic just saying have a little faith mulberry my tech built them thumpers it's gonna pop this door and it'll find groot up it rocket am i good or am i very good okay tracker says boss fight is what the dragon says we saw him take groot down the elevator right so we just gotta find the controls lady lottie does probably got him on her fancy chair up there what is that down here hellbender used some sort of rising stairs there's gotta be a way of activating them from ground level vehicle access can't you just do that flippy thing and get up there gamora even i've got my limits what is your maximum altitude if we can't find a switch maybe we can get access to the circuitry itself drax think you could lift this thing easily what do you want me to do with it still working on that uh the signorfian night air is refreshing smells like eggs burnt hair indeed i'll buy nearby circuit can i send gamora up there perhaps lady hellbender operates the elevator with her mind what we watched her bewitch at tara tara perhaps this is among her powers maybe there's a control panel inside there you can hack it's possible of course she can't just have a normal freaking ground level chair it is intended to inspire fear in her adversaries all right drax try to clear that rub see what's hiding back there okay you could have made more noise with that rocket in there she did not ask get in there rabbit i want to go in there all right i'm sending the schematic to your advice just follow the wiring and tell me which junctions to switch where is it coming from what's it like in there rocket cramped and dusty uh here done cool it changed i can see it doesn't take much to impress you switch this done this one oh here uh what are they doing trying to run this much current through one capacitor is there a problem just amateurs this whole board is gonna need to be replaced right now well whoops must be setting our soothing sounds volume two believe those are monster mating calls okay that's a little freaky ah this thing is a mess there's wires everywhere have you seen the milano hey those are much more organized than they could be it ain't my fault i ran out of them zip ties they've all stayed the same where's that going up there okay here going all the way around there that doesn't go to anything and here rocky did that work it's half powered but i don't got enough juice to flip the circuit yet there's got to be a second node okay there keep it like that i can get up to the throne now better hope that panel actually works it's a bit like watchdogs though isn't it there was a puzzle in watch dogs too that that reminds me of [Music] was it watchdogs legion actually i think it was watchdogs legion we just jump up there now [Music] see nailed it that is the wrong element what he's right groot went down on the other side well it's the only one we got sweetheart call me sweetheart again don't call gomorrah sweetheart same place your voice does not convey certainty i'm mostly sure this is it we're almost there i gotta say this is going pretty smooth kind of nice for a change police you get bored if it was all smooth sailing remember the cargo run for the haunchy i remember you nearly jumping us into a black hole where's my point the exciting bits are what stick with you what the piece of skutt right on cue it's not that something's wrong heads up more guards i will give a wide berth peter quill come on you hunker chunk everyone asleep they're gonna wake up soon though surely anyone else got a bad feeling all of a sudden rocket keep it down stuff it quill groot's tracker just went dark you said we're almost there i'm sure he's fine that could have gone better could have gone worse at least he didn't wake anyone on his way the rodent has tiny padded feet [Music] so stupid he does have tiny padded feet though it's very true certainly it is not best if you simply cut their throats while they sleep no don't do that i'll get through there just oh that was close i don't want to knock any of these bottles rodents is more irritable than usual he didn't want us to sell grouped or did i the tree was an inferior choice we got paid didn't we i was supposed to get through this in one piece can i squeeze through here oh i don't like that i thought it was gg then wait for us he's so quick thanks okay we can stop sneaking now it's fine what's with this place and no railings it's like they got the architect from the death star i am not familiar with that installation we should probably split up there's not really any railings on the death star is there drax always comes with me who's my buddy all these monsters definitely not a fan of whatever this is where is groot yuck just yuck what of the group i'll be in this one surely oh my god that one's massive nope don't like that that michael scott gift did you not see this chris rocky we found him over here easy there bud i'll get you out of the flesh whoa hey let's not turn him into kindly stand back i will breach the perimeter it's too thick what group smells like it's too thick who knew that's it just like the arago drop butt on three two what oh that dashed witch scripted down to your bark you know we just showed up soon good to have you back groot now all we need is an exit um i guess groot knows the way apparently hey wait up what's going on say something you okay group shut it quilt what did i do what did they do to group insisted on this stupid plan now that freaking monster queen is i don't know perhaps the tree witched she did do something to that tara tara hey come on talk to me bud what did that badoon floor could do to you uh the clone guardians of the galaxy you fools thought you could cheat me and suffer no consequence groot [Music] oh it clones it can mimic what it looks like which one of you i get it now got it wise to entrust your absurd scheme to a flora colossus you call him friend yet you ignore his very nature overlooking the fact that he is the worst liar in history i told you he can't just pretend to be monstrous to his credit he kept your secret for almost an hour lady hellbender let us settle this honorably i will face you in combat honorably your offer is worthless destroyer there is no escaping my wrath no it's a giant beaver tail okay you want to see the size of the beaver [Music] i'm gonna kill this it's got two health bars that's a true monster well let's make it truly dead we will need the pelvis for one can talk this over screw talking there's one gun oh that joint octopus keep okay grease ready [Music] i'm ready to find me an opening it's all yours [Music] it's got two more we can do this i would like to fight lady um lady hellbender though oh no it's got ads don't have to tell me twice no no no no no more jellies what's next peter now swing now attack [Music] destroy that come on great [Music] it's on cooldown [Music] [Music] get a rocket [Music] what flavor do you think nope [Music] that's a new one good job one left [Music] i don't think she cares anymore come on you overgrown octopus the creature does not have eight limbs i only had go four them [Music] come on you mean a cut [Music] we've got it free okay that's the final health bar now imagine his head's going to open up and we have to just annihilate it just shoot it in the face oh yeah yes you really gotta freeze those as soon as you can i would say i don't think the monster will be taking any ready i am trying to destroy another joby splash is right in the eye sick [Music] guys we did it they live [Applause] [Music] bring me nasha not the nasher no not like this [Music] [Music] reminds me of the spiral is from destiny we still need to get out of here and fast everybody's dropping now that was a ride there's no time to celebrate we have made it off of this stuff i wonder if she's going to be one of the bosses then there is no escaping i feel like it one of the main antagonists yeah i think that's a yeah i mean she's pretty guys badass on bye lady [Music] are mine guardians of the galaxy it's usually your soul is mine she just wants the bones i suppose they do build things out those on that planet though don't they they had bones armor bones on the wall bunch on the ceiling she will hunt us to the end of the universe who gives us skype we got off that mudball with the money didn't we only after the talking tree betrayed us i do not speak tree tree hey you got a problem with groot you got a problem with me whoa whoa whoa whoa one problem at a time lady hellbender will seek her revenge mark my words then she'll have to get in line first i gotta call corel the sooner we get this fine paid the better yeah so we can go back to focusing on being broke that's weird this money all that you think of rodent no i also think about bombs and booze bombs made out of booze nikki there's something wrong with the connection did you twist the thingy yeah no dice nicki is your mom around i really need to talk to her she's with me inside me did you try narrowing the band first thing i tried it's got to be something else i'm losing in it can you put your mom i think something has happened to the girl yeah it's called she's novacorp can you fix it she's acting weird [Applause] [Music] [Music] is that the space llama it's still there we have to hide it look at what it did it killed everything that's scott relax it's just an array just an array look at it quilt where am i gonna get the parts to fix that it's flark i told you it was a mistake to keep that thing but did you listen to me oh no no no we don't listen to rocket he just has to fix the freaking ship i promise we'll get it fixed soon yeah just like you promised to get your girlfriend to go easy on us yeah okay hey that's not fair you know what isn't fairquill being the only one who actually seems to give us gut about the milano look guys we need doc to fix the array luckily i know a guy i'm nowhere has got the parts we need and he can get rid of that over track jeep we cannot abandon the child the behavior was erratic the llama thing you chewed the wires drugs it was probably just a bad connection and if we remove the tracker corel will make sure the entire nova core fleet is on alert for us gamora is right we made a promise i made a promise steve can pinpoint where corel is we pay the fine quill you're freaking kidding me that way we don't have to keep looking over our shoulders for nova on the next job if there is a next job damn sounds like roots got that toothy bastard under control at the llama back here and trying to finish chewing through my ship or else what did the llama do it just wrecked everything crazy right guys i am going to leave it there for today thank you for watching i hope you guys have enjoyed this i am pondering our latest mission i get you they're still talking but no gotta give our cash to novacorn i do not consider seknoff9 a successful heroic venture it's successful because we got the units not because it was heroic didn't you say the same thing after zootopia that one was a bit higher on the heroism scale bank robberies are not heroic uh yeah they are banks are evil this must be the assassin what did i do again the refrigerator door was left open yeah i should have had gamora or was it the abomination yeah rocket it's fine anyway guys thank you for watching um let me know your thoughts in the comments as well it's interesting i mean no matter what it's a bit difficult i think when you start it was not play and i had to run away like you see the characters differently than what they are in the mcu in the movies but this is based off the comic so i think the correct strategy we're just a big fan of the comics it'd probably be um you know fine you wouldn't have to kind of look past that but i mean to be honest i think the um hold on i just need to pause the game because they can't they won't stop talking i think the uh the gameplay is quite interesting yeah i like the uh the combat uh graphics are nice some of the writing is quite funny um level design is called it reminds me a lot of jedi fallen order but uh yeah there it is what's interesting about this game though is that it is just a uh a single player game there's no live service no mtx no multiplayer no co-op it's just a good old-fashioned big budget single player i think that's uh maybe that's something that we should celebrate in 2021 when so many other games are just full of micro transactions and live service and stuff like that but yeah it's uh good fun i enjoyed it enjoyed what i played so far but anyways um once again cheers for watching a big thanks to epic as well for sponsoring this one this game is available on the epic game store and if you guys buy anything there do consider using my creator code jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that right on subscribe if you're new like the video dislike it if you didn't enjoy it and i'll see you next time bye [Music] you
