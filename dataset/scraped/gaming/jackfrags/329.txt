i need you to help me solve a mystery there's been all sorts of shenanigans in the battlefield community over the past 24 hours yesterday at 2 40 p.m uk time the official battlefield twitter account slid into my dms on twitter incoming transmission so naturally i replied with what what do you want come on battlefield spill the beans and then they posted this weird image so some clouds or waves in the background and some text in there a lot of it is redacted but it says protocol ab00817 halo crossover anyone no i'm just kidding source quantum encrypted long band radio broadcast target oz alias unknown interception unit uss raven rock naval signal corps state of transmission xxx 0104 3600 hours so the message itself in the form that i could see was some of you want to return home i must tell you the truth do we accept our fate if you can fire a gun we need you war is the only way home i was a bit confused by this but then all of a sudden other people on twitter members of the community other content creators also had been sent images and their images were slightly different to mine so we started putting all of these together and sharing them all and i think there was five in total and geeky past times here put together the complete message and it says some of you want to return home that most human of all instincts with a heavy heart i must tell you the truth you have no home to return to the question we must ask ourselves now is do we accept our fate or do we dare to fight for a better world no one may force you into battle but i say to all who can hear my voice if you can fire a gun if you can tend the wound if you can cry havoc those who cannot need you we need you war is the only way home so this is a bit of teasing for the new battlefield game building a world building a narrative giving us a few hints along the way perhaps and then all of a sudden today a couple hours ago there was more battlefield again sliding into my dms you could have just asked for my number emergency broadcast i said not you again and they sent this weird video there's no audio or anything just weird gobbled images it's about 10 seconds long you can't really make anything out but if you freeze a couple of the frames you can kind of see some things in there like this one i froze here that to me looks like an osprey or some kind of helicopter it could even be a chinook or a ka-52 alligator it's a russian helicopter but it's really weird and in my video that was like the only thing that i could make out but exactly the same as yesterday more people have been sent different videos this one from gabitron appears to have some faces in it could be a soldier's face or an eye someone wearing a helmet maybe this one that technically alex got that definitely looks like a little bird helicopter maybe there's a soldier in there too at one point moonlight wolf got sent one as well and i think this is arguably one of the clearest ones that i've seen so far and it looks like a downtown area with skyscrapers or something had's got sent this one and perhaps that's like another version of the downtown area that we're looking at obviously it's really difficult to make out what's in these images and i'm not sure if there's some kind of puzzle here there might be there might be even more hidden messages in here and some people have attempted to overlay them and see if anything stands out but so far it's just a bit of a mess really and unfortunately the compression on twitter videos is so harsh that it makes them even harder to understand but the fact that the most obvious ones are helicopters and ospreys and modern looking cityscapes i think it's fair to say at this point that we are getting a modern or near future battlefield game once again of course these have been heavily memed already frostbite cinematics there thought that they could see an among us character in there hmm red is definitely my mate will here he thinks that's iron man i don't know well i think you're definitely reaching there but let me know down in the comments below if you are seeing something that i'm not because i think that's most of the important bits so far will there be more of this maybe i'm not sure it's only four days to go anyway so i'm sure they're gonna wrap this kind of stuff up the viral marketing keeping everyone excited up to the reveal with that said that's all for today folks thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
