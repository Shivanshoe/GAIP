where is that guy there is there's another one you know what trickshot I'm doing it yes got the trickshot it's 2020 and I'm playing cuisine Royale I'll be honest I didn't see this coming either and yet here we are I last covered this game in the summer of 2018 and at the time we were looking at it because of the weird history the game hat for those of you who don't know cuisine royale started life as a joke literally it was a game made as an April Fool's joke by a company called gaijin entertainment who are a Russian based company known for their work on war thunder and star conflict and a big thanks to them for sponsoring today's video if you want to check out the game for yourself there's a link down in the description below to download it for free on PC Xbox or Playstation 4 and should you use my link you will receive a bonus pack containing in-game equipment and money to get you started so the concept of cuisine rail came about because to protect yourself from those pesky enemy bullets you would put all manner of kitchen items on your body frying pans sauce pans calendars you name it and anything that you picked up would be actually placed on your character model so you ended up looking Italy ridiculous amazingly after April Fool's was over I think the company thought hold on players seem to enjoy the wackiness of this game off of something different and well they actually proceeded to support it as a full title and so today I wanted to take another look at the game and see what changed what's being updated and just get a feel for why some people are still playing this on a daily basis now one of the big things that it has going for it is the price there isn't one as I said it's free-to-play and that suits the game perfectly the first thing I noticed when I jump back on is the movement seemed a lot better than when I first tried it when I played it the last time the movement was quite floaty and it was a little bit clunky but to be honest mechanically I think it feels ok now you can play the game in either first or third person but honestly I think with a game like this the person is definitely the way to go how else would you be able to see your character running around with the pan on their head the core math is very similar as well which is based in Normandy I can't say exactly how much of the math has been changed but I do recognize a few places from the last time that I played well this big like World War 2 star bunker here anyone home oh that was rude well the hell was that like bendy bullets or something I was bouncing around everywhere really rude and they were down here I would like you to meet my friends mr. boomstick he says hi and goodbye there was also a brand new map set in Mexico which definitely changes up the visuals from the very green fields of Normandy to the brown sands of Mexico at first glance it reminded me a bit of Miramar from pub G the entire map isn't just desert though there are some elements of greenery in here too and some cool pyramids lots of new assets so I was really impressed it's also four times bigger than the original map which isn't always a good thing when you have a relatively low play account but I thought the flow of the game was fine oh and also you don't parachute into cuisine Royale like you're doing other Battle Royale games this game will just randomly spawn you on the ground somewhere and then you have to go and fend for yourself so no more cries of where we drop in boats so let me give you a rundown of the basics of cuisine Royale it's a smaller scale battle royale game with up to 40 players you can play solo duo or squads which in this game is for players the game also requires you to pick a character some of which are locked at first these characters not only look visually different but they also offer up unique abilities I've gone with Annie pin-up Ashley who can briefly slow down time and improve her accuracy use it wisely though quite dozin McCullen I don't know what's with these names but he can turn into a frenzied mode and beat people down with his fists I can hear someone you know let's do beast mode for this why not come here stop hiding I wanna follow you yes we got it we got it as mad what the hell why can you do that it's Ocelot L is a mighty Shaymin and he can open the door to the spirit world and the Viking can spin up his hammer and fly into the air it's Thor then now the newest character is called Valentine Jason she can use something called flickering step which allows her to almost warp or dash forward as you can see this game has gone full matte and sometimes that's a good thing so what the game was probably most well known for originally was the way that you protect yourselves in combat the base map is rural so most of the looting that you're doing is small villages and outbuildings and what do you find in those buildings well kitchen utensils of course just to be clear you can't find proper armor and helmets in this game - and they offer up the most protection first until you can find those or loot them off other players you may well end up picking up some pots and pans to give yourself at least a fighting chance if you get shot at the ultimate armor though is a full-on assault vest which is going to give you the best protection now the game allows you to put protection on your head chest left and right arms and left and right legs so you might end up looking like a walking kitchen but at least you'll be protected you're also going to need to find a bag just like every other BR game to hold all your gear there are however some items that you might see around the world that may seem useless at first but they're not for example there are bunny slippers that allow you to you guessed it jump higher the Eagle eyeglasses improve accuracy and the ivory bag allows you to regenerate hit points find an oxygen tank and you can improve your stamina drain all these things also go on your person so by the end of the game you look really stupid but I suppose that's the point in fact I actually found a rocket pack as well which is just bonkers but I kind of liked it it had a limited amount of fuel and you can absolutely kill yourself if you go too fast and don't stick the landing get injured in a fight though you can get health back by using food items which you find dotted around I never really had any trouble finding any and you heal quickly it's also worth noting that you can pick up Aztec gold coins that you find on your way they've got no limit or weight so you just carry as many as you want and you can use these to gamble at slot machines to get in game loot in terms of weapons there's definitely a lot more of those since I last played you've got mostly World War 2 weapons like the mp5 the tommy guns Springfield rifle car 98 as well as other iconic weapons like the AKM the scar and even an mg42 now the next part of the video is where things start to get really really crazy rituals as you play the game and level up you get access to Royal Books you can also gain these by doing challenges now royal books are recurrency that you can use in the workshop to unlock certain items including cosmetics and traps and rituals these come in varying different forms in fact way too many to go into in one video but you've got basic traps which include stuff like jump pads that both you and enemies can use all the way up to ritual of trembling hands which gives everyone on the server 300% more recoil yes that's true 300 percent so traps only affect players who activate them but rituals affect everyone the jump pad is the first one that you get and it can be useful for getting on top of buildings or flanking enemies these rituals and traps consume souls which build up as you play the game by getting kills you can also get them passively with some pieces of clothing there's even a wait for it zombie apocalypse ritual that's got zombie swarms attacking your opponent's I told you it was going to get a bit crazy wrapping things up I think the interesting thing here is that the game went from a joke obviously during its inception to something where strategies and almost custom classes are coming into effect so depending on your character and what pieces of gear you can find you can essentially make a certain build which is quite different and interesting to play than anyone else the gunplay I think even is quite nice although I'm not a big fan of huge writing all over the screen when you get a kill and I think the looting system could be a bit so more refined thankfully even though the loot looks like a mess on the ground there is a proximity loot option to make life easier if you want to try certain things out then there is a shooting range in the game now so load-in try all the guns and items to your heart's content I'm not sure what the developers goals for this game are and if the player base is where they want it to be but they're definitely keeping the updates flowing and the community the game does have seems strong it's also got a wacky element to it and there's some interesting cosmetics in here I have to say it's quite fun to play too I don't expect that I'll be playing every single day but to be honest with you I was surprised at how much fun I had coming back to this game it's changed quite a lot since I last checked it out in 2018 and I'm interested to see what more gaging can bring to the table with that said once again a big thanks to them for sponsoring this video and again there is a link to download the game for free in the description below if you're interested in checking it out if you enjoyed today's video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
