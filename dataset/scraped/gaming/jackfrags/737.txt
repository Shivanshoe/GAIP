everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some more call of duty war zone today I wanted to try out a couple of different guns so I watched the guy on YouTube called exclusive ace and he did a great video where he like broke down all of his favorite guns in the game and he's made a chart on everything where you can look at like DPS time to kill with no armor to arma 3 arma that kind of thing and he had some great recommendations in their book is top pick or best in inverted commas weapon in war zone is the out this one here now I don't know exactly how he had it set up I kind of tried to copy what what he had so today I've been playing ground war and leveling up dog now this is a weapon that I barely used in multiplayer before a couple days ago I mean I've had it a few times like in gunfight and above other occasions but I leveled it up and this is what we're going with so I don't know if you guys knew this but although it's classed as an SMG one of the attachments is a five five six magazine and that increases the damage significantly so I've gone for the drum mag and of course magazine capacity is really really important in modern warfare because you're not just doing one-on-ones you're doing one on three sometimes and you're also dealing with opponents who have potentially 250 HP if they've got three armor plates so magazine capacity is really really important but we've got that on there I've got the monolithic suppressor which i think is like a great attachment for most guns like towards end of their level I suppose extend a barrel I don't actually have a sight on it at the moment but I was thinking of putting like the GI on it the mini reflex we'll see how that fares for range I've got the Joker is my secondary as well I gotta have ghost on there too I might switch things up and go for like a sniper loadout later on but today I'm joined by acolyte who is really nice guy he also has a YouTube channel which I've linked down in the description below and I'm also playing with my friend Karl who goes by Pheo or Phoenix now Karl is someone that we used to play a lot with back in like bf3 and dayz dayz really chill guys so we should have a nice couple of hours of games here and it's gonna be good fun so with that said we're going to cue into a game now and see if we can get some wins today hello if you are in the chat I can see you all I hope you're doing well and if you're watching this as a vaad thank you so much for tuning in I'll put the hope that we did well for you but again if you've got questions in the chat please ping them at me I can't read everything because I'm trying to play the game at the same time but I will do my best to respond to you guys so with that said let's say hi to the guys sound resumed you guys ready yup yes sir alright let's do this so how you find this game then Connor you played a lot of war zone so far well not so much I think I've played 18 hours over the last three days Wow yeah 18 hours oh yeah something like that it's been fun man it's been really fun there's lots of stuff to do in it right it's not like a normal BR whatsoever they've really mixed it up yeah I think I'm quite addicted to it I think it's one of those things where if I have dreams about it I know I'm addicted to it last night I had a dream about water I don't know if that's kind of sad or they've hit the nail on the head right yeah but yeah man it's I'm really enjoying like discovering stuff about the game like all the crazy clips that people have I've been putting out there oh I know the first day the the pistol out of the air raid off drop oh yeah that's cool I thought those super funny have you been using the the thermals at all a little bit on the snipers yeah yeah it's really good for spotting yeah you can just scan an area real quick and go burn to someone there but people take a cold-blooded right which yes and it's such a good counter but when they're trying to lay you out from afar with an m4 or something yeah just can't compete with it because you can't find them Wayne thank you for the C in this loadout I'm running at the moment I've got an out and I've got the Joker you know the the rocket launched their locks on oh yeah yeah gonna try something new go for it the argh really yeah there's a guy who does odd videos and he does like great dance of all the data and everything and he did a video a couple days ago about like best weapons and he looked you know he had all the chants and everything with DPS and ttk and he reckons at the algae with the 556 mag attachment is actually like one of the best weapons in water oh really yeah when you consider armor plate rate of fire range all that kind of stuff but we'll see well give it a shot I'm excited to try it out but where do you like to drop down honestly I'm impartial I've been dropping in so many different spots because the map is so big I haven't really learned where the best spots to drop are yet but I did have a crazy game in boneyard we just never left stayed there the whole round I'll shoot all around can we go there and get one of the get one of the scavenger things maybe yeah we can do that it's a heli there do hmm what's a broken hey anything gaming K communism cats how you doing what's up Seeley hey captain clunge what's up Jason andrews silver bullets a shadow star gaming are you guys all doing thank you for joining tonight I'm going to pick this up straight out I'm gonna get the heli right away it's fun to gun you gonna straight to the Gulag car oh yeah oh maybe not No oh my how many that at least two not on the same team though I'll thank you I feel like I'm a bit far away from you here but it's working so that's okay oh my okay well you need one of these guns kind of no I'm okay I got an LMG and a mp7 okay let's see if we can find some armor plates I think you go looking up a little bit area there's a guy over this way picking up Salaam we get up on top of the plane I don't think you can see in that container ship nice second floor and one at the end of you is that your Molly no that's theirs okay I'm a bit low and I'm same team what do you need let's go let's go say I'm dead right jump jump I need a all nice you've got it please yes here mascara Connor circles around with you thank you very much that's not a bad story is it boys how much money we got not enough yeah cool like with Bri me it was one sorry brimming but there's just dead bodies everywhere I'm gonna go for that scavenge over there Connor yeah we can do that a bit of cash maybe I found that most the time you can get your loader drop immediately do you think that's a balanced or do you think that I should increase the price the price a little bit more I I think they should increase the price I think six thousand is way too low for your whole team to be told there you know maybe they drop the mic mid game too right yeah there's just random drops as well I don't know maybe 6,000 for one player but it's hard to judge it isn't it it is it really is what I saw some people doing was they would drop on a scavenger think mission like we're doing here like a contract so one guy would drop really quick hit the first one and then the other 2 would parachute really early and then he would get the first one and they would just parachute on the second and third and then that's instant and low that job that's pretty genius oh we do we forget the heli good Snagit what we were doing yesterday with my group we were doing the the other types of contract I don't think it's I don't think it's this one but it's the ones that reveal the zone next and we did a couple of those and they just sit central zone because you know where to end revealed the oh you mean the Recon ones the flags yes that actually shows you where the next zone is yeah once you complete them I did not know that yeah so we kept doing that and it treated us pretty well we kept finding the last zone and we were just go and sit in there just camping everyone out yep Thermal snipers on top of roofs off there the whole shebang we were those guys yep we could get loadout now if you want oh yeah RPG appear what's up Roberto how you doing man videos or by station nearby is that the closest one I think that's the closest one I'm not very good at much that come out so I'm probably wrong no that's all right there's a guy over there I'm scared of him yeah we don't have to fight them right now let's get our load it's what we want what we need oh I just built a questionable loadout which what is it well I mean it's the OGG which you know it's perfectly acceptable because it's it's good but then the riot shield riot shield shield a pretty good a Bondy thank you for the ten how you would like a warzone yeah I'm more or less the same as you where I would use the like a rocket launcher I don't really I wouldn't really want a secondary weapon I'm using the odds so I really I'm not a sniper for my book yeah what you see when I play these decides against I'm quite I don't I usually stick to one gone another one I found it okay so there is a reason why I gotta use it in practice that's all that's true all right why do you want a mute a well I guess just go into the zone for now there's a vehicle nearby I found that those are really good for league in mm1 here it was forget this is like why like self Rosie oh yeah armor plates for everyone is the biggest thing yeah doctor I forgot to buy doc Fox so I think this is the best PR at launch it's up there man it's it's really up their apex had a really good launch as well this is really strong I haven't really noticed any problems Paul Paul roof the vehicle was they look like they're leaving it I don't want to shoot them yet I was gonna go for the vehicle does anyone know where overgrown is I'm not sure we'll come back to you guys the gas is pushing in yeah I was just gonna pick up it's still only I don't think so Willem Oh if they let you jump up on the back no use those guys up - all right I'm gonna try to avoid them that's it Jack mm-hmm yeah - issed slowcoach okay go good good job there's no friendly follow there's a guy out there right we'd have to go this way though he's fine set us on fire you can thrown in the back if you need to honestly I'm impressed I'm straining credit we're out of here it is acolyte king Hereafter I felt like I'm playing a single-player level all the AI are just attracted to you yeah an ermine thank you for the 25 I've I don't think games comes gonna happen to be honest where is the business part I think James comes gotta be counsellors anybody know know if we get into the load-out drop I can get one oh yeah it's true well I just love the Joker too much does it lock on to vehicles or it does yeah lock on to all vehicles and you can also don't fire it so if someone's camping on a roof oh my god wow yeah that really hurt didn't it Alma Wow well how much money do you have we can still go to another by station buy some more armor 3100 yeah let's go over here this is like acolytes magical tour of the war zone map all of this is great please keep your arms and legs inside

he went to uni what jobs you had before YouTube life plan maybe in the future maybe I studied computer game design at uni that's what I did I did a four-year course so I kind of know how to make games but I don't because it was just a university course I don't have any actual experience of making games what's the general pattern a or somatic a are 120 gaming what game do you recommend that has a low requirement so I can play it on a laptop for a quick game integrated graphics oh man counter-strike csgo might run well um tow I'm good thanks to my favorite streamers Stone Mountain and Jack frags I think stones watching I'm playing with a cue light in my friend car or some Dark Stranger hey hung up the thinking I might actually give this game a try I'd likely be cannon fodder well you know as long as you're having fun that's the that's the most important thing you don't have to be good at every game to enjoy it and you might surprise yourself right it might be a lot better than you think puppy soda how good was the video with the clips from warzone Thank You Man I mean most of the clips you know they weren't mine you know I just found the best ones on the on the card reddit did some commentary on top Lloyd Berg thank you for becoming a new member right round two are we gonna win this one can we do it right sound of muted sound resumes where we drop in boys I think that's what they say right that's exactly what you say every game that's what needs to be said so no phone yard last time hmm I've noticed damn does not have a lot of loot so I kind of like to avoid that place I'll never go there ever again don't even mention it yeah pretty much nature I feel like the silk is gonna end there this match they're looking at it probably will it's gonna scorn us isn't it

Lucas thank you be the to hit me up if you're ever in Sedona Arizona but my main weapon is a RPG triple kill what I call amazing be easy and go only 2500 more yeah baby steps yeah puppy that's a crazy clip when he throws the rock of the Claymore J Travers what did you learn in Maya animation effects modeling it was mainly modeling in Maya Scorpio Zed sculpting that kind of thing it was quite a while ago and out those the boxes the gift gosh there's no like cash looks let's casually on the floor you can find on the pill it'll be on the flower you know what them the maximum amount you can find us on the ground cash I feel like it's like yeah I feel like it's 2500 or something yeah like that big stack the bundle yeah I think you're right I think it's 2500 I don't think I've seen over that mm-hmm I've seen a big double bag is that 5k or something crazy no that's from players yeah okay thank you for I have like the bigger it becomes then eventually goes into a duffel bag gotcha eventually it just turns into a credit card twenty five thousand on this one American Express that's right been looted what's the party size limit Matthew its three all being looted Thank You are mad well I guess they would have cash where's nearest bank well you can look for contracts I guess but there's no missions near you yeah that's the nearest one that's behind you you could go to that one - that's a search yeah search is probably bad that okay that flag one call if you do that mission you have to go and capture an objective but whilst you're capturing it it fires a golden firework into the sky and says hey there's someone here that's really yeah you found 15k in their orange crate wow I don't think you could find 15k on the floor I think a key light question was how much because you just find on the floor yeah love that there's these little missions throughout the the match because that's how it helps you get your teammates back in right yep if you have a bad game oh isn't that a new color for new you call that's the way to get cash it's a wall call oh you made it by four he's gonna play in them Walton thank you for [Music] went their vehicle but if you had to hit that you've

under will try plunder and Mike thank you for the fifty love you content keep having fun thank you I need to get that out back again did you like it that first match is really good yeah yeah I never used it much in the multiplayer but people were swearing by it yeah same I had to like grind it early on today to get all the attachments pre stream content what are you using on it right now that makes it so good I think the big thing is the five five six mag the drum mag because you get 60 rounds and it upgrades the damage of it as its fastest an SMG if you put the five five six in it the damage on it is actually quite high and accident AR then we're almost yeah and it's got pretty decent mobility and range and accuracy it's just really good like all-rounder mam I might have to try that he also recommended a bottle a foul is a lot of fun I use that a bunch and multiplayer yeah he was saying like if you just headshot people in war zone you just chunk all my place oh yeah with the foul but of course it is semi-auto so that's not for everyone not everyone likes that yeah Jason Woodley thank you for becoming a new member just binded so left click is scroll down or up we've got it

delayed trigger why is a game such a painful weapon is did you ever play about field three-color I played it very briefly for like a week but that was on console and then I probably slept a PC and I just never touched it oh my god there's a god right next to me oh my god there is a whole group of snipers down below careful I'm not building I need a gun I don't think we came to the right spot yeah

Scott yeah that was close that was close it is a cue light yeah but this is the Alec setup that I'm going with it's pretty laser beam is pretty laser let me tell you it works really well in war zone it's from the video that I watched from a guy called ace he's got like all the weapon data information I thought I'd give it a go it's pretty good Joe beach morning jack played my first game yesterday really loving the pace yeah it's pretty fun isn't it Joe pretty damn fun mark has anyone figured out the laptop yet no you know what your most kills was in a game we played one earlier off stream I've got 18 kills I think that's the most that I've got so far I like the scope on the cone I see a guy's a bit like a yep unit seven one three that tablet gadget yeah so that is the heartbeat sensor it's like the thing from aliens you guys have seen aliens right basically that really good Thank You Ivan yeah oculus core man he's a nice dude very good player very Chell easy salty [Music] then on PC King golfer hey Bix right a TV station it worked mm-hmm never where did we go the very first win was boneyard right yeah and then did we win it lumber I can't remember that yeah we did that was though that was women as well dude where do we go now I would battle airport yeah for my session which one you want you want to do Airport Apple Apple Apple [Music] that's one can get quite hard yeah there is a bouncy as well there's a couple of scavenger contracts perfect can you get loot like on top of the air traffic control center like there's actually you are inside yes I don't know about on the table though all right check it out I've just never been up here before I don't want to be the victim of an air strike you know fully understand it was just some ammo right that's all huh music oh no a piece of you is it it's not even in this is it no it's not it's not basically legal doesn't even drop either yeah that's how it like I would like them to diversify the loot a little bit more yeah I think just maybe increase the load out package cost yeah that'd be a good move I reckon what they might do is every like few weeks just completely change up the loot table oh that would be good listen I'm being hunted to be honest I think they've been pretty good with the live service stuff so far like they seem to be on the ball with regular updates yeah I was really impressed keep this fresh by you know changing the loot table quite often and introducing new contracts as well right like it doesn't always have to be scavenge recon and bounty on what do you think they could replace with it oh no I search and destroy like take get a bomb and take it somewhere even like that maybe yeah okay cool I've got enough for a lot out by the way P well yeah let's just do straight away find Paul Robinson thank you for becoming you know wherever he goes yeah as I'm being hunted remember six stage what's the threat it's just warm did you get the load alcohol no I meant to say if we combined it with one person how they died the hunters they died yeah easy money if call of duty had Villar how would you realize and then the curve the most I wouldn't play it to be honest I don't think it needs to be Maya for play its I'll jump free and there's a we try and you pick up that c4 I've got a drum would you what you want to do it okay so if I come down can you just plop c4 on it yeah me oh okay well that does not go exactly where it says mmm hold on let me try this again yes it's on yes it's on but dream try flying up yeah thanks are there any targets I don't know you should be able to auto spot people with it I'm kind of going too far away here oh shoot it's the battery life is based on range I think there is another drone I know where another one is okay we'll come back I'll pick it up destroy this evil exploit no no I was gonna say like okay yeah so if you come over here well we have to go up top it's it's in this area here is one page with summer please he's very addictive halal yeah very addictive it was down here ice there's a cool area to fighting Harris remember all right we'll save this until we know there's someone nearby and then we'll try it again okay sounds good last zone would be really funny dude win the game with a c4 drone yes I got a bonus to reddit's Austin yes we got the bunny sorry I meant this one over here this new one is it um yeah there's the by thing is they're both yes it is there's a staircase behind you hey wait what's up Stryker 2080 I think rifle and armor plates no yeah no 900k yep yeah I got five I need munitions but pretty good but I

trying to connect to battle yeah Carl hey I can't see you online yet yeah give me say that's it do they lovely engines screen installing share this blah blah blah oh boy installing shade Mart it's a minigame in itself yeah occulus mike is really good Jonathan that should be joining in a sec am I like the best gun the whole like tile first game was really good actually used that a lot I'm the game that we won this Alex I'll appear come again yeah that's what we use in I think this game let's try and get loadout ASAP all right just pull the money together yeah yeah that's what that's what I normally do it's very good so helpful or early on as a brunette hey Perry hey Marcus Pete the world galway iran is it realistic some elements of this game a realistic yeah I mean I think the weapons look very realistic the tzk is pretty quick Max is an SMG yeah but if you put those five five six rounds in it basically becomes a assault rifle the metro ever playing [ __ ] again yeah yeah I've got some home videos in the works actually at the moment that's a great gap recall all night it's crazy [Music] Toby all right here we go hey okay okay hey Jalen yeah well I've done three live streams in the past week so I'm definitely doing it more often I like streaming it's good fun O'Conner I literally just read your DM on my phone I apologize I didn't realize no I told you were starting up the streams I didn't want to interrupt it I bet that guy's like sorry what's what's going on it's been inactive for so long all right can't you get it I don't know how to get it hmm go over there mode initials there all right yeah I think if it's inactive you can like open a ticket or something and they'll give it to you that account okay I'll trade you in there most to the targets pumpkin is fast but still reads on his own shipwreck yeah I'm really enjoying this game I picked here because there's quite a few missions around right hmm it's somewhere he's always a good drop around here some up here Oh someone's got a heli Ozzy up careful are we being hunted yes oh you specifically me specifically you must protect acolyte at all costs you know all right let's get that money so we don't need much more do you think it's possible to get a contract to hunt down the people that are hunting you yeah we do let's go is go get loader like that's insane isn't it like the game breathing we already have enough well all three fully loaded cold hard cash car practical that's gonna land in between therefore their deadly don't don't stand underneath those yes right here we go it was that point straightway yeah we can do that threat isn't increasing so I think we're running away from them maybe they dropped quarry yeah I hear a heli after the East no I don't it's a fan on one of these okay yeah just a really big fan yeah it's as that good it was how about Keystone if we want to go up with us what what we what do I do let's get this secure thing here call okay now quickly by somewhere where plates see if anyone comes around same here oh no I'm gonna come back to you guys yeah I'm in an open field as well so you're all right there just like looting the quarry okay I only saw one though I've got no idea on the others wonder if those are the guys this relief was tracking me I feel like they are I think the grass would be bigger if it was them well I'm not close to you right I think it only counts for me what's your threat level it's only one it's still one right now yeah now it's two yeah it is them I'll just wait 15 seconds okay jumping off this Tommy oh man is just absolutely laser day but it is that insta no no no Johnny Alma place call yeah thank you where was he exactly same spot right there behind that he's gone in he's gone inside bottom level he's bottom oh yeah they could come out this door I don't really want to push in there it's not he's not there Tommy thank you for the 5 zoom in here so you kind of have far less he really ran versus clear this little room here comes secure it with you I don't know if it goes faster it more diesel on it interesting well nice down below that instant oh okay it's job hey that owl just absolutely destroyed him I don't know if anybody likes this thing but this isn't here well I'm gonna go buy some stuff we could do there your scavenger plates or we could do recon you said recon shows you oh yeah actually shows you the other zone let's do the next read another one we'll have another zone on top of that that's cool is these flag ones right yeah the flags got some munitions next to the box thank you vehicle six joke around Lord alright let's head over there sorry hundred meters by UAV gunshots up to the west 285 like in that compound I think but this should be easy because it's in indoors if we just have one person looking out I know something on the roof is it it did they're generally inside oh yeah this'll be an easy one you think it um speeds up oh definitely look that's way yes more people on it the quicker it goes when you're trying to make money for teammates that are they can't come back in the game yet okay so if we do another one we'd actually see like where the final zone was almost right maybe I've never done it before it is their office like the max I've done uh I don't see any mm-hmm I think there's one over here yeah is there a heli here we could if there's a heli no I don't see anyone no all right well we could just go to military base yeah somewhere get this contract just to see how close I'm gonna grab the squad about seeing the quarry behind us we have a UAV someone get you a beer yes I can buy one now I'm gonna wait with you guys oh I think I just picked up Carl yeah Thomas Eddie's gone I'll combine another we can buy another one over here I just bought one as well if you use three at the same time it becomes an advanced UAV yeah you see the whole map right yeah have you got one call no no no I got that position Eric it was it I'll pop mine we've got two ground leveling in there right yeah both dead well look at that that's money that's cash money right there I'm alone out here I'm just gonna get my sniper cuz I haven't actually done that yet it's actually got a sniper friend for once rather than two jokers I know I'm just I'm just out in the back pinging people I mean that's fine I can just bought them for you and then you call in the air strike because it doesn't warn them does it the Jo could nod it doesn't want you in this is joka and before you know it you're gone another bounty here Jerry do you want to do it yeah let's go we still got two UAVs or there's a supply one here as close oh yeah Oh Jeep that's them probably call you still got that Joker cuz that yeah yeah yeah that is them that's easy money right there these are over the hill they're going up the hill top load I can't it's on blue one jumped out we this is tough I think all three of cold-blooded yeah armored cilantro go market I'll give cheerleading hey Scott on yeah let's go next time maybe I got a good spot yeah yeah yeah this is live I'm wondering if you look a sniper and then we have a joker so if we get like up on the cliff side here just near the edge of the zone the boundaries we might be able to just start calling stuff in on people yes love that and if you want I could buy a munitions box we can do that oh I can get one it's oh no I'm gonna go buy an air strike I could get when it's likes anyway you guys have cold-blooded no yeah missions box why have munitions box 5k yeah okay everyone good Oh is enemy call that's us oh you're just a that's weird it sounded in front of you it's a no on the mini-map it it just looks like you're an Avro moving really quickly I couldn't see the odd bike just speeding a good boy too fast too furious upppppp it's a wiki on a quad grandpa yeah go just jump up there we go we're gonna hike up the tree physics how do they work no one knows no this is so weird it says clinic we might run out into these guys I don't know oh no cuz they're still in contract don't they are you able to see him that's cheeky we can pinch them [Music] without all of us yeah sorry defender oh you eat dog food if

to the for you I can drop you someplace over here can you make it over me yeah okay are we gonna need to make money oh I don't know if you can do it but we killed that one guy those two guys outside the zone Oh over there is that Luke that it might be too far of a run for you the other is lit right there oh yeah don't know risk it for a biscuit I have the quick revive but you only have eight seconds so you gotta do quickly you can do it here you're good you're good here they already picked myself I've just gotten off EJ they are they all here all right this isn't good can we outrun this
