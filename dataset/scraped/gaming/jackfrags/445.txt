battlefield 6 is releasing this year and with that in mind i thought to ask the question what's the best battlefield map ever made it's a tough one to answer really isn't it arguably impossible what about top five of all time still pretty hard you'd have to cut out a lot of great maps just think about it bf 1942 bf2 345 bad company bc2 2142 bf1 there are loads of games to choose maps from instead what if i asked you to name your top 10 maps of all time i think that sounds a bit more reasonable to me and so that's what i've done here now if we all did this we'd have incredibly different lists the truth is that everyone is different and everyone not only prefers different maps but has different memories of playing them a lot of maps that i've chosen are because i remember them so fondly when playing with friends i've had great experiences on them it absolutely affects your decision but when you're cutting down so many maps to only 10 tough choices have to be made and i've made a few today so the first in my top 10 and in absolutely no order is strike at carcon we'll find this out numerous times during this video but the sign of a popular map has to be how many times it gets remade over the years and striker carkind has had its fair share of remakes it was made in bf3 even 2142 but the version that i'm choosing here is from battlefield 2. i still think karkhand is one of the best examples of infantry combat in an urban environment that battlefield has ever created and it's only when i jumped back in to run around and i remembered just how big this map was it's got more capture points across the bridge than the bf3 version too which does make a difference if one team gets pushed back the one downside i'll say though is that it's really dusty which can impact vision i think that was due to performance at the time though i'd love to see karkund reimagined again in another modern battlefield game the bf3 version looked incredible but look at this concept image and imagine it with an up-to-date frostbite engine it could be epic next up we have another huge map battlefield 2 maps were rarely small to be fair and here is dragon valley this is another bf2 map of course but it was also remade in bf4 this one was a tough one because the bf4 version of the map looks fantastic and it feels way more like what the original map designers would have envisioned if they had the tech back in bf2 days temple area especially looks gorgeous it's also the map that had one of the most frustrating easter eggs on ever with switches hidden in trees logic puzzles and all for a dice camo even still the original map has fond memories for me because it was just such a great battlefield experience jets choppers tanks infantry the map just flowed really well i spent many hours as a chopper gunner on this map and for that reason it's on my list next up arguably one of the most iconic battlefield maps of all time wake island this may not come as a shock for you as i imagine it will be on a lot of people's lists and we talked about remakes being a measure of how good a map is well this map has been remade more times than i can count the original version was released on 1942 and that's the version that i've picked so many good memories from playing bf 1942 on here it has been remade several times though on bf2 bf3 bf5 vietnam 1943 2142 and even battlefield heroes it's a very popular map what's so interesting about wake though is that it was also the demo map for bf1942 battlefield as we know it is a huge 64 player all-out war experience but back then it was a brand new concept and it had to be proven in fact during an interview with lars gustafsson the big man at dice before the release of the bf5 version he explained how at the time the studio was struggling to pitch the game to publishers because they just didn't believe a game like that could be made and so wake island ended up being one of the central points of the trailer and the demo so if you think about it it really is where battlefield as we know started and it has to be on my list for that reason alone let's switch gears though and now move on to a more modern map just like wake island was the centerpiece of bf1942 whenever i think of battlefield 3 i immediately jumped to caspian border in my mind and it's the next map on my list it was remade in bf4 but despite the map being reasonably similar minus a huge wall i just feel as though the original played better had a great flow to it and it just brought some better memories for me it was the first glimpse that we got of bf3 multiplayer as well and that trailer was just incredible it had everything that you could want from a battlefield map infantry battles especially on the hill space for tanks lanes choppers raining down hell and jets fighting way up in the sky the layout wasn't very complex but it just worked as a map and often some of the best maps in these games are the simplest and my next map is from bad company 2 and it's none other than erica harbour this is another infantry map and i'd say it's one of the better maps in bc2 unlike some mats though i actually enjoyed this one on both rush and conquest and the bc2 destruction definitely adds to the experience over the course of a round you'll find most of the buildings destroy and while you'll get killed from the odd player hiding inside them it does offer a unique experience you can use all classes to good effect here too perhaps the only issue with the map is snipers sitting really far back during rush matches but apart from an artillery strike we can't do much about that now can we and then we have another bad company to map but this time a rush specialist valparaiso i think this one would be up there for a lot of people but likewise it could be a bit marmite for others i personally think this is one of the best rush maps in the game perhaps of all time and this was definitely one of the most played maps for me on bad company 2. so i remember it more fondly than most various stages are so different as well you've gotta push down the hill then you fight through the fishing village before working your way back up another hill i imagine loads of people will remember sniping from the lighthouse too moving on it's time to head all the way back to bf1942 again and el alamein this is another map on my list despite being well really it's just a big open desert but back in the day when i loaded up bf 1942 it was so iconic and i asked myself why did i like this month so much if a map came out like this today with so little cover i'd definitely be criticizing it and yet i remember el alamein so fondly back in bf1942 times there weren't all that many assets on the maps to begin with so it wasn't that much of an issue back then and each team's base was at the opposite side of a huge mountain or hill and then two outposts sat on either side and this was definitely a vehicle heavy map and it showcased that element of battlefield to the maximum tanks and planes of the order of the day infantry well you probably won't have a very good time here and while infantry may not have had a good time on el alamein somewhere they did prosper was on grand bazaar and that's next on my list this one could maybe be classed as controversial but it's on my list because of the reasons i mentioned earlier mainly good memories i played this map more than i could remember i loved the infantry flow through the middle of the map and also the banana as we used to call it back when bf3 was the main game i played a lot of competitive games and we played matches on this map quite a lot it worked really well for 5v5 which is unusual for most battlefield maps and that's one of the reasons that it's on my top 10 list just a fun map to play generally warm up on had vehicles there too loved grand bazaar and some of you may even remember the remake in battlefield hardline it even had a secret room that led you to an epic easter egg that in terms of spectacle was one of my favorites and for our penultimate map we have our first battlefield 1 map and to me saint quentin score is at the top of the list for bf1 i do think there are some good bf1 maps but this one just has a fantastic flow the flow between the flags mainly the ruins down to the town just works great of course the overpowered bombers during various phases of the game's life didn't exactly add to the experience but the tanks and horses worked in relative harmony here some fantastic sniping opportunities from the windmill and the windows of buildings too and this map also happens to be part of a bf1 operation and the first few points that you have to capture offer up a fantastic trench-based battle it's bf1 at its world war one fantasy finest ironically the first part of the operations map isn't used all that much during conquest it's basically a gimme flag but in grand ops it was a fantastic experience and last but by no means least i've gotta put propaganda in my top 10 from battlefield 4. on paper this map looks incredibly linear and basic but in actual fact had a brilliant flow to it and it's one of my favorite infantry experiences in bf4 it was added with the dragon's teeth dlc so interestingly it's not even a base map that should tell you how much i personally like it for it to get into my list it's a built-up urban map set in north korea and you've got one side of the map which is mostly a heavy urban area with lots of factories and a giant monument then on the other side of the road and tracks you've got two other flags interestingly there's also a levolution event on this map where the train rolls through the map be careful not to be in its path when it does because it will kill you one thing you may not know though is that this map was based on a level from bf2142 called belgrade while the concept of each of these maps isn't the same and those games are vastly different you can see similar design in the layouts and it's a nice nod to 2142 a couple of cool easter eggs on this map as well and there we have it that's all my top 10 most iconic bestest greatest most fabulous battlefield maps of all time and speaking of bf2142 i don't have any maps in my list despite enjoying that game i just don't think any of them were particularly epic and stand out it's the same with battlefield 5 for me although a couple came close i mentioned it before too but this is just my personal list based on my experiences with all of those games but i'd be really interested to find out what you guys think and which maps are your favorite across all games and why what makes the best battlefield map of all time let me know down in the comments below and that's all guys thank you so much for watching hope
