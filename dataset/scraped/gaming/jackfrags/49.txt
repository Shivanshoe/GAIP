music's changed what operator is that mecha godzilla for uh we've stopped searching uh it is right because you guys need to come back into the lobby because it desynced us all um it's because i think what i think what happened is when i clicked matchmake it forced me to watch the the little trailer thing right it kicked and then kicked me back out into the main menu and i came back in so there you go what operator was it cam uh constance which is the uh vanguard one what bloody hell is that uh so she's the lady yes the lady make a godzilla oh baby the noise it's making yeah i know jack yours is just a regular there we go and [Music] yeah it looks pretty cool that is a great skin it's gonna be a good sweat skin i think i've heard some rumblings in my chat that they are massive what the the boys the boys are massive what gun is that um type 100 and the atra burst yeah i know but there's a titan thank oh i can hear rumblings yeah i hear rumble every now and again you said tight 100 i can't the one in the bundle cap yeah it's it's in the um the watcher caller are you sure it's not everything yeah oh it's neurologic is it yeah i think so yeah it just didn't load the skin operation 60 players oh interesting here we go let's go boys titan frenzy damage the titans during the frenzy event to earn rewards stream thank you for tuning in this is our first match in gear you got time before deployment where's time's over i think i should have gifted subs on youtube as well today i'm part of the initial oh my god godzilla's beaming i'm part of the initial wave of that so i don't know if anyone wants to start feel free i think you have to opt into it or something i don't know right who wins godzilla or king kong i should have done a poll a violet thank you for becoming a x fill or godzilla's on the right king kong what are they doing they're just smashing stuff up oh godzilla's beaming live and your kia teammates will redeploy i don't like that or return them isn't working either so the guys can't hear me and i can't hear them [Applause] don't get hit marker i just got intel from king kong once what is that monarch intel overdrive what is this stuff it's all new and crazy i'm confused okay i actually need to sort out my mute button because that's no good i think it's because i've tabbed into the game i find a nice quiet area down here maybe godzilla using aimbot i think so what's up mark thank you for becoming a member repair titan frenzy grab supplies from monarch supply i just need to alt tab from the game quickly sorry about this guys one second guess is right on your tail no i've just seen him jump onto the peak that's terrifying dude this is so sick he's just jumped on the beat where are we going sorry my mute wasn't working so i couldn't hear you okay i mean he's a pretty easy target to hit isn't it i can't see them oh there's that intel collected if you shoot if you shoot godzilla you're just collecting the bar at the top guys look at the bomb oh yeah the bar at the top and i've got overdrive or something does that even mean lucky's downing men i'm down to man yeah i gotta call me midair there's a guy dropping oh god he's taking a ruckus get in the helicopter or something it's gonna be worth watching oh god he's hyperbole is he beaming oh my god that looks so sick dude godzilla godzilla's turned on his aimbot he's trying to get rid of pete because it's the worst part of the map yeah absolutely do you reckon we could stun godzilla with a little stun grenade i reckon he could slide him with a pistol from like 500 meters away how many points have you got on the side of the screen like it over on the right hand side i've got 18 oh yeah i got 15. every time you shoot him you just get intel collected so keep shooting him for memes right i've collected all the all that i mean there's so much on my screen i'm not sure what i'm doing [Music] oh what are you doing up there imagine the size of the bananas dude this in a plane that's so good coming over whatever the same map oh stop it [Applause] wow yeah i think so i think that you have to be the person that does it and i think i don't know you have to go and pick up the difference if you collect intel like i am right now killstreak oh it's on the right yeah look at the bars yeah you get this yet some kind of thing that's cool godzilla's going under the water where's he going have you used it yeah last year no no no yeah you've got like unlimited stim it's really weird i need help how did he slide so fast that's what i'm saying you do you have mega slides in this oh my god up there you just jumped off peak and started beating his chest in this mr you can get like super far i just need uh to get some to get run over over here holy crap is he destroying peak you're being trapped he's trying to rock at it get rid [Music] we're gonna get this time godzilla uh yeah i mean we could go meme him [Music] to stagger the titans okay no one's everyone's just killing each other i do i'm absolutely beaming i've got a milano it's all i've got jack i i'm by godzilla now oh yeah the more you shoot him you get overdrive which means you just you get you you stim you just go really fast basically watching him i'm watching him oh god he's beaming oh god he's going right over my head just hit a rock or something what the hell oh my god look at him his thing's like half he's half damaged he's half damage keep beaming come here i got my armor satchel thank god that's what i needed it actually looks good like i expected it to be a bit chalked because as well it goes across and beeping again in the gun look at this helicopter taking him out intel collected shots this is so sick what's he doing yeah take out the helicopter you can you can't attack him right now he's invincible he's turned on his uh godzilla staggered he's asleep dude i'm shooting intel collected keep shooting my way how do i get on this gun how do you get on the gun you're not allowed he's running the gas today i hope he has a gas pass what a big game bounty guys we'll get some cash i don't think godzilla's the big game imagine that yeah i know and an mg42 this guy knows what's up that's pvc but mg42 is i'm about to get a heavy weapon drop i'm gonna head shot godzilla rytek [Music] oh decrypting i've got i'm in his path no no he's got a titan frenzy on me look at this heat ray coming in it should just miss me i've got uav let me let's see if i can figure out where godzilla is oh god he's about to beam gentlemen i'm here jack jack look at your mini map you're right on the edge of something there should miss me right yeah it should do it keep shooting him he's in it nearby open fire oh you hear that sound okay i've got 95 intel what does it mean what does it mean that's so funny jack behind me when i hit him in the head oh guys can we not think about improving our kd and just kill godzilla right that's what i was doing just like that smite me guys i'm controlling him you're controlling him i'm controlling godzilla why does the sd is that what you were doing let me see if i can spot him for us i'm killing the guy that killed you jack revenge it's sweet coming back

for godzilla and i'm about to make [Applause] [Music] the thumb item three thermite i think i've thermited king kong ammo it actually changes your fov when he roars yeah oh man still collecting himself i'm literally standing next to godzilla this is quite threatening again i'm decrypting again what does this do rotate it yeah jack that's you that's doing that [Music] [Applause] oh god here comes the rock there's a rock's coming home [Music] no i [Applause] when your dog wants a biscuit oh god he hold up the beam thank you anyone got uh ammo box not literally nothing they should just play an ammo box by default in this game godzilla skin works on this mode yeah it does there's a guy above us i think he's braying coming oh no he's on the canon [Music] i'm picking up loads of intel i'm guessing that's my monik thing on the side of the screen right oh my god i was wondering where i was gonna go it moves a little bit left and right look it's got recoil not my study it's just what you get you've got godzilla that's in the kill feed oh yeah yeah yeah yeah little icon right quick rubbing for this gear oh this is so cool oh that damages you on the ground the radiation that's does

can't i thermite him why can't i thermite king kong found another munitions box yes there's more people coming from the hills yeah they're going to push us on me wow godzilla is coming your way [Music] now now we have to eliminate everyone is that what we have to do yeah i think now we have to win the win the game but also we can keep using the heat rate to kill people someone's firing rocket time dude i mean it's probably a good it's probably a good strat i'm oh i don't think you survive in a building either so you might want to move i'm being serious i'm not going to survive full stop and there's people on the hill oh and it's so close to the edge i nearly made it killed one guy [Applause] [Music] [Music] once they got him trying to crawl out of the way of king kong's giant boulders oh god oh he's ready for me he's ready for a beam hot beam hop beam can you switch the image can you guess i can try yeah i can try [Music] look where it's ending up guys in the ocean do we

really been that many um interesting live stream ball games that are out at the moment that i've like latched on to that i'd want to live stream so um yeah it's not been as much i think over you know august september there'll be a lot more when the new games start to come out james alexander thank you for becoming a member a latin thank you what's up chinta thank you playmo star citizen for sure man i got i'm really enjoying star citizen it's good it's really good fun oh it's not working again look at him allies will redeploy as long as you remain alive earn points it works when i'm in the menu and then you can control them with the device now the attack on titan bundle was definitely a missed opportunity because oh my god titans spying on this would have been so cool that would have been amazing that would have been really cool are you guys all going for planes yeah yeah i could pick you up jack maybe yeah we'll go see kong yeah you want to give him a little tickle i just want to go let's get close i'll get the hell he'll get the heli would you like to join studies tools please shout out why would you land on this plane you weirdo [Applause] oh there's a lot of people on pete by the way yeah we should move away from peak jumped off rotating there's fighter planes inside peak he's having a frenzy like if you go to the bottom runway there he is flying out the bottom of peak intel collected selected intel collected intel collected smoke dude that was going right over his head oh my god i nearly hit him oh god he's getting angry you can grab a fighter plane from uh from the feet yeah you're doing good damage though i think jeff you think you'll ever get to see them fight each other i mean that would be a literal end game i reckon there's like a secret unlock oh cameron into his face yeah i just heated myself into kong's face why are you trying to take out flames you little yeah jack's doing the scene oh god oh god [Music] wow the models are actually really detailed and it doesn't look terrible it doesn't it looks really good oh watch out oh god look at you guys you're just tickling him i think he's going to win how close can we get jack oh god i don't know he's going to swat us out of the sky dude do you like the time oh oh yeah i think that's it lucky the more damage you do the more damage you do the more likely monkey oh god godzilla wonder if you could see for king kong he's got some cheeks on him man look at that oh he's going to throw he's going to throw a rock at me he's not very happy i mean that must really hurt being miniguned in the eye look oh is out of the sky and he's off great light and frenzy over so you can't anti-air king kong or canyon no i don't think so you might have to be closer i did he might be invulnerable right was so now i loved it that's amazing okay so you can't get too close to then yeah i'm taking out that plane that was awesome because he took me out so he's going to hold it it's kind of hot by the way it was just so i want to go back and see the monkey godzilla's over at uh a beach head if you want to go and say hello but there's people fighting on southbound as well we could use the um where have

like a special okay guys um i might have done it too long um are you all gonna kill yourself the snow oh no the heat right oh there's only three teams left dude you got a team wipe with the thing that's ridiculous who's doing that it's the other team because they've got access to the thing so because it's now locked so you can't you can't do it anymore if you go into the ray afterwards it sets you on fire yeah it leaves some radiation on the ground oh i don't think i'm gonna get it how many of these have they got saved though it's just us and then yeah where's where's godzilla now oh they're over here they're over here yeah it seems that they have a lot keep shooting keep shooting because we can get another device for the end i'm gonna run out of ammo though to actually kill the

buddy we are alive yeah i don't think i'd play this for uh more than a few hours i mean it's so cool though they've managed to pull this together like if they were gonna like regularly sorry if they were gonna regularly update it then you know i'd be uh much more inclined to stick at it i bet they've got a lot of players right now though i think a lot of casual players would have come back and gave this a go next game order them to attack each other if i can june i'll say i'll try sounds good um i'm gonna drop some more cod points in the chat here guys we'll drop the playstation we've got three playstation cod points codes coming in the chat now [Applause] we did get some new members as well thank you did we figure out if the gifting's working is it there is the option there i'm just

you stand next to that and shoot him you do more like you get more xp or more damage or something i don't know i didn't drive [Music] yeah it's going to be too late oh it's too late no here he comes no no no no no there's a couple of them around the map if he comes the rockstar there we go we need to get to the buy over here because we've got oh no there are people just above this fire by the way okay why would you do that yeah near us i think on the rocks uh i've got munitions it's fine there's a team behind us on the rocks oh yeah they're coming at 60. king kong you need to chill daddy okay what are you doing he's dead daddy kong daddy please more animus i don't want to die no he just uh he threw a rock instead of doing his slamming it i got the device i'm going to try and control one of them who am i going to control godzilla it's godzilla should i is resurgence still active um yeah all right yes still active the character models from the movies just stole them and just got the low poly version or something because they're working with the studio aren't they so they could have shared another i need another musicians if you go on might be able to get something in a minute because the air strike yeah there we go i don't see godzilla oh my god that's all knackered special package stodd special package starts got his package out what's it what's your special package that's before oh yeah that's the one you have put in your hdr video jack yeah maybe and my axe is yeah so if you actually it's actually really easy to kill squads in this mode which instantly replace you can't get that you can get up on the roof jack oh yeah over by the stairs at the back you can hop up on the little frame here and then you can hop up on the roof here oh that's cool the more you know godzilla i missed so i kind of understand now he's just pumping his chest stop pumping king kong stop that now stop it i don't like the way that king kong doesn't come into the final circle and it's godzilla in the final circle kind of want both even though he's the final player yeah yeah he's the final boss should we go after godzilla now is there separate challenges lackey for like each um i think fighting each titan there is like 125 000 damage to each one and then 500 000 damage to all of them in total oh my god we're literally going to have to play this game to unlock it all sounds like vanguard unlocks please play our game all right where am i where am i finished well do we hold on i put it down put it down on docks oh no oh god he's coming kong is targeting you [Applause] he's jumping is he going to jump in or is he throwing a knife he's doing a rock and then i think he's going to jump to my area yeah he'll jump now if you're going to do any of the any of the beams and stuff put them on green over there there's a team over there you jump in yet again reinforcements are now disabled guys so don't die right why is he not doing my thing he's not doing my thing where i send him over there have you oh it accused it up though doesn't it because yeah i know but people could have moved berlin oh my god the godzilla beam this is pretty sick i'm gonna lie isn't it yeah that's pretty cool i took out the big cheese it's a very cheesy game mode for casual players i mean casual babs oh and there's the casual player right now all right can i get a rest you in you're in cover yeah okay five teams there 15 players boys we can quick scope them all that was a baby yes you know it's like now we're getting twin game though i'm never gonna have enough ammo to beam to get another thing so it's just like well you have to save it no you have to save it there's nobody in those buildings otherwise they would have died so there must be all the cranes in on the ship yeah there's one here i just got the kill i'm gonna save mine until right at the end thank you later goodbye oh i think we're the only like full team left yeah between out of beam godzilla godzilla he's he's in the v guys this game mode count towards your career katie how could you hopefully godzilla has just beamed away he's throwing it he's throwing it it's clipped through everything oh god oh team here holds him here then marcus rath again done it again yeah they know where we are whole team we're stud uh on the red marker here in front of me and now the heat ray we need to kill that we need to we need to we need to keep shooting godzilla where the hell is he yeah i've nearly gone you beamed him you've been lucky yep took out one you go rose skin dead good good kid it's 4v1 ah good ah it's time to heat raymond have you got one i thought i had one but it's just next i need a smile the beam is the coolest thing i've ever seen it's the krypton screen device right where is he i think i must be hiding in the relocating he must be hiding in [Music] about where am i putting it you should see a uav cam if you open it yeah i've opened it it doesn't show where he is just put it on jack god of course that's going to get me as well isn't it oh god yeah i've done that to myself i'm dead no kong is targeting your area this is the big rock giant rockers rockers right okay so he must be right on the edge there he's run to the edge surely i didn't get a uav pick he didn't [Applause] you can find secrets by directing them by telling you what to do okay so the only way to tell them what to do is that though yeah well i'm just interested about kong's acts because why would it be there yeah it's kind of a bit weird isn't it right hang on my uav said he was over there when i got the device out may have accidentally been remembered very very soon yeah let's focus on a rock let's try and get them to when they go into the frenzy yeah so there might be actually a bit of method to the madness here there's some kind of secrets right i'll get us back straight back in let's try and figure out all right we're on a four win streak guys let's apparently destroy the glowing thing with the attacks that's what yeah yeah that's the obvious one isn't it be quick you have to be quick and ready to do it and it hasn't and it can't be queued up because it only he only sits there for about a minute and then he's gone yeah so everyone lmg's or i'm being kong this round by the way i am now the thickest boy we need to make a loadie for this really rockets mg42 rocket mg42 rocket or like the m60 or something mg-42 and rocket with recoil booster extended mag everything um 150 round god i've got so many calling cards i can't hold them all i'm going for a 150 round mg82 wow you've got there's loads of player titles i'm team godzilla i'm going to try the joker and see if i can lock onto it gonna be calling in the i o oh no if we can get them to smash one of the rocks with the hieroglyphs on or something of that demeanor holding for deployment take this time so we can follow them around so we need to destroy them when they're near the rocks when they're in the frenzy mode okay so you have to destroy them okay let's see what we can do so we're on a three-game winning streak by the way and that deserves a like on the stream for everyone streaming on youtube um maybe even a like on every video like all this video yeah prime sub on twitch if you got one we should go for a helicopter i think that's a player and it's time for five ads on switch do you think the axe is well lucky like you said maybe something like that yeah the axe has been there for a while now so oh right he's sitting by the first rock but it's not lit it is not lit i repeat he's hammering near it hang on a minute it's not lit how do we get into litty litty well he goes into a frenzy mode that's when it goes off right that's when he starts getting low and that's and that's what but do you reckon we need to use king kong's thing or do we use godzilla's thing to do i like using king kong's thing either of them are fine really but king kong thing what's the strike let's go yes jack it means munitions as well i've got zero weapons clustering jack's on about 50 points already so yeah he's not in frenzy mode at this role hey jack are you in the heli that's me shooting the boot i've got munichi yeah he's going for it right uh me and jack gonna have to run we're getting the carjacked okay he's on one of the rocks but what can we do you can do you have to shoot the the shoot the rock the rock with anything oh yeah i don't know rpgs thermites we're seeing it with a minigun try oh god and you're dead he just swiped the helicopter he's like gaining power from the monologue so if you don't shoot him quick enough is that what i don't know well they're going to be a couple of titan frenzies for sure oh god it's fine uh i don't think this is fine jack i don't think this is fine slight cancel away think about the now the kids oh you can't bring him i was on my life it's controlled by someone because he's spamming it can you keep this away from me yeah i'm trying to figure out whether you can look jack he's not i want you dead no you can't do any damage to the rock that's what i've seen what but what do the rocks do is that where it gives him his like extra power to these frenzies i think so yeah so there's got to be something to it i'm redeploying he's almost he's almost like max bed damage what does that mean anger he's really really angry yeah yeah he's getting angry i'm on the monolith right now okay yeah so that's because i died instantly i think we have to do an attack on it and it would like um he's leaving if you do the godzilla blast on it while it's glowing maybe that's it yeah but you'd have to get an enormous amount of intel that quick yeah you don't have to be beaming him like you have to get like at the top it's immediately seems to work he's just aimbotting me now being killed this isn't going to work for me i think no i've been killed brandon i've got two bazookas i think i'm going to survive guys you'll be alright [Applause] crates inbound mental event mental i bet there's a ton of secrets we must uncover the secrets yeah we must uncover the secrets [Music] [Applause] it did the same for me i did a munitions crate uh i'm sorry uh heavy weapons are worth a fair amount on those uh yeah they're worth quite a bit more squad members so they don't have a frenzy anymore now not at the moment now what are the secrets of your power king kong i would like to see the baby i would like to see the baby [Laughter] yeah i think i think the idea definitely might be in making them attack each other during the frenzy but you'd have to get loads of intel crates to do that or like just a load of intel [Applause] oh god oh god there goes kong i think he's gonna frenzy the man landing behind you by me yeah on that red mark he's going down in defense you're crushing him i believe god the heat ray the heat ray prepare for tightening we could do it we could do it we could do it oh i'm about to be beamed i'm being beaten with me yeah godzilla's about to beat me is he by one of the things at the moment yeah it's it's lighting up okay have you got an attack one of you no i'm getting yeah interesting now i'm so close [Music] reloading yeah reloading you have to keep moving in guys because it's unavailable during a frenzy no okay unavailable yeah i can't use it no no okay so our theory wasn't correct then theory isn't correct so maybe we've got a monolith no i'm not allowed i've got a three anyway let me use it yeah shoot the thing with rockets choose the monolith yeah is that what we're allow are we allowed to is it breaking i don't know but we just didn't see anything we can think of really i can't use the javelin on him guys and it's done and he's gone oh god yes hold up [Music] the thing isn't lighting up anymore [Applause] why is that area blue on the map yes i think something's beaming him with blue did you see that i'm saying the actual look of the map docks is blue is it because there's some monarch drops there or something i don't know it's not the ui is not particularly descriptive [Applause] i've placed a kong's raft apparently trying to stick kong with termites i stuck him with a thermite [Applause] intel crate's inbound okay so kong's just going to stand here now he's not going to move anymore final resting spot yeah because like it last game he didn't move did he on this zone yeah me don't like kids sakuras come here okay i've got one as well now yeah i've got the screen device i'm already getting to a heavy duty i don't know there's gotta be something to it sure there's a guy up here right there red markers oh guns are pretty terrible well you get a lot of intel from that a cannon [Applause] i'm trying to make it so that i can get all the way just before a screen device and then stack a second one yeah if i can get two you can do that yeah you can just get the meter all the way up to just before you unlock the second screen device and then you can stack it anyone got an ammo crate no but i have a load out i'll tell you what the aaa cabin might be the strap that's the player how many points yeah i'm getting like 20 like 10 to 15 per burst so each burst is worth like nearly the whole length [Applause] when somebody's actually shooting at me shooting at me yeah yeah red marker red marker have something [Music] what the hell is shot from behind someone just sniped me but it didn't one shot me out of the sky i think kong's wrath oh god is that godzilla's frenzy because godzilla has a frenzy as well doesn't he no they fire at the same time though the frenzies need a ministry if you got one no one here stud yeah you've got two devices so i'm gonna use one now yeah you've just been pummeling godzilla again yeah i've just been pummeling him oh my my sec i got the scream device and it didn't stack it so you can only hold one my favorite part so now i have to do all 150 yeah probably drops it though you probably dropped it somewhere whenever you got it i'm dead now well i can get oh oh no oh no he keeps going he keeps talking about a camera it's up on the roof i think my other device well yeah can we just pile them out i guess they despawn wouldn't they yeah you just like stack them yeah heavy weapon drop i am heavy weapon drop right yeah again yeah over here i mean if i see a load of enemies grouped up i might start everyone's actually focusing more on shooting as opposed to not really yeah there's 33 players left like yeah i've got another device yeah you can stack them it dropped it stodd you were right um just down in there's how much drop on it so we need to try and get that device as soon as possible basically yeah i got a glorious device so i got the godzilla's one heat ray activated get my loadout again he's annoying [Applause] okay so i've got a device as well i use godzilla's destruction let's kill people in the factory yeah there's people over here beaming get them i just got killed with godzilla's ray yes this is the wrong x this is the thumbnail world of the xm4 that's the blueprint i didn't change the blueprint let me prepare i'll control [Music] guys dropping in on us think i have an idea what's your idea lucky well so let's say we have to get these things to move right which means that we need the titan devices watching me from my right hand side surely if you land top peak where the aa gun is one of the few like functional air guns where kong goes you could just beam him all the way through how many monarch points are right here look at the ball hello there's so many of them you can pick them all up and it'll give you extra stuff right [Applause] absolutely try hard in godzilla with a merited xm4 well i don't understand this this blue area it makes no sense confusion it just ignored my come on it just went now just put it somewhere else i think that's because someone else did it yeah but no i don't have one oh god oh he took it away from you yeah he just used it and then went nah ui is a bit funny though isn't it yeah i've had a couple of times where i'm in the map and the thing disappears i've definitely messed it up yeah you can rank up your guns pretty fast in this mode i think oh you should come to me it's safe here there's evil ground here as well from godzilla i'm running around i am down i'm gonna die i didn't think it was gonna do that much damage broke a guy over the back there you go i did not put it there uh right okay so put it directly on top of us that's gonna kill me then no you're fine do you notice when you put it down it's bigger for you than it is for anyone else yes yeah so i called it in over here on this beach and they just dropped it on us yeah that's what happened to me that's what happened to me earlier maybe it's max range maybe i don't know if it's blue again now right now go go go is there a monolith within this blue circle no the godzilla doesn't need it does he so it might be on the beach someone just called in a loadout down there is it could be that rock right yeah because what if the monolith has to be activated within this blue area on the beach here guys because there's no explanation for this blue circle they found him they found rusty and they've murdered me with no light yeah the god no an m13 of all things jackie's crouch sliding his way to victory a downed one [Music] that blue area isn't explained by anything is it not really no it's just there gotta be something to it i don't know what but there's something to it it's gonna be something it's gotta be something right do you guys wanna make any changes to your loadouts a second cam sorry you want to do an mg 42 or something strela i'm gonna do a pkm 200 round mag i love that let's do it vkm bringing out the big guns 200 200 round pkm yeah 200 round pkm no optic because you don't need it and uh fully loaded that's not a bad idea a fin lmg light machine yeah finn lmg let's go and you need a gun to run around with so i'd recommend keeping looking no stop the recall on that it doesn't the whitley have like an insane magazine on one of them i think it does it's like 250 round mag maybe is it 250 on the whitley one of them is ridiculous let me have a look uh lmg's whitley magazine 150 lackey so no which is the show right let me know when you're ready guys let me let me i'm nearly ready i'll be one second yeah no worries the kong skin is not yeah i don't like the cog scene it's weird isn't it ciao i hope you're enjoying this i'll play one more game and then i think that'll be it um like because of code i'm still feeling a bit like low energy i keep coughing and i don't want to like just you know drain all my energy doing this i'll get one more gaming thank you for watching so far i love this says the devil the toe is a good idea you need to aim it at the ground beneath king kong [Music] hey babylon i'm all right thank you hey axel i can't wait for the next 2042 video the comment section is the best thing about it i love reading the comments to just push the hell out of that game it's always fun reading the comments and we're 2042 as well people can't help but comment everyone's always got like a really you know strong opinion about it [Music] hey markell what's up heron what has happened to cod el cano it's just how it is now man check weapons just a fun casual arcade game it's always been that but obviously they've um taken it to another level now with these crossovers and weapon skins and stuff enough training now you fight a real enemy mg-42 is 250 rounds oh damn it hey up to the game baby let's do nukem isn't it sounds better yeah my voice is a lot better uh we've got three more codes to give away as well we'll drop the xbox cod points codes in the chat now what's up real joel how you doing man joel james my name is the real joy james hello star citizen thank you siddharth [Music] king kong what's he doing down there if we can get those platforms of aas we can definitely get the intel extremely quickly okay i'll go for this one over here are you going for the one that's marked there i'm going for the orange there is a heli here [Applause] i have been shot behind immediately with a pistol monarch one guy down here i'm already down so can you got him down got him down with me nice one finished him can you see godzilla from here you can see kong normally oh wait no he's moved a different angle huh he's gone away hasn't he lucky yeah our plan has failed my plan is his fumble there's a plane coming for me again jump back here at some point he probably will prepare for titan frenzy we're on one of the points crashing to the ground oh there he goes is he coming there's a guy on the roof above you lucky jumping down now yeah i've just bounced off the floor there on bounce now we get the godzilla beam to hit it i mean who knows but now we've been with no one's got it there's no way you're getting one straight away [Applause] oh i got i got a uav i thought it was an air strike damn it it's a portable buy here as well yeah you got a couple of people below you what has happened to my hood he's gone all funny he's just turned right in the back he just crushed me you clash like he literally just smashed me with his hand [Applause] there's normally two frenzies per round oh god bestie getting the mini game if you want he's back beaming um so i redeployed and he jumped through me and i died instantly yeah the side didn't redeploy and she was spawning are you switching the cannons every time yeah exactly yeah get them oh god first place oh my god yeah charm yeah critical damage oh oh god i take the damage from i i tried to switch seats as you left stud and it put me in the pilots i know i took damage though i don't think so now once [Applause] already that's an airstrike yes get the points [Applause] good count [ __ ] we're coming back oh yeah i've got a precision i've got a precision oh when it jumps it's so cold [Music] what oh [Applause] there my two hundred round pka didn't start saying you can't use it when he's got the friends here there you go i can try i couldn't monkey come on my ui is completely busted by the way really little c4 knocking at your door [Applause] reloading i'm halfway getting the next one already [Applause] two hundred rounds of pain with the pjs and godzilla are way easier i'm being beamed by someone oh god everything then come on stay on this edge with me and then it'll be fine oh god i feel like i feel like this is in the comments oh god he's gonna be friendly he's on it and he's unable during a frenzy unable yeah so i don't really understand how this works [Applause] hmm strike it yeah try an airstrike right i mean guys there's a spare screen device there if you want one there's a rock on you guys watch out unavailable right right on the edge i should be okay yeah guys there's a scream device here if you want it i'm going to try and hair strike him how many ammo do i [ __ ] oh no no no no one of the screen devices i worked so hard to get it [Applause] i reckon geeky bastards has already figured it out i wouldn't be surprised i'll have to go watch the stream there's the guy here running up to you another one maybe you can do it can you use it whilst he's staggered lucky behind you there's a man in the gas oh that's a good shot here can you use it whilst he's staggered i've got one try see if you can use it now i know unavailable unavailable no god damn so you guys are right by the way what is the purpose of him being staggered yeah what's the point of even having the device if you can't do anything to the titans with it good work soldier i've got one yeah i've got one too i down the guy though i'd already dropped one though and it got left behind him twice what does the staggering mechanic do though that's the thing three times like bananas from trees someone who i just said i don't think that's ah i think they're having you on there let's have a look in the trees can you see any bananas up there really wish there's a way you can get them to fight each other athletic association the zones move massively like look the zone is going out of the gas look you see that over at docks it basically ends in certain locations so that godzilla can be near you so there's no blue thing on the map right now and there hasn't been other than the frenzy both titans unavailable so yeah like i don't really understand so we need to figure out that blue thing what is the blue thing squeaky past times tweeted anything help us geeky nice combat though eat the shredded godzilla eat it didn't even travel that far thing then look at us all here just beaming him 200 round pkn let's go [Music] imagine if he just like turned his beam on us was just like right see like yeah i reckon if you did i reckon if you did that you haven't unlocked you would get so much xp right now oh yeah yeah you could level up oil weapons yeah i think he probably would i mean it says it's double xp in this mode so oh i got another stream device i can use it right now i'm going to use mine just screw it people down in the water already yeah i've called it an honor people in the water if you open the map before the animation finishes it uh it starts activating the thing already so on that in this final circle is anybody aware of any locations of monoliths oh god in the final location um in this area right now no i don't think there's any no i hit kong with that combat though someone's calling in the lodi [Applause] thank you very much for becoming a member appreciate that gas is inbound i call in my loadout no doubt there's a guy above you by the way yeah there's a movement here ready to be the kong one is completely broken by the way it just doesn't very well you aim it yeah right can i finally get a godzilla one [Music] so someone's just see you guys here loads of guys there yeah you can select whether you're using the godzilla or the conga village oh god no jack check i'm in my uh my monster kill streak device there's a guy how do i get out of it you have to put it down i'm sure you get out of it you drop cam maybe oh look at that legendary thanks dude yeah so on console you plus you press the left button and you can select well you can do three or four on pc yeah there you go so that's that's an easy way of doing it don't mess around with the mouse that way jack there's people over here we can kill them well there's people over here i've got my uh hold on i'm going to try and beam them over yeah yeah right oh someone else is done they're getting pushed by the zone right now number one victory royale yeah i'll put it on us nice this is the same circle finishes last time you feel like it's a certain thing well i don't know but this is definitely identical you're going left side of that rock yeah i've been immediately beamed king kong suck on my ass he's still going coming from the cod website rumor has it monarch has a few secret awards for brave or just playing reckless so experiment with both monsters and see what you can find well that doesn't really make any sense because you don't experiment with them you just get a device and get to do one thing and that's it so i don't really understand what they mean by that there's a monolith right here yeah it's all it's on yeah it's right on the edge of the water [Applause] oh that was so close i'm gonna try and get you to shoot the monolith on blue there's a monolith on blues on me he has a monolith right there all blue interesting it's not just getting like triple down available all right i've gone to beam it out gas is in between marking lucky you're in the way doing it right [Applause] can you kill me it doesn't do anything like it didn't do anything now in the trailer like the hands and stuff like light up on the monoliths but i don't really [Music] but it's just understand to get the are you like 600 rpgs yeah i will be honest like it's not very well explained well i don't think it's supposed to be and it's a bit of an easter egg are there any monarch locations like obvious monarch things like the ships or something because it says it says specifically that monarch has a few secrets bunkers maybe yeah i think it's just like you need to get the window right so you know you've got a godzilla breath saved off when king kong's next to the the rock and it's uh no no no yeah maybe i'm gonna die here i'm there's a afraid on the beach on a stimmy oh god they're pushing me though just yeah there you go look it says that aerial axe slash is one of kong's attacks so he must be staying like what's going on where are they but yeah so you can get so he must be able to pick out [Music] um i might be able to get back up there yeah that that makes sense lackey because otherwise if he if he has an aerial axe ability how do you trigger that unless he can pick up the axe yeah exactly i'm gonna have a look now and then more importantly what is under the axe once he pulls it out of the ground yeah the thing is i guess they could just unlock abilities as the event carries on kind of thing yeah maybe from may 11th to 25th two weeks yeah maybe it's that then just roll them out starts just sweating his ass off at the end of this i just i swear my thing just hit them though hang on neither nor godzilla or villains uh the monster verse has protector and destroyer titans each with a biological imperative to battle for dominance while we do see these ancient rivals go toe-to-toe and godzilla versus kong both are considered protector titans however provoked by other titans or humans there's no stopping their rage ah well i can't resonate one now it's ruined oh there is a bye no money yeah it says here operation monarch godzilla known attacks heat ray breath tail swipe door source dorsal slice so is that the normal attacks he does yeah but we've only been able to use the heat ray but he doesn't he just do random attacks anyway and that's what he's doing i've never seen that so we can't i've never seen the axe but but kong has an axe buried into the ground it just says here his latest target is caldera patrolling around the island and using his heat ray breath haphazardly um and gifted if you win this round [Music] beautiful shot look at this x50 is back yes is there another guy here surely yeah that [Music] what yeah it says here in operation monitor the scream device is in a minute beams you're gonna push me it's five less stuff oh no this is the team as well i seem to want you dead start dude got two semtex lucky study there's only one of them i'll put us back in the menu um once the attack type is chosen between type uh between the heat ray or the ground pound from kong those are the only two that you can use so that's interesting because he hasn't used the ax slash must be an easter egg lucky yeah he must be yeah it might it must be like some kind of special activation i wonder if there's like a a location where if you fly a plane around him he he whips it out or something maybe wait right i'm off good game that was good fun have a good night right chat thank you for watching hope you enjoyed that it's a bit of fun i don't really see myself playing that mode that much longer to be honest unless there's some kind of crazy easter egg that you can activate where you see something special happen um it's a it's a good laugh like i think the developers have done a great job with it as well you know obviously putting something that big into the game so cool to see king kong and godzilla like that and being able to use them as well like attack people and get kills with them i got like a triple kill with uh king kong's rock was it at one point in that last match so there's some epic moments yeah not much replayability though in my opinion but there it is that'll be there for two weeks i think two weeks up on the store um appreciate you all being here thank you for the
