hi everyone hope you doing well and welcome to some call of duty war zone I did say that I was going to stream today unfortunately the season 4 update was delayed so we won't be looking at that today but I wanted to keep my promise to you guys and actually make a stream I didn't want to say I was gonna be there and I wasn't so hello if you're watching it live and if you're watching it as a video hopefully we had some good matches tonight today I'm playing we study areas fine gentlemen there and I'm going to be using the Aquila 141 I think this is a weapon that is often overlooked underrated definitely but I wanted to see is there a competitive build with this gun I've been using it a bit leveled it up and I think I found something that works quite well so this is what we've got going on here at the mono single arms 19.8 I don't like the iron sights on this so I put a mini reflex on it mono for grip 50 round mags rather than the 60 just because I like that extra mobility that you get when you've got the 50 instead of the 60 without said we're gonna get into some games here with study and have some fun let's see what he's up to sound resumed I started yeah good to go yeah yeah ready to go man alright thanks so we're gonna do trios and we're gonna fill see if we can get some nice random people to join some lovely random people lovely random us gonna be great so what kind a loadout are you rocking tonight start what you're gonna be using the RAM 7-iron site I in site ramsett well I don't even know what the iron sights on the run 7 look like they're a bit more like a K iron sights but in a ring you know it has the little half moon kind of thing with over the center like an e turned sideways a gyro it looks like a gyro so you're telling me you aim with the Euro symbol that's right money right money okay this guy is actually on PlayStation but he's using a mouse you don't say that I've had that before but I think it's epi it's wrong and you don't think it's a good a good move well let's try it let's try it let's go for it okay well so I mean obviously when the beta came out you and I tested using the mouse on ps4 and it felt ok but there was a lot of input lag 60 FPS low field of view it was it was absolutely playable it was I thought it was gonna be like nope disgusting we'll see how it goes yeah I'd like insane sensitivity on the mouse Sean yeah I got closer than my my standard sense though it's pretty good have you played any today if you warmed up for no you don't need some warm-up pain it's painfully there's nothing you can do so like if you have you got one for the slide comes with Stratos no I can't I'm not that keen so tsuki sorry you were telling me that you can you slide you slide and then you sprint and then jump us up here right see change your Crouch to change stance yeah yeah whatever is control or I lose left alt and then it's Crouch crouch jump Crouch crouch jump and you don't actually jump if you got it right you do a slide and then when you put when you press when you crouch trout jump you shouldn't jump right and just continue running but you also have to turn on tap whispering ortho as well okay yeah if that you know that sounds really complicated yeah it also doesn't seem to make that much difference but I do it anyway okay so did you mark that or did he Mach think yeah I think he's he's well up for it I mean I think we should get Cory Boris a go Cory so best one yet no the season four of date didn't happen yet they delayed it so that what I was that's what I was going to the stream tonight but it was delayed but I promised that you guys I would be on so that's what we're doing I hope you guys enjoy it yeah perfect timing and you're doing the I've known for the kilo one for now maxed out I think I've got a nice build on it and I'm gonna see you know is it is it competitive so guys trying to shoot me boy did you lose oh no you okay so I'm gonna go over here on me here okay go guy here the guy you guys I'm I'm been shot in the back yeah I'm good I'm gonna come with you that was to hear my young friend is down Oh No so if they lose the Gulag do you think they will disconnect though carry on so we'll just lobby the roof no no that could have been to a scout from that team okay oh I hope they don't disconnect I want him to stay do you think they'll stay you might do we've got a little bit of cash on the roof stud no I don't sorry fine he's jumped off he's jumped off okay [Music] I'll just keep testing see where they are okay no one at heart I got pretty lucky with that spray there yes checking again anyone around anyone got any money there's none that were happy but yeah they got bigger yeah if you give me your money Justin can get it back in two hundred mate oh yeah yeah wait no we'd have a shop I thought weather v1 air its sniper ammo as well that's you don't go on a hunt don't pay that Blake let that play thank you I've got this sniper ammo now 13 bullets there let me say this I'll be sensor as well um I haven't seen anyone heartbeat and we can just keep checking we can just go slowly through yeah just move through together checking heart I think it's pro game a move right here guys if you're watching this I think in this building XC you sticking around he is sticking around I'm proud of him it was it big Stewie for last I remember that oh yeah he was I hear a box above me I'm gonna go for it yes why nothing actually be able to do this om use that plate Jack so thank you for the reminder I often forget I do dude I've got some extra sniper ammo for you if you need it I'm alright for now I'll pull up no that great expected beautiful with the slowest he said thing a legend okay well we can chill a bit now I think there is another team that London at quarry though yeah yeah I'm not just part be think constantly if they're gonna be in these buildings is it worth getting this bouncing um yeah I think so old yeah I think they all right and grab this arm up I got ton more money from somewhere and I'm beat yeah same sex is better on a beat still might even get enough money to go lay down yeah I mean quarries are brilliant like it's a good place to drop if you get a lot of crate I why here's someone else apart from him no maybe not early surely no one have their room it's fine us yeah that's I say yeah oh nice 46 metres oh yeah North so over there somewhere no building on the roof 7 get a different angle here didn't quite a beam him hard enough run let's have a look he's moved in front of me he's kind of northeast now okay just one guy right

you own PG&E got sniped where's our friend might begin but it would be rather stupid he jumped off he jumped off that guy he coming this way from the guys in front just got roof cover of course well at least at least they got ya and I feel him yeah What did he say stupid RPGs along those lines finish one day down there with the RPG no I'm upstairs I'm upstairs that much says down - down - are they on the roof there's on that video of my smart they're on that happy dude he's alright just going in there yep one dead and then one left one lap I'm seen in anyone outside or any here no as he could have gone to the roof right mmm I think he was on this he was oh yeah damn it should have killed him don't know if that's a teammate do we have enough money to get our mate back they've got I'm dropping down to you stuff I don't know where he's gone he said this building yeah yeah I haven't taken fully harpies sosamma yeah nothing I mean then what are the chances that he's got ghosts already if they didn't have a load up holy by meet you don't buy me climbing whereabouts you Stimpy actually this is a new team this is a new team you shot me from the trucks I would personally run away jack because they're just gonna go career Wow where the hell was he I didn't even know who that guy was but then you just head shot him yeah yeah I didn't like him he came to the spot where I wasn't exciting to you I think these guys are gonna just hard push I've moved away staad they're full growl bhima's you know yeah just move away I've got enough money soon yeah we have enough money now yeah we go sis PI over here gonna buck you like the mp5 skin see I'm say as cool isn't it it doesn't mean Louie do that Yeah right I'll try you cash BB growling I'll do a share son yeah yeah I had to dip out of that cuz yeah there was three b1 at Birth thing they were absolutely clueless yeah do with a arm essential a microphone this is well if you think about it you got a ghost no I know my class yeah yeah Sam I'm thinking they're they're probably gonna push towards us from the now keep moving keep moving yeah where's the song going you're moving a leading good go for that scout yeah I mean with the ground yes boy than the open light you need ed yeah if you get against like a good player who knows what he was doing he was crap flight counseling as well yeah it's gone back to awesome I think it's cuz our teammates over there so it's just yeah or ingenious I'm afraid I mean it's quite close to the Bell had is actually testing out for us he's been it's being tracked as well tell him to get out of there time to get out of there Alvin I I really I only watch the highlights to be honest yeah it's the fall it's in here under yeah it's time to run I don't even know if I'll be able to make it across this airfield without being 475 here or at least I mean they don't know where me and you are now you know they don't they're just gonna like Yolo critters it just has to be that team that got the bouncy and then I'll teammate they got the bounty yep and he went towards yeah let's keep moving keep moving north I all this has been layered oh good cash we could just spend to a locker oh yeah go slow to get out but yeah we should resin we should resin don't go for that one don't go for that one just keep going let me grab the heli and go yeah let's go north I've got the feeling someone's around here man that's way too open that one what about I'm down one of the dam at the cellar we could do that yeah I just loot somewhere dead and then get our load out and get back pretty safe oh there's a truck there that is he actually gonna go across the down there maybe and I've got c4 that yeah I will let them I think this place is Eve is a bit more desolate yeah it's a better option I'll get the rest you just buy cell friends or whatever you want and I think we're safe loadout I think yeah for me in bow he said thanks or legend yeah or at least we're away from the beamers momentarily you know oh yeah till the end of the game and then no murderous yeah is this with the round seven and the Keela one for one secretly the best gun in the game I just I just think it's you know it's lacking on CERN front but it can compete and then remain that funny yeah Mike ela one for one has a crab with a knife on the side so you know it makes it better a DF by one one frame simply scares the opponents to death when they see the crab with the knife it just poor me I ain't going anywhere near that oh is that the crab knife me yeah crab oh you get stabber I've never not version of it mess with crab oh you get stubble yeah no I've not heard that one and it's a picture of a crab with a knife I mean obviously I've seen the crab in the knife mean I'd never heard that particular phrasing before I like it though you know I'm a big fun that's a crabber yes though though mama wants to get stabber especially especially from the crab no well I mean imagine imagine being murdered by a crap table horrifying I mean I do have a key card so yeah there's the one right by damn right here no one there yeah there's one right here let's do it I don't think I've ever been to that one what just someone camping down there Aaron sitting around there there we go you go down this what is this a giant crab in there with a knife zabba why oh my no what how did he die what he didn't activate his parachute and just he's definitely gone now he created into the ground and then disconnected someone's doing alright thanks so long it's over though careful careful Jackie killer do something visit yeah I don't like that he died of embarrassment way too deep the game he just like he thought himself off the edge and then buy you need enormous satchel yeah yeah that's right baby no sorry I thought it was a um a buddy got two plates though it should be alright kind of feel bad for him like why did he just use of edge what the thing is this he didn't even go down I think he uses himself hit the floor and then went even further this I'm just like and then just died this just Gaber Diane we do the classic Skyrim is it this way or do we have to go along the bottom of the well you would just want to get back up to the top yeah where were you I don't want to go all the way around there was a team here the other just seen him how do we do that me now striveth he looks like he's on his own he's in the building he's out the building there's one guy who might have seen my Skoglund he's running towards us stud I hate the x50 joke I'll be honest why you got the eggs this is what I picked up there's on air yeah well I didn't get in there you can't even be a 50-day if this doesn't work bullets just unreal yeah will you run across you run across sayin oh yeah and then sky what if there's like a book with it you can just I'll go over the letter again ouch ink is like a really easy way to get it every time what's this I'm gonna get sniped on I buy an x-15 ow well I think that guy's own that's the only caveat good add the eggs 50 stud you never know very dangerous very founding well if he's that the say me excuse me you were fine yeah oh look like I got stuck then oh sorry I was weird I thought that poor guy literally left the game in embarrassment he seemed alright though cuz he was like communicating with us and he's saying thank you and I knew I was doing he waited he was patient guy up here nice line oh that's standing completely still I might be able to get than with his overtly Ronnie edge kilo is not really fit for this kind of range no leave it at the stubby ground just to you see this baby for me you see me J all right one down one he's on the same corner okay you know in the building two down I've just okay there's one left and I've got copies on the guys they're down I mean he could have a self Reza myself is up there nice guy did you get me one more number you confirm my kill as well didn't you no I didn't you didn't I thought you did know how many - I'm pretty sure he's dead ok yeah he's dead it's team market yeah yeah that's fun thank you sure Oh bud it's the meta growl the meta mp5 every single whatever I'm so bored of it now I'm so bored of it you think they're gonna like adjust the growl cuz they didn't know if the m4 did they and they didn't even know if the RPG because I think they know that people like they've got their selves now can't ruin it for him you know people are like you know people have been grinding to get their certain load outs and now they've finally done it I think they're the site we don't want to ruin it for and the first way my type like my developer and also they're selling the purple tracer back from the ground hour as well and the mp7 so I'm surprised they don't like pump out skins to the most popular guns they definitely do the m4 yeah it's easier money isn't it like if you've got a popular weapon that everyone's talking about everyone's using it's just it's just good business sense to put out a skin for those booms in it let me just dropped in it said here's someone one sec okay hang yeah yeah he's just you know side on me helmet is that they came back so it came back I thought we might whatever the team library yeah you thought he was thought by Jack have a look at my you alright okay okay we gonna make this gas yeah oh look yirou maybe that's always sideways you okay I understand I get it now yeah I get it yeah yes yeah sideways you're right it's someone waiting for us I'm sure that I just saw a sniper Becca Becca pickle yeah I know my friend why they come here because they just they were so brazen they didn't even think but they didn't put a trophy system on what are they thinking yeah these are the guys that's like canceling everywhere would they have made the gulag well I think they have yeah they have made the gulag I think so they're not gonna be able to go back for this stuff no that's gone where are they likely to drop because I want to kill him again side you know probably on the houses up here you know yeah oh that's gonna be out there do you think miss out here yeah yeah I guess that's what we do something like that we need a psychologist what to figure out where they're gonna go yeah so we've assessed that sweaty squad and we believe that they're going to drop here there's a 98% probability their microaggressions show signs of easterly winds you guys yeah so they did make the girl like yeah someone redeploy now I bet you they all redeploy because they'd have any enemies right they're maybe gonna be brought there London in this circle they load up very open-air Bible it is a single soul on this side of the third girl don't like those houses up there we know they're out there oh yeah anyone that isn't is this orange I'm worried I'm thinking it might be someone like a squad round here that to move out mmm I suppose I could just be right down this hill maybe lucky and I'm not saying I don't think anyone did now you still got that ax 50 no I've got sniper now yeah good your age okay [Music] you seen the new message a kit sir it's that no one cares about ghosts anymore it's all about all about taking restock instead Reese I like a restock for solos but then about zeros or trios feel like there's enough likes tons to pick up if you need one yeah well if everyone's using the same loader I guess yeah do I get a that if I should get a sniper as well what do you think like I'm about to drop one now I'll just pick yours alone I drop my mp5 please bees no come on oh there we go I'm glad wait with thank you this game it wanted me to where I get the loadout okay sixteen players there's not a lot of trios there you got a suppressor on this sir yes it does there this is these studies HDR loadout guys there's no one here that is it you know no there's only five tip of the teams left yeah okay well that's not bad behind us in it then there we go in still is it yeah nice job okay so they're fighting on the other side circle there and you imagine the big balls play you just go up the tower you did I tell you why you'd be dead within ten seconds of air I reckon it's worth the risk if you want you know you want the sniper beams there's no way do I don't even see the point again we push over a little bit serious check this guy's body what do we have he had it have a heartbeat sense then I better take it you good Jack there's people fighting down here okay I'm just watching our back right now yes good good find out the edge the edge boys there must be maybe one so I mean I'm in yeah right on me I'm good I'm good yeah we need to spin this blocker thing one three-man team that we need to deal with yeah they've got Snipes down there as well okay if this guy you had no idea I was here we'd have to drop you though the same unfortunately I haven't got a self resume there huh no all right you ain't got all my dudes other beings being a girl well you got a cluster spike or anything no I don't for themes left is gonna be one solo somewhere check our backs wow that's really good for us we can sit on this edge Jack and just we can just watch they come in yeah to come to us jumped a few a home a place a son down again yeah my other self res I'm being beamed there yeah oh you mean uh believe me now pretty good I'm gonna stay here with Zach I moved in hit him where stud where I'm at on orange orange baby sniper I'm holding angle he's at the back of the tent is there another one there son he's got self ready to go for us you hearing him Kill Confirmed Kill Confirmed still two seems like we closed on this place on the clip in the compound in the compound dude one right next to me here hear him he's running he's running oh my god I didn't have it to like I couldn't heal I just had to keep stat like moving back on the edge of the gas oh man well played with you when you lost all your health or the end loved the earth yeah oh man if only that guy hadn't of Yeaton himself off the cliff he would've got a win yeah always had to read them again and that would have sent us in a completely different you know oh man that was all pounding good unfortunately I got into a really awkward situation where the cliff has just gone off and I was just in the middle of a big downhill road yeah this is kind of like pre firing range trim oh good game that was really good yeah tdys using the chat boys most of it still doubt right until the end yeah I think those guys at the end were good players but we just had we just got lucky with the circle we had a good position Endon yeah thank goodness thank good as we took out the the sweaty squad I know yeah hey with the winners easily if I wanted a leaf and a trophy system I think even even I was thinking even milliseconds if they just jumped out of the vehicle half a second before they would notice yeah that isn't fine I'm just gonna read some stuff on stream i up that was sound muted sounds a great game i really enjoyed now I think the kilo actually works out all right there I mean there definitely a couple of situations where I felt like if I had a growler m4 it would have been better maybe but pretty nice during that match we got a ton of new members thank you very much guys where was I oh man em silvus Thank You Minear zdravo Alex Muir TNC again Alex gain the galaxy how do you silver thank you for the hundred grateful and thanks for creating good and fun content no problem buddy Simon quarter became and remember Damien Lachlan probably just butchered your name denied Damien I'm sorry a stiff nasty has a great name Craig Smith you think ecology would use the Unreal Engine one day in place of the id Tech 3 drive stuff I don't know I feel like what they've done with modern warfare is pretty like it feels like a pretty advanced engine now so hopefully they carry on using this engine for the new games and Michael Bruce thank you for the 10 I've been watching you for years and just wanted to give a little back Michael that's very kind thank you Parker greetings from upstate New York what's your thoughts on the SKS in war zone oh man you know what I don't think it's very good so I have to be honest lassy thank you for 50 been watching you a lot lately called to catch one of your streams thank you so much I'm Denmark Dion thank you for the 20 if you want to see the setup on the kilo

McNally oh man you guys are you guys are so good thank you Michael Decker Beauty gaming Sid has Captain Nemo yes garyun yes garrison sorry Brett bosna and Fred power thank you so much welcome guys hopefully we can get another win for you Braden in the chat said start a position to be able to use a pistol when you're down great and that would be so powerful in this game I think maybe maybe if it was a perk or something you know like so you had to give up ghost or something but I if everyone could shoot with the pistol when they downed I'm not sure how that would I don't know if that would be fair Lee Hanson what's up man love you content thank you hey Pedro how you doing from Rio de Janeiro and Brody what's up from a higher sound resumed right where we going Saad which one TV Dave a hookah with a savage who's French cool I'm still waiting on your video called long-range sniper boys Ryan that's a that's an old mean but it checks out but it checks out another cheeky wind Claudio maybe maybe was it tobacco how you doing Daniel what's up TP from Texas how you doing man under them for mysterious is your favorite game to play yeah I think war zone is there's no one landed here okay that's a good good omen yeah also is my favorite game at the moment though right like it's definitely the game I'm playing the most tomorrow I'm gonna be playing battlefield 5 I think cuz there's a new game going past this again with the revolver stud if you do 500 give this up actually Katie's armor so lucky I don't you can give subs on there on YouTube YouTube by killing with the revolver from here right now I'll give you 100 subs alright I tried actually that's 500 gone what's all this stuff who knows this Easter eggs well I got an armored box Jack need it yeah yeah sure using it thank you I'm I made the crucial mistake of not using the plates earlier I needed all five this is all no one air yes word TV stations usually pretty hard as man but I guess cuz so how the plane was maybe the Mets has changed we do we know that we're moving directly trying to play to win now we're the guys that bind Odin there I'll try the Odin eventually a bit you're not giving their go yet no I'll use it as a sniper replacement eventually sniper replacement oh man yeah as opposed to assault rifle otherwise we got no close range right yeah I mean you've got like you got to have an mp5 of close range I think now yeah well I mean the mp7 is you know just as good but I think mp5 decent close range right well yep the max now close range mp5 will always kind of beat the mp7 yeah but the mp7 is got a bit more range yeah then it's like if you're gonna use any so might as well use a ground ground yeah I don't like the fact that the game is is like that now you know it's so predictable and what people are using was a friend just firing oh he is dead how'd you go this visit just into the resin just give oh no he's got you like isn't there yeah he's cocky like is he gonna quit if he uses the goo like please don't please don't I mean there's the team that just killed m1 green are down at the camper buildings on yeah I wish you could set an option to say like if you run over something pick it up automatically like let's say obviously would like field of grades like I don't want to automatically pick up like a shield turret or you know something like that but if it's a

on a EK chillin I mean we were ruin their day if we were in the middle of a field may have two guys the guys were really feeling yeah it ruins it does suppose Oh easy spicy no breeze actually caught you've got one of them yeah but if we land there I mean there's so many different squad cheer Hannah the guy on the roof is cheating as well from blue to just go for the scarf instead still alive I think that's fine I think he's fine different people not unload out okay see someone over here on green hey guy in the roof is he she's my sister so he just jumped off he just jumped off okay there was something shooting someone in green Jax just put another I don't know why don't see anyone there though yeah he was doing someone really far away you got your load up I'm getting it now yeah I've got it let's go today I'll go get mine and then we'll go to the top again I think where's the guy with our money what is he slow down man just see where it landed upside down sideways on the cliff savages I mean we've got no plates nothing we can't even afford place he's going it is Seenu Seenu moving back where is Ystad found him anyone that you're in charge teammate confirmed it this is maybe the guy that was on the roof I'm gonna push down okay I'm seeing if we can get some plates yeah we need place desperately we could buy some there's a shop right here yeah well this guy good we requested I could die my plate he is serious is that not you go nice guy let's go you need a hundred - thank you have you got some now Ethan go we have to move the gas I'm drowning he's dead he's dead he's dead I see they just on his own a weird game listen play out like the other game he was Nobby was he he was born the load-out sound almost that becomes like me turn away from we've gotta move for the gas top of the clip as well I think then we go right there maybe avoid this right I'm not sure where that came from alright I haven't seen a going up there I'm looking I don't like this position at all like it sucks compared people push from the houses yeah I just a sniper shot just rang out over my head when I can't load that it's gotta be someone in this house like surely in these houses behind us serums with those guys now start I'm sorry oh yeah they wait it's the only way it's just a wait or is it gonna be one lonely default skin with meanders out of the house not sprinting Mario Super Mario just oh okay okay have you seen the mandalorian yeah I'm having it though Oh God I know notice it because they did the stupid thing on Disney Plus where they didn't release it straight away yeah there's a guy over there hit one um chewy I'm just feel like this someone appears somewhere they're like well yeah the issue is I've got no plates there's no light so if we get shot it's basic I can drop you a couple here yeah yeah just to thank them I just respawn someone over there this guy's an absolute savage clearly you got a growl as well uh want to see the growling m4 it's a growl white growl yeah I'm not seeing that again this is just a weird one custom maybes on the kilo I imagine obviously I think you're the only one using Aikido in this lovely I'm the only one in any lobby ever at the moment using the Keeler one forward that's how I tell you a joke five gifted subs on YouTube if what if anyone else in the lobby has a kiva okay alright so we have to look at everyone that Mykel base gap that I had bought five subs right if you get a kilo in this level it's such a cool looking like gun though just looks awesome you're like a girl I get just fired after Jimmy one down one down - dad I'm gonna raise you yeah I think this guy's pushy man he's an absolute mad lad pretty Savage I've got plates the more I'm gonna try and push with him and stun yourself rest I guess rest I said he's gonna use the in his class that's peculiar I wonder if you pick that up no I think that's Bobby's boss there's some people in my chat start saying that they use kilo as their maid I don't know man I guess I guess we'll be gifting those fine are there any kilos here no let's have a look yeah ah give me you stare place day boys yeah one oh yeah thank you yeah this is the ghost Kayla you know when you buy the ghost skin what is it is it black and white it's gray and black and it's got um like the UK flag on it I'm just gonna reload and show the stream this guy's doing the odds like cancer so let's go yeah it's a high skill player that's what we call a pro gamer move in the industry I need blaze how do we ask the plates is it just do that yeah what were those guys now the spammers well legend yes I hope this guy gets the sulfur as he deserves it he didn't even buy self-worth dude what a legend look at this absolute boss team player and I give him a thumbs up hey sniper sniper sniper from the near the police station throw the other by over the way looking house yeah he's looking he's looking as switching positions I'm not easy for smart but yeah I mean they could be someone coming from this way with ghost seeking you know yeah yeah let's see where the next zone goes god I don't really want to go across that bridge yeah it's dead you get third pied here all the time as well game they are and I'm at UAV I need them he's on the right side of her name like green market somebody said I know I can just see him on the right boy UAV instead of self reservoir lab it's a Ledge Ashley MATLAB it's an Atlantic phase skin is that right God forgive us and no one's firing either with this duo's what's up Dave are you doing this solos everyone has aphasia it's not what that is it wasn't aphasia your face can't actually have like skins in this game yeah they do is it the the eSports States is that what it is yeah I think so I don't know how it works with all that stuff I didn't even know you get them when are we gonna see snobby skin in green I can't hit him though I've given away a position savages he's going in with doozy he's got one downstairs no one downstairs I'm just watching the back of the compound I've not seen anyone come out well there was three guys here on UAB wasn't there so they moved yeah I got my seat boys back at least Savage is on par yeah is he all right yeah high five five all the fives he's sirness up in damage Jack yes he's got more damage we'll have to put this right way on that terrible ax fifty oh it's got a thermal on it why would you do that I understand that it's cool and everything but it's just not very good for anymore it's not the one I mean might be useful in this zone because so many trees yeah hmm you're better off without let air off with my mp5 the 80s speed on this is so slow a troll bill well I don't think it's at all built because Mike's got stock on it and everything it's got double double zoom scope but it's the thermal one you know I don't see anyone out there in the trees at all and people don't run cold-blooded early so we run along the clip I think there might be people just in these buildings here just waiting just waiting for us yeah we actually there's a heartbeat sensor in there see do we grab it I'll go grab it let's see if we just in case yeah I've not got a flashbang or it's done yeah I'm out get about restock Savage is already in there like I mean I can climb roof before this someone on the roof like there's no one on my heartbeat don't know a hobby stop where is everyone find us 14 people left somewhere we just edged along the edge yeah go up go up we want to be here early no way a fire station surely there's even 550 guaranteed someone up here I don't see anyone in the tower mmm someone just dropped in someone just dropped in over there do you like it who like is the full team all team of Cougars yeah I think because they GU likes closing and all they just haven't had anyone to fight so they've just dropped all right do you think they'd drop back onto their gear yeah maybe so there could be another squad up here then giving this guy an idea of where we're going there was that there are full gulag squad just drop down it move downhill I think yeah I think they're load outs dropped up here that's why they do that this Jeep final they've gone for that final load outs a final form yeah yeah this look this gear here Oh stay shots they taking that full load out dude it's done actually no truly they could maybe this is another team's like that so like having a peek over here you go Bella picot Bella yeah I'm just seeing him in a while not a porno that's the worst kids dig oh there you go truck and age oh they write you down in one down the bush there's no one there got him got him got him that's purple theme why is that truck doing oh man the c4 from here hit it I hit it didn't get it she went shoo shoo sure don't you did full damage at all I disabled it yeah it's gone but the guys out Savage is covering up the covering are right they might be relatively safe I'm looking on hobby I think they won on hobby oh wow if we couldn't be given the circle any more than this really yeah but where I mean where is it I'm kind of worried that people are going to come up the way that we came up you know mmm yeah that's a bad I don't know if they can Jack I'm looking now this is a sheer cliff based on green you don't think they could get up there I'm not sure I don't think so no all right I think they can come up where I am now though probably shot from the right oh you know we've been there's a guy he's a thermal he's quite far away stud die fear my fear me there that was a nice shot there's a no no no that's all right there's one here though you've got to carry us home stop no no I wouldn't this might be someone else Oh Savage we just like cuz now you've got a glint of the hill star did you say that I'm hoping you shoot someone else that's what I'm waiting for all right just weighing is he prone he's ready for you last night fight he doesn't shoot then I'm just ruined sorry I'm sure I've got the zone not get a peek my hearing shoots night back but if I don't then you just got an easy snipe he's moved this is a problem you won't believe me the guy in the truck is the only one I can think that would be like below you were behind you hmm but there's no way yeah you're right he can't get up there okay this is probably the top of the hill was gonna be soaked here every other team still yeah that's a good route I like that would be a guy already looking all players left I mean that's good a lot of Randy teams yeah it's a lot of ones I think yeah pick maybe it's on that tree oh no isn't it ghost that stops you from coming up on the hobby sensor no it's God it's cold-blooded I thought it was ghost that's such a shame dude a mind there's a good attempt yes Savage guy was pretty cool he was all right he was actually trying to play with em fortunately was he was quite quite aggressively Savage hmm you want to try Giro yeah we can D do it you owe it nice pun Jack great another turn wouldn't recommend sound muted OB have I encountered hackers recently Kobe no I haven't actually not seen a hacker all five weeks now I would say obviously they still exist like some people are definitely playing against hackers but I don't think I've come across an obvious hacker yet in the last four or five weeks not as far as I know you know someone blatantly doing it Oh Brett thank you

using but that's you know if you want to win that's how you do it nepal all things being equal would you go for a ten nine hundred K or three nine hundred X for a one PC gaming and streaming that's tricky because I know the the Intel's are still slightly better in most games aren't they but I've heard that the AMD's are really good for streaming and multi-core so I don't know to be honest with you I'd have to look up some benchmarks and max thank you if you do more gunfight videos yeah definitely butterball you sound like Jazza from the YouTube channel ja sir he's the Australian guy that

The Last of Us is one of my favorite games ever just brilliant story brilliant gameplay I'm wait for it silly from South Africa what's up man subscribe today that's very kind you and thank you couple people out but the hele I have got a terrible shop in STAAD that's my life got a sniper in that deer Ecore nade okay well this is my loadout this sniper I wonder if they'll jump in the heavy but you want a headshot if it goes in in the ma yeah I've got like a perfect little lineup yeah same I think they're probably losing though mmm I don't want to be running around hot although really no sucks back off a bit yeah okay wait forever for that I need an AR in left we've got that scavenger yeah it's got that well there's a couple of crates in here start I'm just gonna check if I can find a decent gun yeah got eyes on the helicopter again alright doesn't though they're gonna go for anyway LM jeez man I'll kind of want to like people on top of this building yeah make a decent LNG builder is there a decent LMG in this game Bruin maybe PKM not sure to do some experimenting yeah my scavenger has taken me to this building Jay I know people earn you know people are in there yeah yeah in there on top I'm in tracked okay is it the sea huh no surely they wouldn't be it wouldn't be a bounty out there don't remember where the bounties were oh look just gone to scan right here yeah actually I think I just um just finished that one in there we have enough to get our load up check and you're I mean there is definitely people on top of this building cause I'm the way it was to sort semen oranges love they go mark him you want to go load up I'll hit this guy and the guy just jumped off - as well okay yeah we can get load out roof load up just make sure this guy's not peeking me cash yep good get a UAV maybe as well Oh plates yeah more plates Oh plate and more plates they get just a couple spares oh you know kilometres let's go okay so there was a guy right here that shot plate those are me back what's up Ethan really Thank You ppreciate you being here yeah he was in orange and he was running loose and was dead here right shelter I just feel so fast when I've got the mp5 are like it's so it so like well that's why people do it yeah quicker than like a growl an mp5 are you at max fov as well I use 100 yeah I don't like max because you know I don't like to have to close yeah well I was younger I played with a big referee is that one up there so we're like y'know I think I did see one up there earlier but I haven't seen one since so it's some bases yeah like if I was playing just multiplayer I'd ramp it all the way up to the top so yeah you can't when you're shooting people with iron sights that range you're just like I might you yeah yeah you've got to be sat like really really close to your screen to be able to play with that kind of effort probably you know like huskers does I don't you ever watch Huskers but yeah skills and yes you see a lot the Korean play at the Korean pros like apex and stuff and literally two inches that's great yeah but I guess it is a matter but I think I could get eyestrain yeah I would rather be comfortable than like you absolutely have the best advantage if it was a tornament maybe I'd you know I'd do it but just for casual play like this now no way I mean the action is rolling yeah I don't know what's going on my nose fighting it's definitely that's the difference between Jews and trios less chance to be revived in it so people are scared I mean we've already lost literally 60 players at Rose is just more fun isn't it well yeah it's people to play aggressively which is what I like I mean we could like what we could do is just play duo's but go for bounties and you know just spam bounties in UAV that's literally I'm down for that be a bit more aggressive like no matter what happens yeah just go for anyway I mean unfortunately we're on a mission at the moment so we can't get any bounce maybe just drop off this roof there and see if this mines up here maybe die yeah so I'll just wait ten minutes while you use that even though there's another cable right there I kind of wish that you could go up like two at a time if you like how you never get hit by claymores anymore learns at the beginning of war zone it was literally Claymore central yeah but people have realized you need c4 to count vehicles I said yeah I think I said ana was thirty OD so you don't even do that much damage even if you do hit someone yeah kind of like that though because I mean claymores are just annoying and also yeah yeah it's a good way to counter vehicles you never feel scared against the vehicle if you've got c4 Oh someone's team premiere orange I think you might be started but it's being this guy yeah yeah someday dude he instantly dropped off yeah I'd stop in power as well he just didn't if you do him I think we'd have gotten then yeah I know I couldn't he was I was wasn't sure when he was gonna stray alright missed him again we're just gonna get it okay gun might be below us now right here let's see Matt think an orange thing someone's just cool down load up aim you still shooting over there surprise yeah they're on the shop I think they're fighting on the shop can we get a better angle I mean we could just go rush it yeah yeah you stayed low yeah they just respawn stunning yeah all right he's cracked his crack stud right here he's gonna finish his solo dude the building [Music] how did you know I had stopped in paradigms as well right he's gonna come with his mate okay that's mate good did you kill him yeah I got with him well fight nothing of what his mate was doing it with maybe his mate just guys he ever he was stunned as well like annoyingly perfectly in a spot where I couldn't consider myself yeah and the second I time move around to see him he moved up yeah I've got 10k I reckon one of these got the other guy might be like alright I've got two rounds of July 5 so just if you can just chill there yeah yeah maybe actually I might buy am i buy a UAV and I understood that up like who's gonna sit here and chill Sydney thank you for this and shout out to Jennifer best warzone player Sokka is it the crab from Bob no I wish was a guiding head of me over it nice job and you've got a little bit of time but the zone is moving right now can I get that load out or shall I you can but I've got UAV on yeah I'm runnin on UV yeah I didn't want to use my mp5 then because I had to stop in power arms that's the only reason realistically maybe I shouldn't use might be 5/8 as well or anything really I just thought you know cuz this is all about testing the killer one for one I want to use it as much as possible from on you you have any spare blades yoni spare players up yeah thank you then we can buy some more see we can bury get sell Francis no no right orange it off you get one okay let me just see if well boy yeah boy and then we'll see if we can find one I might want to get my ghost laid out as well just cuz why not on the edge of the gas you got any spare AR I could rub yeah yeah you gonna make that yeah yeah okay yeah yeah I didn't resin was already moving there were any need ghosts although I definitely did last round which is that right and once texted me what does they want I already use this I already use the hammer and what can you know get back to it even later no just once so am i playing I'm just gonna grab this ice to drop my erm Oh jack we've named it that I didn't Rob give us some more um if you've got another mag yeah thank you I just didn't drop my ammo and then go onto the ammo is that was already fine eighty percent ball mp5 versus mp7 j xk a close-range roof mp5 wins annoyingly on that roof because we won't be able to see them medium to long range mp7 woods won't push it how do we get up there we can't unless we've got one ladder on the inside just some ladders on the inside yeah there's good you might just you might be lucky enough to sneak by Mandor do it I mean the ground if I die I'm sorry found one outside here Jack one kill one team a different team completely okay roof is clear now okay the one guy finished my kill over here and orange Jack ed him get it him you got him dead did you yeah yeah I got it Oh someone slapping me from behind fire station named him where Rosie in the in the big doors okay have a sniper we might go up to the tower now I'll see about you there in the side window now first war yeah if you want to get yourself read so I like drop your money on the shop at you on yeah is it safe down there yes they've done it now all right coming up in the money in the shop oh let me put my shoe it didn't come come come come come because in case you got sniper so that guys watching through thank you horrible bug manners yeah it's like if you're too close to the building it doesn't let you do it yeah that's good almost at all yeah I could buy some place as well actually nrcon got place their plate there I think this guy might be heading towards us now alright I'm a good weave like not look for a while see where he's gone then see him in the windows you have to move anyway let's go pick the brand that was perfect around distance there okay medium range range yeah you just got brand f to pay respects this guy's surely bill he's not gonna let us get out of here alive oh thank you stud these are so low I'm just going to put a c4 on this just in case I like it and if you mark it I think you you can see when it moves good to see it go red at the edge of your screen yeah I don't want to be in the open air no and wishes that run along there as you did myself of the Ruger well the C fulstone Navy's in the gas I don't know mmm I don't know just the Vic was the grade in the gasser they do the helicopters do it as vehicles there come on go for it go for it come on too much fun getting an attack robot I know blow up anyway did you okay the sporting thing disappear yeah well I just I didn't rather did but it's a that fella Susie doctor Scottie I'm not used to using open area I mean I've condition here the bird surfing and it's peaceful now I mean that was that was a nice that old you know think of kills there yeah but now it's that other yet orange yeah I'm going this hour ago sorry okay I don't have a sniper so you kind of on your own Asami yeah I don't get plates cuz you can play up before you got behind that rock so I probably see you're having cases someone on the right Dan one blue stud okay do we want to push the blue guys cuz they're actually the resin over the road we have the tree covered too and they're just on that rock now yeah hit him it ghost character yeah I can't see down that guy up on the blue it's two more on blue team or on blue look I think one thing II like ones Aggie lagging I think these guys over the river might push this though what do you want to push it do you want to get a high ground or should we stay no I think you're right they've bacon see you though jet we can see you from orange all right be careful it having a big fire his stud get the guys that are injured thing behind the rock with a sniper it's a much go action stopping power rounds up to the right oh yeah just seen him jack I've just seen him a bit just seen him he was running right I feel like we should just keep going left and flying can get behind him back looking down on me he saw me I'm his mate might look real can you move your pink yep sorry I'm a broke down - one down one down nice now I'm worried that there's someone out there and get round can we get round yeah we can but someone here another team is definitely more yeah in the building green building up ahead sod oh man we're making a lot of noise in this law schools around you want to go over here yeah I'd rather disengage I think you told you don't want to fight these guys ahead of us there a blue maybe I don't know where they've gone daddy hard listen to me so now yeah nice nice nice one dad there's someone green minuses are you think we should have earth stayed more over there no no is good there they're moving stud I've not seen us there they've

residency scores are pretty good I kiss need my my study see I need me most under the sea for now I'll get into a fight later and I'll need it yeah so I'm thinking I was using our move I'm on the roof

about four seconds go on go on go on gone that's what you said to drop my weapon yeah are they gonna push me out have you got a sniper round once you keep Ram yeah and start winning this round what do you think guys oh I can hear them okay jeez grouses oh they're beyond the heart beat as well that's a nice try yeah slow fast slow fast I mean the guy's got 14 kills he's obviously a good player hmm

but by it sound muted right that was fun bit tricky then there wouldn't have any plates I had position on us well played soon all right boys and girls thank you for watching so just to show you guys because I know some people asked like what I was using there I did show it at the start but on the kilo this is what I've got it set up like you want to screen shut out and take a look it's okay I mean it's obviously not an m4 it's not a growl but it's something a bit different and I'm kind of just getting tired of using the same weapons all designed but if you want to be competitive and win at the moment you have to use a growler and m4 is your primary I think you do anyway and someone asked also what my mp5 build is oh yeah lots of mobility I ran a fire up close good hip fire do a lot of damage with that good serve anyways I'm just gonna wrap up and say thanks to everyone that became a new member and thanks you know for for watching appreciate you guys d Kent thank you for the eight
