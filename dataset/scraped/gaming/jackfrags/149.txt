today we're jumping back on 2042 thought we'd come back i did take a day off yesterday just had a personal day for myself no video a lot of people were like why don't you post today because i've been doing daily videos i think like the entirety of december took a day to just chill instead really but today we're going to be rocking the k30 or the vector playing as mckay now a lot you guys said that you really enjoyed the 2042 gameplay video i did last week yeah rather than a long live stream oh my god there's a lot of people here it's just more like oh my god there's so many dead more like a typical gameplay commentary you know highlights that kind of thing so we'll be doing more of this for sure and there's a couple things i wanted to talk about i can see that go through the wall it's right there yeah a few things have popped up in the community and just general stuff that i thought has been interesting we'll find the e down weren't we in sport no can't spawn a mackay come here instead is there an entrance there no i thought that might have been a window or something how did i not die then yeah i saw a little clip on reddit about attachments in the game and apparently if you spawn in and then change any attachment like your scope or whatever it reduces the amount of vertical recoil on some of your weapons which is interesting i did see a video of it so i think it's real but i need to just do a bit of testing on it myself first we still haven't had any updates either from daiso ea about like the future for this game they did post a image on twitter earlier down here somewhere isn't it i hate these anti-freeze things right so annoying yeah they posted an image i'll put it up on the screen get a concept art i've been surrounded everyone's running armor man it's so annoying i didn't recognize that level i don't know what that's from so they could be teasing some dlc stuff there maybe a new map or something but i think the reason they haven't really said anything is because they're still on vacation i need to change ammo types here run out shot in the back yeah i reckon it might be next week i thought it was going to be this week but nothing yet might be something tomorrow thursday sometimes they do updates on thursdays if not hopefully next week it's a really exciting week for me anyway this because uh they have ces in las vegas which is the consumer electronics show should i go for the could take the tub tuck i'm gonna drive the tuk tuk and see if i can recreate the trailer yeah they've got the uh electronic show at the moment there's always big announcements like we've already had some stuff from intel amd nvidia just announced a 30-90 ti which looked massive okay well that's uh that's heated into the ocean there's no coming back from that okay so it wasn't quite like the trailer it'll do good launch i reckon that's at least uh eight out of ten yeah i also saw this um electronic car from bmw you guys seen clips of this today it's called the all electric ix or nine i suppose and it changes color there's a couple of clips of it on social media and it starts out as dark gray almost black and then it changes color to white they didn't reveal what is that i don't know they didn't really reveal the technology behind it i've got the wrong mag in here don't i there we go yeah they didn't reveal the technology behind it but the guy just pushes a button and it changes color it's sick there is another tuk-tuk here i try and recreate the trailer again all i could think of without car was is this ever going to be road legal because in the uk at least i assume it's like this in other countries when you buy a vehicle and you register it you have to say what color it is and you have to say like what the engine is what the license plate is etc oh no oh we got sucked in anyway it killed me that time just exploded me must have been hit by a lightning strike so if you could change the color of the vehicle how's that gonna work and people in the comments were like oh this would be like the perfect car for a bank robbery you go in the car you turn up it's red and then you leave the bank press the button car turn interesting idea anyway oh mother nature's bringing the heat be pretty op in grand theft auto too if they ever release grand theft auto 6 and it's modern day you'll be damn sure there's some kind of upgrade that you can get for your car where you can change the color of it i like to call both elevators here because even if just one person goes up you can send both up at the same time is he gonna get in the other one no okay you got that one i'll get this one you got the music on yeah so hopefully if someone's camping this they've got two targets now that's a friendly problem one person on the point okay good i was expecting more of a fight here that lightning strike the different kind of tornado isn't it than on the other maps go back to e and what about this tank here i do have c5 i get right on top of it is that it yes you think i was going to get that tank usually when i tried that it doesn't work so ow stop it am i not in cover there come on that's a wildcat always dice to those things i wanted to give you guys an update on my crashes as well i think i fixed it but well someone else has helped me fix it that's way too many people than i thought was there so there's a member of my discord called bsardgaming who actually hit me up i was like you know i think i know what this is and uh they you know they showed me how to properly configure msi afterburner for like voltages and clock speeds and everything and i've just been testing some um like under clocks and changing the voltages a little bit and i seem to be good like i haven't crashed for a couple days now in 2042 so i'm happy with that look at this thing what the hell is that a taxi what how can i drive that thing around i'm losing this point here i'll keep fine over anyway on the top mr freeze is around did anyone ask for those i reckon you could only kill my two maybe three people max with this mag they've got armor under control i suppose it depends on if you're hitting those headshots though doesn't it clear here now i can't hear the vehicle the bolt oh two balti's why they're shooting at each other now get these what are they doing look down transport north west what he just heated into the water and then bounced out like mario okay so 2c5 will actually take that out the other guy died there's my remaining c5 hello enemy tuk-tuk what are you doing absolutely mad lad change my ammo again what is going on hovercraft no c5 our troops are engaging at charlie i've been assaulted by oh my god you've got the toe launcher it's not very good it's fine you can use that yeah we can do a bit of damage before the round ends like that's irish why does he just suddenly sound like that doesn't make any sense that was my kill both factors are now under our control coming over this way yes this gun is nuts isn't it please yes one more there i'm around the corner there come on again that's the second time hey 2018 tickets nice chill game this or as far as they call it i just can't i can't do it [Music] didn't feel like there was 40 in it apparently there was i forgot to ask would you guys be interested in watching me stream the halo infinite campaign i was supposed to mention that but i uh i
