i just want to say that before we get into this that none of these images are hacked or stolen or leaked or anything like that they all come from official sources from the battlefield 2042 digital art book which i recently took a look at and also on portfolio websites where artists have uploaded their work and it's all directly from dice ea criterion ripple effect etc so today we're taking a look at some concept art and exploration for battlefield 2042 i think a lot of it shows that the vibe of the game could have turned out completely different to what we actually got and there's some really cool stuff in here regarding characters some that we haven't seen yet some that were different and changed but also the levels in particular that i want to focus on because it shows how gritty and authentic feeling this game actually was in the concept and exploration stage compared to what we got when the game released which is a very sterile clean looking feel to a lot of the levels now dice have said recently in a blog that they are going back onto some of those levels and adding cover perhaps making them look a bit more war-torn than they were so i'm looking forward to seeing what those results are but in the meantime we can look back at this stuff before the game released that was being worked on and see exactly how things changed so kicking things off we're looking at the classes now this does make me wonder was there ever a point where specialists weren't part of the game and i could be completely wrong with that because we do have the ai soldiers and they are split into classes if you take a look at them carefully you can see the individual classes but here's a decent look at the us and russian classes they look pretty badass to be honest not too futuristic and retaining a lot of that modern look a more up close version of the us assault i would presume here and maybe that's the engineer or support and then perhaps a different version of the assault looks like they've got some kind of launcher there or maybe that's an early iteration of the grapple hook and this here is an early concept for and this is absolutely badass i love this and i kind of wish seeing this that they'd have gone with this look for falc instead so she's still got the blue gloves down here and she's still got the surrep pistol although the final look of it is different to that reminds me of ripley from alien 3 if any of you guys have seen that and there's another look at it here absolutely love this design there's a much younger version of falcao with the long black hair even that one looks a bit younger but overall quite contrasting to what she actually looks like in the final game which is older with the gray hair now moving on this is early concept and expiration for boris believe it or not and the turret looks very different here on the backpack reminds me of one of the characters in iron man but i don't remember the name and here's another version that looks a lot closer to what we ended up getting in the game albeit with a different face now moving on this one's quite interesting because i wasn't sure about some of these characters so i thought that these guys here that could be an early version of casper this here though i've got no idea whether that's a upcoming seasonal character or it could be route if they were going for like a watchdogs hakka vibe but i'm not really into this but then also this female character here now this one i think is really interesting because there's no characters like this in the game at the moment and if we take a closer look at that i do think this could end up being a future specialist in the game and next up is pake and again looks a lot younger here different face perhaps a bit more of a stoic stance there as well i'm kind of into that more of a detailed look at the visor here and separate uniforms i think that's the legendary uniform for pake anyway but the face definitely changed quite a lot from the concept exploration to launch and this isn't unusual it's common in games that stuff like this is just put together a lot of it is thrown away they take inspiration from a lot of it and some of it ends up being exactly like it was in the game now we're moving on to a look at some of the levels here and this is what i was talking about with the grittiness of everything so you can see there's a soldier at the forefront here i think maybe this is an upcoming specialist as well or an earlier version of one and this i believe is hourglass when the sandstorm rolls in and it just has a completely different feel and vibe to what the actual map looks like and this is on hourglass again because we can see the big skyscrapers in the background there with the led lighting a jet in front of it this was interesting to me it's that same specialist and it looks like they've got some kind of remote control bomb like an rcxd from black ops cold war that kind of thing so that could be an upcoming specialist too hourglass again here and what i wanted to show here was just how chaotic this seems the tornado in the game in the final version of the game there's no doubt for me that it's visually impressive it changes the look and feel of the map the weather but as you can see here it is picking up a lot of debris it's picking up cars and absolutely destroying the level but in reality in the game it doesn't pick anything up and it doesn't leave anything in its wake it doesn't change the level and i remember in the beta it did actually pick up cargo containers because i was playing on orbital parachuting above it and i could see them flying around and there were old dev stories about containers being picked up and then thrown onto snipers on hills that just doesn't happen in the final game at all and i think that's a bit of a shame now this one i'm not sure what level this is could be upcoming it potentially could be the south korean level kaleidoscope but there's a huge wave of tsunami coming in here drowning these buildings a giant container ship just being knocked aside by the force of these waves and this could have been at one point some kind of revolution or weather event that didn't get put into the final version of the game or maybe upcoming future we could see a map that ends up like this and introduces naval warfare to the game next up i think this is kaleidoscope because we've got the thing here that falls off the building and just take this in for a second look at it it looks like a war-torn location doesn't it it looks gritty the weather effects the fire in the buildings here and kaleidoscope in reality is nothing like this this to me looks like a battlefield game and dice as i mentioned did say that they're going to focus on kaleidoscope first to change that maybe it'll end up looking like this this i believe is manifest and i just love the whole vibe of this we've got some ai soldiers or the original classes here we've got boris here firing some kind of launcher a tank and rao in the foreground but again it just has that gritty feel to it onto breakaway it would appear that there is an avalanche here perhaps one of the large ice shelves cracks off and it can damage you could have been abandoned maybe we'll see that down the line and this i think is renewal inside one of the tech buildings and what i loved about this was the atmosphere of it and the lighting everything's turned to red and we've got these smoke things coming down from the ceiling now these are in the game these smoke things but they just add like a really horrible cryo freeze effect to your screen and they're really annoying whereas it would seem that maybe in the past this just filled the room with smoke and you got this epic chaotic situation in a close quarters environment you may have seen this one before but i think this is gorgeous love it so much the reflections the water not sure what level that might be and this one i think could be kaleidoscope again and maybe that plan to have the tsunami washing the boats up on shore debris everywhere really cool image here from hourglass i want to say and i don't know what sniper rifle this is but i don't think that's in the game look at the scope on that thing it's absolutely massive but the vibe of it again don't really get those kind of feels while you're playing renewal here we've got the class looking sold just here just feels cool loads of debris on the ground beautiful reflections this is probably my favorite though and i'm assuming this is an area of kaleidoscope but there are these huge satellite dishes an almost swamp-like area down here too you can see that the soldiers are knee-high waiting i suppose in this area and of course we've got the doggo there living the dream this one here i wanted to show you guys because you can tell that it's kaleidoscope based on the overall look of it the layout but the building in the middle here is completely different so are some parts here and the color scheme is completely different to what we have in the final version of the game reminds me of the alpha bf3 colors in a lot of ways discarded here just looks messed up doesn't it the amount of stuff on the ground the barrels seems like there's more machinery obviously we've got the cranes going up here which that's how they look in the game just has a more rustic chaotic feel to it and this could be orbital maybe at some point there was some kind of fire tornado because we've got what looks like the tornado here or the bottom of it and then a lightning strike now in the game you do get lightning strikes in the tornado and they can actually kill you if you're unlucky but it appears that it set the ground on fire here so maybe at one point in the past or in the future that was a mechanic where fires could start burning and engulf parts of the level just giving it that more war torn feel and wrapping things up there's a few images here that i wanted to show you of character exploration and also just some of the details in the items and gadgets weapons that you can find angel overall design i think pretty similar to what we ended up with although he looks very different here with the shaved head much more colorful as well kind of glad that they stuck with this color scheme instead of going for these highlights and it would appear that the doggo remained mostly the same although there are some subtle differences there's a black skin that you can get that's in the game as well i think that was from the ultimate edition so you can actually change the skin on your robo dog and then if you guys knew that and this one here looks a lot like the boston dynamic dog doesn't it not sure what map this is though so that could be a dlc map coming up doesn't look like breakaway because i don't think that's snow so watch out for that one look at mckay here remain pretty similar by the looks of it grapple hook looks the same as it is in the game and i think most of these skins are actually in the game as well obviously his face changed but i think this is just a model that they've used to put the clothes on and explore what that might look like ralph face definitely looks a bit more grizzled a bit harder than the version that we get in the game and also look up here that just reminds me of death stranding the beacon that he has used to have three prongs on it but in the final game it's much more like this with that round top and this and this costume down here looks kind of badass i've not seen that before it kind of looks like robocop or something a look here at the spawn beacon the soft flam interesting thing here is that in the game the soft lamb is handheld and you can move it around but there is a version of it here where it's on a stationary pole maybe a new gadget maybe they just decided to make it handheld in the end hover drone looks a bit different there too motion sensor looks the same also i wanted to mention the exodus cinematic do you remember this was released last summer i think and had irish in it and pack and it's just a very dark gritty real version of the game that's painted there and it's quite the contrast to what we actually got in the game when it finally released and that's it i mean there are some other ones in here too but it's a really interesting look into the concept phase and where the goal posts were compared to what we actually got to but again plans change things change and concept art is there for a reason to explore but at the same time it is used as a vision for where you want to be perhaps that grittier warthorn look would have worked a lot better here but that's it let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys thank you for watching hope you
