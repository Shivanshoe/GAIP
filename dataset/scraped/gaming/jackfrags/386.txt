the reign of the ffar and the orc in call of duty warzone may be over it might be it might just be we've not played a real game yet but a couple minutes ago raven released a patch for the game with more balance changes and we're going to take a look at the patch notes now a couple of really big things in here let's see for some reason they call the org the cold war tactical rifle charlie who says that just call it the org recall strength increased burst weapons ride a fine line between inefficient and oppressive the intent of this change is to maintain the weapons identity of being a powerhouse while making it a bit more difficult to wield right now we feel it is too easy to stay on target given how lethal it is we will continue to monitor the performance of the tactical rifle charlie and make additional changes if necessary so short version increase to the base recall of the weapon we'll take a look at how that actually translates to in-game in just a second because the second point ffar they didn't call this a weird name they just went with the ffar ads speed has been decreased that is actually enough but when i read adsb decreased in my head my english brain goes okay so it's quicker but it isn't they've actually made it slower like to me that should say adsb has been increased but whatever they've made it slower to aim down the site with the ffar the ffar is a jack-of-all-trades it has the damage profile and range of an ar as well as the fire rate of an smg the ffar's wholesale efficacy has it edging out smgs at ranges we're not satisfied with ideally the ffar fulfills the role of a mid-range dominator while falling prey to weapons that excel in short-range engagements we are bringing the ffar a bit more in line with what you might expect from an ar damage and range at the cost of handling there's some other changes to attachments here like changing the grips they fixed the bug with the grosser barrel where if you pick the mil spec it would bypass the damage fall off so the groza isn't going to be quite as good as it was things called bugs with sights and then they fixed the book with the salvo fast mag where the ffa and the m16 were not having their ads be decreased and then also something about the pellington i don't care about that stuff what i care about is the org and the ffarnot we're going to take a look at the ffar first because i think this may shift the meta a little bit but i still don't know if it's enough and i'll explain why in a second so as you can see they want the ffar to be in a position where it isn't beating smgs and this is what the ads speed looks like at the moment this is after the nerf definitely feels and looks a lot slower doesn't it and then you compare it to a mach 10 and you can see there's quite a big difference there right like a mac 10 in close range if you radius first should beat the ffar now which i think is a good place to be so that's definitely slower and that will have a big impact but of course if you're already ads or if you build a hipfire build and start shooting from the hip you've still got the same damage profile so i do think that maybe they should look at the damage of this gun as well and also the mobility that you have with it when you're shooting when you actually aim down the sight it's just crazy mobility and you can always improve that ads speed by putting one of the grips on the speed grip or the airborne elastic wrap now i'm just being speculative here because i haven't actually played a real game of wars warzone since this patch because it's literally just come out so i don't want to say that it's not enough but it's definitely enough will it change the meta i don't know i think a lot of people will still run this we'll have to see the org if you just fire it at a wall it definitely looks like the recoil's increased a little bit you see it bouncing up there quite a lot but i'm not controlling the recoil there but as soon as you actually control the recoil you pull down on the mouse and you can still spam it like crazy and get a really accurate burst yeah at longer ranges it will be way more difficult to take people out but close to mid-range i still think the org is going to be super op as well as the m16 i think a lot of people would just revert to the m16 now they've given a bit more recall on the org although it is a lot easier to do this with a mouse than it is with an analog stick so i think the org might be a bit more difficult to use on controller but the m16 i think is untouched apart from those magazine changes so you're gonna see a lot more people falling back to the m16 again but again with the org in the m16 i think it's about damage and rate of fire i don't think it's necessarily about recoil and abs speed i just think their damage profiles are way too high but again i haven't tested this yet in a real match just my thoughts and opinions based on looking at the stuff that they've changed so we'll have to wait and see how that goes but i'm happy about this because when they did the patch last week they did some changes but i mean the initial reaction like that said everything didn't it like it wasn't enough and i've played a few matches since that patch last week it was exactly the same like it felt the same to me everyone was still running those two guns but these changes could actually make a little bit of a difference will it be enough i personally don't think so but at least raven has been quite responsive and done this quickly yeah we've had the easter weekend people were probably off work but they've come back today on a tuesday put this patch out put this balance out there and we have to see how this feels within a week or so in general though i do wish that raven would be a lot more proactive with actually balancing the game because it just feels like the org and the ffar have dominated the game for weeks and weeks and weeks and there's just been no variety and the time to kill is so fast and it's been like this for too long if you play it regularly if you play as much as i do or some of my friends or just people who like playing the game that's all it's been for weeks and weeks and weeks and that's definitely putting the casual players off because these are cold war guns remember and if you haven't got cold war it will take you ages to level up these guns to get the attachments to make them competitive so those people will just stop playing but if raven were actually more reactive with this and addressed the balance concerns quickly and explained to the community what was going on what they were changing i think the game would be in a much better state more regularly now then moving on i thought i'd show you this because i haven't experienced this myself but a couple days ago this started happening to some people's games and it's obviously a build up to the room and new map that's coming out a lot of people think it's going to be on the 21st or the 22nd and i'll show you why in a second so this footage is from geeky pastimes who is another content creator on youtube and twitch and in his game there were missiles flying overhead and radio comes going off you could hear people talking some people talking in russian missiles flying everywhere overhead and also like a warning ticket at the bottom of the screen so they're doing these in-game events like i said hasn't happened to me yet seems like it is a rare thing but some people are experiencing this and also early this morning if you're signed up to the call of duty newsletter you would have got this email and it's a little note on the board about the zombie problem getting worse in war zone and then it says that they're relocating to superstore and there's a little note on the floor here an order number with the date on it 21st of april 2021 so could be that that's the date we get the new map so i'm really looking forward to that and the zombies are moving to superstore some content creators were sent a load of superstore stuff today so it's obviously leading up to that and i reckon that'll be thursday that that changes in the zombies continue the pub crawl hit up superstore so superstore will be a particularly spicy drop once again i've noticed that it's not really that chaotic anymore people have learned the game and they go to other areas now but i reckon when the zombie thing is there it's gonna get mental i don't know how this is gonna end but hopefully it's with the bang i can't wait to find out with that said that's about all for today guys i hope you enjoyed this one if you've played with the new organ ffar what are your thoughts on it so far do you think it's enough not enough how are you feeling about it let
