finally for the second time the dmr has been nerfed and this time it's actually done something the first nerf er wasn't really enough this one definitely is so a couple hours ago an update went live for cod warzone and on the dmr they've reduced the bullet penetration from sniper to assault rifle i can't believe it was set to sniper but it was so that's where it should be now they've decreased the damage falloff ranges so you're going to do less damage at range they've increased the recoil and they've adjusted the damage multipliers there's also a couple other changes in the patch like they've nerfed the type 63 a bit the diamattis they've also fixed the stim tactical glitch too thank you as for the dmr we tested a little bit earlier and while it's still a good gun at long range after the recent patch you will definitely notice that horizontal recoil so you can't spam it as much it bounces around a lot more you got to take a break every now and again and you'll notice that damage drop off too so whilst it's still quite effective at medium range at long range it gets beat by bolt action sniper rifles bolt action snipers are back and we played a couple games earlier after the patch to test things and just see how it feels now i'm not using the dmr in these two matches because quite frankly i'm sick of it i never want to see a dmr again but of course there were still people in the lobbies that we were playing in using the dmr to test it or maybe they just didn't realize it had been nerfed and immediately you could notice a difference because now you're not getting instantly melted by it as you cross cover to cover and at longer ranges you can beat dmr users now with other guns most notably like i said with the bolt action sniper rifles and it is so satisfying to use a bolt action sniper again in this game on this occasion the lw3 some of the long-range headshots that i was getting in this match really good fun and i coupled it in these games with the ffar or the far i don't know what to call that gun it's a bit weird but i do think that with the dmr nerf the far the galil perhaps even the stoner and the m4 will start to creep into the meta a bit more it's gonna be really interesting now either way but this nerf has definitely made a difference i can tell you that gun's still good and i think it will still be meta for certain people depending on their play style at close to medium range it can still be really strong and i've got a feeling that for pc players it will still be a top choice because it's easier to control recoil with a mouse for console players maybe not so much bit more difficult to manage for me though i think it still needs a slight rate of fire decrease that's one of the biggest problems with it just the rate that you can spam it but we'll see if there are any future changes also they've fixed the overpowered mach 10 blueprint that did 10 more damage than the standard mach 10. so that's good mach 10 though still really viable so people will be running it still as their secondary i want to do a bit of experimentation though with the cold war mp5 i think that's got a real opportunity to push itself up into the meta but we will have to see with that said i've got two games here today with tactical brick westy and study having a blast post patch hopefully you'll notice the difference in these games and we're just a lot happier in general now that the dmr has been nerfed it's good times good patch as always thank you to these guys using my cod supported creator code in the store jack frags in all caps if you
