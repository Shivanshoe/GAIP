check this out hdr that's the build this baby right here the cover shot reticle this is the reason that my sniping has improved so much recently this one's okay that one's okay some people like default forget all these but this one the cover shot amazing really clean side picture it's the best of the bunch look at it perfect what else do you need it is a bit of a grind to unlock it but it's totally worth it and you can use it on other sniper rifles too but you have to get like 150 mounted kills and then 200 kills with a sniper scope and then 50 headshots with a variable zoom scope so it does take a while to get it i did it all in ground war in modern warfare easiest place for me to do it but once you unlock it oh you can get some nice headshots with this and that's what you're going to see today two really fun games with tomographic and aculite the legends we're having a laugh having a blast and focusing up when we needed to i think you guys will enjoy this if you do like it
