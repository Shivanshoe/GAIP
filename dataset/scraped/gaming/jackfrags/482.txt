hi guys and welcome to some bf5 live gameplay commentary today we are playing pacific storm really enjoyed this map got the m1907 here so hopefully we can get some nice assault gameplay on the go and take out the tanks what is is there a dragon yeah this is dragon it's always a dragon i'm getting away from there just trying to do the intro to my video dude please chill but there's a couple of discussion points that i wanted to talk about today in the battlefield community over the last few weeks there's been a lot of discussion about what the next game will be and i've seen all kinds of posts popping up on reddit not just the battlefield reddit though but the gaming reddit you know those kind of forums where people claim they've got info about the next game and they go into great detail about what it is and some of these posts they sound really believable and you think oh actually yeah that sounds kind of cool i'd like that but you have to keep in mind that most of the time this stuff is made up so don't read too much into it and i've seen a couple youtube channels as well where they claim that this stuff is gospel and 100 confirmed but the reality is though we don't know anything yet someone firing get me there there's a guy here the only things that we know about the next game really are what they've said in the investors calls in the ea investors course and that's typically been it's a really big scale like we've never seen before we've got a couple clips as well with some destruction of course and a deuce face that's it that's literally it but interestingly laura miele she is the chief studios officer at ea she was on the game awards you know jeff keeley does the game awards last week they did a live stream and she was there speaking to jeff and they did an interview and they were talking about next-gen consoles i don't know off the top of my head what she said word for word like verbatim i can't remember but if i were to summarize it you know it was just like oh that guy's dead so the next gen consoles are awesome in terms of the power and of course we're gonna have great graphics ray tracing audio that kind of stuff but then she went on to say one of the best things about these new consoles is that they're enabling innovation and then she went on to say the dice are building the next battlefield game we know that the whole studio is working on it yeah snaking the grass right there but also that it's got scale that we've never seen before we've heard that one already and then she said that it's blowing them away that's it that's all we got we got a scale like we've never seen before dice are working on the game they're playing the game and that's it that's literally it and that's everything that we know so if you put that together with what's been said previously obviously the next game is going to be a lot bigger there'll be some innovation there and who knows what that is right like we simply don't know that tank hopefully have you not seen me am i really gonna get away with this yeah i am although i didn't get shot by someone with a k7 taking out tanks important though but that's it that's all we know it's big there's innovation the scale that we've never seen before that's it so all of these uh leaks and posts that you're seeing on reddit and 4chan and most likely not true i mean i've fallen for it in the past as well if you guys remember when was it it was i think it was like march april last year when they were talking about the playstation 5 and sony had announced it but no one knew the specs of it and there was just this random post on i think it was recessor on the gaming forum and someone came along and went these are the specs in the new playstation and here are some of the games that are going to be launch titles for it that was it that was the post what was really interesting about that is the the specs of it were correct so that person obviously had some information about the specs of the the playstation 5 because when they were finally announced i think it was a gdc in march last year it lined up with this post and then we all looked at that post and went oh okay well the post also said that these are the launch games and there was a little battlefield bad company three on there and that gave that league some credibility all right so maybe this maybe there's some truth to this maybe bad company three is going to be a launch game it wasn't obviously we know that so what i think happened there is that someone did have some legit information about the ps5 specs but either they've just added on some games that they'd like to see as launch titles and claimed it as gospel or someone else has taken the post and just added that information it's bad company three not a launch title it's not been announced we don't know anything about it so even the ones that look legitimate sometimes they're just not true i don't know if i can take out two things no i can't so if you see that kind of stuff don't read into it too much that's all i'm saying wait until there's some kind of reveal or announcement because up until then there's going to be a lot of people just making stuff up so be careful that's all take everything with a pinch of salt think for yourselves yeah it's okay to get excited of course but most of the time it's probably just made up look at these little guys up here crawling i'm gonna be ruined here honor can i even get out of this situation i don't know i can't get an angle there yeah i feel like someone else should take this tank because i'm not very good at it i'm good at this though shooting people just not tanks yeah so that's really it i mean i what i might do i might put the clip of laura miele saying what she said in just so you guys have context if you haven't seen it because it was a bit out of the blue i don't know if anyone was expecting there to be some kind of battlefield information in that stream with jeff kelly but there was a little bit and i haven't reported on it because it it didn't really add anything to what we already knew not to mention the things such as the scale of games we're playing um the dice team is actually playing at the next battlefield it is at a scale and size that they have we have never seen before and so it is just it's it's blowing our teams away about what is possible um and it's it's incredibly exciting you know i'm seeing this other stuff propping up with like fake easter eggs and rooney text that's not even in the game it's literally just made up i've had people message me on twitter and discord going jack have you seen this this confirms what the next battlefield isn't it's gonna have single player it it's set in world war three it's literally just made up it's all made up though don't believe it there's more tanks there there's captain bird's eye i did buy captain bird's eye but i'm not really played as him yet maybe i should give captain bird's eye a bit of a time to shine on the battlefield i'm getting away from there there's a lot of dead teammates here it's that d point though isn't it like it's always a high for tanks on this map maybe sneaky beaky here or am i gonna get spotted i feel like there's someone behind me oh you see that lightning strike that was sick i keep mistaking rain and wind for people running around i'm out of ammo you get a dynamite there oh oh that was close are we all gonna say at this point now which is good excellent thank you very much see other people much better in tanks than i am like this guy here john no look pro tanker for sure but anyways yeah i thought that i'd open up the floor for the comment section and say you know what would you what would you want to see in the next game because people always ask me like what do you want to say and if you watch any of my live streams or any of my previous videos you pretty much get what i want you know for the next game but in terms of the community you guys like what do you want to say let me know in the comments below what are the top what are the top three things that the next battlefield has to get right i can't go anywhere near that tank just flaming everyone top three let's let's do it like that because that way it'll be a bit more digestible and we'll be able to have more of a discussion can i get this i think so come on tank there we go look at this animation boom i know you want me oh we're getting close we are getting close ah planes on it we've already got 20 tickets left this was a fun little game though wasn't it plenty of action i think i talked about everything i wanted to as well this thing is just a bullet hose i don't know if this is better than the m2 carbine though not sure which one's got better stats a better rate of fire it's a rocket isn't it that's the japanese rocket thing you're shooting at me stopped gave the game away there didn't you really nice graphics on this map though so nice i'm playing on ultra but yeah that's gonna wrap it up for today guys thank you for watching can we get one more kill i think that guy's gonna kill me if i'm not careful i have a hill anyway i hope you
