hello guys and welcome back to battlefield 2042 today we're going to be doing all kinds of things there's a couple new game modes in the game we've got a different version of gun master free for all which i've not tried yet although i don't expect i'll be playing that very long and although rush isn't one of the main featured game modes anymore we can still play it in portal so i'm going to be hosting a portal server on bad company 2 rush and i thought that we could play some games together you guys are welcome to join whenever that is also we're going to be shortly testing some recall and attachments there's been a video posted on twitter which we'll talk about momentarily and i have to say as well a big thanks to the epic game store for sponsoring today's stream if you guys pick anything up on the epic game store there's a link down below do consider using my creative code jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that if you're watching the stream live hit the like button thank you if you're watching this as a video appreciate you being here hopefully we had some decent games today so first things first we're gonna talk about this attachment thing because i saw a video posted on twitter by sergeant danger cow who's a prominent member of the battlefield community and i think it's really interesting and i've not looked into this myself yet so i thought well why not just do it live then we'll see what's going down so i already knew about this but there is a bug in the game at the moment where if you change any attachment you get approximately supposedly 25 percent less recall so for example i've just spawned into the game here i haven't changed any attachment i literally just spawned in got the gun so what i'm gonna do is shoot the wall and we're gonna look at the recoil okay so that's how far we've got now i'm going to change an attachment so let's say we change the scope which shouldn't really affect recall and i'm going to shoot in you know roughly the same spot i wouldn't say it's 25 but it's definitely a bit less i mean it could change based on what attachment you've changed i think we need to secure more territory so i need to look into that one a bit further but the other thing that danger count posted a video of was that if you crouch supposedly again i'll test this if you crouch while you're firing it reset your vertical recoil and this is important because if if you're someone who's played fps games for a long time when you get into a firefight with someone usually if you're an experienced player you've got the ability to crouch and stay on target at the same time right you're crouching up and down you're trying to make yourself a hard target i've been doing that since quake you know long time and it works really well in battlefield and in other fps games like call of duty warzone whatever now so we're gonna look at this again here we go i'm just gonna shoot recall's a lot lower there but i did change the attachment and now i'm going to shoot but as i'm firing i'm going to crouch start the same position here now i know it's kind of difficult to test this because as i'm crouching my crosshair is moving up and down right so i wonder if i could do it where as i crouch i move my crosshair up no that wouldn't be very scientific you can kind of feel it though i feel like i can actually feel the the difference there i think that okay i think there might actually be something to that it's hard to scientifically test it really isn't it i think a developer would need to look at this further like in a white box environment with the stats and everything but you guys see what i mean so as you're crouching it's supposedly resetting the vertical recoil meaning that if you're getting into a firefight with someone and you're doing this your vertical recoil is going to be a lot less it's difficult to test it i think a developer is gonna have to look into this so i wasn't controlling the recoil there so i think this is quite interesting it's very difficult to test it anyway let me guys sorry if you guys let me know what you think about that do you think that's actually something or is it just a placebo effect i think there's something going on there because if you shoot and then you crouch you can almost feel the change in the recall just an interesting thing that i saw during the rounds on the battlefield twitter today in the community of course if you want low recall anyway you could just control it right and just pull down like that but maybe that's going to give you an advantage in certain firefights interesting devs are looking into it is that what they said okay maybe you'd be able to tell the difference at longer ranges that's about the same i don't know i feel like there's a little bit of a difference so it wasn't crouching here and i was crouching here but again because your aim bumps down when you crouch hard to tell i think a good way of testing it would be if in the engine or if a developer could fix the crosshair to a certain point so when you crouch it compensates the names up and down and then you could see right for sure anyways that's fascinating really see what happens with that and welcome to the stream guys thank you for coming mike what's up john hey thomas hello quick beam welcome blob man how you doing hey matthew what's up b sod hey chris you're gonna have to pay for that wall you're really messing it up yeah i think i caused significant amount of damage there into the thousands of dollars i would say easily thousands of dollars so in portal we've got free for all and we've got gun master now i've played gun master before like i made my own game mode and it was here but it was called gun master of ages and i picked the weapons that i wanted in it so i went through like 1942 bc2 bf3 and then 2042. but this i think has got a different has it got a different rotation on it i presume it has because it says 2042 here right so i don't think that this is my game mode i think this is one that they've made maybe just with 2042 guns but we'll try free for all as well and then i'm going to host that server and you guys can join in what's up lucky hello hero sean prince how you doing hey gabby good to see you again what's up nordic yeah hopefully it puts me oh this is a terrible map for gun master this is a new game ah relatively new we'll give it a shot okay so it is it is different then it's a pp isn't it kills to next level two okay so it's the it's the old-school battlefield style of gun master as well where you need to get two kills per gun to actually advance it looks like it's all yeah no plus system no attachments either it's quite annoying that because as you guys know when you shoot an unsuppressed weapon you're on the mini map for five seconds so i think in this game mode everyone's just gonna be on the minimap trying to decide who to go for there's one in here why is my you see that look at my view it's wobbling that's very strange isn't it why is my view wobbling i'm the wiggler i don't like that i need to die okay does that fix the wiggle i hope that's fixed the wibble not a big fan of that hello luca what's up calvin hey the wibble stopped 40 degrees 150 meters away are we going to kill anything from that range i will thank you very much for the 10. just wanted to drop on and say thanks for everything you do got a lot of love you did have a good one thank you will it's very kindly oh no there's no no hitbox pawn here i couldn't shoot through that gap what's up gods hello from iraq iraqi carbon what's up man hey tune a long time to get the kill with the scar there didn't it cheers hello leslie hey james thank you man what's up straight up gamer hope you guys all had a great weekend i was out all day yesterday so i didn't really get much gaming done or editing this work this weekend really i don't know why they put this map in the rotation man it sucks so much for gun master is this in free-fall as well is it gonna appear i climb this without dying not a shotgun not on a giant map okay well doesn't matter the range is huge okay so yes russ should just be under all out warfare ammo yeah rush is uh is pretty good on this game i think it's the mode that i enjoy playing the most it's not a featured playlist anymore located 110 degrees 90 meters away from my position anthony calvin a terrified beef i'm not a big fan of having no attachments either on some of these guns i dread to think i'm gonna get the knife kill as well if i get to the last level that's gonna be pain drop down how can you aim with this man there we go of course you've got armor if you're irish why would you not play irish can i change that's a bit of a exploit isn't it you start with armor okay abx you can peek good shot any suggestions for better performance on pc it's really difficult ethan um it's just not very well optimized you could try a config just put your graphics all on low maybe overclock your cpu a little bit overclock your gpu a little bit um turn off some of the windows 10 windows 11 fancy graphics features make sure game modes on and then wait for an update i guess apart from like building a new pc you're getting a better cpu there's not much you can do unfortunately larry is 24 is he running good on your new pc yes why did everyone just suddenly appear in the same position the ammo tasty pistols ah should have turned down a gundam yeah it just doesn't run very well unless you've got like late 12th gen intel or one of the amd 5950xs uh cenu thank you for the five i'm curious why you don't play escape from tarkov i've been meaning to i just haven't had a chance i want to play with acula but i think he's just been too busy but i know he's um he's a lot more experienced than i am so i would just drag him down could be fun though oh come on it's more about the cpu bus master than the graphics card this game obviously there's an extent to that right like if you're on like a graphics card from i don't know five years ago probably not gonna have great performance play eft solo be brave would you guys want to see that i mean i have no idea what i'm doing you know i've played it a few times in the past i've done a few videos on it i think it would be quite difficult i'm willing to give it a go might be a fun video [Applause] m44 i don't think i've ever actually picked this gun in game you know i don't think i've ever picked it in a loadout 11 series yeah 11 series can run this pretty well if you've got it overclocked like stard i think he's running 11th gen and he gets pretty nice frames the deuce i was trying to kill that guy because i know he's on the last level burned need to get one more kill with this bloody revolver bloody bloody i miss the wrecks yeah the wrecks are sick ah should have been a bit more patient then what's windows 11 like it's been fine for me it's pretty much windows 10 with the skin damn it i haven't tried my new pc on windows 10 though so i don't know what the performance differences are i've read online that like if you get 12th gen really you should run windows 11 but then i've seen benchmarks where people have tested both and there doesn't seem to be much of a difference at all so i don't know if this is actually any truth to that wait turn on captions yeah this shouldn't have captions youtube has captions a great spawn eleven seven hundred can run it fine and surprise me gary they announced pricing for the 30 50 ti [Music] can you actually buy them yet are there any reviews on them hey jason are you streaming with obs studio or shadowplay obs studio from a streaming pc try and get a better map a barry thank you for the 17 months when you play with dr disrespect whenever he asks me i'll be there why the caption so accurate because it's google they just got really good video technology and transcoding you use the revolver just for fun yeah corey that map is terrible for gunmaster any type of small game mode that map that i just played really bad this one can be okay but if you spawn on the ice you road it's about a kidney 30 50 is 249 okay have i played the updated infected custom game no i haven't someone said about an asus rogue one there where was that i've lost the message oh gabrielle yeah um the reason that the members disappeared was because i used to be with a mcn a network on youtube but um something happened because of the way youtube is operating their rules now so i just went i had to go direct with youtube instead so i'm just a youtube partner now but because i changed it removed all the members uh there wasn't anything that i could do about it so i'm sorry about that appreciate your support though man there's one i'm not sure i like this uh stack of weapons you know if you're not playing irish what are you doing is it just me and him on this server what that's obviously failed try again did you guys see the uh halo infinite 6900 xt you i don't think you can buy it though you have to win it like i would buy that just because it's halo it looks cool man i love how it looks okay this is all right this is full it's just started now i wish i could buy that [Applause] collectors edition graphics cards don't really come around that often do you remember the star wars ones i think it was a titan wasn't it they did a they did a red and a green titan one for the dark side one for the light side what's this guy doing i remember there was one for assassin's creed origins the egyptian one damn it i could take him out is there a way we can join you yeah you can just search gun master see if you get in the server i am going to host my own server though sir oh dude don't shoot me shoot the guy behind you hi and pascal yeah titan x that's it jason thank you you got a good memory jason correct [Music] how is it predicting what you're going to say it's because youtube has a buffer on it like youtube is like 20 30 seconds behind what i'm actually doing in real life uh it has to have that buffer for like high resolution streams like 4k you can make it more real time if you want to but if you do that you i don't think you get the captions or maybe they're not as accurate and also that can cause lag for people so but because i'm streaming at 4k i like to have the the buffer this is gun master yeah robbie they put their own version of gun mastering memory like an elephant do you have teammates no no it's just free-for-all it's you on your own you against the world [Applause] so if you lose you've got no one else to blame but yourself that's that's why i kind of like it you know all the responsibilities on you it's all up to you and your skill there's a bit of luck involved of course especially with the last kill on the knife and the rocket launcher kills well no let you get away from that is there no lmg in this it wasn't was there we didn't have an lng last time i think it's a shame hello mayonnaise what's up hey matt what was for lunch today i haven't had lunch yet i had a chocolate croissant i think might make a roast dinner later because it's sunday oh you jumped over my bullet didn't you mckay where'd you go yeah i'm alright stolen i'm jumping dude jumping jack rabbit over here i'll go bust i can hear someone oh let's go this way instead roasted noobs i'm gonna roast any noobs at me too cool oh god guy here pain hey luke roast is always worth the wait that's a good point that 50 cow has a huge amount of jiggle on it i knew you were there somewhere oh no i don't want to get knifed and demoted a level that was like a horror game a bit of a jump scare for that guy ow stephen thank you for the five yo thank you for the 449 as well glad your pc is working better thanks joe yeah what's my um what's my take on the state of battlefield 2042 um i think we'll hopefully we'll get an update from the developers next week i think they should be back at work some kind of uh blog you know announcing what their plan is for the game in terms of like adding features live service content we'll have to see oh crap no should have aimed i don't know why this spread on the rocket launcher but there is no die ah someone got it oh he's got armor on of course pain could have got a kill there wasted a few shots didn't i ferginson yeah i love your name bro it's cool martin yes it is gun game i will oh look at the hell oh no give me a break are you safe that's a val what's up matthew hey well again different will that time yes okay i need a knife kill now this is gonna be pain why is it okay that was easy literally the first person i went for jack will you do a video about your new pc yes i will marius i will i think i've got to do three live streams using the new pc for specific games like it's an nvidia pc specialist thing that's this month though but i've got a little setup video that i'm going to show in that andreas thank you for the 100 [Music] what's up is the tochi beat you with the 100th like on this stream well we need more likes don't we i think thank you renee vello thank you gg battlefield 3 reality mod i've not seen it i remember playing a mod for battlefield 2 years ago called project reality i've not seen that they were doing one for this game someone actually managed to mod bf3 they had venice unleashed didn't they back in the day is venice still going is that part of the project reality mod or is that something else you got right there ah a thousand like okay so you're saying you were the 100th like in the past hello envy what's up jess very good thanks for the five this is the worst release of battlefield today i love battlefield but this is just pain people just count down here level 78 shotgun hello hey john or ps5 what for this game i think if you're talking about this game you want to get it on ps5 you get 128 players bigger maps and stuff i'd imagine it runs a lot better as well i'm dead yeah i've not played it on the old consoles myself i have 33 i have a 3900x and 28 2080 s and 32 gig ram and jack setter makes me sweat oh come on no i can show you guys my friends here you go it's gonna go no signal for a second there you go i've got my gpu currently down clocked as well because it was crashing a little bit on this game well when i say a little bit it was crashing like every hour so i had to underclock it the battlefield wait is that quite hang on was that a rocket launcher how are they how are they doing that it was like it looked like there was a rocket launcher coming off that didn't it i swear a grenade launch or something does one of the guns have an underbarrel on it why'd you come back in you knew where i was weird maybe somewhere around there somewhere there we go on my left ah missed the drag shot the scar oh yeah okay it's the score i've already gone through that though score's pretty early on in this rotation the knife has an underbarrel can you imagine if the knife had an underbarrel it's a really bad spot for me but i'm just trying to find people okay oh couldn't slide away quick enough what temps do i get in this game are they higher than average not really max is like 74 on the gpu cpu is about 50 60. yes thanks to the five cheers for reading my comment no problem jess thank you appreciate you being here i don't think i could ever go back to 1080p yeah me neither 1080p is like so blurry by today's standards you play at 1440 you go to 1080 and you're just like what is going on you can't see anything i think games have become too detailed like 1080p works fine still for games like counter strike go valor and mobas with simple textures and geometry but a game like this or warzone going to 1440p is a huge huge advantage makes such a big difference especially for long distance as well right like battlefield warzone they've got extreme distances and if you've got that higher pixel density when you're trying to shoot people at long ranges it's a lot easier why do you do that every time i spawn in wish i could turn that off i'm losing this one hey safe what's up king jay cries in 1080p i think 1080p is still the most popular resolution though and according to steam the most popular gpu is the 1080 and the 1080 ti because those cards were so good back in the day like price for performance wise everyone's still gone well not everyone but a lot of people still held onto those cards because they still work great but we don't have gpus to play at 1440p i think it depends on your expectations for some people 60 fps is fine on pc for others it's unplayable so it really depends on how you feel your expectations your experiences what kind of gaming are you into are you just playing single player are you playing pvp everyone everyone has different tastes and expectations and feels for that kind of thing right what's up childish thank you for coming stupid revolver that is the guy above me i think right there 1600 screens were also a vast majority exactly yeah the most popular gpu on steam is the 1060. i thought it was the 1080. that's the guy that needs a knife kill oh he got it i was gonna run down and kill him 1060 is what i have yeah i think a 1080 is sufficient for 1080p definitely [Music] one of the things that attracted me to your channel is that all your videos are 2k plus you mean resolution yeah the great thing about youtube is that if you go higher resolution you get higher bitrate on youtube so it just looks so much better i'll try free fall now stephen thank you very much for the 50. that was very generous of you have a good weekend cheers buddy thanks stephen hope you had a good christmas in new year isn't the uk weird about guns yeah we don't really have guns okay free for all can i just pick whatever gun i want here i mean some people can get guns in the uk like if if you're a farmer for example like i think they have access to shotguns if they get a license it's very difficult though and there are armed police officers as well i know civilians don't don't really have them ah good shot i'm doing good thanks joker how are you see you later thank you for coming i have a grenade oh okay [Music] what would be best mckay maybe plays mckay with med bag m5 short barrel try that see how that works are there dangerous wildlife in the countryside in the uk not really badges badges are big i don't know we have any bears no definitely no tigers snake there's not really that many venomous snakes either excuse me dice is that can you not shoot through that i don't expect that did you sundance good shot ducks yeah ducks are quite dangerous you just never know when they're going gonna attack i used to have one that like followed me around everywhere and stalked me when i lived at my old place there was a duck that would just like fly into the window if i went outside it would um like follow me and try and bite me [Applause] very dangerous jewelers more of air what bloody hell is going on you can hear some ducks down there oh that's a terrible spawn for that guy [Applause] i already gone oh no no i don't have ammo pkb that works damn it uk squirrels are terrifying yeah they just fly around and they throw small grenades at you it's horrible jack any word on what will drop in the first season no idea there's new specialists new guns and gadgets i think they said new locations as well and that's all they've announced yeah i could have switched ammo couldn't i see sometimes i remember but then sometimes i'm 35 and my brain doesn't work so it really depends on what kind of mood i'm in you know oh you can see me on the map can you die already come on uk squirrels one run away from my mini dash hunt oh that's adorable i remember when i was in florida i can't remember which park i was in and like animal kingdom maybe just eating lunch outside like a picnic area and um a squirrel came up to me and gave me a high five true story and then i had to wash my hands because apparently they carry all sorts of disease but you know that was a cool moment in my life being high-fived by a squirrel i never thought that would happen yet it did is it free-for-all yes it is rohan do i think 64 players with more visual fidelity and destruction is better for 2042 comics i think it's an interesting idea yeah i think you know if they prioritized smaller maps with more destruction and detail you know would have been a very different vibe for the game but i think now it's like all the marketing everything's like oh we got 128 players i can't see them going back on it maybe what they could do is live service like let's say they focus more on infantry for live service they could build new 64 player only maps all jen i think that's an interesting proposition right and i think that's a like uh what's the word a potential future you know a realistic future for the game so i'm doing the crouching thing there but that's just automatic it's just in my brain stay on target spam crouch angel does it again bloody hell do you come from dude what the hell jesus that was something right good morning james gable you should write a book it'd be really boring jesus these spawns need some work these spawns need a lot of attention ah future map should be slightly smaller but still have 128 yeah i think the problem with that though is if they have too many vehicles on it would just become an absolute grind fest wouldn't it i i'd be down for that but only if it was more infantry focused because like a smaller map with that many vehicles just constant explosions constantly being killed by helicopters that's not gonna be fun is it yeah it's gonna be cool to see what they do you know how they pivot if they change it all i wish there'd be more blood and gore in these games it looks so clean it's warm man yeah i mean bf's never been super gory though has it maybe an option to turn it on and off be good yesterday on breakthrough the game spawned me in front of an enemy tank and right between two enemy players marvelous yeah you're kind of screwed there aren't you mediocracy uh rus luncheon thank you for becoming a member it's very kind of you no problem we go thank you for watching i've got a vector why do i have a vector and see i've got c5 as well and no med kit hey okay it just changed my loadout for some reason nice this map is also terrible uh uh free-fall tdm that kind of thing mr spawns ruin it what's my m5 loadout there you go is no one here i mean nice oh great what's my dpi 1600 i pet loud dog dog dog dog i'm gonna go with dog defaults to the far right i wish it didn't do that you can just stay here and farm can't you sure i could just stay here head glitch and farm if i wanted to kind of boring though isn't it that's the first grenade [Applause] standing back a movement i'll get bored if i just stay there and now watch me die i keep getting pinged by pegs okay unusual unusual choice there for a tdm do i miss the times with battlefield 3 yeah man i mean bf3 was great i've got so many good memories from bf3 iconic maps guns weapons voice lines good single player just doing stupid stuff with friends i think i've got better overall memories though from battlefield 2 just because it was so new like we played 1942 and we played like desert combat mod when we were kids but then bf2 like when we were at university we used to love that just like flying around in the blackhawk strike at carkind master city pipeline all those iconic maps around so good i like that skin that guy had [Music] assist sorry you killed me then that was weird wasn't it that was strange bf3 sniping was awesome yeah yeah bf3 sniping was legit it was difficult as well had a bit of a challenge to it remember when bf3 came out and and i started my youtube channel with bf3 right but there were a lot of other great youtube channels at the time that started doing it too and sniping was one of those things that i love to watch on youtube as well as do in the game like i would watch um andeselle do like long range sniping and um rob us remember roberts he would do it with the the shotgun the slug shotgun the 870ms and just put like a 12-time scope on it and because the slugs were broken when the game came out you could just literally snipe people from like 1800 meters away with a shotgun sniper with a slug in it it was so funny [Applause] i'm gonna drop down ah i couldn't snipe on bf4 yeah bf4 was also quite difficult to snipe and i think it was a bit easier than bf3 though sergeant enigma yeah yeah dude he would make amazing montages i don't think sergeant ending has uploaded in years maybe i don't know do they still upload in the back what's up luke jack's last hunt showdown video convinced me to give it another try and i've been hooked good luck good yeah it's a fun game really difficult to get into but once you're there and you learn it so much fun some of the best pvp i think you can have at the moment on pc at least he's on console as well i imagine it plays quite differently on console there's someone here here's someone here do a little flanky hey snappy what's up man you should have died will you be playing some breakthrough today i think so lucky yeah we're gonna do rush first though i think after this round i'll load up a rush server and you guys can join we're gonna do a couple rounds of bad company too brush just because i was feeling in the mood for it got my tracking all wrong then pain sergeant is uploading daily really randy craig just do exclamation mark set up and then you can see my specs these guys above me i think i wish the radar had levels on it so annoying that it doesn't previous battlefield games had it you know where you can see what level someone's on like if they're above or below you that's such a useful feature but it's not in this game it's annoying [Music] i got reload stuck on my screen [Applause] so you can't tell where people are it's frustrating nice little kill streak going on here that's weird you coming up fov 88 so there's someone there hello mate what are you doing in a bush first of fifty isn't it i assume so what you doing in a bush notification just an assist i'll get turned on not gonna get the third though sterling thanks for the five would you ever collaborate with neve's gaming again i would yeah i don't know if they're gonna do battlefield friends though they did that little teaser but then you know obviously the game released in a really buggy unfinished state so i wonder if they've decided to just hold off for now with it it felt like they were going to actually like start making episodes again i mean i love battlefield friends can you do the angel voice again i mean it just comes and goes you know angel's got its own a mind of its own he just comes out playing against bots no it's these are all real people joker hey will what's up will whitman that's a good name you can pop boris throw it down in free-for-all it's kind of sketch isn't it opinions on the 360 ti it's a good card jacob yeah it's good price performance isn't it although i would wait and i would wait for the reviews of the 30 50 ti first because that might be better price performance depending on you know how it is so i would just hold off but yeah 360ti is good it's a budget card isn't it it's like price performance damn dip potato chip death animations are like a ballet yeah they do kind of like spiral and pirouette don't they like crazy crowbar chromecast needs to make a video on this game it would be very interesting to watch yeah i'd like to watch it brandon what's up man love your videos call in from work to watch your stream thank you brandon i was first of 45 not 50. i thought i'd lost then i thought the guy just caught up all of a sudden is it still difficult to get 30 series i imagine so yeah looking at the prices on ebay have you ever spawned indoors in this match i think i did a couple times mate yeah milk first or tea first youngest pros okay it's very important you boil the kettle you put the tea bag in the cup you put the water on the tea bag you leave it for two to three minutes two to three minutes if you just if it's shorter than that then it's not tea as far as i'm concerned two to three minutes and then stir it a little bit take the tea bag out and then just put a dash of milk in it if you put too much milk in it spools the flavor you just want a dash you want it to look like clay if it's too milky you know it tastes weird what graphics preset i'm all on low apart from texture detail on high score an anisotropic filtering on high it's 50 the timer ended oh i see manuel i'm good thanks instructions unclear i'm dead i didn't mean that to happen i was just trying to explain how to make tea what kind of milk semi skin that's fine i don't i think whole milk is a bit it's a bit too creamy for tea you know what's my preferred tea yorkshire gold that cup of tea is going to be freezing what are you kidding farrah no come on you two to three minutes it's still going to be quite hot okay i'm going to host the server on portal we're going to play a couple rounds of bad company

they do dragon valley again [Music] let's go metro don't make me laugh you know metro is one of the most played maps of all time in we got enemy battlefield in the area changing man i think that is weighted somewhat though because people used it for like grinding weapons and attachments right it was also a pretty fun map on bf3 rush i liked it in rush oh trade kill okay i don't think they'll do wake island again i don't think it'll happen again i feel like they've done it like eight times now or something i've got a lot of dead guys in here they're all up on the right there you play bad company two maps with modern movement that's what we're doing railroad skip that's what we're doing right now i didn't put the classic preset on so we've got 2042 movement too dangerous unless they put smoke down oh my god oh good grenade grand bazaar i love grand bazaar man that's a great map man they really held us up there we burned through a lot of tickets then didn't we down to 64 already

terry's mom betty and mary mary's his aunt that ending was gold it was a bit crazy keena wasn't it what's up dankvids the last time i killed you was in pub g was nice to do it again but it might not be me in pub g because a lot of people use my name but if you did fair play gg how did i fix my fps got a brand new top of the line computer there you go eggy right should i play a different class this time snipe maybe a bit of sniping uh robert thank you for the two why does bf1 have better graphics in this game um i think bf1 like the maps are a lot smaller they're more detailed they obviously worked on them for a lot longer it's only 64 players so they've got more headroom for graphics they don't have to worry as much about networking scale as they do in this game that's probably why these first two points are hard to capture motion sensor transmitting this work it does work but there's tanks there yeah bf1 is a great looking game still came out in 2016 as well like the atmosphere the environment the sound effects the visual effects explosions it's all really good [ __ ] that looks dicey welcome back safe do i still play warzone yeah ducky i've had a few days off though i haven't played it for about a week and a half because they had an invisible skin in the game and they were on their christmas vacation so it didn't get fixed it's been fixed now and they also had some shotguns in the game akimbo shotguns which were broken like do you guys remember the snake shots when they were broken worse than that literally worse than that so i just didn't want to play you know the game's in such a bad state with the balance and everything and the invisible skin just annoying to fight against but that's been fixed now so i actually think i'm going to give it a go again we'll need to take out these tanks you would you were there that whole time i think that i think that other tank was in the smoke or something okay sniping isn't gonna work i'm gonna have to push in aren't i um rpg xm8 combat you pp take the pp yeah i'm gonna play warzone this week i think maybe starting tomorrow go go go thor take us in hey man down we got a man down oh no the tank was

thing while you attack it might just happen it's not something that you can request you know it might just happen this rush is from the past game yeah yeah from bad company too i don't think there's any medics is that that's a bright kill stream yeah yeah for sure hobo um i streamed god of war on playstation 4 pro but i'm really looking forward to playing it on pc and 4k with 60fps or more fps earlier right's not working yeah i loved god of war though it was great such an emotional game i think it's one of the best soundtracks ever as well in video games we've got 40 tickets we've got to make something happen here guys well that was the last thing i expected to see when i went around the corner i have to applaud that person but look there's a lot of enemies all over it why are you in combat stop being in combat let me spawn you dice oh no they're gonna die nice please nice nice think about the children dice think about the children think about the kids think about the kids get down i think we got objective bravo okay defend defend we got this as long as that tank doesn't kill me i'm good we got it ah the tank backed off though kind of good if that tank would have just gone warm and just like run the building down i would have beat it so i think thank you what is it what do you see something in the corner what the deuce okay maybe pp's a lot better than i thought it was

what the what is that a ghost what the hell was that that's a nice boat strange all right push we've got push in lads oh god three seconds i'm stuck i have to leave it what the hell i can't move forward oh my god my game was so bugged then one tank versus one enemy yeah i was i couldn't move forward my game just bugged out it's better now [Applause] you gotta do the big flank on this one big pp fight [Applause] is there another ladder here how do i have so much self-control what do you mean i thought there'd be another ladder there this guy's just murdering my teammates oh come on that's disappointing who would win one armored boy or 15 infantry i think 15 infantry in that case right rumba what's up man yeah it's me it's my server i just hosted it i think we should try and get b now while they're distracted with that you gotta blow it up guys come on you should know this hey how do you outsnipe a sniper well with an rpg my friend that's how good job should have just reloaded there eggie there it is there's the message what's up stephen it's fun to use a different gun i don't really use though in this anyway we are moving on big right flank here tank's really good at this point you've got all this cover on the right hand side so it's useful ah what's up marcel do i like vanguard i think it's okay ducky i'm just kind of bored of arena games now you know like i much prefer called warzone than just typical cod nowadays vanguard had a lot of bugs in there as well i don't like the fire there's fire everywhere they put like an incendiary grenade in at the moment so like whenever you play it it's just fire on the floor there's fire shotguns incendiary ammo it's chaos i prefer mw19 i think mw90 is my favorite cod game of recent times we'll see it's occupied no um back to intel matthew am i gonna do a setup video yeah kind of a tarot fast enough i'm gonna ask an important question in chat now guys okay important question pubg i think it's been out since 2017 2018 i haven't played pub g for a while so i've not really been interested in it like i don't feel like the game has changed that much either um it's going free to play next week do you think that's going to make an impact that's our tank like would you go and play it again with it being freeze to play do you think the player numbers are going to spike a lot of people still play it especially in asia but western audiences not really but with it going free to play i think it's 50 50. what like what do you guys think is it gonna inspire you to go back and play it again for me personally um i'm gonna try it again but compared to like new games pubg just feels so clunky i think that's the worst part of it and i know that some of the clunkiness is on purpose right like that's the vibe of the game i'm going to change the weapon i think keep getting ready [Music] i know that some of the clunkiness is by design and it's supposed to feel like that but when you compare it to some other games it just feels so archaic i don't know what it is a lot of people say no possibly no not really it's not about the price it's about the game yeah that's how i feel to zerno like it just hasn't evolved enough for me like there's been a lot of um innovations in the vr space i think over the last couple years and i feel like pubg just hasn't kept up with it i thought i had the flag there i thought i had it pubg was a psn plus game may yes i'm going to do eft again cheating will be a problem yeah i think they've got a new anti-cheat though they've got a kernel level anti-cheat now something that they've developed myself okay change gun excellent combat explosive charge has been planted standby why play poke g when you play super people which is pubg but better i like super people it's good [Music] you diffusing it oh we got it i think we got it bang [Music] i think that was our last chance we've only got 12 tickets i can't jump out now this is absolutely our last chance we've got friendlies on it but be careful i'll play this got it i want if using it i don't think so i think we got it oh someone nearly made it gg falling back well done that was intense [Music] that was real real close good game what's up we squad up i don't think we're gonna do it fella because um like brandon doesn't like the game at all as far as i know so i don't think he'd play could do it with charlie matt might jump in for a bit i think you know if there's a big overhaul brandon might try it i don't want to speak for him but i don't think we've got any plans to do more squad up we did one or two episodes from memory steven what do i think of alden ring it's sick i played it yeah i've done a video on it it's really good that was really close wasn't it romeo when nvidia gonna send you that 39ti for review any info on that curious about performance romeo i don't know if they are i don't know if they're going to send me one i'd love it i'd love to test it we don't know anything about release date price performance i think the performance obviously is going to be the best performing graphics card but by how much though you know a 4k might be a bit of a difference 1440p and 1080 i don't know like i would guess like 10 15 fps bump over the 3090 that was really good i enjoyed that guys thank you for playing with me there a bit of rush classic maps love it will you do more live streams of new single player games yeah yeah sure ain't nutty so they got classic conquest tried those two i think we'll play some should we do some breakthrough let's get moving 128 breakthrough let's give it a shot what do i think about the razor desk i've not seen it thank you for joining guys that was really fun appreciate you guys uh johnny if you want to join you're welcome hey bash why does tdm put me in free-for-all because that's what tdm is right in this i think that's it that's all you get hey joel from guam what's up love the halo campaign walkthrough just finished oh justin thank you man yeah halo was good i really really really liked it good gameplay jonathan stodd fancied some games earlier really today is an agricultural research facility in egypt key to mitigating the global famine matthew they say 390 i should hit 70 fps on 2042 and today i think it'd be more than that matthew coordinate your efforts it will push the russians clear am i looking forward to the day before yeah take that facility back that reminded me actually starred um he recently did a video on this lmg and i've i've used it but not much but this is the build he had so i'm going to try it out okay what's up seed from malaysia what age i'm 35 dicks is this the johnny yes the johnny hey sith thank you man what's up navigators [Music] hey do i use the streaming pc dirt mod yeah yeah there's no way that you could play this game and get a smooth 4k 60fps stream with a high bitrate on one pc i don't think you can do it you can do it with other games i don't think you know this game but yeah i've got my pc playing the game and then it's cloned to a 4k capture card the elgato 4k60 pro so how do i use this gun then i've got a different scope on it okay thank you for the one 20 years younger than me expo there you go i don't think i've ever played the first sector of this in 128 breakthrough i always join like after don't sound 35 does anyone sound their age i think it's difficult to tell isn't it i need some smokes there buddy would you be playing the new harry potter game yeah cornelius it looks sick i can't wait for that game no one's spawning a ranger you guys know the trick with the grapple as well see that you can just like bunny hop with it you can maintain your momentum and the way you do it is you shoot and then you let go and you just press jump i just keep getting sniped here by the dxr you don't sound a day over 21. ranger can you revive me that'd be good no goodbye range there's a new harry potter game yeah it's like a third person action adventure rpg seems interesting i've not even got a kill with this gun yet there we go there's someone out there are there any new posters in the making yes there is soon it's got a lot of recall like this got it that was a head shot okay i feel like headshot our forces are hitting alpha oh you can with it though i don't think it's as good as the pkp definitely more recall than the pkp but you can get a nice beam on if you want what the jet interesting i think it would be better in a close range scenario you know maybe see if we can push further into the map and try it out some more don't look up no i need to watch it though it's on my list [Music] let me see if i can run people over i get much maneuverability on this i mean there is a tank there oh god i accidentally pressed my chat hogwarts legacy i think it's called the harry potter game don't be sad angel's frozen to death that was something right i'm taking anymore cool i'm feeling it i'm feeling it [Applause] i'm oh that was close it's fine it's fine this is absolute madness man this is so crazy what is going on i feel like i'm living in a dream world sometimes playing 60 128 player breakthrough oh no baltimore as well i wish that i was playing this sundance [Applause] excuse me i mean it's madness isn't it guys absolute madness old mouse one love the fabric around the weapons anything that makes the gun look like tuscan raider oh how good was that second episode of boba fett guys did you see that so good okay i need to stop pretending to be spider-man it's not getting me anywhere stop the spider-man thing get out of combat get out of combat there's a guy behind you i'll come back come on come on come on come on come on that's the spawn oh they were killed pain am i still playing on low settings yeah apart

this is don't go too low though don't climb to the wall good good man yeah we can't go anywhere near that wildcat we're dead if we do oh he's got classical music on this guy actually seems like a decent pilot what do you think hey judge it was an episode of constant nodding what do you think i mean i know like he's trying to communicate with the tuscan raiders and everything i like the bit when he was trying to teach them how the speeder works that was good [Music] that was a nice [Music] enjoy your content and positive attitude cheers cheers buddy very kindly the chopper gunner isn't broken at all um i think it's a bit underpowered honestly if there was anyone with an a launcher there i think there was maybe one person doing it [Music] it could have taken us out the enemy has regrouped secure this sector before moving on roadkill i'm stuck up they just forget about me i mean what okay oh why is there a trade kill there come on i was gonna kill turn around get in the building disgusting well it was one of yours check out the anti-personnel mines on the bolt jewels i know it's got i knew that it had anti-vehicle mines but it's got anti-personnel as well i didn't know that oh look at this spawn beacon here hello hello oh why are you there i should stop asking that because it's 128 players and there are people everywhere right like it's just the way 128 players is i think i've got the close quarters rounds on jason yeah close combat there you go allies initiating attack at charlotte one [Music] [Music] we have secured an objective where's that wild cat [Music] that's pain i don't want to go anywhere near that [Music] okay instantly dead ruined a little bird wouldn't be better i think uh you coming in okay grenade i'm trying to cap this part of my own here lads go on give me an assist please help somebody the guys just splash banging the ground that was a nice little take i enjoyed that slipped in through the back door with the gravel load let's go [Music] jack is working the cleaning company today it was a good back range no more down you can go in here can't you i bet there's people watching it though prone with a pkp watching the corner that hurts me in my core guys i have to be honest like i can really feel that in the bottom of my stomach you know like the pain really hurts although there's a mckay falc falc don't let me die over here please angel angel yeah that one hurts a lot that's a bad spawn that one maybe in combat this one oh this one okay what the i was going on there i want to get in i don't want to be out here oh you're an enemy teammate i'm sorry i let you down you're not dead oh okay god i thought that person was dead there they had armor on the top yo boris boris killed with mp9 unbelievable i obtained gameplay by that guy yeah for sure [Music] oh so a developer has replied on twitter about that thing we were looking at this morning this morning at the start of the stream my brain is not with it today so this is drunksy they said there isn't really anything wrong with when you go crouch the camera translates downwards which moves the point of aim down like any fps yeah that's what i thought if you missed the start of the stream we were testing the theory of a bug with recoil where if you crouched it was supposed to reset vertical recall i tested it i couldn't really see a difference maybe a little bit of a difference but um it seems like a dev has uh actually spoken about it no spawns here it looks like it's not a thing sorry [Music] how did i do that much damage damn it right now that turret wasn't firing at me then did you say that it was interesting i'm burning someone here look at this what is going on here i wait for a rest marcel the the thing with the attachment switching is a different thing it's a different thing oh man i can't wait till they stop that it's so frustrating when the when the little bird hits you with those rockets you slow down is the most annoying thing in the game they're hitting hard allies are securing objectives [Music] oh there's a little repel there oh we're dead what the hell this is how we delete angel from the game he's the final boss and we just have to fire enough shots at him and eventually he'll die guys i need help with angel we need to remove him from the game guys he's here i need help we need more bullets mckay please come on shoot shoot shoot we have to destroy him he's the final boss no what the hell that was something right well fov 88 italian thanks for the five the hell with that little bird rocket banding to fill you on that one yeah it's horrible angel's still there alive are you responsible for this young man what did you do create a monster are you really i don't know which angels are real which one's on must be dice i got killed by an angel angel can multiply himself don't be sad it's just how it works out sometimes don't be sad don't be sad don't be sad we nearly out tickets no we got 356 blood dl [Music] oh no you did oh sick [Music] kill kill kill kill don't be sad don't be sad [Music] oh no it's a walker run it's not fun to play the game like that is that fun it must be must be

ghost tuesday is coming have you got your coat on the roof i live in a giant bucket did all thank you for the five do i enjoy 2042 a war zone more these days walter has been pretty bad last couple weeks because the bugs uh i wouldn't say i enjoy either of them as much as the other though like i just like i like variety you know some days i feel like playing warzone some days i play battlefield i can't really pick favorites like that i don't know i just don't work like that and offer different types of like to dip in and out gamepl both from time to time at the moment i'm definitely playing more 2042 though that's mainly because of the bugs in more zones don't be sad i'm gonna get this full control of the area mission accomplished giovanni cheers for five any hell let loose gameplay on the horizon yeah angel does it again always spectacular what's up fatima how are you really surprised what's my favorite battlefield game overall people always ask me this [Music] and i always say it's a toss-up between bf3 and bf2 tasty i'm just pulling the recoil down i'm just using my mouse to pull down the recoil higher fov makes it look less than it is as well today i'm proud the voice lines are cringing i want them to re-record the voice lines some of them anyway oh no we just played renault breakaway let's go jack popping the cork on the whiskey dizzy it's um it's a flask just got water in do you like that sound though it's a good sound isn't it it's quite a unique sound really [Music] never been a big fan of whiskey though it's a bit too um it's a bit too strong for me a bit too dry don't like the taste of it he known every stream toast burnt bread it's not jack's favorite was bf4 air superiority what attack helicopters on grilling peaks in china rising you aren't here i like your videos watching every year thank you five cups of coffee let's go hey i've already had five cups of coffee let's go i climbed mount everest all downhill from there you get it time to go to

try not to oh my god what not the ranger oh that god six kills there where was the hit wrench i missed the warzone mythbusters yeah i feel like i did everything though you know you get to a point with those type of videos and then you've covered everything i'm not just going to keep making the same stuff over and over again you know i do enjoy making those types of videos asmr with the flask how can i just run across there oh this please don't get killed by a robot again at least it wasn't a robot i've got a kill with a frog falci one of our objectives is under attack falci mine in falchi hello angel falci angel you've literally just got to move 15 meters towards me to resume yes yes yes thank you so much you're the best can they hit me can they hit me before i kill them i'm running out of mouse pad i literally ran out of mousepad then i was pulling my mouse down so much controlling the recoil do you guys know if i put their ap rounds on this does it actually destroy helicopters ah am i right one of our objectives has been targeted i'm good harry thank you yeah have a good time i keep trying to buy a super chat but it just tells me a message not a cent that's weird sb velarama that was a good revive play yeah i mean they'd run out of time though it was close the medics in this game need to do some training i just think people don't care i think that's all it is and ultimately as long as you're not cheating you can play the game how you like right you paid for it you play it however you like you don't want to revive everyone and that's you yes ap rounds damage helis okay thank you you serious if i die now i'm gonna be actually so annoyed see anyone here it's just that one player weird there's a guy parachuting there i don't even know if i've got the range can this gun shoot up there three times i'm not sure it could i don't think so that's a helicopter now what the other team doing where are they that's scary objectives you really see where my bullet was going then look at my range is actually shooting from that distance i've got the range now can i get this guy it's got to be a headshot that's close i give up but he's still coming down look at that oh flying squirrel more here this is where the enemy team are at my machine gun's gone ow it baffles me there's no voice chat yeah it's a big feature that they left out should have been there at launch i mean look there are 64 players on the other team i just don't know where they are my game crashed my game crashed that is the first crash i've had in a long while no error either that's weird because i questioned how many people were on the server that's why okay no nathaniel do i read books no i haven't read a book since i was 16 probably yeah i don't know whether the team were there oh they're doing hey i changed my gpu clocks i haven't crashed in like a week or something something like that i don't think that was a gpu crash though i think that was just the game being buggy come on let's roll you know it doesn't crash toast yeah i wonder if it was a server crash no the player menu can make you crash it happens when you click it instead of hover and press f really bloody bunny is that true is that a known thing yeah there's nothing wrong with books i just don't read them i don't really i'm not really into books i prefer movies your game just crashed as well joe hmm usually when i got my gpu crashes it was like a directx error so hopefully that's just a random crash because i thought i'd fixed it us personnel are occupying a ship recycling well i'm going to change the calling card never damon powers i'm never going to change it it's important enough that the russians want to take control i think oh we're defending again we get so bored of defending but if you get the flag how toasty do i like my toast i'm like okay so from a scale of naught to 100 75 is where i'm at 50 isn't quite enough anything over 75 i'm throwing it in the bin what's up this firm handshakes from the championship club championship club it's not called that is it the champion the champions club champions club okay let's give this a shot on this map then guard those objectives are you growing up there is that where these this is what you do but we have to slow the enemy force just go up here is what this is what we do [Music] insurgent when you're gonna play insurgency i played it recently well no one's come to a1 have they so you get farmed by helicopters on this map as well let's get going the champions club love you jack thank you the championship club yeah i know

gonna get farmed by a helicopter johnny i can't raise you because you're in a wall and that doesn't count i'm sorry stay away okay i may have put us in a bad position here johnny [Music] hold on wait wait there's a ranger hold on friendly is down don't worry johnny was doc watching one of my videos again what did he watch now okay johnny we're going over here now you can't do that johnny so if you die cross and go over there i'm very sorry i'll cover you oh god no john he's gonna rest me though watch i know he's dead no johnny never dies he never dies johnny's actually got the max skin as well he must have played this a lot have i seen fish no i don't know what that is i mean that might be a problem hold on johnny this is a tank let me really slowly you won't see me die on me johnny go for the res you think you climb it you can beat me and johnny i don't think so there's another one here johnny johnny we have no right to have survived as long as we have here oh he's got the soft lamb as well look at that a legend one of our objectives has been lost oh johnny's on the of our objectives ball under attack okay i think i think we should move down go down there's a tank there johnny tell me i'm sorry hello i don't even know where the enemies are anymore what's going on ruin everything there's a ranger here as well kevin thank you man greetings from argentina what's up you're dead oh come on are you not dying there ranger get him yes johnny johnny there's a man here johnny we all needed johnny in our lives but we do multiple uses as well let me tell you that man just hit me with the ballistic shield and killed me that makes me sad do we need like um you know what seeing as johnny's here i'm gonna run the actually i could do c5 couldn't i it's one on johnny there we go that's not johnny's over there that tank made you dead dead yes yes it did yes it did johnny that's brave and there is a tank right there there's also a lot of enemies across the street which i could get a cheeky little flank on johnny's teaching a class on being a medic yeah it's what he does he's he he plays his sport role in real life as well johnny does i'm very good at it oh i was going for the tang right they've taken where we were before they've overran that so we're not going to get back there unless there's a massive flank going down oh johnny's dead faulty field now there's a lot of bolt is protect yeah for sure there is they took a1 what if i attempting to control alpha 1. i get this and then i can go and put it where i want it we can just fly that works johnny this is a suicide mission just so you know yeah they should be around here somewhere it's fine roadkills johnny johnny johnny johnny oh god oh baby's attacking alpha 2 that was something right please the gun on that is like throwing pillows turn it down i don't even know what that was it's stupid that's pain nothing you can do about that oh johnny's alive how is he johnny how are you alive oh what objective oh the turret literally that man put the turret down oh my god before even thinking about shooting me all right fine turret time fair play it killed me it's fun on this it's born on this spawn on this johnny's dead let's pull on this one on this spawn on this we'll spawn on that then i'll spawn on that then dead okay let's go on this journey and then we'll go we'll do a mission why is there a turret right in front of me that's just deep pain i feel inside of my loins helicopter pilot just decided you know what i'm gonna protect i'm gonna make it look like i'm actually a good pilot then once you've spawned on me jack the only one you spawned on me i'm gonna fly i'm gonna fly into the water tower okay now you might not like it but you're just gonna have to deal with it okay whatever objective is under attack let's get going doc said he wants to call up an rpg with me do you like oh do you know many co-op rpgs jesus i don't know many co-op rpgs do i ever go back and read the comments after a live stream i read them on my videos i wouldn't read the chat i read the comments though yeah like the actual comments that people write when it's a video i mean i i look at the chat and i try and you know respond to as much stuff as i can but of course i'm also trying to focus on playing the game i want the little bird we've been getting unlucky [Music] let's go it has a big initial vertical kick this gun i do like it though go i bet that looked really weird for that player no team johnny can blow the tornado away johnny you see that tornado see the tornado there give it a blow see what happens i see a little bird he's coming to kill us johnny put a muzzle break on it um yeah i could do but the short barrel gives you like insane rate of fire speed doesn't it so i think that's what makes it good yeah i mean i don't think it's as good as the pkp but i just wanted to try a different lmg you know that's all we are duck one two three spawn in that maybe get lucky come on oh we got one up there don't we does it count as combat if you're in the tornado is that why i can't spawn on that dude nice i kind of wish i'd kept my med kit probably the best co-op rpg available would be divinity original sin too it even has remote play together that's cool yeah i know that game but i've not played it i've heard of it i've seen it i just never played it myself let's go i got revenge warzone has at least 50 000 people playing is that right peace and love how have you got those stats i would have thought warzone was a lot more than that right free to play it's on five platforms i would have thought it's way more [Music] where are they pushing from i feel like there's someone over here i don't know what that was sundance maybe johnny have you gone it's a wildcat there we've got repair tools on it [Music] ow you could redeploy with the repair tool it's up to you put that radio on i'm jumped up [Music] nice little strike there ow why did that hit me you had fled [Music] oh is this song available whenever you're ready i wonder if i could go after that i'm going to take it was an in-game radio intron yeah yeah in-game radio has got like all unique songs on it it's cool three kills out of all that there was a couple of spawn beacons there though and there was also a couple turrets so even though it looked like there was a lot more people there when i did that missile run there was only a few i could see that sundance on the minimap no don't go up there johnny that's bad news that's just chaos that makes sense of anything there that dude just go on the stream are you going to make more 2042 videos instead of mostly streams i am going to do videos dude as well but every sunday i think it might change next week because it's the epic game sponsorship we might do god of war next week so there'll be a couple 2042 videos this week rather than streams that makes sense [Music] how many times have i been killed by a balti stefan why do i always play alone because if there's multiple people talking at once right and i'm trying to respond to people in the chat and i'm trying to talk to my friends on discord at the same time it's just gonna get messy you know the amount of talking the amount of voices it's harder for people to follow that are watching that's why i think there's definitely room for you know playing with other people on live streams but this kind of stream for me i just prefer doing it solar defensive positions holding the sector is still under our control thank you oh man didn't pull down enough there do i still talk to bis and azzy i followed them david i don't really talk to them though [Music] because you're in a bush i'm sorry that's just how the game works oh my god no that was the flank just see all those people at the wall oh that would have been so good so big crazy thank you for 11 months man i feel like i died to vehicles more than foot soldiers i honestly think that they'll prioritize infantry gameplay though for the dlc live service well we lost that okay let's see how long i can stay here without being seen what do you guys reckon i'm just prone here you think they'll see me i wish i had a suppressor they're all around me look at the map location revealed by who piss off ranger why are you there ranger oh man that hurts why was there a ranger oh they're the bane of my existence man i think i was gonna get like 10 kills there johnny [Music] get in [Music] he goes up we're going after this helicopter [Music] because if you have to shoot him please shoot make us up you're the best i love you shoot all the red things that goes up let's go i've got this hint here [Music] is that [Music] egg is that place we'll go get it i don't know why he fled so late i just kind of did they jumped out what's going on [Music] good job big zeb proud of you man what are we doing over here [Music] there's another helicopter over here johnny's waiting yes they're down to half straight [Music] and goes up it goes up exactly please excuse that please die oh it goes up i love you you're the best all right we're gonna die now though how is that not a kill what you see what i mean about the attack helicopters being underpowered that's that's obscene isn't it the fact that there wasn't a kill there these are anti-personnel rockets as well a latin thank you for the 10. no matter what game you play it's a good day to see your video thank you [Music] still in there oh no good shot do you think they should put claymores back in the game nope hope that answers your question jack plays on low settings yeah damn i wanted the little bird johnny johnny i'm back i'm sorry there was a guy i'm back should i get the um johnny should i get the rocket launcher you you saw flam hold on let me just try do you like that johnny do you like that was good wasn't it that's good what the jets are at this location oh no i don't have any c5 left deal with that fast who's is that johnny's ranger i think that's johnny's isn't it is this one mine trying to do the pet thing johnny i'm gonna kill myself i'll come back johnny was impressed with that i think maybe he was antonio i'm doing good thanks i'm doing real good so you're gonna see some soft flam action here guys this is going to be great i'll take out all the helicopters tommy we got svk hard then man what the hell why

[Music] did i get hit here [Music] oh that was close [Music] they shot me out of the pilot seat that is the first time that's happened to me that is literally the first time that's happened i've never seen that before so they must have been using the ap rounds um i apologize to anyone that was with me in that helicopter that's crazy i think i was a bit too low to the ground though before he's not right underneath it is dangerously high oh other on the roof the song was getting good too is johnny a random player no he's one of my best friends i've known johnny for 20 years well 20 years he's a good man where were they they were there maybe that's right on the limit isn't it for grappling up there what killed me i'll go on the top i want to do that again because i think there's still people up there and i could try and clear that out [Music] look at all these look at all these bad guys i could be killing oh my god okay here we go that's where i want to be oh my god they saved it johnny you they saved the helicopter it's gonna need repairs though should we just go back in i can't believe it was still going anywhere i can find jack's settings what do you want to know swedish charger because i mean the graphics are just everything on low texture detail on high that's it really 1440p nothing unusual really mouse is 1600 [Music] not many dpi positions remaining holy crap okay right let's think about this 116 tickets i'm gonna put a suppressor on 6k u suppressor i want to get round the back there's people up here though isn't there yeah when i go up that side they're looking at

i mean it's not a popular game to watch on twitch oh is it hourglass okay before zero down yeah my like my my streams for this game and my videos do really well i have a big base though you know i tried to kill the lights before that player i need to be irish as well change uh to irish before i get the armor there we go it's gonna be tough to come back from this i'll give it a go though they really need to do something about those voice lines yeah they do have on they're not very good there's one i'll take it spawning out in the open love it living the dream am i on regular weekend streams dave sunday usually some days when i'm usually streaming on youtube um depending on when god of war's out though i might stream earlier this week oh my god [Applause] i wish i could use the plus system in this game mode there's nothing there what's this [Music] this would be a mighty comeback if i actually managed to win this one wiggle it always wiggles when you get to the scar weird look at the wheel look i hate it it's horrible you're not going to vegas why would i go to vegas chess i don't really want to go on a plane anywhere at the moment to be honest you have to wear masks don't you so if i went to the us that's like a nine hour flight actually longer there depends if i went east coast maybe ten hours nine hours on the way back you have to wear a mask like chance of catching cobia i'm not i don't really want to travel anywhere at the moment i'd go to like local places you know if i was uh away from people i don't think i'm quite ready for a plane yet though i have to hire a private jet i'm kidding oh you're wrecked [Applause] i mean vegas has just had ces is that what you mean that's finished now though isn't it pretty sure that's over i think you have the same gun as me takes a good choice for this as well to get the passive i think i think the armor is more important though across without dying here ah damn it solid thank you for the two reject battlefield return to embrace home front do people still play home front it did have a multiplayer component did it i remember playing the single player and them i think it had multiplayer oh man come on everyone killings just assist assist assist angel is best best what about sean connery there the thing is you can't use plates so angel doesn't spawn with players in this game you can't use gadgets or equipment irish scores with them so i think he's the best pick oh come on like if i changed to angel there's no way to use place angel i'm just gonna spawn with zero armor right whereas with irish i'm gonna spawn with armor say zero and i can't use my place miss the money shot sometimes i get the wiggle wiggle wiggle oh my stupid electric man all these environmental damage things that can get you so annoying my kid has a question for jack since there is a skull icon for headshots is there a belly button icon for shots to the belly no unfortunately not it's just it's just a skull if you shoot him anywhere over the head right that's all you get are you right there are we doing one point behind now okay keep going hello ridicule green what's up hello cash sniper more test thank you for coming guys i think this will be the last match of the day oh please what the heck was that it's the electric stuff on the roof the air conditioning units if someone shoots them they go and do damage to you they like make your screen shake a bit and just generally annoying you know love to not spawn out in the open oh i need to get into a groove again two points behind now it's no good you're cool i'm coming for you buddy please [ __ ] where are the enemies hello yeah that's good he's a guy that's in the lead someone up here i can hear him oh come on how did i not kill you so stupid 14. they've gotta get another kill with a rocket launcher and then the knife kill no no don't you dare [Applause] god for that yeah he was low reload stuck on my screen that's cool he won jj came out of nowhere i think gun game would work best with no mini map spots at all yeah i agree with you be sod for sure how did that rocket not kill him if it's not an almost direct hit everyone it just it won't kill you
