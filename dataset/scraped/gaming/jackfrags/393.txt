if there was one feature of warzone that i would give 10 out of 10 it's the fact that you can hear the person that you eliminate for a few seconds after the fact what i'm about to show you was a simple solo hot drop in superstore i wasn't expecting anything phenomenal but what i got was four kills in a row with some absolute top tier banter on the death comes let's take a look so kill number one i know there's a couple people here i think one's on the roof i'd be mad at this to be fair not happy with that one actually got a wall bang as well the final bullet was through the wall so milliseconds away from survival there second one not sure how i got away with this to be honest i dropped down onto the second level through the door oh there's a guy right there beams me my arm is gone turn around sticking with the semtex his panicking runs back up get the beam just sheer disbelief there from the lad couldn't believe it how has this happened he had every right to win that fight but unfortunately centex it does stick to things including human bodies now this one is rage in its purest form unbridled dick tracy comes out of nowhere wrong place one time switch the pistol get the kill camper not happy with that one dick tracy should go back to detective work and stay out of the war zone and final kill in superstar here got two on heartbeat simply just can't accept what happened there they stood in a window and got killed unbelievable and that right there is why death comes in warzone are a 10 out of 10 feature and i'm sure that many other games will copy that going forward anyway so today using a shotgun the gallow which is basically the sparse 12 from cold war and the as well now the aceval i think deserves a video on its own because it's actually pretty good stodd says that it's the only gun in the game that will beat a ffar in a 1v1 i thought we'd use this loadout in rebirth rebirth is a nice change of pace from the dance last couple weeks for me it's just getting a bit stale but i know they do some kind of mid-season event tomorrow or the day after so i'm hoping that they change some stuff and shake up the map a bit we'll see but the gallow build here it is i've seen more and more people using this recently and you get really fast ads speed and ads walking speed some people put the ember sight on instead but i didn't have it unlocked so i just went with this for these games but you just move really fast and you can shoot really fast it's kind of like you're playing doom it's a lot of fun to be honest anyway i've got two games here on rebirth island great time with the lads tactical brit westy study we were having a laugh getting some kills and just playing like absolutely mad lads really so i hope you guys enjoyed this if you do leave a like and a comment down below thank you and as always thank you to all these guys using my creator code in the cod store jackfrags in caps if you buy anything use my code and i'll get a kickback just a little way to help me out on the channel so with that said let's get into the action now and i think this video will show you why this shotgun is breaking its way into the meta it's really good check it out he's in cell inside [Music] is what you did lucky with his all-american riot shield if you like it get your loadouts get your loadouts [Applause] movement there's a guy on
