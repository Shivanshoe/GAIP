hi everyone hope you're doing well today i've got a banger of a war zone game for you in solos i know you guys like to watch solos typically when i look at my analytics the solo matches tend to have the best engagement the best watch time usually the most thumbs up as well so i thought that i'd bring you guys another solo game and they have just replaced buyback solos with the normal solos and it's a completely different gameplay style from my experience anyway normal solos tends to be a bit slower but i like to push around and buy uavs and attack people go for the kills make it a bit more interesting for you to watch and often that does lead to my demise but in this case it worked out great now the loadout i'm using in this video is the m4 this is how i had it built if you want to copy it i won't make you wait till the end of the video don't worry but this build absolutely slaps it was the second build that i recommended in the recent warzone meta guide that i did for season five what are the most popular weapons which ones should you be using and how to build them now frustratingly in that video i did open up by saying the bruin is absolutely the best weapon in the game right now and i expect it to be nerfed the day after it released a small patch not enough to bruin i didn't expect it to be so soon it's still good and that video is still relevant but the bruin i think now for me at least has been replaced by the m4 and the kilo 141. for me though i think the m4 is the best right now i just think it's so versatile easy to control recoil fast rate of fire incredibly accurate if you use that build too so that is the gun that i'll be using in my loadout in this video if you want to copy that so game starts and i dropped promenade which i don't usually do i just fancy dropping somewhere new this is my first fight i thought i'd stand out just in case the guy peaked again and i assumed that he'd gone into the garage here but i didn't see him the first time he shoots misses and then i knew that i had him to be honest i got really lucky there he just completely missed me gave his position away and here i figured you know what let's go for a assault rifle sniper combo if you can get that early game really strong i did find a uav here too early game uav if you can find it probably the best thing you can get in the game because most people don't have ghosts at this point in the game and if you can see where they are and they're just running around losing like that guy was it's probably going to be an easy kill for you because you can set up get ready get yourself in some nice cover and as soon as you get line of sight put some bullets on target and as i said i do like to go for kills and i noticed this guy over here in the compound on the radar there is another one behind me too missed that first shot hit the second that must have been a leg shot but i get shot in the back so i want to turn and finish the first guy off because i know hey he's only got a few bullets left in him so remove that threat while i can but this guy at the top he keeps facing me this dude wants to fight i'm gonna push here get up in there grill a bit armor up as i'm doing so get in a position where they aren't going to expect me and there it is i guess that that dude might think i would just stay down there behind that big rock but doing the unexpected thing in battle royale games could sometimes be a massive advantage and this dude surprised me didn't see him at all hit it with the flick shot though thankfully i had the car 98 one hit kill headshot and as i shot him i did notice the guy over here in the building used the heartbeat sensor to confirm so i know there's someone in that top room there just checking the loop pick up that d coin aid in case i need it he's seeing me now sorry mate if you stay there crouched in a position like that i will take the opportunity you should too as well crouching movement is so slow in this game so you're probably going to land a nice headshot there so after that fight i thought try and get a bit more central see if i can get a nice power position move back into the zone heard some footsteps and as you can see that ram seven it bounces all over the shop i know i've got the advantage here and they continue to peek and that's an easy kill for me loadout drop is headed in so with the buy i got myself a precision air strike instead could have got a uav but as there were two loadout drops there i knew there was going to be someone nearby popped out the heartbeat sensor and i just ghosted this guy in because i know that that's their loadout and i'm going to have an opportunity where this guy stood still and i can just finish it in one shot there it is bit of patience got me that kill nice and easy and then i think i whacked out the heartbeat sensor again just in case but if you count how many loadouts there are you can tell how many people are going to be around pick up the dead silence always useful in solos get to the loadout and we're going to get that m4 and hdr combo moved into the zone a bit i avoided bonezone but we ended up with this really weird north west circle where half of the map was out but picked up the bounty to get some recon and i know that there's a dude up here somewhere and i do see them running along behind the trees there so we'll peak it and try and get a shot but they're just going to go and hide in the bunker so probably safer to give up on that one so now i'm thinking about where i have to move to for the next zone and working on getting a position of power usually it's a building that you can stay in with a couple of windows so we're headed over to the big building here unfortunately the guy who was my bounty spots me and they've got a sniper there and i need to move so i thought okay i don't want to get caught up in a fight here when i'm not in the zone put the precision air strike down i know then at least they've got to move and that gives me an opportunity to continue going towards where i want to be which is this building and i can just chill out in here for a while wait for the next zone to move so i made it into the building checking heartbeat sensor every now and again nothing there but of course it's quite late in the game now there's only 22 other players left but if you listen out very carefully here that was footsteps running on the concrete outside away from me and i want to try and eliminate as many people as i can whittle the competition down i know there's an opportunity here and unfortunately for that guy in warzone nowadays if you get caught out like that in the open unless you've got an hdr or an x-15 you can quickly one-hit kill headshot someone you're probably going down there so we're moving on and our friend from before who was up at the bunker that was the bounty he's sniping at me this guy wants me dead so i'm sprinting serpentine making myself a hard target and i thought you know what you can have some back mate how about that got the armor break not a headshot unfortunately but i know that that will give me plenty of opportunity to move because he probably won't repeat that with an armored break he's got to go back in cover heal up and i'm using the bridge here as some proper hard cover and the sound of the train too that will do a great job of masking my footsteps if there's anyone nearby they probably won't hear me but i don't want to go up towards the sniper so we're rotating going towards storage town instead there's a bit more cover there that i could dip into being very methodical here checking all my angles moving in bit by bit see a guy in the sky i can't resist that one and then there's a firefight behind me someone's won that i know they've got to come here so i'm posting up take the rock nice head glitch and that one is as plain as day so we'll drop down into the tented area here and it's in a bit of a basin so i know that i've got some nice cover if i get ambushed there's someone fighting up to the east northeast popped up on the radar no suppressor that's given me some intel i see him on the roof i didn't want to risk a shot there because it's going to give my position away and i've got an advantage because i know that guy is over there and that guy doesn't know that i'm here so i refrained from taking a shot there starting to get really sweaty now and my goal here in the next zone is to get under the bridge so i'm using the heartbeat sensor i get surprised there didn't see that guy but straight away put some hard cover in between me and them line it up with the hit marker where with those bullets coming from and here i'm getting a position of power they've got a push the gas is on them so i get a bit of elevation find myself a nice rock and they just weren't mobile enough there they're trapped in a corner and really unless they could have confirmed to kill on me they shouldn't have taken the shot there because they didn't have many options in terms of movement after failing to kill me in that initial fire fight so here i've reached my goal location i've got a ton of big solid cover above me and i'm just clearing this area looking over to my right it's been a bit quiet here so i suspect that there's someone around and that was a very close firefight almost lost that one if you looked at my health i was down to about 10 i'm not sure what gun they had actually looked like an mp5 that should have beat me there but maybe i just got the drop on them a split second earlier or something but as you can see airstrikes have been called in and if you looked at the line of where they were that will give you information on where there's likely to be players so i know that there's some right at the top side of the circle there where i'm scoping in because it appeared to come from that direction and it was attacking somebody along that line but i know close to me i'm clear but down here remember there was the guy on the roof that we saw drop off earlier so i did a little jump there checked it and now i happen to be there in really big trouble now behind that get me down just checking those snipers are looking at me i'm going to hold the angle here i've got a massive advantage now so i'm just going to keep facing dude self resist gets up let me get the finish now there's only two people left but i'm worried about this as we just had a really loud firefight and there's been no other shots in the game so these two people probably know exactly where i am and i've got five people watching me the pressure is on it's on i need to win this match but this isn't a bad spot i'm still hyper aware of someone being right at the edge of that gas where that airstrike came from i don't have many options here but to just chill and i know that the next move will be tough for me because there's not really any cover there to be honest i'm a bit worried that there might be someone above me on the bridge checking the heartbeat again can't believe i didn't see that guy did you spot him right there the dude was just prone behind that line of concrete there for most of the time fortunately they didn't peek and when they did i just managed to spot them take them out but now it's a 1v1 i'm a big disadvantage this guy is a ghost haven't seen him i haven't heard him and then they shoot at me that scared the crap out of me and for some reason they decided to stand on the rock i think they were just trying to get elevation on me finish me off expecting me to just stay prone but if you put your full body in view like that it's a pretty easy kill it's hard to miss that but there it is we got the win really enjoyed that game i think there was some quite interesting firefights and movements going on there and hopefully that commentary gave you a bit of an insight into my thought process when i'm playing solos like this with that said if you enjoyed this leave a like thank you and a comment down below try that m4 setup too i think you'll absolutely love it also we're not that far off the cod 2020 reveal now that's coming on the 26th in warzone apparently i don't know exactly what they're going to do and what implications it will have for warzone but i'm excited to see either way subscribe for more hit that bell and i'll see you in the next one
