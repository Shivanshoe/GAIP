for every console generation dice sets the bar for excellence in audio and visual presentation we are creating epic battles at a scale and fidelity unlike anything you've experienced before that's all we got last night at EA play in regards to what the future of battlefield will be a smoke simulation a building being destroyed a shot that only lasted a few seconds of multiple soldiers running around and doing soldier things and an incredibly realistic animated model of a human head that's it well there isn't anything massive here we can't take what was shown along with other announcements from EA play and make some assumptions about how the next battlefield game might turn out the two most important pieces of the puzzle though of the clip of the soldiers and the destruction of the building but I have to say that both of those clips have raised some questions amongst the community and certainly confused a few people at the same time I think the messaging could have been better but I would guess that most people would look at what was shown here and take it at face value it's obviously a work in progress white box environment and everything is placeholder and what dice are showcasing here is that there will be a big emphasis on destruction in the next game and it's been improved and evolved and also that the scale of the next the battlefield has been increased Laura Morelli who presented this section stated a search for every console generation dice sets the bar for excellence in audio and visual presentation we are creating epic battles at a scale and fidelity unlike anything you've experienced before but what could this mean in terms of gameplay though well it could mean that it's more players per server 64 players is old news now for a lot of gamers and battlefield has been falling short compared to recent games like war zone and fortnight's in terms of play account I'd personally love to see bigger maps and higher play accounts but only if the experience is tailored to that and it works well and everything can stick together from a technical standpoint and perform as expect it the first thing that I thought of though when I saw this next-gen clip on the stream last night was the distant soldiers that you can see on the map Iwo Jima in battlefield 5 if you head out to the far corners of the map with spectator camp look around and just watch there's actually a ton of AI simulation occurring the soldiers have run at each other some fire guns some get shot and some just fall over to their untimely demise now you may never notice it in a match and perhaps you've never even seen this before but it is there right now it's there to add a bit of flavor filler in the background to trick you into thinking that you are in fact part of a bigger war than whatever the playable space is in front of you there's more than just those five conquest flags the clip reminded me of that so is what we're looking at here simply an evolution of that AI simulation that dice have been working on since battlefield 1 or is it insinuating that this is the kind of play account will be experiencing in battlefield 6 based on what Laura said maybe I mean there's definitely more than 64 soldiers they're taking a closer look at these soldiers though and the weapons that they're carrying they are the Japanese soldiers from battlefield 5 that character models head is the same they're carrying what looks like a Mosin Nagant and as I said most people look at that and go okay obvious place hold it but others are confused by this and take it as some kind of official announcement if you look on social media reddit forums many people now think that the next battlefield game is world war again which let's be honest it's not that exciting and it doesn't make much sense and it just won't be but you can't blame them for that when this is the messaging when you take into account the context of where this clip was shown what was said and the fact that it says next-gen right there I think soldiers with generic clothing or just simply wireframe models instead would have done the job and demonstrated the point just as well without causing that confusion in the community the building being destroyed though I think is perhaps more telling with some impressive debris simulation occurring however flag fire pointed out on Twitter that atop the building is what looks to be an air conditioning system installed as well as a satellite dish and it is generally a more modern looking building so does that confirm that the next battlefield game is set in modern day absolutely not but it could be a clue and some people will see it as that just keep in mind that developers use assets like this all of the time it could be a brand new model it could be a model that was made 10 years ago we just don't know to me this is obviously for demonstrative purposes so I wouldn't read into it too much and the model of the head I think it speaks for itself really this is dice flexing their artistic prowess in delivering realistic looking characters on the Frostbite engine with modern animation techniques and lighting I love how there's been threads though suggesting that this could be Blackburn from the battlefield 3 single-player campaign or even Recker from battlefield 4 it doesn't look like either of those characters to me though this could just be based off a developer or a real model who knows some people have even suggested that because of this level of fidelity it means that there's going to be a single-player campaign I don't think the next Battlefield game should have a single-player campaign I don't think it needs one I think I should focus on the multiplayer element and just do that really well but just showing a realistic looking head doesn't confirm or deny any of that the smoke simulation clip just looks cool I guess battles generally make a lot of smoke occur so it seems like dice are stepping up their smoke game now then one of the biggest announcements for me at last night's ei play was that apex legends is coming to steam Nintendo switch and more importantly receiving cross-platform support and I think this is very telling in fact for the future of the next Battlefield game and I do in fact expect it to launch with cross play because if it doesn't it's a really big mistake in my eyes and it just makes sense nowadays to have it if we look at the way the industry is going specifically for multiplayer shooter type games cross play is the new buzzword it's the cool kid on the block fortnight yeah that arguably started the trend a couple of years ago allowing everyone to play together they even got Sony to agree to it eventually and having the option for your game to be accessible on any platform and the ability to play with or against any other platform at the same time is a really big deal the amount of people who've told me that they love cross play in war zone and modern warfare for example is massive because they can play with mates or family members that they haven't been able to ever before so cross play is the future for multiplayer titles I don't think there's any getting away from it fortnight modern warfare no man sky rocket League recently destiny 2 said it's coming as well and EA just announced apex rocket arena and also Star Wars squadrons will support the cross play which seemingly runs on the frostbite engine by the way so it could be that's they're proving grounds for how they can make cross play work on the frostbite engine to pave the way for the next battlefield game to have it - I think it would be cool I think it solves several potential problems that battlefield games have historically run into in the past especially when it comes to lower player counts on older titles I mean on PC there are occasions where you can't find a match that you're looking for but if there's a large pool of players all in it together matchmaking times will theoretically be shorter you'll get into games faster and if the player count is increasing we are getting those more expansive battles like we've never seen before cross-play also helps without - let's say the player count goes up to 128 people per server then that's 64 extra people that you need to find every single time a new game starts and if you're limiting it per a platform and you've got multiple game modes and maps like Battlefield always does you can see how that starts to quickly become a problem wrapping things up I wasn't expecting there to be anything big for battlefield EA play this year I wasn't expecting anything at all but what we got here was a tiny tease that many people will draw their own conclusions from but what's evident is that there is a big level of excitement and expectation for whatever is next and if a few short clips is all it takes to get people talking battlefield could come back strong if they bring out a quality game with that said do let me know your thoughts on the clips that we saw and the information that we received how would you interpret those clips let me know down in the comments below I hope you're all doing well if you like
