finally after what seems like an eternity we've got some new official gameplay from battlefield 2042. dice just released a video it's about a minute and a half long and it's got gameplay clips of four of the specialists we've got mckay maria falc boris and casper it briefly introduces all of them and then goes through some of their specialist abilities and perks and there's a ton of stuff to break down here so we're just going to look at each clip individually have a quick talk about it and look at everything that's on offer so without further ado we're gonna get stuck in first with mckay this guy is an assault specialist and their special ability is the grappling hook and the trait of nimble and in this first clip here very straightforward love how that osprey flies over the top grapples a third-person takedown as well to me this looks significantly better than what we saw in the gameplay trailer you know the original gameplay trailer that they showed back in june just from a polish standpoint it's looking real nice and in this clip here i think this is on the discarded map you can see the the nimble trait for mckay gives increased agility when aiming down sights and ziplining so mckay is going to be a very aggressive specialist great for flanks great for just attacking people head-on next up is maria falg and they've changed this one significantly not just in her appearance but also her speciality which is that surrept pistol there so originally the surrep pistol was able to revive from distance as well as heal from distance but dice shared a bit of insight into this and they said that from play testing and the tech test it was a bit too powerful so they've adjusted things now and instead of being able to revive from distance it will now just heal from distance i can imagine that if you had a front line and you had a couple of maria falc's just constantly shooting from cover for example you're dead europe you're dead you're up in a game mode like breakthrough for example which we know this game has the game just would never go anywhere because people were constantly open there was no ebb and flow to it maybe so they've changed it she was a bit too op now she can just heal from distance but she does have that combat surgeon trait that allows her to revive teammates back to full health she's the only specialist in the game that can do that i presume that means that the other specialists when they revive someone they won't be back on full health next up is boris the russian and this dude has a sentry gun as their speciality and a sentry operator as their trade you seem put the gun down there and it automatically spots and shoots enemies looks like it does a little bit of damage there i love this clip here and his tray actually means that if he's close to the turret it will boost its efficiency so you can put it down and just run away and it will do its own thing but it's going to be quite vulnerable it can be taken out with emp attacks for example it can be taken out with explosives rockets grenades that kind of weaponry but if you stand close to it it looks like it's gonna shoot faster do a bit more damage maybe have a longer range to it be more efficient at spotting those enemies that are a bit further away and then finally in this video we've got casper who is a recon specialist the speciality is the drone and the tray is a movement sensor and the clip here nice little ipad there deploys the drone start spotting people you can actually mark people with that thing for your team and it's supposed to have emp attacks as well but in the second clip here you might be wondering well what the hell was going on here well this is casper's trait motion sensor love the storm effects on this map by the way it looks great they take out an enemy on the bridge with that bolt action sniper rifle and then if someone is near you and creeping up behind you it's gonna be based on movement speed you'll get a little alert you see that little red ring that pulls to the bottom of the screen that's gonna let you know that someone is very close to you you might be in danger so best turn around and that's all we got still no official date for the beta but at least it's something the footage looks great i mean the graphics in particular as i said i think that's a big upgrade on what we saw at the dune reveal looks more gritty realistic more polished i think it bodes well but let me know your thoughts down in the comments below surprisingly this wasn't the only new battlefield thing that happened today battlefield mobile remember a couple months back ea announced that a proper battlefield mobile game was being developed by a studio called industrial toys well they put the google play page up today and it's got a ton of information about the game on there and some screenshots and as you can see i mean it does kinda look like a battlefield game and i'm pretty sure that this is grand bazaar they are having play tests for this soon and i'll let you know a little bit more about that in just a second so there's a ton of info here i'm not going to go through all of it because not be boring but just the headlines so you know exactly what this is so this will have all-out warfare in it and you'll be able to squad up so you and your crew can play on maps that are both new and familiar to battlefield players so i'd say that that is grand bazaar i mean it looks exactly like it so we're gonna have some fan favorite maps being remade for mobile as well as some new ones too we've got tanks we've got atvs and it says large-scale environmental destruction i don't know if there are many mobile fps games that have destruction that's a staple of the battlefield franchise really since bad company so cool to see that it's coming to mobile as well how detailed it'll be we don't know yet so they say that it will have those only in battlefield moments as well explosive spectacles that battlefield is famous for collapsing towers you've got atvs you've got tanks you're going to be able to parachute while firing a rocket launcher or burying enemies under the ground with rubble that you've destroyed making every match unforgettable so it feels like they're really leaning into the dna of battlefield with this game and it is a first person shooter maybe they'll have third person modes but they're sticking with first person it's cool you can have classes assault support medic recon getting a lot of bf3 vibes here which is kind of good i like that and then you can customize your loadout with a vast collection of weapons skin class specific gadgets and more you can personalize how you want to play and there's a little screenshot here with a loadout with an f2000 p226 a small frag grenade and then a couple more options too this will be free to play but i hope that they just keep it to cosmetic stuff right don't start charging for this stuff don't make the same mistakes that battlefield 3 had back in the day because that was incredibly paid to win and it failed so just cosmetic stuff here be brilliant yeah it looks like it's gearing up to be a proper battlefield mobile game we've never really had that before cod mobile huge i think that's one of the reasons that ea have done this and it can offer a bit of a different take on fps mobile games and that can but i'm pretty sure that we'll see warzone mobile too so that's going to be a heavy hitter when that comes on the scene now as i said they are testing this game an additional blog went up with this and it said that they're steadily rolling out the battlefield mobile play tests and they're going to start with indonesia and the philippines and these will begin in autumn 2021 so next couple of months and to start with they'll only be available on android devices but they're going to expand the tests as time goes on onto new devices and new regions so i'm sure we'll be able to get our hands on it very soon and i've just noticed there too it said battlefield mobile is free to play and only includes cosmetic items battlefield mobile will feature its own battle pass collectible cosmetics and unlocks unique to this mobile game yeah it sounds like they're gearing it up the correct way and i hope that they stick to their word the game is built for mobile only so it won't feature any cross play it's going to feature conquest and they'll release a lot of additional details soon a bit closer to the game's launch so there we have it guys thank you so much for watching today let me know your thoughts on the
