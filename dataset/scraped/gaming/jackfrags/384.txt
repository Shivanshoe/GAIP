exciting times guys out of nowhere warzone and black ops just released a brand new sniper rifle the zrg 20 millimeter now this has been teased before but we never knew when it was coming out and they just dropped it it's out now to unlock this in war zone or cold war you have to get two long shots in 10 different matches pretty easy to do there is a blueprint for it and that's how i unlocked it early it's this one here it's called the jackpot sniper so i bought that one if you guys decide to pick that up use my code jack frags in capital letters and i'll get a bit of kickback from that thank you the thing with this sniper though is that it's actually really viable in warzone and i think there is a chance for it to become better myself stud westy tomographic we played a few games tonight and we didn't even have it fully unlocked i think we were using like the longest barrel but we didn't have the suppressor we haven't maxed it out for range and abs speed etc but we were just dominating with this thing hitting some really nice shots so it does have a chance it kind of reminds me of the sniper rifle from halo in a lot of ways but apparently this is based on a real rifle that exists it's an anti-material rifle or something like that so it's super cool that we've actually got a brand new viable sniper rifle from cold war that's competitive and it sounds amazing too if you don't have it suppressed pretty nice default scope on it as well but it acts completely different in war zone cold war so don't let that put you off what i'm going to show you now is the game that we played earlier and this was a fantastic game of quads we were up against it on a couple of occasions i was using the new sniper and the amax which is one of my favorites in the game some nice shots in here nice tactical moves bit of team play it's good stuff if you enjoy it guys leave a like subscribe for more let's take a look at the new sniper round you want to do this actually yeah no good 59

lockdown hello breached about my passport no passport none for you now good games though that's good games this sniper is good even without the combat recon it's like using a pellington without the combat recon yeah and it's good fun because you land the head shots with the combat recon it feels like an lgb3 so when we when when we get the rap suppressor 1400 meters per second maybe well that would be an absolute pog if that was the case i think when you've got it fully unlocked it's going to be very good it's going to be the long range cycle absolutely [Music] you
