hi everyone hope you're doing well today i've got some more exciting hell let loose gameplay for you the last video did really well in terms of the likes and the positive comments so i thought well obviously you guys like to watch it so let's do some more i've been playing a lot over the past few days and what you're about to see are two really intense rounds the first one i'm on the us team attacking with my friends tommy and adam and i'm using the bar as the automatic rifleman really great class and there's two awesome set set-piece moments one where we have to attack the germans in an entrenched defensive position so exhilarating and the second is towards the end of the match when we have to go through the reeds and the water and attempt to take over a big house which is easily defended by the germans so it's pretty crazy and the second match we're in a tiger tank for the germans doing some tank hunting and aggressively pushing up to the front line and i do say it later in the vid but this game is so good when it works so much fun with that said if you like it leave a like it's a great way to support me sit back relax and enjoy yes the br is so good hello that's a sniper he's dead that's a tiger tank i will happily but he'd king him where's targeting uh right there yeah i'm running away from that they're all dead i destroyed an outpost that's a mine there's a tank still oh yeah it's still there i'm right behind it if you can get to me you got a nice rear shot i'm coming i'm coming i hate that tiger tank there's nothing that i want more than that to go i'm
