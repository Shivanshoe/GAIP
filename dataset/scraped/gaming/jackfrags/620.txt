two unexpected things happened to me today the first one was that i found a filter on my phone that makes the war zone characters smile that's it honestly it made my day who knew that they had such pearly whites underneath all of those stern looking faces the second unexpected thing today was this box turning up at my house and having looked inside it i think this is some kind of clue or easter egg about big map changes coming to war zone in season five so we're going to take a look so inside of the box at the top is a letter and it's from somebody called marcus lurch ortega who's a senior officer at shadow company and if i remember correctly shadow company were a group of private military contractors who appeared in modern warfare 2 i think general shepard hires them to try and take out task force 141 but here's the letter at the top it says shadow company but dansk so obviously they're operating in the dance as well this is marcus ortega senior officer shadow company we haven't met yet in this box doesn't mean that we will but shadow companies kept their eye on you in the ao and decided you were worth contacting what you've got here is a black rook as a chess piece it can do two things a frontal assault or a sweeping flank the black rook gives zero shenanigans about misdirection or dancing fancy diagonals black rook is brute force embodied that's us shadow company is called in to clean up the uncleanable messes and take out targets other outfits can't touch we're a magnet for missions too sensitive to ever get declassified and too messy for those who don't know when to bend the rules of engagement to put it bluntly we get the job done the black rook is a symbol but it's also a ticket to the dansk and mr z's doorstep find us on landing montre lurch inside the box is a black rock that is a giant chess piece there it is seems pretty legit but it's hiding something underneath there is a secret compartment and we're going to open that up and see what's inside it looks like that is a usb stick hidden inside so we're gonna take that out plug it into my pc and see if there's anything on it okay so i'm on my pc and i've just plugged it in the usb drive doesn't have a name but there is a folder on it called jackfrags modified on the 16th that was last week there's an mp4 in here 5g tunnl2.mp4 [Applause] what what is going on here so it says 5g to unl 5g tunnel 2 maybe 5th of august 2020 i guess that could be the date for the new season or something happening 11 a.m and where is this place i don't recognize it it's like a ramp or is that one of the bunkers maybe there's definitely a helicopter as well let's watch it again okay so right at the end a helicopter it's really difficult to see but i think that is a helicopter there you can hear it as well the helicopter just drops in and it looks like this fire here and the only place on the map where i know there's like a big shutter and fire is at the stadium so that's what this could be [Applause] weird there is a little beep at the end did you catch that listen what's that little beep at the end there kind of sounds like the war zone countdown as well you guys got any ideas what this means so i've done a bit of digging online and i found out that there were two other content creators who were sent similar things to what i was sent but their usb sticks had different video clips on than the one i had nick mark's got his clip on monday and tp got his clip yesterday i've been sent mine today so i'm going to have a look at the other two clips and see if there's any kind of correlation or connection can we figure something out so this is from monday this is nick marks showing his clip on stream chess piece okay it's kind of heavy look at it it's like a five pound dumbbell okay all right and the top of that computer is a video and i'm gonna play the video this is season five contraband here this is a like 10 second video okay and this is what we got for season five i'm gonna play it you let me know what you think here we go [Applause] that's it one more time [Applause] okay so train hurt getting ready to leave chopper flying by screen shaking so that was nick's clip from monday and now we're going to take a look at teepees from yesterday we got okay we twist it twist it what's on here we got it usb drive [Applause] okay let's watch it what what is happening yo what's gonna happen dude one more time one more oh it time like a is that a nuke dude so if we put all three clips in chronological order based on the time stamp in the top right it looks something like this 10 46 in the morning 5th of august there's a train which isn't on the map at the moment sounds their horn at a helicopter flying over then we switched to 1105 there's a bit of a jump in time inside the stadium there's a loud bang and some kind of explosion no signal and then finally one minute later we can see the helicopter landing and i assume whoever's in there will attempt to enter the stadium and figure out what happened so from that i think we can safely say that it's not a nuke because the helicopter would have been taken out and they wouldn't have been landing a minute later it's probably more like a massive explosion inside the stadium that's going to cause some big changes to the map maybe it was a missile strike from above that hits multiple areas of the map i'm guessing that the stadium will now open up and you'll be able to go inside also the fact that that train is there like i said that train isn't there at the moment on the map i know that a couple of patches ago they added an underground tunnel system and some railway tracks so i assume that the train will be moving through the level in terms of gameplay this could be really cool because it could essentially be a loot train that goes around the map i don't know that for certain it could just be that the train has moved there for whatever reason or it could even be connected to those secret underground bunkers that were added a few patches ago too we know that we can open those up we can get inside them and there are further keypads that no one has figured out the codes for yet those big vault doors there's always been rumors about something underneath the map there's much more to this level than meets the eye and perhaps whatever this explosion at stadium is will change things drastically for whatever reason and potentially open up underground routes we'll have to wait and see you may have noticed something else on those three videos that i don't think is an accident on each of the videos in the top left there is a string of letters and numbers next was 6d tc7 tp's was 5g co ncr sca3 and mine was 5g tunl 2. that's what it all looks like together i've not really done much digging into this so far but i imagine this is some kind of code or a cipher that can be decrypted there's definitely something going on here because we've got different strings there and we would just randomly sent this stuff so i think there's more to be uncovered here also the fact that shadow companies sent us those boxes i'm guessing that they will be appearing in the game in season five maybe they're the people that caused the explosion in stadium maybe they're the guys in the helicopter at this point we just don't know but i think it's awesome that this kind of thing is going on and i always love a bit of a mystery and easter egg so i'm all in with this so there we go do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below what do you make of all of this is there something in the videos that i've missed can you crack that code in some way talk about it in the comments below with that said if you enjoyed today's video leave a like it's a great way to support me if you didn't like it dislike it subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
