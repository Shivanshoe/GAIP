hi everyone hope you're doing well today we've got a couple of crazy warzone games with acolyte tomographic and stone mountain it's a really nice squad buyback quads is so action-packed too and stone is typically hilarious as always but there are some lovely snipes in here and a couple of clutch moments that we really needed to win so i think you guys will like this also i'm not sure if you saw the teaser for season six from a couple days ago underground metro stations are being added to the game and they've got moving trains between them and electricity on the ground these are kind of like fast travel locations i think but you can fight in and around them so be really interesting to see exactly how this works next week as valve that's coming too that'll be a nice fit for war zone i reckon but only one or two days now to wait depending on what time they drop this update there's also been rumors about a potential zombie mode to tie in with the cold war stuff that's going on so keep your eyes peeled for that and i will be streaming tomorrow for the final zombies reveal now before we get into the game just to say a massive thank you as always to everyone using my supporter creator code in the cod store i've got a huge backlog of pictures saved now and if you use my code jackfrags in all caps tweet me a picture of what you got and i'll put it in a video like this one i just released the ghost ghillie which i think is quite nice and of course when the new season releases if you get the season pass you can use my code for that too and i'll receive a bit of kickback if you'd like to support me with that said let's get into the games now i hope you guys enjoy this and if you do hit that like button leave a comment below let's do this we've got a goo like a here lads
