hi everyone welcome back to battlefield one so i released the vid a couple weeks ago and it went down really well and there were a ton of comments asking me to play this game some more so that's what we're doing today this guy looks super pro that's just this sniper now we're playing here on ballroom blitz it's the blitzy it's it's the blitziest of ballrooms so they say and we're going to have a pretty chill time here today i've got the wall that's my rifle here quite a lot of recall on it more than i remember get out of it mate what are you doing down there nitro i think we've got a bayonet on the end as well right yeah i do so we've got a rocket gun we've got the ac grenades there's a little kind of mortar here is that let's see how it is mortar man and a horse horse oh no i just wasted one of my ac grenades though there's loads of enemies coming down look at the mini map right now it's crazy i think if i go around here we could get the best flank ever in the history of ever because that's a real thing i didn't just make that up the gunplay man it's so different to bf5 one more guy there would he okay he's dead i feel like there's loads of people up this hill though at the a point oh look we capped all the flags can kind of tap it a bit was that the horse there throwing the grenade on me well it wasn't the horse throwing the grenade at me it was the man riding the horse it'd be a bit weird if horses just randomly spewed out grenades wouldn't it i'm getting this tank here get out of that tank i don't like that tank it's a cool looking tank got the french skin on it oh look at the boys there this is called world war one they did this didn't they this is what they did in the world war one the great war as it's commonly referred to whoa dude what the hell was that that was thick that red baron there crashing into the side of the building i mean there are people here but i can't oh no no multiple snipers all right hey we got one with the grenade as well check that out they're over here somewhere right nope they've been killed okay i was just about to fire a rocket going to that thing but someone else did the job look at this i'm all covered in mud now and my gun as well check out that rocket gun now just caked in mud so many cool details in this game hmm 10 other people were shooting at me then i should fall back maybe oh god that was cool he jumped out oh no i got a reload oh too many people around the annihilator trench that's a cool gun i kind of want to go back to a and see if i can destroy this vehicle that was easier said and done no that's the wrong phrase isn't it that was actually quite easy to do oh my god the force got it as well oh god that game is so satisfying anyone in here i don't know i kind of wish i had dynamite to be honest we've been bombed oh my god that was an artillery truck or something can i get a shot on it hey oh i missed that guy's gonna be me with that support gun they got the airship look at that everything's falling off it can you hit it that'll do a bit of damage i think three damage okay let's go oh that was too low no way and it's going down are there any enemy bombers i can shoot with this it looks like our planes are just doing a number on their team man what about that sniper there [Music] rocket gun on that sniper where'd they go oh that's an enemy bomber isn't it here we go how effective is the aaa in this game i'm gonna get bombed on i i can feel it coming oh we disabled it did you get any bombs off no is that the pilot oh juicy meat that is a really nasty landing for that pilot nice big red plane though isn't it that it's awesome just keep pushing back to a there's a little duck tank there oh oh you're prone on the ground unbelievable you never see that in battlefield games here let's get in there like swimwear let's do this our support player coming out of the smoke yes i'm going to get mortared am i going to get mortared got gotta put the gas mask on these guys have no idea i'm a little silent assassin in the smoke here mp18 trench that's a beast of a gun that is jack please let me live no oh hang on the big boy bomber here we go yes right just bomb the hell out of this point please don't kill me don't kill me i just need to get some bombs off that'll do that'll do here we go hey oh it's still still so broken although this gun is awful i have a pistol yeah probably better they were over there weren't they oh the sticky grenade got him yes mondragon sniper spawned on a plane and instantly fell out that's what happens if you gotta hold on tight you gotta really hold on tight to the planes and then you won't fall out you'll be okay i thought i'd get a horse how sick is this the animations on these horses man i don't know i i think they must have mocapped them right they're too good look at that is that mo capped what i do remember is that when i did my computer games design degree and we started to learn about animation in 3d programs the lecturers i don't know how true this is look at that playing the lecturers told us that is that gonna crush me that's fine the lecturers told us that if you can animate a horse and it looks good and natural you can probably get a job because apparently it's quite difficult to animate kobe oh no horse i'm sorry i led you to your death does this plane have a gun on it oh god no i've inherited what that was that was weird why did i spawn on a plane that was just falling out of the sky come on come on i saved it though just about although we are very low to the ground could try and get a bombing run off maybe just gonna drop the bombs here i know there's a tank down there we jump out i'll try and take out this tank with my last breath hey and and it's just like it got some health back then didn't it i think that's gonna do it victory yes what a game it is just really fun to hop onto this game it's pretty chill we did it right 46 12. i did kind of run in there a couple times but this is the kind of game that you can play and not really have to pay that much attention to which is why i like it's very casual very accessible very fun i'm glad that people have owned for some quentin's car that made it onto my top 10 battlefield maps of all time quality map anyway i hope you enjoyed this guys thank you so much for watching if you did like it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more
