this guy oh he's going back up clever girl oh i nearly went inside the map there let's go do you believe the cake is alive well it in the context of portal yes it definitely was a lie it was a bait are you guys if you are playing 2042 you got to start using the suppressors that keep you off the minimap it's a completely different game honestly but infantry players if you actually use one of the suppressors that works oh man so good i did a video on it like all the times that you're on the mini map and you don't realize and two of the suppressors just don't work so yeah just try it the two that work are this one the pb heavy and the type four try them out i can get you hold on [Music] oh no really out of all the teammates there no hey death what's up chicken uh val thank you for the

from 10 away have at least damage nerf yeah that's true i mean they work really great on smgs got to start securing sectors cheers for the five how often do i use the plus system between engagements um i use it every now and again like now for example i could put a bigger scope on couldn't i who got me then oh well all the way over there i didn't i wouldn't really change if it was just a suppressor though to be honest with you i don't think i would do that hey adam what's up junior hello james webb suicide what's up man happy new year jack thanks for the great content looking forward to morning 2022. yeah hopefully there's some big surprises next year for gaming fingers crossed i have a bigger scope i actually have a six a 6x on this so can you just say objective quite a bit of

know i don't think all you guys follow me on twitter but june was really good just the visuals the audio i understood everything i've not read the book i've not seen the original movie and it was quite easy to follow along with it i just really enjoyed it i thought it was great is this going to have the good suppressor no it doesn't this is a scar 6k you know it's got both the broken ones most sectors are now under our control just the vector and the mp9 isn't it i think in the smg's that have it try the vector favorite snack while gaming just some chocolate want some crisps so clement too much sand there was a lot of sand in the movie yeah hi jack it's my birthday happy birthday dina you play escape from tarkov moon i i have in the past and i'm intending to play again soon like i know me and connor acula have talked about it he's much better at it than i am though like he's got way more experience so i i feel like i'd be quite detrimental to him damn it just missed but yeah i mean i i want to play it again i need to get back into it i've got like this whole new karma system right which can respawn you back into the game as a scav quicker i think taste it i love that 190 degrees it's gonna go go yeah and go get some run okay no they just both exploded in the side of the mountain i didn't even see that guy yeah june was awesome i need to watch don't look up next and i need to watch um the new venom movie carnage let me be carnage i haven't seen those and i haven't seen the matrix either i didn't see spider-man that was good i haven't seen the matrix oh dude two people in a vehicle maybe oh crap so weird apparently there's one person here guys can you help me out hello i hate armor so much did i see yes i did had some great fight scenes in that the scene with the bus like honestly i think the theme in the bus is like one of the best action moments of the whole year i really enjoyed that movie because it was just it's quite different from a marvel movie like i've seen all of the mcu movies and that one just there's something different about it it was quite refreshing at least they tried what i've heard really interesting things about don't look up some people are like this is this is an amazing social commentary on the current state of affair of the world and then other people are just like now it's just complete crap but like i really like leonardo dicaprio like i don't think he's done a bad movie so i'm gonna watch it look at the range on this ah come on grenade yes i got the grenade right but i should have just held in cover instead have i seen the raid oh yeah dude the raid's amazing great movie some of the best like hand-to-hand fight scenes in cinema in that film just such a simple concept as well you know swat team trying to make their way up a building and everyone wants to kill them there you go that's the movie [Music] that wasn't a good idea it's funny don't look up's worth the watch yeah i've heard it's quite funny i like jennifer lawrence as well you went to leicester square that's awesome i've never been to a theater in london i mean i've been to london a few times but i've never actually like been to a cinema there spawn me on the top thank you what do i think the wingsuit is overkill um i mean i think it's very good so it's a very strong character just because you can get around from a to b so easily right and it's just fun overkill i don't know depends on the context isn't it i found their vehicle 310 degrees come and get me vehicles oh they're both dead what happened i'm sticking out like a sore thumb here on i wanted a wildcat damn it menu's gone now it's weird not having a rocket launcher i'm so dead do you scottish accent it just comes and goes you know i can't just i can't just do it like that whoa hell let's pray please oh my god that guy's got a head glitch on me there where are the penguins the penguins are over on the ice dude they're far far away in the ice i think so hey aiden what's up happy new year man pretty confident i fixed it which feels good you know like i actually hated playing and streaming and just crashing all the time there's nothing worse than that this ever actually lock on i swear the lock ons are broken it worked great with the soft lamps but like anti-air stuff it just doesn't seem to work that well you guys have that same experience like am i out of range here what's going on it's cool to see a jet pilot though actually like you know maybe it's air-to-ground i'm just flat i don't know i give up i just don't seem to work i've got the wrong loadout as well didn't change it since last time i played portal oh vehicles packed do i have a gunner at this time oh no i killed myself the classic slide along the ice the embarrassing slide 400 meters for the air okay that makes sense i felt like i was like almost in that range then you know i was i was almost there with it so not close enough what a terrible spawn man jeez that's awful ozil no problem man thank you happy new year from lebanon he needs to get closer yeah i think you guys are right i just wasn't close enough i do feel like the anti-air is quite inconsistent though you know well i'm on top whoa oh this is sick a slide of shame missing dead angel does it again angel what are you doing there bro well i couldn't actually i could have put c4 on that then don't wobble me off are you coming back jet come on jeff let's go oh my god in the vehicles just leave me alone today please that'd be great other nick what's up man thank you for becoming a member fudge thank you for the five all the best of 2022 cheers my dude thank you i get this tank yeah helicopter let's go for a random jet or something let's go in here that's cool oh good nice little upwards flank there i expected them to keep going around that crate then and just come round and i'd blast them but they went on top instead uh yes thumbs i think i've fixed it i think i've managed to fix it maria get out from under there and help me maria oh no maria that was a nice little kill streak there though enjoyed that helicopter helicopter imagine if i could get past the player loading screen can you not get past that advanced darkness does it just keep loading forever i actually got a little bird i never get little birds what should we just get taken out by a random missile doesn't it hey gabby what's up thank you for coming breakthrough is the worst map i mean breakaway this one that's rude firing missiles at me i didn't agree to that helicopter helicopter i'm dead now can i dodge it i'm gonna go with no and the answer is no to that one and that's why they don't give me the little bird that often you know the poltergeist can i get i can't use the menu [Music] i'm gonna make a you know i've not even done a single c4 jeep in this game i'll make this one my first here hilly got the helicopter doesn't kill me first hey we did it ready let's go baby hey the vehicle carried on going let's go technically you did dodge it i like you i like you a lot the deuce what's up gina thank you interesting way of saying it i like that that's good how do i feel about the ttk i think it's fine the only thing i don't like is the armor there's a little walkway under there i don't think i've ever been there boris was obliterated behind you sometimes that happens to boris you know he can't help himself what's up pixelated tech andy cheers for the 20 man thanks for all the fun moments you shared with us which made me smile while suffering through a heart muscle inflammation all the best for 2022 for all the chat as well have a great new year thank you andy you're a legend man thank you hope you're okay thank you for the 300. happy new year from mexico thank you man what do i expect from battlefield in 2022 i don't know man i think at the moment it's a question mark you know after um how bad the release was they obviously made that statement they made a lot of changes at dyson at ea vince sanpella has now taken over as head of battlefield they've got this whole new studio i think you know we might get a statement or something in january saying this is what we're going to do with the game so it said or they said at least that they were committed to it but that could mean committed to it in a different way so the plan they had before might be different now a live service and dlc you know the whole way the game is presented what we have to play what's on offer that kind of thing yeah i mean it's going to be a really interesting time i mean at the moment i'm loving the variety like i can go and play bf5 i can go play bf1 i can play 2042 i can play bf3 the f4 there's still servers for those games on pc player bases are still good so for me as a battlefield fan in general i've got so much choice and variety and lots of options available to me obviously 2042 is the only game that's going to be getting new content because the rest of them are just you know old games but i think it's going to be really interesting to see what happens what they do with it happy new year from miami hey rex thank you hey ben pieces happy new year from new zealand terry you're already living in the future aren't you mate it's 22 for you gonna go for that helicopter isn't it no i'm dead how many times have i been killed by vehicles as much i'm interested to see what the battle pass will be yeah what are they gonna do an i think they're going to focus on infantry maps that's what i think they're going to do and i think maybe they port some of the older you know bf5 bf1 maps that still look good okay this time i'll try damn it i couldn't get the last one on happening from germany wasn't dave oh yeah europe is um it's midnight now isn't it happy new year to europe there you go one of our objectives is under attack yeah the battle pass isn't even out so like what's that gonna look like who knows the beam i don't want to get shot in the legs anymore underneath me i was getting my tags i'm surrounded right now i'm dead oh god there's so many i was surrounded there was like 20 people i think they could put some of the portal guns in as well all those bf3 weapons could come in i don't really see the the 1942 weapons i don't see them putting those in but i think bad company 2 and portal and bf3 sorry that could work [Music] mvd thank you for the 34 months that's very kind here happy new year we must secure and hold those sectors otherwise this battle is lost oh god that works what the hell [Applause] oh my god what is happening that was sick should we go run some people over oh man good kill sks and ebr yeah they work really well wouldn't they i think sk cbr m416 m3 g3 p90 you know all those classic bf3 bc2 guns they don't work fine unscrew these spawns how did i get location revealed then there wasn't i didn't see a peak anywhere near me that's weird a latin thank you for the 50. it's very kindly man that's a cool sticker i like that because i have a couple bfi maps in portal i don't know how they would spin it in 2040. i mean at this point did they just give up on the law i think in portal obviously it's fine like in 2042 why would you be fighting in like harass or something you know nearly exhausted their resources uh denny's thank you for the 350. happy new year from south africa may 2020 keep it with the fantastic content thank you it's very kind i think we're just about gonna win this one we have majority although the f flag is neutral at the moment good game what's the deal with battlefield mobile i haven't heard about it um yeah me neither i suppose they're just they're just working on it you know when they've got something to show they'll show it all hostiles retreating you've heard your rep today no pants i didn't get any revivals or captures spectacular hey enjoy these moments when they come a good day's worse yeah i didn't get to play mobile i saw some gameplay footage of it it was only available in singapore but i know some people use the vpn to try it from europe in the us i'll go back thank you for the 20. bf mobile looked awesome though i mean they had it was basically bf3 with worse graphics they had grand bazaar on it and the destruction wasn't anywhere near as good of course and the graphics weren't as good but it looked like a battlefield game on your mobile phone that's pretty impressive it had conquest it had a little bit of destruction classes flags all that stuff really let's go let's go hey claw happy new year from australia grandma royale so it's br but it's just maria falc hey mango andres what's up from switzerland how you doing this could be a decent map for the ac i think guys i've not crashed in two rounds how incredible is that is there a vehicle here to lock on to dice i mean what's what's going on there sludge what what the blade runner 2042 oh he's got a shield i'm sorry dog has to be this way where's that dozer on he's taken off his helicopter stop the users from conquering every oh this is so good yeah i'm a sanitator as well one of our objectives is no longer secure mexico in 2042 they could i mean the missions take place all over the world don't they so is this real jackfrags no he's pretending helicopter helicopter oh my god come on dice what even killed me does that blow up that doesn't seem fair guys i have to be honest with you um [Music] ah i thought i could try it terminated i killed myself again i think i've killed myself multiple times already this game tomorrow what's up man how you doing hey leaky what's up ziggy maybe it was a bad idea to go head first against the tank i watch i'll throw this and it'll go up there somewhere oh my god it actually it actually locked onto it i don't believe it it locked onto the thing that i wanted it to what's going on come on what's your video earlier there's a nice nice highlight very good one kill from that ah there's someone on the right oh there's three people there it was a nice animation staggering around before you yes comparison hey jose no problem marlon look on the roof here don't like the look of that storm yeah i tried it a little bit earlier alistair the old single fire mode it's good i need to like you can click it so fast i'm not a good clicker there i started i watched start with it like he clicks it so fast come on let's go you gotta go when you gotta go you gotta go [Applause] where'd you come from what the what the invisible mckay how can the sub show before i talk um like a futuristic technology that youtube has dropped i wish 2042 will have a british specialist with a futuristic longbow that'd be cool a long bow bows are always weird in games though like they're always like really op or just terrible and no one uses them there's no there doesn't seem to be any middle ground there's a sniper there wasn't let's stay here for a bit just snipe there's a little foot there you see that little footsie quite a bit of spread on there i'm actually firing too slowly you don't need to fire it that slow the only thing is like trying to stay on target and accounting for the bullet drop people on the point now isn't it who's over there somehow finally got the kill bing-bong spoon bacon i'm sorry mate that's an enemy what the hell oh this oh that goes back outside i see interesting oh it's so nice to play this game with good fps actually there that was that's the kind of distance where it just excels isn't it oh my god okay okay i'm feeling it oh my god what the okay i'll get it now my game crashed it's still happening why did it happen what's the error don't give me that dxgi oh my god it's the same error graphics driver so i've obviously not fixed the problem have i that's the first time it's crashed in about five hours rc1 draw final ads what does it mean what does that mean [Music] press f to play respects guys in the chat can we get f's in the chat please i was having too much fun wasn't i [Music] i was just having too much fun with the ac and the game went you know what jack screw you you thought you'd fix the crashing obviously you haven't i actually feel sad ac 130 just crashed me out of the game yeah i tried a different graphics card as well before i've done a full format we will continue let's go i mean that helps me in a way [Music] manifest nvidia studio drivers try them i've never used those please no clutchy okay go a bit closer um yeah i need to do i need to change my controls as well nope most sectors are now movement this is weird what the hell where's prone nice for on mass three um weapons and equipment and i'm going to put fire mode on mouse why does it it labels the labels the things incorrectly that's weird so remember what i said at the start of the stream guys if it crashes you guys can all laugh at me well now's your chance i stole your jammies in my squad what a gamer the only difference right is that i'm cloning my game now and sending it to my second pc that's the only difference from like the last couple days i've been testing this recording playing everything was fine and this is the first stream i've done since i've changed and the only difference is i'm cloning but i've always done that in the past except it was on windows 10 so i wonder if i should just install windows 10 because i never crashed on that really every now and again maybe i'll just go back to windows 10 [Music] stay away i can hear someone over here where'd you go let's get killed by the little bird there's a couple people up here isn't that i don't want to get killed by that ranger okay oh there's another one a rambi thank you for the 200 if it's dx device hung limiting gpu so it says for bf helped how do i do that though rambi do i have to use msi after burner medic just run past me angel bro go back to windows 10 yeah it might be the play i might actually do it maybe windows 11 just isn't ready yet took me long enough [Music] these helicopters he has a kill with no hit markers [Music] angel do it again angel just think about the kids is that ranger [Applause] gotcha he's a bar starter okay you can kill a ranger in one c4 did you guys know that actors are now under our control that's pretty nuts happy 2022 yeah we're nearly there in the uk almost there oh my look it's literally there where are you going please those grenades they're weaker than where they started there's a tank on the other side of this happy new year gaming combo what's up man if i had c4 i'd go for it but i don't unfortunately you going okay a buggy game on a buggy os the two would cancel each other great that's just a theory a game theory there's someone on the minimap over here an infantry there's a wildcat there oh no the tank didn't see me what chair do i use how many miller angel doesn't do it again it's literally there's a vehicle right there guys a new record i don't think so mummy i watch out for this wildcat could you drop me some ammo and then i can get some c4 [Applause] please kill that thing it's literally here the grenade just went goodbye you drop ammo thank you i need more ammo they're not there with the electric oh my god as soon as i get a chance to actually kill a vehicle i get shot dangerous animal and milk cow interesting law that guy's body went up there one epidemic do i play suit no don't jacob can you mark the designated smart grenades no you can't that'd be great i talked about this in my video last time i did 2042 like the best thing would be in the options menu just have us a setting for sundance which is like which target would you like to prioritize for your smart grenades do you want it to be helicopters do you want it to be land vehicles or do you want it to be planes or do you want it to be distance like nearest vehicle you know that would be great because then you wouldn't have so much frustration with it just like eating off into the stratosphere for some jet that's on a completely different level you're gonna have to kill that man first it's clear we're good see you later sleep let's jump thank you for going oh looking at the chat yeah i don't have a config on handy at the moment fresh install the windows and battlefield no conflict don't use the lss either oversight i mean it's a lot more stable than it was because it was crashing like all the time like if then you guys watched any of my last streams like the amount of crashes that i was getting i think the next thing i'm going to try is gpu up utilization there's quite a few people have suggested that one of our objectives have been attacked um and then if that doesn't work just install windows 10. where'd you go didn't even see that dude maybe smart grenades have a minimum range and can't target close no they can michael they can they just do what they want you know sometimes they just go you know what screw you nearly every sector is now secure an objective is no longer secure like it's literally a vehicle right now sector charlie it's ready to blow our troops whoop stuff jack turn off the hacks yeah maybe that's why i'm crashing please throw it i'm sure i had one left what gpu do you have um i have the asus strix rtx 3090 yeah crazy j dude that'd be a good solution so you get some visual feedback right so if it's a vehicle that's close to you and you look at it it highlights it in red or something so you kind of confirm okay this is what i want to attack right now our forces control most sectors that'd be a really good solution there's a lot of people down here i think two yeah objective one that's it stone shot attack with four rpgs and he didn't die [Laughter] yeah it doesn't surprise me i suppose it depends where you hit it come on you just face planted there yeah oh come on i expected him to die there i just stopped shooting i was like he's dead i tried updating my gaming chair driver that worked for me tom i haven't tried that yeah that's a good point i should uh plug in a usb stick into my chair and see what version the phone where's running let's go dog commando you can do it oh you can't do it i'm sorry rest in peace and you guys keep your christmas decorations up control 6th of january or do you take them down sooner 6th of january is like the official end of christmas isn't it tactical hot dog i thought i'd fixed it but i crashed about 10 minutes ago so pain i guess all right let's say i have this grenade out and i look at that it turns red i go bang and then it just goes towards that that'd be ideal oh land on top of it i think it would kill me wouldn't it i'll land it on top of it [Music] majority control oh man why is that the helicopter where's that going nice if that was low enough down there that i could have actually look i hate that so much man when you get hit by the little bird rocket it slows you down it puts a slow effect on your sprint so you can't get away so stupid security a little puzz little bird is the most overpowered thing in the game still no objective underground must be great if you're a little bird pilot playing this game who's actually good at flying you get so many kills and just almost never die if you're good hey ml what's up we're at half strength a different angle now they know that i'm there god i don't want that back on the back thank you stay here hopefully they'll run over the top of me hello goodbye [Music] can hear someone try and capture this so fast i'm dead i tried to slide around the corner stu i don't think that's a good idea hello roost and roll how you doing man isn't it better to use it in single fire mode i think it depends on the scenario and also like i'm being lazy i can't click that fast i don't want to continuously click over and over again on target though isn't it wow okay that was awkward there's still someone here no they're dead [Music] that must have been the helicopter right yeah i think it was happy new year parachute thank you for coming resident evil village here you go that's the game it was done careful of the cryofreeze damage that that slows you down as well [Music] do i die here again this is where i die run past me uh such a big point isn't it it's amazed trying to find people here there's two people that's where i've been fighting my entire life on this point oh it's going to kill flick and turn hey colin deeply disturbed me one again no crashes okay everything's fine you got fireworks going off in sweden i suppose in seven minutes i told you to keep up isn't it 2022 in most countries sometimes they just line up for you sometimes they just line up for you the health steam gadget i haven't really used it at all jacob what's up nathan happy new year dst thank you i didn't realize the grenades regenerate the smart grenades do what's with the title i'm just saying that it's almost 20 22 that's all one hour six minutes in the uk yeah we're nearly there sally let's go hey joe what's up dylan still rocking low settings yeah of course i've got high textures on everything else is low that's good roberta i've been here from greece thank you greg hey josh 5 30 on the east coast yeah you americans have got a fair few hours yeah haven't you thank you lloyd so i5 is my bottleneck yeah this game is very cpu-bound blue dreams i went from a 10 900 k to a 12 900 k and i got like 60 fps more like it's insane i don't want to do a water again did that to start hey lucky play more insurgency please sure [Music] i think everyone gets memory leak eric hey daniel torres happy new year man let's go kaleidoscope take it how was my holiday i'm really had a holiday joel i don't really take holidays i mean i've had a little bit of a break over christmas like just seeing family and stuff but still working on those days way more hunt putrid i was actually thinking of playing hunt tomorrow like doing a solo video because i realized this today i've posted a lot of hunt videos on my channel right but most of them are just like montages and clips and best moments i've never really just posted a full game play so a lot of people who watch me are probably like what the hell is this game and they're watching the clips out of context and don't actually understand what the game is and what's happening i thought well to alleviate that i could just do a full solo gameplay commentary so if if i get time tomorrow i'll try and record that i might be a bit rusty though because i haven't played it for a few weeks but we'll give it a shot we will give it a shot coffee or tea i like both i drink a lot more tea though coffee is more like a going out thing like i don't really have much coffee at home i have a lot of tea at home coffee's more like you know you find a nice coffee shop you need to pick me up go get yourself a latte espresso that kind of thing a tease any time of the day although if you have it right before bed you might have difficulty getting to sleep what's the caffeine makes you pee keeps you awake a little bit big joe bean thank you i hope so yvonne i really hope so oh thank you daryl those guys get killed how is that a trade kill just headshot me colby it'll be interesting to see what they do i think they're going to keep one to eight but i know 64 players is quite popular so the thing is they've designed this game around 128 players all the maps all the marketing so they're not just gonna get rid of it you have to consider all that kind of stuff i haven't even got kill yet however apart from that trade kill doesn't really count i feel like i'm on a losing team i need to put a suppressor on as well he's on the map there that's why i need to put espresso on not tried it yet phasia not tried it hey david i've been following for years looking forward to another year of content thank you yeah i said this earlier i'm really happy at the moment with how things are going lots of variety on the channel you know like how many hold on let me just look through the videos that i've done recently like there's a lot of variety like battlefield 1 2042 insurgency warzone battlefield 5 ready or not hunt showdown hell let loose ready or not warzone super people warzone battlefield 2042 2042 warzone the resources are dangerously low halo infinite yeah i'm enjoying it i'm enjoying making content right now this server is absolutely chalked on that team hey sharks health healthstim would have been good there yeah it would tell you let's go it's a walking steakhouse happy new year what did i have for dinner mcdonald's m5 doesn't have the non-bug suppressor entries oh no not manifest i want to play discarded rush in this game can be fun yeah i think we'll play rush on sunday sharks i'm going to do a video tomorrow and then sunday what's happened here is it's just chalked and then sunday there's another battlefield stream i'll probably play rush i can't do anything how was going on there that's weird let's make some trouble no not orbital i don't know if you guys know this by the way but you can see what map you're loading if you look down here on the right orbital he's putting me on the same server there doesn't it arthur yeah i think that's going to change though i honestly i think they're just going to go hard on the inventory maps in the dlc [Music] renewal already played that though didn't i hey gemma what time is your vid tomorrow 6 7 p.m maybe i could play kaleidoscope although hopefully it's not that same server we'll see if it's a new game i'll stick it happening you know i've not tried gtfo david i've seen gameplay of it it looks quite complicated but it seems like they've changed it recently okay it is a different server so we'll stick with it um a short barrel i mean there's no difference there is there is it just cosmetic for this gun i don't know i think it's just cosmetic weird though i think a lot of those attachments are just bugged they're not working correctly also that doesn't sound like it's suppressed at all does it it's the game still 20 to 42 fps it runs like dog war on my 360. they've not really done anything for optimization so you need a pretty insane pc to run with good fps so if you haven't played it in a while your experience will probably be the same optimization optimization's gonna take a while you have to brute force it with this game it's the only way to get good fps you just have to spend a lot of money which sucks i hope i really hope that they improve it mbg 10 i was in your last game you killed me oh my god you camping [Laughter] listen it's an objective it's fine we've got to approach that from a different perspective different perspective an air perspective can you go a bit higher up please where you going buddy oh my god you're upside down donnie what are you doing you know you can practice flying against bots you don't have to practice in the main game i'm a ninja strangely staging attack on blah blah hmm i would like to get a kill did you guys watch boba fett what do you think of it nothing really happened in my opinion it just it's like a setup episode doesn't it it's cool though it's just like okay what's next there is a vehicle over there located 190 degrees 110 meters away go no it's gone backwards i'm trying on an air vehicle right now is it gonna see me keep shooting up the air vehicle got the blinds on come on dog let's go made him seem like he was a badass yeah i mean boba fett is about us that's the thing though is he only a badass because no one really knew much about him because of the mystique behind it like he had like one line in the whole original trilogy and then otherwise he was just there in the background being a bounty hunter is that why he was cool he's doing a series about him actually gonna remove that element because they're gonna have to do him as an anti-hero aren't they they can't make him a goodie that was sick oh they're all bad guys i didn't even realize there are half strengths proceed according to plan yeah i mean if you you've got a good point title like these kind of shows when they're all out you can just watch them back to back to back to back so you could do like six in a row and then the first episode wouldn't feel so hollow would it because you'd just be like bam straight into the next episode wavy davey come on wavy david you got this baby davey wavy dave you got three seconds legend look at this guy absolute legend am i doing a count there no no we've got another 51 minutes to go though oh my god we captured all the points look at that didn't i just click a2 did i just not click that did someone hang on there's someone here isn't that they're trying to snipe me i'm going gonna give him a chance come on this is a clip you can do it i believe you just gotta hear me come on line up the shot shoot me once in the head it's simple simple as a pimple you blew it nice try what hit me then i think that actually got me on the grenades that was good i bet that guy's confused like what the hell just happened [Laughter] we've lost control of one of our objectives well i messed around on this game hey gabe game what's up it would have been sick if you hit me yeah i was giving him a chance you know giving him a chance there's someone else here the back here they jumped oh man i'm coming after you there they go one of our objectives ah wrong way i had a 50 50 chance we won one on that point a nice little kill streak though though enjoyed that hey sean i use the close rounds yeah they're the one that fire really quick do i not have those on these bad boys then i want the standard extended mag there like that good a bit more recall on them though isn't it why why is it turning to kuwait you see that i was like sliding along the ground oh god [Music] that's not a good look for me is it clown field yeah there's a new game out called clown field i think i saw a video of it it's a real game apparently i've not tried it though i think it's on steam myself thank you very much for the fire man yeah i'm just testing out myself it doesn't work the video is correct it works um if they're more than 10 meters away you know so it does have its potential uses it's not completely useless what the hell what even killed me then was it you like that was so weird i think they blew the box up behind me and it damaged me it just felt like i died instantly in mosquitoes okay gemma it's your birthday tomorrow well happy birthday for tomorrow gemma you're born on the first as well a new year m5a3 okay i'm going in a bit too hot here aren't i they've taken overland rock went right just got

been months now there's nothing left to say play or don't nobody cares do you have to put into a lot of effort to fight vertical recoil with the ak yeah it's got quite a big kick on it you could take the grip that reduces it a bit i'm good thanks patrick easy in easier it'd be different wouldn't it if the characters were like this like grizzled veterans don't be sad sometimes just works out this

buddy it's very kind you yeah thank you for the five man loving the sticker we're already in 2022 not me please was so disjointed everything that happened then stop the u.s forces from conquering every sector ready ready what do i do outside of youtube work that's my life i mean it's i don't know what to tell you oh my god you just keep getting killed by vehicles over and over and over again [Music] marcel thank you for the two stream to the new year i can't i gotta go i guess this is just a big vehicle map isn't it unless you go to the ship here's something edgar thank you for the 19. will i be playing on ps5 anytime soon you know what i've not even considered it i would like to try though i keep saying this for war zone and for battlefield because apparently the experience is just like so different on console only the worst thing about this game on console is that there's no aim assist that's what people have told me anyway i don't know that for a fact but that's what people have said to me there's another guy on that are you boys are sliding into my bullets here you don't want to stop doing that excuse me i need to watch that back right that boris just literally appeared out of nowhere on my screen is that what just happened am i going crazy it literally just that boris just bent into existence am i going crazy or did that just happen just bang boris suddenly boris is my perception of reality different to the truth can someone watch that back please yes he did just appear okay right i'm not crazy i mean i am a little bit crazy but okay oh no behind me this is what boris do hey me boris hey no problem boris he can teleport the round map no problem i put turret down here i teleport here everything okay that's just boris that's what he does i just got burst yeah goddamn why can't i see his dock through the wall how no recall you just pulled you just pull down deep space literally just pull down it's very easy on pc to control recoil i was about to do a demonstration on how to control recall and i've been blown into smithereens instead what a ton of events that was wow i mean it's that easy you just look at the recoil pattern so i'm not going to control the recoil here so it just goes up and to the right so all you do is just pull down to left that's it it's that simple you compare that to that position mark let's go well we've got sonic power what's going on here what you got going on in your life there's a camera here there's a camera there there's a camera there tell the people what's happening nothing okay you haven't got a movie to promote or anything netflix hbo max new album on spotify no nothing okay i think that's why a lot of people watch like warzone streams and they go oh my god he's cheating he's got no recoil look at this there's no recoil they just don't really know how to control it or they play on console maybe you can put ads on affected as well and that makes the recall look less than it is uh here's the loadout if you want it you can use the extended mag as well that works fine standard extended controlling recall on a controller is completely different to doing it on mouse look at that all i'm doing is literally pulling down the left and keeping like maintaining the target 83 meters that was and i absolutely nice i absolutely beam that guy isaac we were just talking about boba fett like that that's probably the limit i think for full auto like with that gun at least we've got the trade kill i might get a res though there's a teammate nearby or there was until this giant hunk of metal showed what the hell they're drawing on reinforcements some weird noise going on what's that is it aliens am i dying i think it's okay you guys hear that weird noise that was strange were you able to fix the crashes um well i'm i've crashed once tonight whereas before i was crashing like all the time so that fixed goodbye nice knowing you i like having c5 it's good boy i bet you guys couldn't hear it could you so weird a weird fight it's the mother ship they're taking me back home it's not my time to go though i've still got things to do here there's still memes that i need to create one of our objectives why have i got reload on my screen permanently us take a bite thank you dan what was that person doing egg they were just living their best life you know sometimes you get in a bowl you drive upside down and you drive backwards and forwards and then you die you know that's just the way that's just how it works out sometimes don't be sad just having excess sometimes well there is enemy everywhere stay away no stay back no please the reload thing is a bug jack you're one of my favorite youtubes thank you dan it's cool to be one of your favorite youtubes i appreciate that what's up p2j2 how's it going man hey jf i'm jacob again hello should've used the emp grenade that's it isn't it there's always an option available but at the time you never think about it i need to be more

gone through this before haven't we i'm told anton thank you for the 10. cheers buddy can you do livestream the warzone more often look from indonesia yeah i have to be in the right mood to play it though warzone is um it's a funny one has to be the right time of the day as well because if you play warzone in the evenings um every lobby is just hell the game isn't fun because everyone is like a clone of you basically imagine imagine that calling max it wasn't i can't remember did we just go with rover maybe we went with rover just want a little bit more control on this sometimes so annoying on pc no no it gives you the point you got that my name is turtle mike i'll leave in the sea but i got access to a computer now just play battlefield all the time from on the site i'm terminus me and
