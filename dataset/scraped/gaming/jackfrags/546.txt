i can't believe that it was that long ago but i first covered squad back in may 2015 five years ago as you might expect a lot has changed since then but recently the game has hit version 1.0 and officially left early access that's right it was in early access that entire time and i thought it would be a good idea to jump back in and take a look now it's released at what's changed if this is perhaps your first time seeing squad it's an fps game that relies heavily on as the name might suggest and it leans extensively towards simulation within reason there is a chain of command that you've got to try and respect and it's important to work with your team and your squad to actually stand a chance of winning squad is an incredibly in-depth game it's complex the maps weapons and vehicles are all meant to represent realism so i personally think that you need to spend quite a lot of time with it to really get a feel for how it's supposed to be experienced even though i've played the game before enough has changed that i did find it a bit overwhelming picking it back up again there's no doubt that there's a lot to take in when you've been playing faster paced more arcade based shooters for a long period of time there's certainly a steep difficulty curve that you've got to try and overcome and that takes time and practice and that's not a criticism it's just the nature of this game and i think that's a good thing that's why players love it because it's incredibly rewarding when you've spent the time learning how to get the most out of it so the recent update on the update that took the game out of early access was aptly called 1.0 with this update a new map was added as well as a new faction and an increase in the maximum player count so let's focus on the new map first fallujah this map is extremely substantial and it's something that's been worked on in various iterations for a number of years squad started as a kickstarter project and it's very much a spiritual successor to project reality which was a realistic battlefield 2 mod even back then there was a map called fallujah west that would be the inspiration for the new map in squad it was a really impressive feat to get a map of that size and density working back then on the battlefield 2 engine but i think it's just as impressive today as well squad is built on the unreal engine and i remember a time when it first hit early access where the performance was well let's just say it left a lot to be desired playing fallujah today though i was impressed at how well it ran maxed out at 1440p i appreciate that not everyone is going to have a top end system though and so lower to mid end may struggle a bit more but the game has come on a long long way even the developers themselves have said how much of a learning experience it was for them over the years getting more and more out of the engine so back to the map at hand fallujah i spent pretty much all of my time on this map because i really wanted to experience urban fighting i feel like that's what this is about it's not the first urban map though for squad but the scale of this is vast it's genuinely massive around three years ago the developers made an article talking about this map and mentioning it in a future road map since then though they made a decision to restart it from scratch and so a lot of blood sweat and tears has gone into getting the final product into the game fallujah has three times the complexity and object count of any map in squad and it shows when you first run around the amount of buildings here is impressive in itself the mosque especially well done but there's more than that road signs overturned convoys destroyed buildings and they all work together to give you that feeling of immersion and as you're moving around the map you can hear explosions in the distance or bullets ricocheting all around you it's hard not to be impressed the layout of the map though is also based on the true layout of the city supposedly based on 2010 imagery the scale of this however is roughly two to one this meant that the team were able to use real-life photographs as direct references to build certain areas but it left them with enough freedom to ensure that those areas still made sense from a video game gameplay perspective it's also split into districts and there are so many of them that you would probably run around the map for hours and hours and still not see everything i was blown away by this while fallujah is no doubt impressive we should also mention that squad as a whole has 20 maps now which i think is quite a lot for a multiplayer game especially when you consider how a lot of these are extremely large the player count is also now at 100 which allows you to join games of 50 v 50 and when you're on a map like fallujah that's almost a requirement thinking back when i first played squad i'm talking about the really very first version of the game i don't think there were even vehicles in it and then slowly but surely they've started to add them in now the game not only has transport vehicles but armored vehicles too there's a damage system in place with weak spots as well and there are even helicopters in the game now so for those vehicle junkies out there there are options the amount of content now compared to a few years back is almost impossible to go through though in a condensed video like this it's changed so much in terms of refinement in the core gameplay mechanics as well as just a ton of new stuff improvements to player movement audio fixes crash fixes network performance user interface you name it it's all had a big improvement weapons like the spd and vehicles like the caf and of course the middle eastern alliance have all been added recently so you could be forgiven for saying well the game has been out a long time so all of these fixes and content additions should be expected i suppose you'd be right but the road map for the game hasn't just ended now the game is finally released and currently on the roadmap there are changes to the graphics settings helicopter improvements spawn changes new vehicles new weapons as well as another new faction the usmc and there's a new map coming called the black coast and even amphibious vehicles and that's all apparently by the end of the year if everything goes according to plan and next year there's more of the same i feel like i should also mention that the game has a strong modding community something which makes sense considering the game's own existence stems from a mod for battlefield 2. when you've got a game that allows custom created content user generated experiences you're always going to have the potential for some great community made items i've even seen an early build for a version of wake island for squad and while that doesn't exactly fit with the theme of the game because it's modding you're free to do whatever you want and make up your own themes there is a custom server browser section too so players know if they're jumping into an official or user generated content wrapping things up i had fun coming back to squad it's not gonna be for everyone though it's pretty unforgiving at times but i think that's also what makes it great and why it has that niche appeal i do recommend doing the tutorial though one for infantry play and one for helicopters the training area not only teaches you the basics much like any other training area but it also gives you a better understanding of the maps squad play and weak spots on vehicles it's pretty in-depth but it's worth your time if you want a better clue of what's going on and need to be brought up to speed once you're ready though if you can get on the right server with the right bunch of players or some mates i think this can be incredibly rewarding and satisfying to play even better if it's like i said with people that you know don't be shy though the community is quite welcoming it's taken a long time for the game to officially release but it's got a healthy player base and a developer that's keen to keep adding new content and that seems like a strong combination to me sadly as far as i can tell there's no news about squad releasing on console anytime soon but perhaps with the release of the next gen consoles and the massive leap in performance over the current gen maybe the developers could be enticed to put the game on console platforms eventually and with that said that is all for today guys do let me know your thoughts on squad down in the
