hi everyone and welcome to dying light 2. looking forward to this playing today on pc maxed out graphics all the ray tracing all that good stuff turned on it's gonna be good fun and this will be part one of my walkthrough of the game [Music] enjoying the music very good welcome to the stream or the video if you're watching this as a vod [Music] appreciate you guys all being here now i didn't really play much of the first dying light game i have to be honest with you guys i think i played it for about an hour [Music] but i know what the gameplay is [Music] as well before we get started today a big thanks to the epic game store for sponsoring this one you can pick up dynalite 2 on the epic game stores linked in the description below and if you get that or any other game do consider using my creative code jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that without further ado get stuck in hope you guys enjoy this [Music] 2036 not that far away really is it 15 years after the fall this game's been in development for like five years right it was a quick boy oh it's pretty you still got it you know this game used to be more fun and you used to be younger i ain't dumber what matters is you steal just as fast because the slope yeah yeah a dead pilgrim yeah i know i know get up here i want to show you something yeah i know i know the pilgrim's path [Music] we just ran through that tunnel and jumped over this massive gap apparently i mean that's a that's a big big jump right there so i can't sprint or anything it just does it automatically hold to jump farther i'm gonna make that oh just about [ __ ] man you're still strong i presume that that's the guy from the first game is that right is that right chat okay okay apparently this man can jump a lot further than i thought thanks it's good to see you spike how long has it been far too long but don't get all mushy on me now come i want to show you something where are we going you'll see it's incredible the zombies are still down there most pilgrims don't last two three years on the road but you've been kicking around for what four years now and you're still alive what's up danny hey blip blop i know but i'm [ __ ] awesome yeah yeah right right seriously i wish i had as much energy as you got a new lead on jane now trail went cold after new paris which route you take through pains of gary what a [ __ ] some five rickety huts left and a ramshackle fence nobody there had heard of her so she must have gone to gary in that case i'll head north so he was in the first game was it he just looks different a beehive full of honey can't let an opportunity like this go to waste oh no way a beehive full of honey if we're lucky there's chamomile growing here too chamomile is how we pronounce it in the uk chamomile interesting so i think it's got co-op as well but i can't play co-op yet you have to get to a certain point press q to use your survivor sense oh there's some up here as well so i know that there's a lot of crafting in this game the man's got a wall hack i mean isn't it a bit dangerous to just put your hands on a beehive like there's no way i'd be doing that in real life you know what i mean would you guys do that i wouldn't do that i suppose it depends how desperate you are right you remember that old herbalist we helped escort to her village oh yeah the one that had that saying uh remember chamomile and honey are gifts that keep giving combine them and lucky you you just might go on living okay it's crafting then medicine blueprint received a new blueprint press eyes to go to the crafting menu blueprint supplies that allow you to create accessories consumables and weapon modifications using various craft parts this is where you store all of the craft parts that you collect oh there's quite a few there hop over the medicine blueprint hold and craft it a natural bomb that helps and tribulations i've had my share you going through here this is it come on you can hold handful of bees without them stinging you i suppose you can scott yeah wow somebody had a nice crib that is a nice crib damn it locked i'll try to get through here you check the other side take anything we could use yeah sure sun's looking a little low yeah i guess it is sun's getting real low big guy in here zombies hello guys i'm scared of the zombies oh there's nothing there i got debated what about this basket why would you put a basket in the kitchen nothing here in the fridge oh my god nothing in here is the game trolling me or what what's that rags [Music] i nearly missed that leather so it's all about crafting i'm gonna hoover all the things up the last spring party 2023 party but by then the gre would have long since lost control of the virus well they were obviously having uh end of the world party weren't they five years later he remembers haran haran is the name of the virus isn't it is that right uncommon valuables it's a good sound that is i like that a piano rats it's just some rats yeah just rats i think it's time we parted ways why i'm starting to worry about you and you know i'm saying you're starting to worry about someone it means it's time to go what you're breaking up with me we've only just started the game rice did you guys know that the cost of rice is increasing in the real world it's gone up by like 45 or something stupid how crazy is that resin okay i think we got we get everything yeah i think we did [Music] i like that sound there's some art here guys look at this and that's what they called art iran is the city okay i wonder how the wine tasted back then the voice actor sounds a bit like troy baker but it's not troy baker it's a guy i think his name is jonas something is that right who do you voodoo sounds familiar who do you voodoo you remind me of the babe what babe the baby with the power i'm searching all the things i'm sure there was something there not a zip hide area i'm gonna have to hide in this game aren't i see i bet if you played the first game you guys know all about this stuff don't you uh dracken thank you for the ten man polish game greets from paul and jack have fun thank you draken that way or this way i mean at the moment it's open thing simulator i'm here i don't i mean i don't mind it like it's a dead island reference because they were gonna make dead island too weren't they but then that just never happened and they did the trailer and everything with the guy running on the beach i remember that i remember i'm glad that you guys are here so you get all the references oh my god look at this so this is their birthday party or end of world party they were having [Music] [Music] the music is is good i like the music i'm sorry dave goodbye sorry dave everyone say rip to dave in the chat there's nothing like a party to celebrate the end of the world they died on their own terms let's hope we get that lucky too yes dave i'll see what's upstairs you check out the garden okay oh my god i mean it's not shying away from the graphic nature of the zombie apocalypse that's occurred end of life party yeah that's sad look at this what were they doing oh they all took pills as well oh no they just killed themselves it's a bit of a morose way to start the game isn't it [Music] that's mindy and brian i know those they're right there look at least they had each other rest in peace mindy and brian in a ring now i thought i could interact with something in there she was classy she was classy let's party we're all gonna die what what [Music] i bet these are all developers these three here dearest mary i'm sorry i ran from you they say that once the virus makes you turn you're gone forever that can't be true i know you're still in there underneath all that pain and disease i'm coming to join you no more running god come here check this out he just pocketed that didn't he put that right in his pocket i'm taking that thank you i was there to dj a death dj as well what would be your last song difficult question isn't it yeah it wasn't nice places they've got solar panels end of the world party sit down buddy for you a gift a gift from the heavens a baseball bat hello i've just found it by the only dead body may it be more used to you here it's gone flat look at you in your sophisticated palate drink drink who would have thought the end of the world could be so peaceful yeah at least until night falls true i wish crane could have seen this who doesn't matter [Music] some great suggestions in chat here guys i'll track down that guy for you [Music] feeling good nina simone hey what and you're only telling me now when i tossed your beer thought you guessed right away we're celebrating the guy's in villadore supposedly he knows something about waltz waltz who's that fill the door i saw him that close huh okay i got a favor to ask you you deliver this to gary it's on your way people don't like pilgrims there but but they pay well and where do people like pilgrims well they're afraid of us everyone does their best to survive maybe when something needs to be transported through the hordes of infected then suddenly they're knocking on our doors all right but you owe me one i feel like there's lots of references to the first game here that i'm missing you guys all know that you guys don't know so what about that guy well i talked to him over the radio he didn't tell me his name sounds like he's got something to hide see that antenna on the hill that'll help you contact the informant he'll be listening for you at dawn on a frequency of 140.200 megahertz totally hear from you soon [Music] what does he want to return didn't say but he didn't sound like the kind of guy who does things for free i don't think that kind of guy exists what what about me you're an old fart who likes racing me and makes me ask around about his crazy girlfriend hey hey hey she's not crazy jane's just maybe well a little hot-headed and she's always getting herself into trouble but if you could get a load of her all right still too early in the evening for that sort of time eyes i was gonna say eyes beautiful steely huge never heard anyone get so worked up about gray eyes because you don't know [ __ ] about the world let alone women yeah you're probably right i'm telling you i'll finally find jane we'll set up a house we're going to live there no one's going to drive us out and i'll stop wondering like a [ __ ] i'll drink to that some flat beer let's go wee you you could have at least smashed it and that waltz what's his deal is he family no not at all then why are you looking for him will you tell me sometime yeah yeah one day well my time's up so when will i see you again huh in another two years maybe take care man i hope you find that wall sky or whoever you're looking for and remember 140.200 megahertz at dawn the guy's waiting for you 140.2 zombie fm so some people in chat are saying that this is set 20 years after the first game [Music] i've got baseball bat now i gotta go over there okay [Music] a little park there i suppose thinking about it it's probably a good job that they threw the beer in the pool rather than smashing it because if they smashed it it would have made a sound and then the zombies would have appeared five years after the first game i mean there's conflicting reports in the chat here guys hold tab get to the radio antenna oh it's all the way up there 15 15 okay it said 15. it was 2036 isn't it so whenever the first game was set i can hear some screaming going on down here guys i don't know i don't like this you know also i am playing this with mouse and keyboard but i know some people have said that it's quite a good controller game but i'm gonna try mouse and keyboard today and then tomorrow we could try controller see how it goes um oh god can i just drop in here apparently sir you get a lot of oxygen stealth mode i feel like there's going to be some zombies here though because i could hear them there's one there so whack him ah biters zombie do i do more damage if i go for headshots that looks like scarecrow from batman what the hell stay dead i'll do it grappling you can get a grappling hook in this game what [Music] hello oh that's cindy cindy it's nice knowing you in real life oh my god cindy your head's exploded some resin headshots are a thing okay how has he got room for all this stuff man i'm gonna have so much inventory [Music] is there anything on the dock no it does not like it alcohol i get everything no there's something over here there's another beehive on the wall i'll just put my hands on it no big deal if you walk up behind zombies you can do a stealth kill is that right kevin i wonder if you can turn off the health bars someone said i think you can yeah i think there's an option if you want to play with more of a hardcore vibe you can do that takedown oh is that what you were talking about interesting chris thank you for the 22 man when am i streaming tomorrow about the same time can i just check these crates here i thought i might be able to like scavenge them or something i gotta go up there hello why are you glowing red what the slow motion okay well we're gonna have to get up there aren't we hey jim from mexico what's up man is cross play going to work i don't know bear i know that some people were having difficulty playing co-op today like the online services weren't working but apparently there's a patch tomorrow like a day one patch i just want you know i've got access to this today so i'm gonna play it today the day one patch is supposed to fix some bugs as well but i don't know what oh okay um [Music] what am i doing wrong here all the way down can i climb up this thing here there we go no keep falling down [Music] i've never climbed up inside a bus before have you guys this is unusual spam that's it that's it that's it yeah we got it all you gotta do is spam that spacebar oh oh i see i've got stamina interesting i didn't even notice that bar at the bottom there so that's new to me so whenever i grab onto a ledge or jump but actually use the stamina i suppose you'll be able to upgrade that at some point there we go that's cool [Music] i can't get up there wait for it to regen and then we can jump up there maybe there we go that's it we made it [Music] anything in the bus doesn't like it oh my god the zombies everywhere look at them all oh my goodness there's so many careful nope nope nope i'd definitely be dead if i light those wouldn't i 100 it is quite dark yeah it's difficult to see in that bus back there [Music] i guess that you could die as well right like if you actually fell from a great height in this game you'd probably end up dying if you've got stamina flashlight i don't think i've got a flashlight yet guys there's nothing in my inventory this flashlight so i don't think i could use one unless i could craft it [Music] bees [Music] i can kick as well cool all right we're going up there [Music] i feel like i'm playing zelda over here the national park that stamina bar is going to kill me so many times yeah it's going to kill me a lot as well for sure speeds then there's a zip line there cool forest retention area please do not disturb local wildlife and kick stamina oh so you can't just spam kick either oh man can i jump that [Music] i don't know i don't think i could that looks like pain is that a puddle or a hole it's a puddle i couldn't tell i wasn't sure what it was it's so dark i kind of feel bad for that one to be honest at least that doesn't take stamina i'll do a big swing here parkour parkour skill point you've leveled up your pockel proficiency i know your first parkour skill point you can now use it to unlock your first pockel skill i'm not going to do that every time it says parkour i'm sorry i just wanted to do it that first time you know i jump allows you to reach higher ledges when you hold spacebar while jumping there's a lot of skills here active landing phone grip make the last climb on ledges even when your stamina is gone i mean there's all sorts here combat parkour parkour okay that's it almost there so i can just jump higher now it's getting dark it's getting real dark guys oh no oh it's already dark it's time to hide somewhere for the night it won't get any better than this i was in a forest a few weeks ago and it was dark and it was quite spooky timed it wrong you know didn't make it round quick enough and by the end it was actually pitch black except the moon interesting experience that i mean this is a setup isn't it jump on a drain pipe use w to climb what this building here can i do anything with this there's some stuff in there look it's fine [Applause] what the hell is that it's not fine what the hell [Applause] [Music] combat basics some enemies use power attacks that deal massive damage and can knock you down when an enemy is about to use a power attack his health bar that looks like a lady starts blinking red dodge to avoid being hit the performer dodge press space [Music] okay [Applause] like that i want to kill you strange oh my god i feel outnumbered here with a very basic weapon [Applause] my stamina's gone you go away [Applause] died [Applause] okay i think it's dead i mean what craft master resources use a craftmaster to upgrade your blueprints now can i go in here this is my original plan see what was in here some scrap oh an axe how do i use that i mean that's the scythe isn't it look at that oh it's a big chopper put the power on hey what the music [Music] i don't know if it's dmca might get me copyright strikes don't care at this point it is what it is [Music] [Music] you guys recognize this song [Music] um there's another weapon there [Music] don't be sad it's just dmca okay let's give it a try there's a little secret area there [Music] i mean i can sleep here can i save zone you just unlock the first safe zone increasing your network of respawn points all safe zones are equipped with uv light which guarantees safety at night that's it so the zombies they don't like the light and uv light ruins them resting places okay this is it the broadcast station that's my stash machete hey let's roll it was 140.2 wasn't it [Music] this is aidan over anyone there looking for a pilgrim over i guess i have to wait until morning what's on the others easter egg well you know i came all the way from terzawa and looked and there's a hole in the can have to go all the [ __ ] way back okay he won't confide in me just make those speeches of his to the mirror will never be like the commander i don't understand the reference no man if they just crawled they'd solve lucas's murder real quick this business with lucas is bugged up but you can't take your anger out on the bazaar agreed all right enough of that time to sleep i'll try again in the morning i've got the coolest voice on the whole planet my name's adam nice to meet you oh my god i wish i could get to sleep that quick my life would be 99 better if i could [Music] we need supplies everything's ready it's so quiet where is everyone maybe they're all dead [Music] you're stupid let's go now [Music] shh it'll be all right [Music] i mean aidan's always changed a lot after puberty let me tell you [Music] wait here nothing good will come of this have you brought 12346 we were supposed to take the patients back to the city don't worry they'll let us go soon i'm scared i'm here with you you're safe with me i know [Music] these kids are all sick are you testing on them [Music] easy [Music] even if they separate us this is how we'll always find each other [Music] dr waltz we won't make it the military will be here any moment wait close your eyes [Music] that's a big needle fire fire want to have these kind of dreams this looks sick [Music] such time to contact the guy spike was talking about try again [Music] this is aiden i'm on frequency 140.200 megahertz hello hayden yes i was supposed to get in touch with you i thought you changed your mind why are you looking for waltz pilgrim to find someone else her name is mia 15 years ago we were in a hospital together and i know who you're looking for aidan you want to know why waltz was doing those experiments on all of you why you are stronger more durable than others i just want to find mia i've been looking forward since i left the survivor's camp can you help me or not maybe i can let's meet pilgrim where and when entrance to the metro tunnel by the bay you can get inside the tunnels through an open gre hatch i'll meet you there i think you're not doing this for free i have to leave the city but i won't make it on my own outside take me to new paris and we're even along the way i'll tell you everything i know over and out there's a big city down there i have to at least know if she's alive she's alive i'm going to the rendezvous i'll see you later [Music] so mia was like a childhood friend that he had and they were being tested on in that weird lab [Music] i got a couple different weapons didn't i as well [Music] can i climb that [Music] ow okay i guess that's a a no unless i could like what the how did i do that i just did like an asterisk at least i didn't have to climb to the top of this antenna oh they're taking the piss out far cry guys they're taking the piss is there really nothing new that i can get [Music] it's quite floaty [Music] i'm gonna go check out that church god is dead god is not here today paradise lost i studied that um english class when i was 17 i think a levels or as levels very old piece of literature land on armatizes to avoid taking fall damage armatizer what is it is that just a made up word for a mattress i mean is that what that means day raw i mean i haven't played the first game day right i played it for about an hour so i mean i've definitely missed on some easter eggs and story moments but that's all really there's just a big gap there right this way what the drunk sailor what oh come on in the sunken bus there's going to be some treats in here isn't it quick oh we did it reddit does it have co-op yeah it does back villadore enjoy your stay rocks are also not armatizers hmm yeah i wouldn't advise landing on a rock no i swam across the lake so you've can i get in here my baseball bat's blue though so i assume that does the most damage come on hit me hit me yeah i wanted to see if it downgraded stamina but the one here isn't hitting me so if you block and they hit you it takes away your stamina now she didn't want to hit me guys you just like hug zombie hug zombie hug now i'm not interested in zombie hug no i don't want that [Music] come on i mean these are all basic zombies keep away [Applause] [Music] is there a way to trigger the slow motion or does it just do it randomly i feel like it's whenever i headshot them i know you can get like electric bats can't you and fire and all sorts i don't know if there's any guns i saw like a weird-looking bow and arrow in one of the trailers i also saw a crossbow what else did i say i saw this weird like homemade gun it looked like a 3d printed gun or something so i think there are guns someone in chat asked but i don't think there's guns like you can't get like an mp5 or something like that i wonder if they explain it in the lore of the game like why there's no guns there's the drunk sailor look slow motion is critical hits okay thank you so if i sneak up on this guy can i do a stealth attack can i have him that's much easier isn't it [Music] of this cleave feels a lot better than that baseball bat way more fun [Music] oh my god the head came off [Music] my head didn't go up then i presume it's up here i guess i don't have to fight them all [Music] maybe i'd be missing out on materials is there anything in there no it's just a chimney of some sort off with their heads yes indeed check this building here there might be some materials [Music] it's an old store or something [Music] you can't get in it oh my god look at all them there oh there might be some cash in there i'm gonna jump up there and say [Music] let's go zombies i just kick them all off bye felicia does that just kill them come on they survived that one they they're zombies yeah no don't kick the machine a golden coin it's not quite golden is it it's golden scarecrow go back to the dc universe am i gonna get to do drop kicks and stuff like ninja kicks i'd like that another golden coin yes that's a nice dress oh that's so dumb i suppose that's just another way up then gravity's op yes it is caleb mr bluestack please i reckon they break a few legs on the way down whoa it's a seesaw oh there's something here look hide what's the point of this because there's no zombies [Music] [Music] hmm i can't get through there there is weapon durability mechanics in this game yeah that's why i'm kicking them because i don't want to waste my weapons so quickly you know i wonder if you can repair the weapons not the metro tunnels i've played the metro games i know what happens in the tunnels i'm entering the tunnels hey can you hear me i'll meet you soon here i come could just be demoing that i could do it yeah as a mechanic further into the game hey is anybody there uh hello [Music] do i actually want to go in here i mean oh [ __ ] this doesn't look good you know bodies everywhere and probably all sorts of viruses maggots gonna be infected look at this what the hell oh my god horrible oh hmm are you all right you [ __ ] bit me a volatile lots of those [ __ ] in the sewer volatile just getting through the light quickly later we have to just stay strong so aidan's infected here you are we've been looking for you was aiden in the first game what about this one seems dead to me didn't have it on him let's go [Music] i don't have the key i swear can i use that flashlight that's finally giving me a flashlight volatiles are angry af there we go guys we've got a flashlight now yes we can see i did this on my own open up for this still see me coming a common hammer can i not use that yet almost hammer i don't think there's anything else in here was there yeah i don't have to fight that thing i don't feel like i'm equipped don't bring waltz not him oh my god it's so dark without a flashlight the chat is almost impossible to read terabyte it goes quick but i try and keep my eye on it [Music] this is the main bad guy then or a bad [Music] you were guy to be dad where did you hide our king boy i don't know what you're talking about let him go you're gonna make us let him go punk perfect block press and hold right to block an enemy's attack block at the very last moment to perform a perfect block perfect block staggers an enemy making them vulnerable for a short window of time there's a parry then oh yeah there's mass off look at that he's got all sorts of like weird stuff in his eyes now can i break the block somehow or can i learn an attack later on that does that combat skill point vault kick allows you to perform a kick while vaulting over an obstacle or a staggered enemy so i can use the staggered enemy as a springing off point i suppose jump over staggering enemies and follow it with a kick cool and then you just attack during the vault okay [Music] that baseball bat is still 18 damage you can kick their block okay thank you just chill okay i need to get some golden coins whatever that means they're golden but they're not golden okay they're golden have i ever told you the tale of the golden coin are

that opening cutscene i'm going to go get me some darn light i'm going to find myself a uv lamp sorry i'm being stupid all right anyway let's go outdoors [Music] wow not bad where's the fish eye the canteen is there in the center past the chemical dumps i need to get there too bad only way to go is through the tunnel they protect it like a portal to the [ __ ] valhalla near impossible to get through [Music] how do i get to the tunnel it's my specialty where's the tunnel not so fast cowboy you won't get far without a biomarker you're a threat to everyone and you've already seen how people in villadore react to a threat well can you help me you seem to be familiar with the city i've lived in this city since before the world got [ __ ] up i could help you but you need a biomarker you won't get far without it where are you from pretty far i guess about 2 000 kilometers oh [ __ ] how the heck did you not get infected that's easy didn't let him bite me here it's different here we're all infected heard of haran they isolated velador too they built walls they locked us in turned out to be the thing that saved us and how do you get a biomarker uh you can't get them unless you know the right people and i do let's go by the way nice to meet you aiden it looks much better outside than inside doesn't it this game to paradise got some nice lighting and reflections i mean i've got all the race racing stuff turned on so over here as good as it gets i mean this looks way better than the indoor area we were just in oh you do know the moves i was in the military special unit for seven years [ __ ] oh i even liked it except when i didn't for insubordination got blacklisted and they zeroed my bank account ended up driving a cab ouch now the mighty have fallen oh sh damn i i didn't think there'd be zombies in here okay lucky thank you it's about to break can i do the perfect block against zombies guys does that work they don't really attack me they just kind of lunge at you then that's it i know like it did tell me to follow that guy but i just want to go see what's down here so far it's a load of zombies [Music] maybe i shouldn't come down here i feel like maybe i'm a bit too early for this area i don't know cigarettes all right let's go eat okay sorry sorry man i'm gonna come follow you now i just had to see right oh come on okay you're too weak without an inhibitor you won't last why didn't i smash everything in sight last time you gave it to me that was just the first time but then it gets better if you survive of course catch you're telling me i could have died if i hadn't given it to you you would have died i couldn't even get up there anyway so why are you helping me i know people are generally scared of you guys but one pilgrim saved my life i was a pilgrim now i'm infected it'll be much harder to travel and welcome to your new beginning my friend check out this place they're like treasure chests usually got good stuff in him check it out i like his face um roof groves honey come on other resources okay just a heads up as well guys if you've already pre-ordered this on xbox if you want to play it now you just change your region to new zealand and you can play it but i'm playing this on pc because i've been given early access people hide a lot of things in places like this in case someone can't make it back to a shelter before dark what's that a cabbage oh someone must have stashed them here they formed after the chemicals were dumped on us some believe they delay infection folk superstition so you don't collect them sure i do superstitious people pay a fortune for them and i am always happy to take someone's cash there's one specific chest i'm after come on let me show you show me the bees resin chamomile as the lady said oh the man said sorry not the lady the man [Music] i nearly died then mural [Music] [Music] oh cool come on come on stop [Music] he's dead oh there's some police there so you have an army here no the peacekeepers they treat people like that too watch out for them they got the tunnel you want to go through they're not friends on the trail i met a lot of tough guys who talked about the new order and always seemed like the same old [ __ ] to me yeah he's like that here too and the pk's are getting worse that's a pk tell me more about him people killer they consider themselves righteous protest player killer they are good at killing infected so you got to give them credit for that yeah pretty efficient killers yeah but their righteousness comes with a price always remember this you either play by their rules or you're [ __ ] their protection of the bazaar is more like an occupation i'll proceed with caution good though it might not help the pk are a pain seriously riling up the bazaar folks the bazaar is a box of dynamite one spark away from blowing up boom peacekeeper got it hey are we going you uh wanted to show me something sure follow me his yellow backpack isn't very discreet [Music] so [Music] it's a bit difficult to tell sometimes what you're like able to jump on or not [Music] i feel like i'm going to mess that up a few times almost there i hope there are no surprises [Music] it's getting dark they are about to wake up quickly open the chest in return we'll get your biomarker air drop [ __ ] nothing in it thieves wait no no no leave it mess up that lock and everything's [ __ ] anyway enough for a biomarker where'd you get that i've been all over the city more than most but even i haven't seen working gre equipment for years i can't say much but a former gre scientist dylan gave it to me yeah we planned on pc thinking a guy named waltz killed him and before he died dylan gave me the key to keep it from waltz contains important information apparently i hope to find out more at the fisheye we'll have to see won't we that doesn't sound good [ __ ] me we took too long plan me run like hello [Applause] we need to find the uv lamp the bazaar we can make it follow me quick uv light uv light is a symbol of safety at night it is the only certain protection from infected so watch out for it when you're being chased hold q to use your cyber sentence to mark the newest source of uv light at night well i guess it's over there i need to roll when i [Music] to all the land can you hear that we're almost there a bit further we're going to the nightclub open up hello stand in the light look on er come on open up now i got a howler's coming bio markers there's no time we've got the hollow on our ass biomarkers did you hear behind us i said bio markers here that is he's with me i have to see his violin let us just inside the door at least i need to see his bike how about some electronics huh [Applause] [ __ ] out open up [Music] piece of them [Applause] doesn't sound good oh get in there this morning and get [Music] [Applause] killed just gonna do this oh [ __ ] there's a lot of them they're actually faster in my time oh he did it i doubt we're done trouble loves company i know you're there [Applause] god damn it kellyanne open the door i'm gonna check your browser history when we get in there is that all of them i think so help me [Music] [Music] hit him with a uv oh god damn it gillian should have waited a while longer almost did didn't want to clean your guts off my doorstep in the morning he's irish oh come on stop being such a bastard already lots of accents in this game where did you that's rare invite us in or it'll get even more rare how'd you get your hands on that and who is this eden a pilgrim i'm a pilgrim haven't been here long have you how did you get into town i'll tell you everything just let us in i waited for a pilgrim once he was supposed to oh forget it doesn't matter anymore what are you up to hack on huh i gave him an inhibitor survive so you mad he needs a biomarker don't have one [ __ ] seriously [ __ ] the hospital then i was hoping to avoid it always looking for an easy way huh i don't i just need a uv lamp i'll come back for you okay hack on why are you helping him huh remember when we used to help people me sure but i doubt you do stay here and rest by the lamp don't listen to that dumbass idiot we used to help people remember surely remember your [ __ ] hmm so a lot of you guys are saying that that hacking guy is based off the godfather of parkour french guy a real real person i don't know if it's his voice though on face but it might be like i remember when like free running and parkour started making its way onto the internet and it as far as i'm aware it did actually originate from france so that could be correct you wanted something else higher [ __ ] causes and you could just cook biomarkers why are they so hard to get i don't even know what they are because they're complicated devices hell the factories that made them have been out of commission for years biomarkers are key to blood they can't be reused after someone syncs with it without them the infection runs unchecked like what's happened to you that's why people pay a fortune to get a new one all the money and crystals they have fortunately me and hackon found a place where they can still be made what's wrong with hakkon giving me inhibitors kills most people in seconds it's a powerful drug most can't handle it but i survived i said most so don't get excited just be careful with them he survived because of the tests that they were doing on him where could i rest when he was a kid what brought you here this ain't the promised land far from it i need to get to the fisheye and hack hans help when you get there you seem like a good kid but take my advice don't go dolin out trust like penny candy hell how do you know you can trust me okay enough jabber go to sleep nothing to be done till morning anyway block 13 yeah that's the name of the movie chipper cabra so i didn't really look at my stash last time did i outfits i've got outfits in this game can i just like i can just drag stuff over guy you just click it and then get it back i suppose at some point i'm going to be able to sell this stuff though right so guys i've got 32 golden coins i'm going to be rich there's going to be a dream here isn't there a nightmare again howdy pilgrim harley quinn [Music] yeah very funny did you make it almost biomarkers are at the gre hospital i'll be there shortly but to get the job done i need you to join me where should i go with killian's door to your back you'll be pointing right at it hold the line i'm gonna have to run away from zombies again what's he got here pickles cherry jam jam 2030 i'm got some pasta what the tape oh it's still night time no i don't want now at night the city streets are teeming with infected to stay safe use the rooftops when on the street level avoid howlers at all costs if they see you they will alert other infected and start a chase no okay so howl is the bad news keep to the roofs because if the howler spot you yeah i know don't want to go up against any of those anytime soon once i was taking my second wife to the hospital never drove that fast in my life her waters broke three months early you have kids there was no saving that one oh and other than that none that i know of sorry it's fine what normal person would want his kids to see a world like this not the best time to have kids is it really let's be honest so i presume i can just jump straight on to that there's some power lines there could use those what's this yellow stuff okay there's a mat down there hurry up aiden we have to get in and out of the hospital nothing's coming in hyundai the lock is broken don't worry find the old bus grab bus at zero hour a bus crashed into the hospital broke through the wall you can use it to get inside since no one could get in there's a good chance there'll be some markers left it actually said there that they noticed your flashlight didn't it as well so i've got to be a bit careful about turning my flashlight on are they [Music] oh we're in the hospital i'm at the main entrance i marked a safe route for you i'm waiting by the lobby he said it was a safe route okay hey this way what the hell is this gooey stuff to go for quite a few of these for drug research when it all got [ __ ] they grabbed research volunteers they paid them loads of money what was the result a lot of [ __ ] i don't like that some kind of fungus just a little more we don't have much time stay close tonight even that drain stamina just walking up a hill like that military vehicles down there a door's locked you know how to open locks sure turn the key what if you don't have a key how are you running that night i've traveled thousands of kilometers you think doors are a problem for me okay just checking okay just this room should have all the instruments you need maestro i found some scrap you can make lockpicks out of that lockpicks crafting menu i can craft quite a lot of stuff here accessories lockpick i can craft 38 of them i don't think i'm going to need that many am i ah good work is it going to be a mini game oh no oh no no no you need to find the correct position for the upper pick move the upper pick with the mouse to test the upper pick's position press a to move the lower pick [Music] how can i feel the resistance on a mouse i mean there we go is it that easy in real life you didn't lie you know your stuff i had no other choice was forced to know my stuff oh what the hell we go rummaging through too many trash cans we're gonna catch a few diseases i think wouldn't you agree resin the hell was that something just damaged me then i've not played the first game k6 played for about an hour i said earlier that won't work depends on the lock okay this way i watched some guy called the lock picking lawyer on youtube he's very good in front of us keep quiet um [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amy come on [Music] that's a bad idea mia if it was a good one it wouldn't be fun what are you doing yeah not on the wall stop talking and give me your hands [Music] aiden everything okay yeah are you sure talk to me i'm just feeling woozy all of a sudden that must be the infection don't give in we'll get you a marker and you'll know where you stand yeah thanks he's absolutely chalked in his head bro did you just disappear it's simply too fast i mean he's heated away sleeping bearies yeah we have to walk past them if you crouch and move slowly they shouldn't notice you get too close and you're done for sleeping beauties eh you probably know that disney dmca disney hello uh i don't like this the game is so dark as well that's the darkest game i've ever played [Music] i mean everybody be quiet look at this i mean this is death isn't it i'll be interested to see what happens if i actually trigger one of these don't i'm not going to turn my flashlight on guys they're going to see it the game said don't put your flashlight on because it alerts them this is fine what is that chemicals nasty [ __ ] when they lost control of the virus the gre started spraying the whole city with that filth worked out great fun huh golden coin yes [Music] um sorry i'm sorry it wasn't me it was this it was the french guy so this guy you told me about what was his name waltz yes why did you mention him because i remember he was doing some kind of experiments he wasn't the only one doing them there were more cities like villadore with walls cut off from the rest of the world many people were working toward a vaccine eden it's great there but well the world is full of [ __ ] that's true all right i want my golden coin don't jump down automatically do not jump down automatically be careful it's not stable don't you dare there was a golden coin there no don't you dare no i didn't ask for this that's full deus ex days let's jump maybe on the way and john idiot you alive [Music] i guess so can you climb up sure give me a sec hurry we're running out of time it's yellow then i can't make it wait i've got an idea remember the cocktail i surfed you earlier at the girls workshop yeah neighbors exactly you fell to the first floor there's some gre storage down there yes look for white green crates inhibitors should be inside if you take another dose you should get your strength back okay okay okay your gre access key is a highly sophisticated encryption tool can unlock special doors and chests marked with the gre logo activates automatically when you're close to an inhibitor container cool so i'm gonna have to give myself a boost cheeky little boost of strength oh it's this guy from earlier [Music] please look at the eyes oh that's horrific [Music] does it have to be so naked i ran off trying to go around it somehow is it gonna hunt me down like the dog that i am i don't want that guys i hate this just give me alien isolation vibes hide area golden coin golden coin can i not get through that huh [Music] it's in there isn't it [Music] hello bye [ __ ] damn it oh i accidentally turned my flashlight on is slide cancel you can't slide cancel in this game not cod aiden harry if that infected finds you you're dead don't tell me i'm on a time limit as well god i guess in there no this is the worst time for a flashback we'll eat all the ice cream they hit from us i'm scared mia yeah me too and i'm younger don't be a chicken lady what if the doctor sees us he won't besides you'd have to catch us too come on don't back out now i gave him the strength to kick the door down aidy baby don't be a chicken addy yeah don't be a chicken go ahead and close that door you know it's not an unusual thing to do is it closing the door completely normal they look like little plastic men through the walls did you hear it erg container nearby there are no strings on me i can't see a goddamn thing through that door isn't it it's right here [Music] what is it what is it okay inhibitor let's go inhibitor soap is that useful inhibitors are the only way to increase your maximum stats and health stamina health each upgrade requires three inhibitors if you find them go to the skills menu to level up your stats okay [Music] you need three inhibitors to upgrade stamina or health now choose stamina to be able to climb higher active landing parkour skill i don't have any points to spend there though so i think that's all we can do for now didn't i just get some some joggers some unique joggers look at that it just put them on automatically i think i guess this stuff increases my stats okay [Music] i took the inhibitor go back to the elevator get back to the shaft a table leg hello hang on [Music] oh that was close [Music] let's hustle it you were gone a while how are you feeling i'm infected but good to go yeah that's great sorry about this what i'm sorry about what you're on the biochip now that on behalf of all its [ __ ] bandits and idiots i christen you a citizen of velidor you're about to turn get into the light fast [Music] that's not good where's the big lads i'll come outside that was close what would you do without me pilgrim i never wanted to become a pilgrim and just sort of fell into him run the country for another reason entirely i'm looking for my sister sister yeah her name is mia 15 years ago we were in a hospital together i think a guy named waltz was experimenting on us a lot are not jobs in the world huh i have to learn the truth and then what then what will you do once you find your sister haven't thought about that but that's odd well there'll be time for that once i find her once you find her well i have a very specific plan you look like someone with a specific plan i'd like to live by the ocean you know it's supposed to be easier there i always wanted to learn how to surf what you find a bunch of old postcards or something ah don't laugh at my dreams man i know one thing i have to get out of the city it's killing me right from the inside will you help me the ocean's a long way from here and we're both infected people don't want pilgrims for their neighbors [ __ ] people i will help you with them and you can help me survive on the road you know the roots you know how to survive out in the open what do you think we cover each other's asses how does that sound [Music] do my choices here have a consequence of the story of the game i have no idea [Music] i like this guy though so i'm gonna go with deal okay let's do it awesome deal you won't regret this hayden i promise as for your goal here's the situation around here after the pk commander was murdered they blocked the route to the center they're trying to keep the killer from escaping to get to fisheye we have to outsmart them but i know when they change the night guard that will be our chance i'm gonna get the stuff we'll need for the passage i have to search out our odds meantime take a look around live a little come on let me show you something um a lot of people are saying yes they do but some people have said no not a lot so i don't know shrooms i mean consuming uv screws restores part of your immunity it may also have other side effects didn't say that did it pop it it's getting awful druggy old world money so i guess if i wanted to i could just go down there there's a ladder there just go exploring maybe probably die he seems like a trustworthy person you know it's a lookout tower i'm not sure i can go up there here you'll need these take a look around the city old villador plenty of interesting spots to check out oh binoculars cool binoculars allow you to discover important open world locations press

where you're going what a day no freaking way i can do it carlos what's wrong five years of learning what's the problem hey aren't you the pilgrim they wanted to hack yeah matt you were in luck there i could use some of that luck i'm alberto's apprentice not for long probably it's the third time i'm taking a shot at this test if i fail again craftmaster alberto is going to kick me out what's the test about look at this woman dancing i have to design something useful for the citizens i already invented a can opener then a retractable dog leash oh but he kept jamming and besides we have no dogs here are dogs even alive in this universe my dears are worthless now is my last chance to prove that i am not ruthless so i spent the last several weeks walking around the bazaar and thinking thinking hard and then i hit it cow opener for cats they're kept in cages for cats crops but life in cages makes them sad and they give less milk so i came up with the idea of a fence energized with just a tiny bit of voltage an electric fence okay keep the goats under control but let them produce more milk i called this invention the electric fence you could have made a can opener for cats though so what seems to be the problem with this invention of yours i'm missing a few parts and they're not that easy to get i'm worried i won't be ready on time maybe you could help me if you find them for me i'll give you one of my super cool inventions nothing to do with goats i hope nah something much more interesting you'll see i just need some electric parts i'll dismantle them for resistors and other useful things as far as i know they can be found in two places one's an old hardware store on fitzwilliam place near the water tower alberto says they'll be there for sure but it's a dark place full of turned creatures you have to go there at night and the other option whatever is left of military patrols i know of one place south of horseshoe near the old electrical feels like fall out this time span its roam in the area so it's possible there's nothing left there in which case you'll have to look for other patrol remains or take a night trip to the store [Music] that looks like you're in luck after all i have the parts you need i must have collected him already that's just fantastic heaven must have sent you here [Music] i don't know how to thank you one more thing give me the thing that you're making you help me set up my show my installation's right outside the main entrance turn it on please i'll go get alberto wait till he sees it he's quite a strange man isn't he sage near the wall i should go see some next gen goats [Music] you look familiar yeah i'm the guy you almost got hanged why worry you're standing here aren't you excuse me look we had no choice if you had turned like we thought you were gonna it would have been a massacre i see it was a risky situation i get it so we good we're good [Music] that's weird [Music] um [Music] i'd like to see the goats i mean [Music] don't recognize me or are you allergic to making money listen pilgrim we can make it killing you and me you just need to get me some beets radishes parsnips there he is grab him ed he's a murderer what i mean that's come on nowhere from the water you sold in bevin says what but i don't sell water liar luke told me he got it from you whatever's in it has him ranting and raving now you're sure he didn't blame me after he started renting but wait a minute you see proof proof let's go of course the water came in a bottle luke got that water in one of your bottles when i tell carl about this you'll hang don't tell cars wait i swear i don't even sell water damn it if you're lying julian you're [ __ ] toast what do you think chad is he lying so then if you're not selling water how'd someone get a hold of one of your bottles knowing that shit-ed luke he probably stole it that would be like him even if he did my water's pure as melted snowflakes [Music] so maybe it's revenge for what everyone loves me never had an enemy in my life what wait a second wait [ __ ] nobody says that everyone loves me i'm the best type bastard come to think of it he's got an axe to grind for me it was a long time ago never mind listen he lives above an old shop on the west end of villadore on hamfield lane i traded him a few kilos of my finest flour for the water prove he poisoned it and half my flour is yours can you do that for me i guess i could check it out off of it and there's one more thing i'm a little embarrassed hands might also have a bottle of this water no i thought you weren't selling it he's lying i'm not accepting oh well two hands and can you go warn him he's also on hand filled a few buildings down something's fishy about this julian look you better be telling the truth otherwise it'll be hard to help you you can't handle the truth [Music] hey that's the pilgrim call tatspro no need to be shy [Music] merchants um what's the point in keeping all the other weapons right like should i just sell that one that's my worst one let's sell it then call for help sell all valuables i don't think i should do that oh i'm in the bye bit you're an idiot jack what's the point keeping this stuff right it's just crap 13 damage pathetic oh wait oh no you can use the coins to distract the game didn't teach me that what i don't have enough to buy this stuff i've only got 249. [Music] craft masters allow you to buy an upgrade blueprints special infected i've killed one of those i don't have enough to upgrade that i don't have enough to upgrade anything i'm pathetic i look

waste of time why i don't think so this is very very that it has big huge you're saying it has potential potential yeah why does he sound like gru from despicable me a weapon it's already girls happy

you need to have a blueprint for it okay mod slots the best weapons have three slots available grip shaft and tip press i to go to inventory choose the right weapon and press c to modify it um modify apply shock effect to one enemy in front of you there's my first weapon mod there guys nothing on the shaft i do have a charm though for some reason that's cool is that on i think that's on now inspect gonna do some real damage with that bad boy you have to tell my kids no food tonight again i can't use weapons there stay away from the chemicals bro [ __ ] will burn you to the bone yes ma'am look who's here sometimes i wake up at night and forget the fall even happened sarah mitch christopher walker looking at all the dead people that says here they're missing same difference they never find them anyway it's a nice way to start a conversation isn't it it's been 15 years many people disappeared back then my neighbor lost his two kids but life goes on except nobody has the courage to take those photographs down but it's hopeless since there are no night runners the search always ends the same have you heard of kids who were in the gre test and who wasn't in the tests the young the old the blind the deaf everyone came to find a vaccine some for cash others to cheat destiny and not get infected but that was the devil's bargain of villadore walled in with the plague oh it froze was given the chance to be those who gave the cure to the world you guys see that just froze for a second well the virus carried on though the study was eventually discontinued and the children officially no one tested on children human rights and other crap and unofficially and unofficially apparently some of the kids were taken out of the city the rest only just scattered around the city abandoned if the infected didn't get them then hunger or darkness did damn he's sad when did all this happen a long time ago looking at you you were still a kid yourself once upon a time i came across two of them two girls they were five or six years old and it looked like they hadn't eaten for a month what were their names i don't remember i threw them some old bread and took off because they were shaking as if they were about to turn red eyes swollen veins i don't know what they were giving them there those psychos from the gre where are all these kids at now after all those years most of them are probably dead if someone got luckier and is still wandering around they will probably be in the central loop more peacekeepers there easier to survive someone must know more why the past is the past and there's no point in dredging it back up everyone has their own problems here and now pilgrim everyone fights for themselves dumb [ __ ] me people will always complain did lucas have enemies he was a pk commander what do you think i must have missed something to hear that are you smart [Music] goods i mean i can just sell this stuff right fire arrows hello bow and arrow what let's check in because there's got to be someone here that i haven't spoken to this should just be an objective marker but i don't know what if i just sleep [Music] bed's there [Music] couldn't go in that door [Music] i'm just gonna sleep and see what happens [Music] next-gen gaming is held back by consoles i mean the next-gen consoles are really good though noaf's [Music] like the hardware wise they're pretty much you know almost top spec gaming pc at the moment anyway i keep telling everyone [Music] does anyone know where i have to go here because i feel like i've promised everyone [Music] talk to the goats i don't think you can talk to the ghost and that's your final answers some say the renegades are about to attack don't know the windmills turn them on if you get a chance [Music] you have to do the side missions to progress why doesn't it just say that then what that's so weird okay that one [Music] okay i wish it would have just said do the missions you know [Music] i bet a lot of people are gonna end up getting stuck there that one's a side mission isn't it no side quest that's the water one isn't it yeah we'll go do that one finally found a great place to live yep on the roof right above a damn dark zone lots of zombies rescue uh you're fine i could have used the spear combat points perfect dodge stagger your enemy air kick well behind the air look down at an enemy and hold the e to execute that's sick reduce fall damage and keep your momentum or firm grip do that one we cool i never use that no oh yeah maybe nope was that guy were you there before ow oh there's some bob wire right there that sucks they've got levels now as well interesting nearly managed that first side quest it's down here somewhere get out of here it's not australian over this building yeah

zombie body's there try this again hey zombies this is sarah hi sarah hi sarah hi sarah hi sarah today sarah has a story to share with us sarah please begin then when i got here in 2024. i was young all my short life i'd lived in this little town but eventually like everyone else i had to flee and i uh we heard the villa door was still taking people in so we walked for 40 days and 40 nights when we got here they had just closed the gates so we camped outside the walls like thousands of other people in fact it swarmed us we fought them off with rocks during the day at night they got more dangerous sometimes the sniper on the walls would have mercy and help eventually some guy showed up told us he'd smuggle us in through the sewers as soon as we got past the wall he disappeared with all our stuff then a patrol caught us packed us in a truck laughing that they were taking us to the mosh pit that's what they called the refugee camp at the stadium we slept on pallet beds everyone fit for work dug in the trees and graves one meal a day no blankets we were sick for almost a month then jake got jaundice don't know where they buried him little help [Music] i hope you fix yourself sarah i'm sorry i kicked you i'm not sorry trying to get her off the roof it wasn't having it great another water thief just what i need between thieves and infected i'll be out of business soon [Music] i'm here because a guy named julian claims you sold him poisoned water i didn't poison anything all right julian claims otherwise sure listen to the guy who sold me flour mixed with plaster if you're not the thief how are you with infected i need to get rid of those things that down there if not i'm done here hey i can handle that for you marker i can do this okay i'll get rid of the infected i can do it you tell me what happened deal sure deal yeah do not whatever you do if you guys play this game do not go under this table [Music] it will ruin your day and you'll have to listen to sarah sarah who knows when nothing i just debate i really fancy a fruit smoothie like get some fruit put it in the blender bit of milk fruit smoothie um how do i get down do i go back through the this bit here i just gotta kill everyone guys are you ready for this [Music] it's fine everything's fine this is so weird just just murder a room of zombies and you just like fell them all with your hands i'm not sure about that search animation oh you can throw the bottles at enemies okay okay i need to figure out how to use the coin as well like to throw and distract people there's quite a lot of opportunistic weapons as well which i like sector is clear marco marco and iris of the belters okay you're safe now what's the story with the water the wait oh he's got a good weapon look at that so you really are one of those [ __ ] up pilgrims but you're [ __ ] up now we're safe gotta be a [ __ ] criminal or pretty damn [ __ ] up to drag your ass hundreds of miles through a world full of virals [ __ ] up in a good way of course so what about the water there ain't nothing wrong with my water a man of the bazaar was poisoned and you'll be blamed if he dies damn it okay it was an accident okay an accident it's because of these goddamn thieves please admit it feast they're always stealing my water i can't take it anymore so i decided to set the trap do you deliberately poison the water to kill the bandits no not quite at least i didn't mean to a while ago i killed this viral became crawling in here it was a happy accident fell straight into a tub the whole tub [ __ ] ruined then i got this idea why don't i teach these bastards a lesson so i filled some bottles with the zombie water sent them out whether they'd be easy to see they were never supposed to make it into the bazaar i guess i was sauced up and accidentally sold oh he got saucy man got sauced out of his mind i'll even throw something extra okay don't tell anybody i'd be wrong i'd be i'd be financially ruined and crippled don't blame julian and he'll hang don't you worry about julian a weasel like him will find a way to weasel out of it and if not then that's one weasel lesson hey one less weasel in the world just be honest and tell your story to the bazaar it was an accident you nuts no one would buy even a drop of water for me ever again i won't let julian hang for something he didn't do [ __ ] julian no we gotta kill this [Music] why did he just go southern american oh my god his head's off try this on for a size and then 30 seconds earlier everybody is fine he will be a weasel what head i feel like i made the right moral choice there though okay uh where's the did i get his weapon jesus i gotta go find this man absolutely mad lads this game's mad escalated quick yeah

here appreciate you bud what odds hi is he there i'll pick that load huh no i don't like this the hell this isn't water oh that [ __ ] must have taken the wrong bottle again forget his own head if it weren't stuck on his shoulders hey what did you mean by the wrong bottle he always takes a little rocket fuel with him when he goes hunting but the booze is right here that means he's got water where is he and what business is that of yours the water he got from julian it might be contaminated he's hunting at this uh the military tower a few hundred meters west of here unless he's at the courts i'll go to the tower you check the courts fast wait wait take the booze with you in case he's already drunk some of the water i bet what's in this bottle will kill whatever's in that one that doesn't make any sense i like how she didn't react at all to me breaking into her apartment she's just like hey [Music] his favorite hunting spot it's right there i mean no biggie be there in a jiffy you can hide in the long range there can i make that i think i need to get used to what i can and can't parkour is that in there hey he's up there he's just chilling oh come on that was not high up [Music] i

wife said chug drink it already [ __ ] what my wife said that my anna she thinks the alcohol's strong enough to burn the poison out of your system huh my woman so she loves me after all despite her bitching and moaning what the hell as they say romance is dead here for making my day and maybe saving my life look you need any help getting back nah i'm good me and this bottle of booze still got some work to do [Music] what a lovely couple can i like i didn't mean to use that i wanna how do i select that if it's [Music] hold h no i want to change what's in that slot there's my throw knives oh there we go you cycle it with two okay i don't think it's ever told me not how to do that i imagine on controller that's quite easy though it's probably just a d-pad right you just go through them so can i fast travel there safe zone maybe i have to be in a safe zone too fast travel there so if i take that i've got one in this area i presume that thing there isn't it oh careful kick hands off the roof i'm not that mean guys i'm sorry [Music] what the hell do i do here okay i've got to jump onto that first one before darko thanks for the 20. how are you supposed to there's no way i could do that nope try one more time i feel like i need more stamina to do this maybe come back later unless i could jump onto that from there i don't know it doesn't look like it clearly now i think i need more stamina for that i'll come back to that later on you have less stamina than suggested for this activity it would have been great if it had said that when i actually came from the other direction but it just didn't it just bugged out i was like now you have to come from this direction specifically and then we'll give you the hint you can't fly i wanted to fly man [Applause] an epic poem if you please storyteller oh my favorite no i'm not listening to any more poems or stories zombies zombies jump on this thing yeah so i reckon if i go back to the settlement now it will advance the main objective the main quest end up in here [Music] yeah phil oh i'm stuck [Music] why is someone screaming [Music] sometimes i wake up at night forget the fall even happened that's about the only time i smile but then i see the goddamn uv lights is it fred dust all the people in the world today all the little girls filling up the world today when the good comes the bad the bad comes to good but i'm gonna live my life like i should like i should tell everyone we should be getting ready okay i saved you from being hanged [Music] husband is dead julian's been accused of murdering him by poisoning his water aiden please tell them it wasn't me julian is innocent a viral fell into a supplier's storage tub the guy drunkenly sold julian contaminated water it wasn't a murder you'd swear to that

stinky pipe guys no metro station nighttime stories you'll come across characters marked with the icon nighttime story missions okay i'll get that one is everything all right i can hear you a mile away i'm not gonna do it now though i'll do the main quest without her save your sorry for theodore you better find him right now or else monica maybe this is for the better you don't get to tell me what's better but i'm telling you you better get theodore out of there come on do you really want that you think life is hell on earth now you wait and see how i make you feel if theodore comes to any harm who's theodore your son theodore is the most brutal [ __ ] in the bazaar should be in a pk prison [ __ ] you will he's my boyfriend not yours what so then what happened that might be better this way i'm not just gonna kick everyone off okay as much as you'd like to see it i'm not gonna do it this brute hooking up with my sister aunt will lord theodore in a dark zone and now he'll [ __ ] go and get him out monica wait you're a pilgrim right that place is soaked with chemicals hell theodore's probably dead already you want me dead too even if i managed to find him the [ __ ] will just

doesn't know yet wow there's a bobby on the way yeah i'll see what i can do he lives in an apartment on old shamble street about 200 meters north of here theodore should be on the first floor wait until night time it'll be easier for you hopefully he's holed up somewhere away from the biters and one more thing i love theodore you know but he really can be dangerous is it be careful dog or a cat [Music] no i don't want to do that at the moment [Music] earn one degree then another gave up on a third degree managed a phd he's right there nice you're a better climber than one crazy girl i used to know she was something she even wanted to climb the tallest building in the city the vnc tower was she one of your wives almost too hot tempered even for my tastes what about this passage to the center right look from this roof you can clearly see the peacekeeper's base [Music] whoa you brought me here to take a look at the pizza yes the dog got her pregnant the pk are your ticket to the center i told you the only way to get there is through the metro tunnels i'll go inside and draw their attention away from the platform then you enter the metro technical station there's an airlock there we'll take it together to the central loop we can't just ask them to let me through no chance right now each new face they see belongs to a suspect in their commander's murder they know me i trade with them sometimes i deliver lamps from the girls or goods from dark zones there might be a few infected there nothing a pilgrim can't handle though when you get to the main station let me know now you better get some sleep you'll head out at night when there's less infected in the tunnels [Music] [Applause] [Music] um that's a special special infected creature i haven't seen before what does it look like it's a naked purple lady not a big one extremely fast probably a boater you can find some interesting stuff on this it's going to be a good mission catching one requires serious hunting skills now is not the best time for this head for [Applause] [Music] i don't really want to like face the purple demon you know it's not for me [Music] i mean this would be a good time to take some mushrooms wouldn't it [Music] and it escaped i didn't even know that i was doing an encounter or something [Music] i mean i tried to kick him the kick didn't work guys is that going to blow up [Music] why do they all look like the scarecrow from batman i don't understand i try uh one of these throne knives eat that's cool let me go [Music] shhh [Music] slide can i do a slider oh that's not

to see my immunity is it the one at the top [Music] some mushrooms here i think it is the one at the top isn't it gobble them all down gobble them all down gobble all the shrooms come on there we go [Music] i'm in the tunnel okay now watch out for the infected there might be a few or a few dozen i'm already in the pk base i'll throw a uv flare through the vent and you'll see how to get to the main station bravo six going dark [Music] [Music] 26 can i take the mod off that can i remove this i want to remove it and put it on my new weapon is that not allowed i don't think that's allowed is it god dammit the big boy they're all asleep adorable that was nice though [Music] oh dear no i don't want to do a lockpick now not the time for that is it i thought i killed you [Music] oh they're just basic zombies it should be okay first time oh not quite there we go that's a lucky guess um i've done it again i don't know detected there's the inhibitor container over there give it to me you go hello [Music] i know that's not it i thought that was it no more [Music] i didn't even see those god this is hell this is actual hell guys i hate this come on very nice cool i don't think there was any nearby then so i should be okay i missed that container as well i don't know where it was maybe behind that locked door [Music] did you see me [Music] decoy that's cool uh [Music] look around the technical tunnel to the main station should be well-lit i've already lowered the guards upstairs i'll chat them up while you get inside that does a whole load dangler oh [ __ ] [Music] oh they've got range attacks now cool go go go cool cool cool situations here back [Music] on mean i've got to go right for that don't i surely kick him on that down i thought that was going to be worse than it was okay [Music] humans all right i'll give you two packs [Music] up [Music] i got all out of consumables i know i've got a few [Music] no one knives but i can craft them and that's a decoy five packs think about it and i'll be right back i'm on the platform open the airlock i'll be there in a second [Music] it's going to be a big fight here isn't there i can feel it hey what you doing here where did he come from he was wandering through the tunnels [ __ ] bizarre riffraff oh someone from birmingham doesn't look like a renegade um [Music] he's awake [Music] what were you doing at our base nothing i'm only trying to get to the city center the center the tunnel is going to be closed until you hand over lucas's killers bizarre scum [Music] how is it that you lost all nothing heard nothing and you managed to forget about the ban on passage maybe we'll start punishing you by cutting off your hands that would improve your memory huh that would hurt a lot what were you doing four days ago i'm a pilgrim four days ago i was 100 kilometers away enough anderson we need the truth and you won't get it through coercion let's torture them now i'm in command you've read the reports a pilgrim appeared in the bazaar yesterday looks like he's not lying leave her sergeant i want to talk to him alone [Music] piggy blinders [Music] where did you come from from crossdale river that's over 1500 kilometers from here it's actually more than 2 000 freeway bridges collapse there are no straight paths and you've managed to make it so far away impressive [Music] what's it like out there these days what does he not go to the surface what's it like outside the walls outside the walls danger's going to come from always new territories new threats and you came here to take shelter i came here because i'm looking for someone and a lot of people are said to have survived in villadore you're looking for someone hmm maybe i can help you but not for free i'm used to trading what do you need no nonsense that's good the tunnel will be closed until i find our commander's murderer commander lucas his body was found in the bazaar horribly mutilated oh dear the people of the bazaar aren't making this easy they're proud and loyal they refuse to turn anyone in but command has lost its patience i have orders from the top pilgrim if the inhabitants of old vilador continue to revolt our army will come here and burn the bazaar to the ground now i'd rather avoid that meet him what do you need from me lucas had a weapon yes well i want those come on brass knuckles this is the key to finding the killer if you learn anything about the lazarus tell me and i will most certainly return the favor it's worth a lot and we didn't find it on his body i think someone from the bazaar may have appropriated it so if i find that weapon you'll let me through to the center it's not that easy reelador suffered much first it was isolated from the outside world because of infection then the walls became its salvation the people here learned not to trust easily i won't open the passage until i've caught the killer but if you can find the lazarus i'll remember that you'll be the first one through once justice is done sounds sometimes if i have no other choice i'll try look around ask people and don't come back empty-handed good luck it's good to know they still got hair gel after the apocalypse it's still there i got a new safe zone very good right i think i'm gonna leave it here for today guys i will be back tomorrow and we'll continue where we are we've been going for about four
