i checked my stats earlier today and i've played nearly 475 hours of warzone since it came out a year ago and in that whole time i've never done this i'm not sure i even realized this but you can actually put a sniper scope on some of the assault rifles now you might be thinking to yourself well what's the point of that and yeah you're right on most assault rifles this wouldn't be very good but on the m13 it actually works i don't know why it just works whether that's this particular build or the low recoil or the headshot multiplier that the m13 has and it made me wonder it's basically a fully automatic sniper rifle that no one really used this and so i wanted to test it out and see if it was any good and in this match was playing with lachlan westy and study and it really surprised me how effective it was there are some downsides to this yeah you can't really use it close range but medium and long range pretty good so you want to pair it with a nice fast firing smg also if you use this scope you do in fact get a scope clip so people will see when you're aiming at them and it will be quite obvious where you're firing from but as you'll see in this video once you get on target and you start the beam there's just no escape in it it's good fun so i hope you guys enjoy this if you do leave a like and a comment down below thank you subscribe for more massive thanks to
