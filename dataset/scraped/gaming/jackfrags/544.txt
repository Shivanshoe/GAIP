hi everyone and welcome to some bf5 live gameplay commentary just fancy playing bf5 today it's been a while and i thought you know what let's play one of the og maps that i played i think this was the first one that i tried actually marvik was it the alpha the beta something like that for the first capture event that i went to can i take this stupid thing yeah i can it was novick and i remember getting an mg42 and playing operations and i was defending as the germans i was on top of one of the water towers i think like over there somewhere over here prone with an mg42 just going calm on the people attacking that's a good memory for me but today i'm going to be using the stg44 here one of my favorite weapons in the game this ever since it launched i think it's one of the best all-round assault rifles in the game really it's good fun and we're playing maxed out graphics here today at 1440p i haven't played in a while so i think i'm gonna be a bit rusty to be honest with you i know i haven't really posted a battlefield vid in a while but honestly like i said i haven't been playing it that much and how did i survive that i've been playing it that much and obviously there's been no news so yeah i mean if i'm not interested in something [Music] i'm not going to make videos on it right because that's going to show but today i just had the urge to to play [Music] oh i'm going to get toasted here aren't i yeah no regenerating health there are a lot of people up in that building on there so my nade actually got a hit there where am i squad i should be with my squad really shouldn't i not being much of a team player right now scg is always very good wasn't it though if i can wallbang someone all the pen in this game isn't very strong though is it could be someone up here i do enjoy the gunplay in this game though i think it's very good there's enemies around everywhere here aren't there what do i have i'm a flamethrower that was my kill that's on fire i don't suppose i should go standing in that then should i there's a guy over here somewhere on the menu maybe they no longer know they're still there a bomb there someone on my six are you an enemy yes you are could see your gun sticking through the wall mate don't think i'm gonna beat an mp28 at that distance though with an stj my squad mate is there but it's not gonna happen is it i'm ready to play but the round has just started so i should get a nice game out of this let's have a look i was fighting over c there wasn't i could try and push d i've got friendlies there pushing from the other direction so unless i get sniped in the head right now we might be all right there's a big bomber there should we go for the shot yeah i need to get used to that again the lead and everything i got the bazooka on the panzer was always my favorite rocket launcher something just uh had to go at me didn't they um try and get a dirty angle here ow sniper back there where did that come from yeah oh that's a different chap captain dice bear that's interesting that's a cuddly bear he wears a pilot's hat that works at dice you know they don't tell you that they have those kind of animals in sweden with the mental capacity to develop video games but they do you know i've been to stockholm several times and it's uh it's kind of a national secret over there right i ate too many durians just now is that steve oh please i hate that my rocket hit my teammate i mean it like it should right it's just annoying i need to get the hell out of here i hate this get a little head glitch here instead oh they are there is that oh yeah that's it that's dead enemy nothing better than a dead enemy i need my health back now please we 65 hp it's not great is it you're up in that building aren't they someone down here as well on the radar i don't know why there's just a permanent flare here by the way and what's that about a sniper back there a medic box over here i could grab let's get it lovely no way i'm letting that dude kill me i'm sure this one was just shooting at me from there enemies up to the right still oh there's steve no the window we kept the dice bear again those cubby bears are really really good with sniper rifles i'm very intelligent yeah we've been dominated look at this they've just held onto those points this d point is really important and it looks like we've got a lot of people on this point now i'm gonna do my harry potter thing what is that that is really weird i've never seen that before i'm gonna request an order can you do anything with this peculiar all right is that them off the point got a ping down here there could be an enemy down there yeah they died not sure right anyways squad lead thank you you put an order down i love that let's get those points oh man we're gonna go attack this and die i'm happy for the enemy to just chill over there though if they want now we've got c we can take this point how many you guys are still playing there battlefield v and i was just looking at the uh serverless to find a game of nardic and yeah there's quite a few people still playing it to be fair i think the fact that it's on is it ea play it's on ea playing it's on steam now as well that probably helps right now we got flanked but i just haven't touched it recently yeah that guy's on north hp how is that even possible yeah for me i've just been so into warzone and other games like i do play a bit of valorem as well upstream don't really post it on youtube of course but that's one of those games that i like to just play my free time with friends scratch that competitive itch that i get every now and again that's for me again get rid of that i imagine that there's more players on console though and perhaps on pc it's just like the the hardcore players who really enjoy the game still playing it because you know no new content that's not going to keep the casuals coming back is it the guys that just like to dip in every now and again right so i think i hear someone right underneath us just gonna wait here steve yeah on the ladder i imagine it's a bit more popular on console though because um i think if you get xbox game pass this is included in it right or some ea games are i don't know if their f5 is on it but they've got that ea play thing as well right on console too so maybe there's a little sniper there all right let's get this res scream cloud that's a good name pat on the shoulder for that one they've taken d back nasty opened up with the headshot there couldn't get the finish the dead guy all right so busy in there isn't it well i'm gonna put a rocket if you're gonna res 35 damage 64 damage we'll do another one that's got to be a kill i didn't even hit with that one the sniper's got my number now too i just wasted all my rockets sorry we got a tank here okay grenade down there is that right in the spot where did that land yeah perfect we've got revenge on captain dispair finally i love that and then we got sniped from the head his c point is infested with enemies right now put a rocket there hey let's do another one it's more effective than the scg that kind of range well i'm a bit closer now they're in there aren't they they all jumped out there rock it again now they've gone i guess we need to get down there don't we spitfire they're looking cool [Music] uh kill us this yeah i should hope so all right we're chilling underneath we've got blade farm looking good what's that what rifle is that is that the grand it's something like that what does this dude have mp is that the emp mp40 maybe yeah that dude's keeping it classic there's so many enemies above us right now right above what is that corpse doing it's going crazy i'm waiting for something to drop down they're right above us loads of them i could try and go with myself but it's risky roly-poly oh i wanted the roly-poly dice give it to me there's a guy here i think that's a different chat yeah quick reload i'm on two percent healthier guys medic chuck me some meds they're right above me on there oh i'm so dead i'm so dead leave me be leave me be let me just get up dice please okay okay we're okay medic medic i need my medic again look at the amount of enemies on the point nope nope nope medic medic medic please medic turn around please oh i'm probably not helping things oh no oh dear oh oh hey bye well i'm gone i'm sick of that point now that's nothing but pain for me nothing but pain meds no where's the medic i need the goddamn medic stat why do people say stat what does that stand for it just means now doesn't it or like soon quickly god that dude's gonna think i'm in the bunker i guess oh they're just not gonna turn around no bazooka i think there's another one dodge that oh the shotgun a shotgun on novick fair play no one does that apart from that guy i'm proud i'm really proud of them i must have revenge on the shotgun guy i don't get shot in the back here where's shotgun joe where they gone is adam maybe all right i'm going into their territory now this is bad let's get the kills there shotgun joe come back that was him i think chase him down lads chase him down shotgun joe yes down there that was great friendlies i can help i can help i got you blade farm don't worry dude you've got so many points you better send in a sick v1 what about the one on that b point that'd be good wouldn't it no he's put the order on b bounces around like crazy this stg man i mean the squad lead wants us to be and i'm going to follow orders right now i'm going to be come on come on come on come on oh a bit too high bit too high we're capping it out for the ap mines bit too far away there guys we're gonna get this point we can do this i mean we are losing but do i sense a comeback is there a late game come back here maybe well i don't think we're going to do it guys but it was worth an effort wasn't it always worth an effort one of these bad boys there 21 damage right there that's a direct hit completely missed whoa there he used it nice well that's the point clear that was pretty cool ow all these snipers bro i hope that's not captain dice bear again if it is you can eat that grenade are we good now that might be an enemy rocket right now i've got a feeling it is i've got a feeling i'm dead nice knowing you boys maybe oh okay well right there not entirely sure what happened then although i am sure that i'm dead three tickets we're not going to do it lads i'm proud of you all we tried our hardest we couldn't hold on to the port of norvik the german army will have
