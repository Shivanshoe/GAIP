warzone is changing forever in four days and maybe we'll never see this map for dance ever again i think i'm gonna miss it to be honest but i am very excited for the new map caldera and some of the big gameplay changes that they've made there there's also an event coming up soon which is the destruction of the dansk and i'll be sure to stream that with that said a couple days ago i decided to jump back into warzone and it had been about a month since i played properly now at the moment they've got an event going on called operation flashback which gets absolutely bonkers because the ground loot is replaced with classic meta builds from the last 18 months the circles are very fast and there's regular moments throughout the entirety of the match like juggernauts satellite crashes resurgence and more so there's lots of fighting lots of respawns and the games just have a nice flow to them way more teams still alive in end game too with that said i've got two matches for you here both were action-packed one where i teamed up with cameron and another where i jumped on late at night with some members of my discord server we had a good laugh for sure if you liked the video leave
