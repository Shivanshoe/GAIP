zombies are almost certainly coming back to call of duty war zone about half an hour ago call of duty released a big video teasing some of what's coming later today in the evening at the start of season two take a look at this real quick 1984 and the vodanoy ship has just left rebirth island with some precious cargo unfortunately for the captain and its crew it'll never reach its final destination it'll be gone lost at sea for 37 years to one day it appears crashing into verdance what it brought with it well some new friends so we have this new location at the launch of season two it's right between the gulag and the port it's a location that is close quarters it's tight there's multiple elevations you need to keep your head on a swivel but hopefully you go there you get those rewards and get out we also have something that we've teased since the beginning of our dance we're finally opening them up to the users a lot of them go in there and explore start to unravel some of the stories some of the mystery around this this island so we're finally opening up these areas and we're excited to see what fans do with it we have so many things planned throughout this season here it's going to culminate an amazing experience towards the end of the season okay so that's the confirmation that the ship the vodianoy that's being spotted off the coast will in fact crash into the dance and it's going to end up between the gulag and horse right around here and inside are some new friends now it doesn't take a genius to work out but that's probably zombies and i've got more evidence of that which i'll show you in just a second but he described that location as close quarters pike multiple elevations that's a cargo ship he also said get in there and get that reward out now he could just have been referring to loot or cash but i wonder if there's any sort of special loot that you can get in there if you complete some kind of objective it would be cool if there was something else to do in that ship apart from just fight other players and potentially zombies and the bunkers of course all opening up two by the sounds of it and we'll be able to explore those and unravel the stories and mysteries of the island so when the patch goes live later tonight there will be one new big poi which is the crashed ship the body annoy in between that port and view lag location and of course all of the bunkers which can now be fully explored and i know that they showed a snippet of these in the teaser trailer a couple days ago but maybe there's a lot more to this than they're not showing i know in the past they've said hey there's a whole underground to the dance that just hasn't been discovered yet so i'm expecting that these could be some quite advanced and maze-like underground structures very cool indeed and then at the end so many things planned for this season culminating in an amazing experience towards the end of the season so something big is about to happen for cod warzone i'm here for it getting really excited about this stuff now the other evidence about zombies being in warzone if you own black ops you can already patch it and when you load up you got a new menu screen but there's been some new stuff added to the game already and if we head to customization in the barracks and go to calling cards and then zombies in here there are actual calling cards for doing zombies things in warzone so that is 100 confirmation that zombies are coming back to war zone and i don't think that this will be the same as the halloween event i think these will be ai zombies that are in certain areas of the map most likely at the moment around the vadinoy because that's where they came from kind of like how it was in blackout if you remember over at the old church in the cemetery so side objectives starting to creep their way into warzone and there's a few different calling cards here let's take a quick look so the first one we've got here is aim for the head in warzone kill 10 zombies with headshots and the second one is one two punch in warzone rapidly kill two or more zombies two times and the way these descriptions are it's almost like they're not talking about playable zombies i do think these are ai zombies and there's another one further down here shotgun eliminations in warzone use shotguns to eliminate eight zombies if you look at the background there there is nothing like that in the map at the moment so i don't know what's going on there it kind of looks like it's part the black ops campaign or something with that purple lighting and everything so i don't know what's going on there and then we've got quick elimination which is in warzone eliminate eight zombies before the first circle closes and that description it's almost like it's normal warzone right so we've got some really juicy stuff here also the title screen for warzone has changed and you can see the body annoy there with players parachuting above it i really love how they've teased and built up to this i just feel like they've done it very well and kept people on the edge of their seats and that's about it for now there was some other stuff floating around on twitter today that i i didn't really want to show in the video because i felt like it was a bit dodgy how it was obtained so let's just say there's some stuff out there on the internet that you could find that shouldn't necessarily be seen yet put it that way but just a heads up for you guys i will be live streaming this when it goes live on youtube i think it's like 7am gmt so it's going to be really early in the morning for me but i'm going to be up i'll patch the game and i'll just get started straight away because we've got three new weapons three primary weapons to play with exploring the new map potential easter eggs looking at the zombies things maybe they'll be close to what's coming out for the dansk in the future it's gonna be really exciting i'll just make sure i've got my coffee and i'm good to go so watch out for that that will be in the morning uk time and once again if you guys buy anything like the battle pass or any of the new operators or cod points blueprints skins whatever it is consider using my code jackfrags click supporter creator at the bottom type in jackfrags in all capital letters before you buy anything and
