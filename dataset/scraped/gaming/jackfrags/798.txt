so apparently I've been playing escape from tarkov wrong and you guys have told me that I need to go to the lab at the stats a starting area just get it but for real the last couple videos that I posted I've been going to the interchange and a lot of comments told me that that's like a high level area with like difficult Raiders and scavs to kill and also people with higher gear tend to go there so everyone said go to the factory and see how that goes instead so that's what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna do a scabbard on the factory and we'll just see how it goes I'm gonna be absolutely my blood I run around like crazy we'll see what happens we'll see what we get I'm still learning the game a lot I know this came out like three years ago and I played it a little bit back then like I did maybe two or three videos on it but I never really got my teeth stuck into it and learnt about the trading and the inventory and all that stuff and back then I think it was quite a different game and I want to try and actually learn the game understand it because really all I've been doing a few times I've played is just going into the game killing people getting killed and that's it like I haven't really lured anything I've lost a load of stuff it's not been great so I'm just gonna play for a bit and see if I can understand the game a bit more so what do I have on this go then have a look I've got a MP one three three shotgun is that any good see this is the problem I have I just don't know what my potential is so I've got bandages and I put those in my pocket so I can they're hotkey them right anyways okay I'm under the ground I think this has a torch as well right yeah so I do feel kind of safe under the ground at home and obviously this upstairs and I do know that if you're asked Avenue other scabs they don't attack you but the problem I'm going to face is that I don't know what players look like and what scabs look like so obviously something's gone down here maybe I should just have a let's kill everyone approach that might work now close that door can you even close that door you can't close that door guys that's not that's not a door that you can close so he's got some kind of an a K their body armor I mean I can take that chi AKM tactical rig so if I search that and a backpack so that's the ammo for it right so hold on I'll put that in my tactical rig and then reload that a kcon I I can hear someone near me I can't tell if they're above me though maybe they are sometimes in this game it's really difficult to figure out where people are I mean that's not a bad start I've upgraded from the shotgun to an acre and I'll get back to searching this guy what was in here nothing but that bag does actually look better than that one so I should take that right so if I discard that and then put that there right let's go with this for now so this person that's running around oh this girl needs only single fire maybe you need a mod for it let's get a shotgun out so when I first played the game this area was here like this map I think was the only one that was available but I I've just got no idea where the loot spawns and if it's good stuff or not I think what I'm gonna do is if I find Lou I'm just gonna take it and then maybe I'll learn that way what to keep and what to get rid of you know that might be the best way of doing things dead guy there holy ok there's a lot of dead guys here that's got to be a player right does this even connect nope I mean that dude look like he was really armored right to Mercker greatest zuri thorax can I see the damage so I did 7 damage to that guy's body and 139 damage of it was absorbed by armor what ok well that's uh that's a bad start I guess so now because that scab is dead I have to wait 20 minutes before I can do another scav one but this is my main character hold on see what I mean like I've just got crap here and I don't know what's good I've got an sv-98 for some reason don't know why that's there I've got a load of magazines sv-98 hand rail see the thing is at this point like that could be a really sick rifle but if I take it into game now I'm just gonna die on I so I suppose I've got some ammo here for what is this a k70 for so I guess I could try and find an ak74 to buy or I'll tell you what let's just going with this pistol 9 by 19 para have I got some rounds for that have a look yes of that it's a magazine for it it's already loaded so I've just got one extra mag I don't have any armor or anything like that should I take some bandages in I could take some painkillers you know I'm just gonna go in like this and see how it goes so they're just some pmc everyone is hostile so if I see anything I'm just gonna shoot it what's the time left as well twenty nine minutes that's something that I used to get used to it sometimes drops you like in the middle of a session I suppose and that's why you see like dead people around already it's a very different game to your traditional multiplayer experience where it might just start a game and everyone's on the same footing there could be people already here there could be people who are like much higher level than you are I have way better gear I think sound is obviously really important to right I'm just so impatient sometimes something there what's that it smells like a toy or something what is this a t-shaped plug interesting I mean someone's got like a mod SMG or something over there nothing in there like if I found something good in here I wouldn't know it's not like I've got room for it anyway is it a hand drill I've got no space for it another bag there's a little gap there you could shoot through I just want to get in fights with people though because when you've got a character like this I suppose you don't salute and you get gear off for the people I think I hear someone might be down here so what happened there then ironically good can I not see what level they are right anything no kills damage Delta body 161 ammo use 13 hit count 3 so I hate that guy three times and did 161 damage I don't think they had any head-on with those so if I just shot them in the head they would have just gone down I think right I'm back I just downed an entire cup of tea and we're gonna go scav this guy I'm gonna go factory again yeah blah-dee blah-blah look at this dude so we got a shotgun again but he's just got a cigarette in his mouth this is gonna be good come back in again about 20 minutes left I think that might be a player because they've got the blue vest on but I can take that where are those footsteps that's the scanner think just covers through that yeah it's a scam shoot someone over there I'm just gonna search his body it's got to be a lie take the armor it's got a helmet price this is the best day ever all right so this comes getting shot them out there so there's a play there somewhere are they actually gonna come in here though I don't know if they walk through this door I've got a good chance to kill in them but if they walk through that door I don't think so they come in yeah yes right I'm pretty sure that was a real player I mean I was just camping in the corner is there anyone else around I don't know I don't think so let's have a look what is this an SKS scout backpack oh there's a load of stuff in there key pockets and bag within a bag why would you is that a normal thing to do I've got a Snickers look so if I move my stuff out of that tactical rig and put that one on instead so we'll discard that get that one put this stuff in the backpack bag within a bag though we did it we've done it I'm so proud I need to like organize stuff now though have a look at this s gas nice it's got ammo in it off okay but this pistol too it's got four bullets in it this guy's got a keycard what's this labs terror group keycard single-use so if I extract with that that might actually give me access to something the labs I'm assuming I'm gonna get out of it then put that mustache I think over here this is one of the exits that looks familiar people like to camp here though don't they right so I could just extract here if I wanted to I think how's this dead guy there clear I think let's check him out though we're gonna extract soon hope he doesn't have anything amazing man doesn't like it okay felt like we made a bit of progress there we got a kill we survived we extracted and I actually picked some armor up this thing and a helmet so that's gonna give me a bit more protection on my main character and I also acquired a couple of guns which is cool so now we have to actually take this loop off the scav and put it into our stash like so cuz if you don't do that as far as I know you lose it and so what would be the point of doing that whole thing if we just lost it alright so that's everything transferred we are good to go now right so this will be the last match of the video but what I'm gonna do is put some that stuff on that we got and go into a game with my main character I don't care if I die to be honest I just want to use some of this stuff and see how it goes she was trying different map scene is it's the last game of the video I'm gonna try the woods see how that goes down 10 a.m. woods Ron beginning to feel like I shouldn't have done this I think I know where one of the extracts is but you know this is my new SKS it's my new AKM I don't want to get familiar with them because I'm sure I'm gonna lose them very soon indeed it's definitely something going down there I'm just gonna run towards it it could be fun and see what happens I mean that sounds exciting over there my changing direction and that sounds exciting too like I'm in the middle I think if two fights here don't know oh that's bullets going directly over my head I think there's someone there I didn't see anyone though I'm a spy someone here AI think but someone was shooting at me from over there oh man I'm scared to go loot that guy is anyone looking at me come on should I do it I'm just gonna do it let's see mk3 that looks good what's in that oh that looks really good maybe it's got like armor in it or something I don't know so it's the pockets nothing in there tiger body armor I think mine's better but does that mean that it's damaged 14.7 armor points that was got 23 yeah I should take that one a shame that you can't just drag in it discards it just brick building here I'm guessing you can go inside that yeah looks like there's an entrance there where the walls blown out switch tak there's someone inside it I don't know if there's another way in though okay no one else here I just want to make sure what's that there so they've killed someone there I'm sure that was like a sniper yeah look look at that what is that search the Mo's in it's got a suppressor on it Kaskade yeah it's definitely a player I'd say that dog tag I don't know what you can do with the dog tags I assume that you can just trade them in 22.4 arm the points 25 so mine's actually better without suppressed Mohsen though look at that I should take that backpack is that a bit of rig than what I have it doesn't look like it stuff in there look at the ammo is that for the Mosin I think so that looks nice as well that's great I'm going to take that too cool I think that was a good kill I'll check out these guns a gun with the scope on guys I've actually got a gun with a scope on I don't believe this this is his aim so it turns out if you run towards the gunfire it can be profitable at times but I don't have any short-range stuff really apart from my pistol this TT think that's like a proper 3d scope isn't it you definitely feel the framerate take a hit too when you zoom in I can live with that for now now it's such a nice looking game at times isn't it it really is it's gorgeous great for thumbnails do factory gate you need to bring a friendly scab in order to extract what well I'm PMC so how could I possibly do that I couldn't right I'd need to get a different extraction oh wow there's a big open area isn't it that's huge damn look at this place I mean this is sniper heaven over here guys I think there's a player there they're dead it almost seemed like they wiggled why would they wiggle why did they do that but this sniper rather just dropped that dude why would you Whittle suppressed Mosin that looks like a big bag doesn't it bandages cigarettes more cigarettes Nike G desk that seems important I'm gonna take that take off oh you can actually close and open up all my points 40 mine's only mine was 25 so I should take that shouldn't I although it might be cracked or something cuz I shot him in the head oh no it's okay look it's put like a little film over my face so with that give me face protection I think guys I don't know I just don't know let's guy that that guys just absolutely pegging it where were they running to guys I'm scared I didn't kill him with that shot did I it's over there dead I might not have been the same one there are you what the hell these what are they doing I'm so confused guys I need to learn the game give me that tape measure I mean yeah okay so we just got upgrades I think this game but how am I going to escape I need to actually find an extraction point I don't know where they are was a big box here what's in here then yes kit oh man there's some big magazine here that's interesting could take this stuff and pull one attachments gen m3 hmm okay so I found a map on Google and I think the outskirts extraction point which is available should be over dis direction somewhere so if I follow the water all the way to the top I'll see a wall and then I've gotta go right and then it should meet a path and that's the extraction so hopefully I can get there in 17 minutes I hope so all right so that's the wall so if I follow that wall all the way down to the right it should lead to a dirt path and that should be the extraction that I need yes okay I got it right as long as I get shot now keep wiggling oh man that was intense my heart was going then okay I think that will do for today's video guys look at me now look like an absolute chung this cascade he was the guy that we killed and we took his dog tag have to figure out what to do with that his my stats cool well I'm glad that I played that with the map though that was interesting and we finally got to level four we might get level five and open up that trading thing come on you can do it you can do it yes right so level five gets me something like access to an auction house or something like that I have to find out next time but hope you enjoyed this guy's let me know if you want to see more of this down in the comments below and if you did like it leave a like with that
