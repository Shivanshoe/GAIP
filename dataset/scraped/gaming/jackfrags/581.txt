hey everyone hope you're doing well today i'm bringing you a solo match on cod warzone with a bit of commentary in this game let's just say that not everything goes to plan and you'll see why but just before we get into it i just want to give you guys a heads up if you'd like to help to support me for free modern warfare and warzone have just added a support a creator code to the store and if you add the code jackfrags in all capital letters and then buy anything on the store i will get a percentage of that sale it's pretty cool that the cod guys have done this there are other creators involved too so look out for them as well and if you use my code i'd be very appreciative of that thank you so much tweet me a picture if you do that code will stay there for two weeks as well before you have to refresh it again with that said let's get into the video so you know a couple days ago i posted that m4 build video and it was a solo match and it was a really good game everything just seemed to fall in place like clockwork and it turned out great this game is not one of those games this is a game where everything bad that can happen happens almost every firefight that i get in is a close one it's quite an interesting match and i thought that i'll show you guys this so this game was right at the end of the last season a couple days before the patch went live and that's why some of the ground looks a bit different just so you weren't confused i dropped a port and noticed the guy up in the crane but as soon as i aimed at him i get railed in the back and then they start shooting each other so that's given me an opportunity to fall back a bit i don't have any spare plates though but i just felt like i could out shoot that guy and there's all my plates gone that's the first occasion that happens not i reckon i went down there to around 60 hp maybe picked up a couple plates in that building and i was looking out for the other guy that he was shooting at and i thought i heard some footsteps there so i'm just being a bit stealthy and he has dropped off missed so many shots there without foul i just do not like the iron sights on the foul switched up to the mp7 and eventually you can see that i'm quite frustrated with myself there because my aim with that mp7 as well was just trash but i don't know about you guys there are some iron sights in this game that i cannot stand the foul yeah that's they're not for me also the ebr iron sights you know ebr's ground loot at the moment if i see that thing i don't get anywhere near it i would rather have a knife than that ebr because the iron sights are just awful so i did pick up my loadout in the crates back there at the bye and this was when i was all about the ram seven and i noticed a couple guys firing up ahead sometimes going absolutely mental at the stadium realized there was a jeep behind me and my plan was to do the old oh i don't know you're here but then drop a c4 and explode them but they carried on going and i saw that they had a trophy system so i didn't waste the c4 giant killed him i'm trying to get the loot here get the uav i want that dead silence pop the uav get shot at trying to get the dead silence accidentally pick up the holger everything has sniped this guy must have been like what is he doing but when the ground loop gets like that it's so difficult i was trying to get the dead silence so i could run away straight in the gulag no messing around mk2 i quite like the iron sights on this so the decoy a bit of a distraction and then him with the old one-two punch there get the initial damage with the shot and then going for the quick melee just a really simple way to guarantee a kill in the gulag there so not really a great start to the match this one we're in the first circle there's still over a third of the players left too yeah i've got four kills but it's a bit of a fail because i just got my loadout and instantly died but i thought that i'd pick up a bounty to see if i could gear up get some cash really quick when i'm playing solos and i respawn like that bounties are always a really good way of doing it but there was also another goo lager that landed on the roof and i got the advantage there pretty quick broke the armor and thankfully that guy didn't get a gun i was a bit worried but all i'm trying to do here is close the gap they jump off and then get host i think by my bounty and of course the second loadout is right in the middle of the airfield i was just shooting out of frustration and my bounty ruins me there and i'm on like what 10 15 health so i'm thinking okay this is it this solo game is chalked and then i find an m91 followed by bison two of the worst guns for war zone it's not it's not going well is it it's really not going well but we soldier on i'm gonna try and get that bounty now then this is where it starts to get real spicy so someone picks up a bounty and they decide to come after me right i'm not in good shape right now no armor plates m91 bison my bounty is moving further and further away and this attack rover on the airfield you can see there that's the guy hunting me this guy is feeling confident they've probably just got their load out from the airfield too this dude wants me i know they're behind that wall somewhere triple threat now they're just not peaking for some reason so i decided to fall back let's get a better position maybe i can find a couple armor plates in the plane and i just see his legs under the plane there did you guys spot that i might do a little replay of that watch under the wing look at that that's horrible it's like i'm being hunted by some kind of creepy shadow demon but we get in the plane of course i'm going to straight upgrade get rid of that m91 get myself a ground loop foul open the crate here and we did find a plate that is going in straight away and i absolutely needed this and i switch out to the m13 not on heartbeat still he's in the plane right there plate goes down to 45 hp really i've just got to get out of there i just danced to c4 and i think well the only way i can beat this guy is with this foul if they get up in my grill i can now dps them so i'm just hiding i'm waiting he drops down didn't spot me straight away tagged me a couple times but the damage i'll put on that foul insane against all the odds i managed to win that fight i didn't expect to honestly i thought once he'd had me in the plane and he cracked that armor that i got got me down to 45 hp i was done for coincidentally i think if that player would have just pushed straight away instead of throwing the c4 they'd have got me but it's a pretty safe bet isn't it to just chuck a c4 if you think that player isn't going to move and get the kill but we did come out on top by the skin of our teeth there and i managed to pick up that guy's growl and that is really important because it means that when i hit this loadout i don't need to get my overkill which means that i can get ghost straight away so i've got this loadout with hdr and ghost equipped swap out the pistol get the growl so now really nice setup got a decent brow build and my favorite hdr so a bit further on into the game now and um playing the edge of the zone trying to get a bit more cash to think about picking up a uav this dude comes along rocks up at the fire station i'm thinking they're probably going to go for that recon so i peek the door open it really slowly to avoid making a big noise guy does not expect me to get holes by the ground but i did lose all of my armor and they said something on voice comms too i don't know what that was because i don't speak that language but i'm intrigued if anyone knows what this guy said please translate it let me know down in the comments below here we go really hard to make out that one isn't it anyways i did a recon because i thought why not i want to win this game now let's find out where the last zone is going to be and it was all the way up here by the quarry look at this ridiculous half the map isn't in for the next zone so i'll get there early leave the jeep there so i've got a bit of cover check the heartbeat real quick because in solos people are keen man there could easily have been someone here but on this occasion i think because i'd done the recon i got lucky i was the first person here so i'm just gonna chill wait it out and see where i have to move next so the next zone wasn't that far away but i did keep it really stealthy and i'm just using the information i can get from that enemy precision airstrike to estimate where people are obviously there's someone right on the edge in front of me somewhere and as luck would have it there they are that's the guy that called the airstrike in and i'm not opening fire straight away just ghosting them i'm waiting for a clean shot i'm sure that they saw my laser there maybe i don't know how far away you can see it but i'm being really stealthy waiting for the perfect opportunity dude didn't have much cover there in between those two trees so that was my time to start shooting crack the armor get the finish and there it is all the time i'm thinking about finishing the job as quick as possible there because when you're this late in the game and there's only seven other people left any noise that you make any firefight that you get in it's going to compromise you because other people will hear and see what's going on and because this game has been such a struggle i am keeping a really low profile right now so i literally just slug my way into the zone this is almost the final circle now four of the players left i've heard a couple of other firefights going on but i'm not sure exactly where the remaining players are i thought i heard something over there i wasn't entirely sure though i did see a little bit of movement there guy ran up behind the tree and they're getting a firefight switch to the hdr waiting for a clean shot i know that guy's got to move and i've got the high ground so i'm holding here we shot to my left he's out in the open not much of a chance there get the finish eventually and that guy said something to you sounded a bit angrier than the first one let me know down in the comments below what that was but now there's only two other people left i've got a nice rock here circles coming to me a little bit of luck considering how unlucky i was earlier in the game i hear a shot down to the south check the top right there's only two players left it's 1v1 dude he's looking at me whizzes a bullet right past my ear but i know the this guy's got to run uphill so i'm getting a position of power here use the big rocks got a massive advantage now they're on the back foot so i'll keep the pressure on keep facing they're gonna be forced to move any second put that pressure on and there we get the down and that's all she wrote it was a little bit difficult to get an angle here didn't finish him with the first shot got him with the second i was so relieved when i won that game honestly it was just one of those games where everyone you're coming up against is a good player and every fight that you have is difficult but i suppose at the end of the day when you win those ones they feel way more satisfying with that said thank you for watching guys i hope you
