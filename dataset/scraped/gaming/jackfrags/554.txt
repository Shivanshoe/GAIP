hello everyone and welcome to star wars squadrons so i've just been given access to the game and today we are going to be playing through a couple hours of the single player campaign i'm really looking forward to this we're playing in 4k so if you can watch that that'll be the best quality for you and just to show you guys we are playing on pc at the moment at 4k and we're pretty much maximum graphics right now got everything on ultra the whole shebang the only thing i don't have turned on is hdr because i'm not using an hdr monitor but with that said i am excited to get into this and check it out i've played the multiplayer before but the single player i've got no idea i think we're gonna have a good time with it and i'm really looking forward to it i hope you guys enjoy this without said let's get stuck in gas star wars on right so we can customize our pilots here i suppose those are the names we've got atos silk heart and cayenne farlander so we've got some options to change the way the head looks i think i'm gonna go with that one because it kind of looks like daisy ridley so that's our imperial pilot we've got kane farlander for the rebels two options here i don't think you can go in and tweak their eyes or their nose or anything they're just like preset pilots i'm happy with that right standard yeah uh okay okay let's do this i hope you guys enjoy this it has to start like that doesn't it alderaan chose destruction they incited rebellion and anarchy and paid the price the survivors continue to spread dissent find them do not rest until the destruction of alderaan is complete [Applause] lord vader's orders are clear are they yes wipe out all that remains of alderaan how i understood the survivors were in hiding intelligence reports a possible alderaanian convoy heading to foster haven you are to draw them out and finish them off do you understand that captain perfectly commodore sloane dismissed um captain james everything ready lieutenant carol squadron's on their way they're excited to fulfill lord vader's command and you no qualms hunting down refugees from a world we destroyed during the escalon uprising you taught me to ignore propaganda they're traitors not refugees and will be dealt with accordingly i've prepped our usual sigma 9 loadout no only standard ties today flying old school sir this might be a real challenge after all you hear me teresa but i don't think you understand me i guess we'll find out here's me follow my lead and don't fire unless i give the order the convoy is out there we don't want to scare them off let's do this right another victory is at hand damn right so we're in game now look at this hangar oh nice detail isn't it i will say as well this is a frostbite engine game and the animations on those characters faces for me that's a significant upgrade from what we've seen in the past let's jump in the tie [Music] begin pre-flight checks pilot hold up your cockpit systems affirmative all systems up and running [Music] reflect complete let's get a clean launch lock onto my fighter target with tee forward sensor online and tracking now throttle up and deploy out of the hangar let's get out of that we're in space here we go the rest of the fleet is back from malistaire we'll have plenty of help to deal with that convoy of sympathizers [Applause] helix squadron we're prepping yogazanti transport oh that's star destroyer though this looks incredible you wanna do some rolls i can do some rolls you forget how big our star destroyers really are they're shields huge harm us but flying so close to the hall is no time to get careless [Music] look at the size of it it's massive it's good to fly old school again there's something very forthright about a typhoon free look look all the way behind me if i want they've nailed the aesthetic and the sounds haven't they really have someone is testing battle than in the field formations keep your distance helix those engines run hot enough to vaporize a tie careful of oh my god you can see inside it what the hell that's so cool dock for hyperspace jump well we're going hyperspace i'm excited for this i love that you can see inside the star destroyers here we go you can't play this in vr i'm playing it on pc in 2d helix squadron are dark and clear for hyperspace jump remember helix we'll have support but finding the refugee convoy is up to us they won't escape the empire twice punch it oh what are those ships there probably the most isolated trading posts in the sector their venice is on their only a haven for thieves and pirates if the refugees are hiding here clearly they're not as innocent as they claim galaxy what the hell is that all the ships coming out of hyperspace blockade is secure at least interesting there's a lot of cargo traffic today and our convoy might be hiding among them agreed it looks suspicious this is captain lyndon james of the galactic empire prepare for immediate inspection and this oh my god station master kindly avoid harassing my customers if they cooperate they'll be fine pilot proceed what would you like me to do check your forward sensor it will identify potential targets gotta find this transport that we're looking for is it you hmm we're looking for someone could be this guy here back off a little bit we'll turn around this guy here maybe [Applause] one of these guys is up to no good begin by inspecting that ship okay scan an unknown ship or object [Music] wait wait we have always been loyal to the empire i don't believe you steve we're loyal i swear they're cool refugees are bored carry on this guy here check that ship next don't pay anything just don't impound my ship pilot keep inspecting those ships and see if the refugees are here was it you sign it's from alderaan keep looking hmm so you're not impounding my ship no you're fine a ship's trying to flee okay we should teach them some manners let's go after them all pilots bring your weapon systems online pilot track it on your sensors and fire a small volley just enough to damage them then see if they're hiding the refugees hit him with a few blasts all right all right scan us then just stop shooting no refugees here sir just smuggled weapons and a cargo of spice at the fleet handle those smugglers we should get to the station my customers are legitimate traders you have no right captain the station's defenses just activated helix squadron destroy those turrets we can't search are they going to shoot at us all right even the empire should know that we're going to take out these turrets due to divert power to lasers got it blast them some down here as well let's go to the top side keep going so the ties got quite a short range you can only hit them when it turns red oh the sound is amazing it's so good boom oh there's only a couple more left now now the last one yeah there we are good shooting pilot our reputation will never recover from this [Applause] oh there's like a hole in the rocks there we've got enemy activity oh we got x-wings defend yourselves if necessary i'll look for the refugees oh they got shields whoa repair that shields blast through the shields before we can get the whole yeah lead your target did we finish them off then no still going down cool that's half the rebel scum [Music] destroyed i'm gonna speed up put the power to my engine it gives you a bit more agility as well if you do that so you can turn quicker but obviously when you're in a dog fight like this you want to put most of your power in your lasers tricky to keep track of them where have you gone so wherever you aim is obviously where the lasers go so your ship targets just is the most important thing you can't aim with the mouse so to speak the rebel fighters are coming from that tunnel through the station the refugee convoy must be hiding in there after them sun i'm down sniff out the rats you attack my station [Applause] prepare to fire oh we're gonna blast them it appears i've been disabled all systems down those were iron missiles where the hell did they come from i'm sorry teresa it was james after alderaan i can't ignore what the empire's become is it tracer sir lyndon what are you saying that i don't care who ordered it i didn't sign up to her innocent and if refugees them makes me a rebel then so be it wow damn it pilot see if you can bypass his [Music] not shutdown catch up with that traitor lieutenant carol captain james is aiding the rebellion send immediate assistance are you shooting our place down the doors are closing i see the convoy dead ahead i wish you'd seen [Applause] just buried us oh unlucky guys [Music] you're dead anyway echo squadron hello there yourself it's x-wing time let's get it that call sounds desperate can anyone make out what he's saying they're working on it look at this squadron on me any luck pinpointing that distress call hopefully you may need to get creative so much for a quiet patrol starting systems check sure yeah the cockpit's a bit different for the x-wing obviously we'll need maneuverability fast and nimble got it it's a montgomery weapons look good they'll look better when we're shooting down ties shields you can put shields in the back or the front as well all right we might need to hold out a while or just generally systems check complete information anyone low on missiles needs to stock up now are we going hyperspace again i think we might be i'll get a resupply here is that a u-wing there on the left it looks like good commanders verified the distress call from all right time to go echo squadron join the first wave and head to the rendezvous point this had to happen while half the fleet's away here we trapping go i suppose down oh we made it we're here yeah but the convoy's way over there but the bad guys between us and them echo squadron transfer all power to engines head below the star destroyer and wait for my signal it's risky but flying fast and close to the star destroyers hall should get us to the other side safely steady you're gonna go right underneath please fire all boost thrusters dodge the lasers well that tactic didn't work he lied to me we're here yeah but the convoy's way over there but the bad guys between us and them echo squadron transfer all power to engines head below the star destroyer and wait for my six maybe i was a bit too close it's risky but flying fast and close to the star destroyers hall should get us to the other side safely steady hold now let's go we're all boost thrusters i think we'll make it we'll make it that was deadly i did not like doing that ships are moving in rebel alliance forces the convoy needs support wait that was an imperial transmission on an open channel got pawkins [Music] i'll explain later pilot help me push these fighters back echo four leave that quasar for now focus on ties yes i think i've got missiles yeah i do check that out boom [Music] got him some more here yeah you're so much more agile when you switch to engines i got missiles so these tires are attacking that convoy they made it through the other side of the tunnel stay on target stay i'm on target damn it missed nice so it's quite a while to lock onto them i know that you can upgrade your missiles so they lock on quicker didn't need the missile there just keep on going oh my god wow they're kicking my ass got him i see two more on the radar and escort these willing and able do we believe him and keep persisting look at the detail in this cockpit what the hell very good squadron upside down and filled with reinforcements take the ties down where did that star destroyer come from is that the one that we went past at the beginning i think so that was like an eye on missiles and then disabled him let those lasers recharge a bit okay get some repairs on again splash one bogey yeah that's a good hit nice what is hearing me there he's doing a lot of damage that's all the ties down yes come on people that quasar's gotta go ready to go by those missiles yeah we got it yeah way to deal with that quasar nice work squadron thousands dead i think we're clear for now let's make the most of it there's a why do we just trust this guy should we we're on it admiral i know how this imperial fleet operates i can tell they're prepping their capital ships for an attack right now we need backup all right i'll send you the rest of echo squadron with everything they've got heading towards a star destroyer again facing its turrets this time it's okay our fleet's coming well not fast enough fleet is now at your location echo squadron keep the convoy safe while the flagship engages the vigilance right wait the empire is sending in a raider to intercept the convoy we have to take that raider down this thing again [Music] almost in range get ready i think we're gonna have to do some strafing runs on this otherwise i might end up being killed here good their shields are weakening keep the radar focused on us not the convoy starting another attack run can you find those missiles under fire from the imperial fleet the raiders lost shields they're trying to get cover from the capital ships uh he's running home we can get him we're work this would be incredible in uh vr location head to the far side of the ncaa let's go refugee convoy we're out of time we've got to get you out of here refugee convoy to rebel alliance we're ready for light speed joe wait the star destroyer will be watching all possible vectors they can still find you pilot it's risky but if we can destroy the targeting system on the business we might throw them off the convoy's trailer wait are we going to attack the star destroyer let's hope your feet can keep those shields down strike here we can take down the visual targeting all right we've got to go for the targeting system putting shields to the front because this is probably really risky am i getting one straight yes get out of there vigilance's targeting is down oh convoy vessels prep for light speed jump let the squadron withdraw and handle any fighters near the convoy he did it now both of you get clear let's go pilot whatever happens next you saved a lot of innocent lives and mine cowboy's ready to jump thank you we'll tell everyone what the rebel alliance did for all us prepare for light speed we all choose our path light or dark freedom or destruction the empire chose to destroy alderaan in order to spread fear and douse the fires of rebellion but the heroic pilots of the rebel alliance have chosen to keep fighting to show the empire that we are not afraid it was their bravery that ended palpatine's reign and brought about our new republic however the empire lives on shattered though it may be as i speak imperial forces are edging toward the bormia sector hoping to end our new republic before we find our footing as their empire collapses they try to tighten their grip but the galaxy is changing and you can be a part of it with the help of brave and daring pilots this war can end make a choice fly with the new republic change our galaxy for the better right so we've jumped to after returning the jedi now death star 2 has gone vanguard squadron to temperance do you read us now had some trouble with our long range calms you're the third patrol reporting com blackouts and i'm back gunny the commander will want a full report [Applause] chasing our tails for hours and now we're late to meet the new boss well do you want to race home frisk we might make it before his speech ends ko i ain't racing you i learned my lesson the first 12 times ash the speech is starting the transoceanize i know that because i'm a nerd the same species as flask so i'll just say i'm honored there he is to assume command of the temperance in this fleet vanguard squadron's reputation for bravery and integrity is unrivaled which is why effective immediately we have been reassigned to an initiative code named project starhawk star hook then those rumors about a secret project are true what do you think it is some kind of weapon there is the key to victory if it helps end the war who cares i care i like to know who i'm working for the good guys risk remember the only people in the galaxy who don't have a death mark on you [Applause] ah grace the day ain't over yet come on back to the temperance we can meet the new boss and anyone else he's bringing along are we the good guys i don't know ah there you are hey ardos said to expect you i'm zarel de sage chief mechanic and this here's the temperance my pride and joy i imagine you're excited to join the action speaking of here's the rest of your squadron hey gunny i got your new pilot over here you go ahead i'll meet you in there i don't know what species that is squadron i'm kyra kuva you can call me gunny happy to have you on the team let's talk after the briefing eh he's joining one of the best outfits in the new republic hope you can live up to it anyway follow them into the briefing room i think our new commander's waiting for you in there you want me to go in here okay so he became a commander you've arrived excellent otto meet our new vanguard five oh the one who saved your skin at foster haven art o'baradi fleet intelligence a pleasure i heard they rewarded you with a posting to chandrila a real honor how do you shake the hand but a good pilot shouldn't just gather dust i needed people i can trust and i figured you'd want to get back into the action huh there's no shortage of that around here right let's get you briefed welcome back to the front line vanguard 5. is this the long play is he a double agent just pretending that he wanted to defect your briefing's ready to go i'm just looking around just chill oh my god it's fine as you've no doubt experienced the empire is jamming communications across the sector i fear these blackouts could be a prelude to invasion vanguard squadron i need you to split up to solve this christian grace bring our new pilot to the brental system's borders the scouts we sent to investigate haven't reported in find out what happened to them then regroup with your squadron near the planet cavas gunny and keo that's where you're headed if i was still an imperial well i'd send jamming ships there knowing the empire i expect they're using these jamming vessels to disrupt our long range calms they'll have thai squadrons in tow destroy all imperial squadrons and jammers communications must be restored for project starhawk's future when you've succeeded regroup and return to the temperance let's see how you do vanguard squadron got a moment all right you want to chat hello grace sally avatara signer grace if you like that's a hell of a name it's a pleasure i've been with vanguard long enough for gunny to trust me with second position and she doesn't trust easily especially those from imperial families well everyone finds out sooner or later yes unfortunately my dear estranged family builds tie fighters for the empire and i take great delight in blasting those fighters to stardust i trust you will too of course so family's still with the empire she left them keo what do you want oh hey i'm keo venzie welcome to vanguard squadron you'll do great things with us trust me this is an amazing team i went from semi-pro racing to fighting the empire quite a change pod racing but everyone in vanguard lifts up the others you'll fit right in whatever this project starhawk is i suppose the commanders will tell us when they're ready but for now we have scouts to find according to the battle plan we aren't flying together on this mission but you'll be on my wing sooner than later see you out there see you around kid right so let's get back to the um the hangar i don't know if i can start customizing it now hey nice to meet you squad calls me frisk only grace calls me by my real name and only when she's mad i know it's not often you find a handsome fella like me fighting for the rebellion uh new republic or whatever we are now i used to be in what you might call acquisitions you know hunting down trophies antiques anything collectors wanted until i got that pesky death mark of course death mark what's that how was i supposed to know that painting was fake all right or that the imperial governor was gonna show it off to admiral thrawn oh no you don't mess with thrones not this place though they always got a birth for a good pilot death mark or not say you play support yeah i play i'm trying to learn but no one around here ever wants to play me maybe we could uh go a few rounds huh for credits of course it's the only way i'm gonna learn right guess we should get on and fix that calm blackout it doesn't appear to be a way that you can interact with them or like choose anything to say i think that would have been cool this guy's massive chance to get acquainted like i said the name's gunny stay sharp keep your nose clean and we'll be off to a good start we had calm blackouts like this right before the empire invaded mimbin lost a lot of friends but i learned to shoot a blaster you'll be flying with frisk and grace today meet him if you haven't the best advice i can give you is this stick with your squadron it's simple but sometimes hot shots and lone wolves need to hear it get to your ship all right you're ready to go just hop in the cockpit ah the x-wing backbone of the rebel alliance and our new republic a good all-rounder that'll stand up to any starfighter capital ship in the imperial fleet so i think i can only choose x-wing for the first mission you ready to go i mean there are four other ships per faction mcdroid now keep an eye on it got an r2 unit what's up quiet tin can we got a brief legend he was just saying hi you don't have to be so rude radar working like a dream loadout data looking good combat display check primary weapons charged up ready to take down ties throttle and boost good to go whole integrity in the casino you're welcome all systems go vanguard five you are clear for launch good luck out there okay let's go it is really nice cockpit detail isn't it okay we're out there again warm up on me i'm in formation away we go stay close vanguard five you remember your mission parameters vanguard squadron find the scouts smash the jamming ships and get back before the cantina closes i think commander james skipped that in the briefing thanks harder we'll be careful regroup at cabbage once you find our missing piles all right see you soon good luck you two bye our jump point's just ahead i kind of want to know what all these planets are called what is that it's big whatever it is hyperspace coordinates calculated engines are hot let's do this vanguard squadron [Music] this never gets old hey grace [Music] let's go no scout's showing on sensors you got anything grace negative we've got to be able to find someone out here wait i've got a republic signal temperance we may have found them [Applause] heavy interference gunny and kia will take care of that shortly we should investigate the signal and regroup with them is there a crash site or something i don't see anything oh no there is something here all right our scouts didn't make it empire must have found him first if that's the case where is the empire vanguard five scan the debris such brutality even that astromech got dusted now hey i'm picking up a second signal let's check it out me he's got a nice little bomber doesn't he i don't like this grace i hear you something's not right if we're lucky something survived the attack stay ready for anything wait that's not a new republic signal it's imperial oh [Music] here we go i think i actually got most of them and then i was lucky i want to waste the missile on this guy [Music] that's the last of the ties okay what is this you get a lot of shots gone must have been support for the empire's jamming ships if we scan the wreckage for its last known trajectory it could lead us to the jammers that's a heck of an idea they've got five scan the debris and we'll watch your back slow down [Music] i love how you can completely stop as well like this just floating space it's great nice work vanguard five let's see that path was leading them toward gunny and kia's coordinates oh if we're quick maybe we can cut off the empire before they find our friends marking coordinates you gotta get there first hopefully they don't know we're coming let's do this right for the scouts we lost lead the way bangkok five whatever comes next we face it together so it was an ambush look two imperial championships ahead no sign of gunny or keo that's the source of our comms blackout one two three four five six challenge six time fires sure thing grace i'll soften them up you two finish them off okay missile of asian you can evade a missile by making several sharp turns in different directions i bought power to engine to set your throttle a half speed to make it easier okay so we're on engines i don't see any missiles though got it i don't know if you could do that if you didn't have power in engines no that's a lot of damage i should take out the ties first maybe nearly got that one repairs on recharge went down to 30 health huh that's not good you heard the droid we get it then oh 14 hp another imperial jammer destroyed great work i love it let's finish the last of these ties i need my repair come on come on come on that was close sorry no friendly fires on can i actually damage my friendly units stupid empire try to invade our territory will ya look at my i'm all cracked up smoking ships this isn't good i need a proper repair at least the smoking stopped it's a bit banged up isn't it yeah i should see to that crack really when i get back to base that's not good when you're in space and the cracks fixed right oh you're right on time let's finish off their ties i haven't seen any pie interceptors yet time bombers come on [Music] that one had a really tight turning circle seems like a one-on-one you can beat them oh get it get it get him nice that's all the tie fighters little a-wing man you can request a supply droid that's good [Music] six follow me so i guess that's a full repair and resupply vanguard we have an imperial cruiser protecting the last of the jammers taking down these ships ain't going to be easy not while the cruiser has a missile launcher can we disable it what's our play if we take out the jammers first we can call the temperance for reinforcements that's why you're in charge cubby vanguard five focus on the jammers uh-huh here we go right so that is quite a big one enemies locked out of me countermeasures just before impact okay i've blown them too early there come on so my counter measures are on r i i do have it on my s4 mass five as well down as much damage as i can on these get through that shield as well get out there i'm gonna do like a long strafing run if i can put power to the lasers i'll pay you back for that let's go for this one got it like a weak spot that we can hit there he goes if you stand still like that underneath one of those you just get hammered come on that'll do it oh it's just playing half not bad vanguard such a strong squadron come on back to the temperance thank you i'm not sure i trust him you know i think it's the long con well done come on vanguard let's get out of here if they've already done the imperial traitor thing like three times so it'd be quite interesting if they do it where he's a double agent and then in the end he just screws you over great work team first round's on frisk welcome home vanguard no time for celebration i'm afraid we have a visitor and a mission i think you'll be interested a visitor okay get ready for a cameo guys i can feel it it's coming i can feel the cameo all right okay so we've got a couple of medals i miss the efficiency medal and the defense breaker whatever that means right so where is the visitor in here no way it's pinned in the upper atmosphere with no hyperdrive but too many fighters for talis group to handle alone this might work out for both of us meet a visitor we're gentiles rogue squadron yes you're the reason i was able to finally get a calm through love it i have a star destroyer problem that vanguard might be able to help me solve we need a star destroyer for project starhawk intact now we prove what vanguard's made of which you would the absolute mad lad give us a brief as you may have overheard talus group has cornered the imperial star destroyer victorium above the planet yevon they're in tough but it's presented a great opportunity for us to jump in and not only disable that star destroyer but to seize control so first we need to give ourselves some cover by knocking out the turrets naturally if we can also take out the targeting system that'll buy us even more time next we need to prepare the star destroyer for boarding you'll need to find a potential breach point in the victorium's hull preferably near the bridge once you find a good spot bombard it until the hull is breached however we can expect that the victorium still has plenty of tie fighters they will try to stop us once the skies are clear we can bring in the boarding team while our troops capture the bridge vanguard will defend the exterior from reinforcements once the boarding team has seized the bridge and is in control of the star destroyer we'll rendezvous with the temperance okay i think i accidentally made stealing a star destroyer sounds simple let's hope it is it's easy done that before do we have a chat with wedge sorry for the speedy introduction but talus group was counting on me to get reinforcements fast your commander says you have talent enough to steal a star destroyer and get away with it steal it normally i'd have rogue squadron for this but general century gave me a temporary assignment to protect general sender that's hera meanwhile rogue is handling well that's classified too general syndulla keeps us busy your commander and i have something in common i once flew for the empire too at sky strike academy turning to the rebellion was the smartest move i ever made i wish more of my friends have done the same look i appreciate the talk but uh talus group's waiting for us rightio i wonder if we're gonna see her at some point i do remember seeing her in a trailer says where'd you ship actually out here let's see i think so um can we customize this now so we're just inspecting it no i don't think we can customize it yet maybe that's on the main menu it's cool you can just take a look at it from every angle you can't move around here though it's kind of like a point-and-click adventure if you know what i mean the commander wants you on an x-wing for this mission got you outfitted with ion missiles they disable enemy fighters and they'll disable subsystems on enemy capital ships too right so they've given me some iron missiles now gonna get shields oh it's red this place always brings back memories let's hope for some of that skywalker luck today all right ready vanguard we're heading for the heart of the action vanguard follow his lead we're just going straight in there calling for immediate assistance captain antilles with that guard squadron here to help it's damn good to see you wedge we've taken heavy losses we need that star destroyer stopped don't you worry we're here to hijack it you're what be ready interceptors so they do want to steal it agreed they're fast they'll rip right through our fighters vanguard prioritize targets okay right let's get the interceptors on weapons deal minimal hole damage but are ideal for squad tactics use them to disable enemy starfighters stripping enemy shields and disabling sisters okay that's what i thought ion missile knocked anyway systems dead we'll finish them up let's catch up one got one on my tail hey thanks that's it push the imperials back you got it counted that missile that was cool i felt like i got swarm with prior disabled stay sharp enemies locked on got him up the interceptors get him now he's done try and dodge it now that one hit me i think [Music] get it gotta get it hit it yes that's almost all of them and don't stop now you're safe oh thanks i knew i liked you that's it good job good job vancouver okay regroup on chalice leader it looks like it's been damaged already at the front we need to make a few repairs then get ourselves out of here roger that's alice leader now don't worry about the imperials we'll keep them busy you're really gonna steal that star destroyer that's the plan okay vanguard on me let's head for the victorium let's do it focus your shields before they open fire on us yeah put it to the front targeting system is there star destroyer the targeting can get in safely don't stay in the clouds too check out the turrets as well that's cool this is our chance to capture that star destroyer if we take the bridge we'll have access to its internal systems i'm just gonna shoot all the turrets reaching a star destroyer just like the oldies no forget it i think i'm gonna scan the damage here nearly got me killed [Music] i suppose i could just sit in it i'm here ah i wasn't worried your character does have a voice but you only really hear it when you're actually flying around that's on the other side i think there's one at the back here enemy is down they're shooting at me here we can set the team i get a resupply okay i'm only on 40 hp here so i've got to be careful i'm trying to check out some of these sides as well i got you it's chaos let's get a good run up on it [Music] enemies these imperials just keep coming you're fine don't worry all right okay so frisk is being chased i imagine this is some kind of time thing let's get over there one more that was an optional objective i assume there's some kind of metal for that there's none over by the star destroyer i think they're all back here that's how it's done that's it i've got them all that's it all fighters destroyed cool great work you wings are on the way we can bring the boring team in safely they're still firing us follow me to the running we'll give them vanguard let's go i will try and take out as many turrets as i can i've got three there are you doing wedge where are we going there's a weird green planet there check that out morning team we have you on our sites ready to take on a star destroyer copy captain antilles just get us there and we'll do the rest you heard him god guide those few wings into position stay sharp what about the star destroyers crew if a boarding party takes the bridge we've got an imperial carrier they're launching reinforcements they're not giving up their victory without a fight take down that cruiser [Music] just came out of nowhere advanced targeting by default your targeting system will only cycle through objectives but you can change that with targeting wheel for example you can say you're targeting the flagship systems to focus on the subsystems of a deadly star destroyer or all enemies to target enemies that are not mission critical such as the tie fighters up ahead right hold five to open up the targeting wheel and select all enemies oh that's cool so you can prioritize this would be really good for multiplayer as well we'll stay okay back there buddy that's what i'm so let's come on missiles no no didn't have a lock good job okay regroup at my position let's go see where'd you go so you're not there wait we need you in the fight buddy me vanguard let's regroup at the victoria the boarding team might need support we're almost through those glass doors something's gonna go wrong you can guarantee it we've got another imperial carrier make that three carriers three oh my god that's a lot get ready everyone we're in taking control now that star destroyer has taken down its own carrier what a sight why yes the ship is ours oh they got it we just stole a star destroyer you can take it from here i'll escort talus group to safe harbor great work cool general sedula will be impressed can we see general syndulla please i want to actually see hera we missed two medals again that time oh you gotta save yourself gunny now the empire is gonna want that star destroyer back good let's see him try and take it you know back home after the empire invaded membin we stole an armored transport hauler full of scout walkers when the empire came looking for them we just turned the walkers against them had a real good time i'm guessing the commander has something similar in mind for this star destroyer hmm right otherwise what's the point at least wedge picked the right team for the job huh those slackers and alphabet squadrons still be fapping around alphabet squadron's a terrible name enough yapping time to check with the commander and see what's next is hara here oh i can speak to the gondroid gank droid doesn't say much of course i don't know what i was expecting i'll answer your questions once the star destroyer has been delivered safely delivered where we risked our tails to get that star destroyer and you can't even tell us where we're going it's not my call besides i'd be risking a lot of lies if i shared too much too soon you hearing this after all we did for project starhawk listen all i can tell you is the basics our soldiers on the star destroyer victoria now damn colin vanguard for immediate briefing it was just getting good what's the problem we have an emergency the star destroyer you captured is unexpectedly fallen out of a hyperspace behind enemy lines our troops are repairing the hyperdrive as quickly as possible but you need to buy them some time there's an imperial fleet advancing toward the star destroyer victorium i want a wings intercepting enemy fighters the rest of vanguard will provide defense and support i know imperial protocol better than most i have no doubt the empire will disable the victorium with ion weapons before sending shuttles to recapture it stop them at all costs the empire must not reclaim the victorium once the star destroyer's hyperdrive is operational cover its escape so it can jump to safety i'll send you rendezvous coordinates when the time is right the thing is right they've got they've got so many star destroyers why do they care so much if we've got one okay right so we're gonna be in an a-wing for this mission i guess have a look at the cockpit that's nice there's an interceptor a wings go as fast as you can fly them their hauling shields are too light to take on capital ships but imperial starfighters won't stand a chance with you in this cockpit edit the loadout okay we have a few options to make your tie hunting more efficient big fan of the rapid fire lasers on barrage rockets myself rapid fire cannon well that's already equipped you know how to pick them i kind of feel like i should have a repair though quick lock missile or the counter measures i don't want to really change that because that means that i'll lose health all right we'll go with that [Music] oh man what happened here what who cares our star destroyer is in trouble vanguard good to see you again think you can keep those bombers off us we're on it victoria sit tight five intercept those time bombers we need to buy our crew sometime all right here we go brisk and i will handle the rest of the starfighters aren't they victorious these bombers are coming in fast you might want to activate turbo lasers don't stand a chance don't let them hit you with ion weapons oh they sound great how rapid oh my god there they are that's cool you only get a limited amount of those uh they travel a bit slower i think i nearly got hit there that would not have been good to restart our systems look at the detail on this star destroyer look at this what the hell imperial shuttles headed your way hold them off if even one imperial shuttle reaches us we'll be overwhelmed that's one of the shield generators though i think vanguard intercept those shuttles all right anyway back on the mission split up to take them down target attack so i'll get an enemy and tap h to order an attack right so i can actually tell them what to attack now so we'll go with this one on your wing too far away get it closer nice oh toast that's neat because you can actually command the ai a little bit there i'm big fan of that [Music] so you guys attack this one yeah you have to lead with that right click a little bit i've only got 14 left through this space junk here oh too fast way too fast i couldn't slow down quick enough right here and ready to go got him another shuttle group they have ties in tow i like the a-wing it's super cool [Music] hey one shuttle is all they need one more to go let's get some fire on that a little too far away imperial transports are done for that's the last of those plastic shuttles nice just in time systems are up time to fix the hyperdrive they're coming out nowhere don't let any tie fighters near him okay all right y-wings are here vanguard if we lose our bombers we're done for take out those ties defend you can order your squad to defend your allies sir i'm freaking off to intercept them okay so they should be about their defending you're popular today so messy thank you i can tell them to get the ships that are attacking me as well so if i'm being chased i can just say hey i need help oh don't worry vanguard has you squadron take covered the rest of these ties i'm on it just a little longer [Music] attack him we got a lock done that's the last of them your timing couldn't be better we're almost done our bombers are out of here thanks for the backup we're doing our final test vanguard spread out and keep watch spicy this moves back there keo you gotta teach the rest of the squadron that drift you want to learn right now i'll watch five figure it out you'll learn how to drift okay follow me all right this is cool learn how to drift i learned this racing in the koshi star circuit first transfer all power to your engines and fly as fast as you can yes now we're going to buzz the bridge of the victoria oh god i don't like this when you're ready turn as hard as you can then cut your engines to drift turn hard as you press shift to drift okay you got it [Laughter] what bridge someone the empire is never gonna catch again sorry team it's for the greater good of the new republic that'll be brilliant in multiplayer do a quick 180 drives operational vanguard what do you say we get out of here that's so banged up ruined i'm with you i'm gonna drift everywhere now all right victoria we're in position where we headed somewhere classified just send you the coordinates got them punching them in now jumping to hyperspace in three two it's gonna break it yeah i know what the hyperdrive failed again no and a load of enemies just appeared on your wing pal oh man well we gotta get there now i don't know what happened everything was fine and then our system is just shut down sounds like your marvin nullifier is blocked run a system flush then restart it should be fine can you hold them off a little longer didn't come this far just to leave you hanging protect the victoria more imperial ships careful of the bombers yeah they're just gonna get rid of it this is taking too long i think those rockets have a longer range on them it feels like way too fast guess we'll keep you initiating system flush how long should this take longer than i'd like i think the bomber was right above me then and just dropped a iron missile on me can you hold them a little longer just delete me there you hang it it's now or never vanguard protect the victorium gotta use those commands a bit more this is taking too long don't tell me this is too much for you frisbee's getting tired breaking through maybe i need to be a bit quicker [Music] i'm sure my own i'm trying my best how long should this take taking damage here there's too many fighters the optional objective here is to destroy the raiders i don't know how you would do that and protect the ship at the same time feels like that's quite difficult attack that how much longer now it isn't fair for the empire you think you could just fly into them and do damage well some of them tried to do that with me earlier can you get them almost there running a diagnostic on the alluvial damper time bomber okay ingredients just do it i think what i could do is set my targeting so it only goes after the thai bombers that would probably be a really effective way of doing this quickly you've got a lot of things about sorry you've got a lot to think about when you're playing this paul is taking damage yes it works we're ready to go okay get out of there let's get out of there no no no three star destroyers just turned up let's get the hell out of here [Applause] they don't want us to hold on to this do they i wonder if it's like a special star destroyer or something something unique about it i don't know [Music] this is where the boss keeps his secret project who'd want to get this close to the ringali nebula i believe that is the idea [Applause] now that is a battleship i don't recognize that that's why we've been gathering imperial ships to build this something new hello vanguard welcome to the nadiri dockyards i'd give you the tour but the empire knows we're up to something now they'll be looking for us which means we have work to do cool i only got one medal that time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] an old enemy has finally surfaced one of my spies has linked the attacks on our star destroyers with the new republic starhawk project a common factor is lyndon james you knew james better than anyone captain carol if i had i'd have destroyed him before he betrayed us at foster haven then this is your second chance the rebels are keeping a low profile take titan squadron hunt down this starhawk and eliminate it gladly admiral sloan but if i may ask there's a particular pilot i'd like to requisition [Applause] me [Applause] ships good more than merrier remember the last time you lost your call the day i cut through a whole squadron of rebels has saved your name [Applause] [Music] [Applause] your new wingmate has arrived [Applause] on the imperial side now in the hangar so you're our new wingmate welcome to titan squadron i'm varco gray squadron leader i think they're waiting for you in the briefing room i don't make a good first impression i will don't worry welcome home pilot it feels like a lifetime since foster haven doesn't it one fool betrays his squadron and loyal officers like us are reassigned in disgrace i heard they sent you to the outer rim i got the medams sector protecting fuel shipments from petty scoundrels and pirates the kind of posting that used to end careers before endor before lyndon james reappeared no doubt you've heard admiral sloane has instructed me to hunt that traitor down and end this project star hawk it seemed fitting that i bring you back to help me destroy lyndon your empire needs you pilot are you willing yes ma'am good for now you will be flying as titan 3. let's get to work do it do it cool right thank you for watching guys i have to leave it there i've got a couple more things i need to do this afternoon but i hope you guys enjoyed watching this that's a first look at the star wars squadrons single player on pc i did see a few questions in the chat like some people were asking uh what kind of frame rate i was getting so i'm running it all on ultra you should be able to see that geforce overlay typically it's about that when you're out in space 180 to 200 fps it's a well optimized game it runs very well considering i'm playing this in 4k as well i think it's uh it's very well optimized but with that said do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys how you feeling about this if you enjoyed it leave a like if you didn't like it a dislike subscribe if you want to see more and i'll see you in the next one bye-bye we should begin the briefing now we should end the briefing
