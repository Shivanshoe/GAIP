hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to more bf4 live gameplay commentary today we are playing on the gorgeous paracel storm that was a bit hectic those guys just rushed me there cuz I was starting off I just want to say a big thanks to anyone that watched the bf4 video last weekend I did promise that I'll be doing more and it was just such a great positive sentiment on that video in the comments the number of views their likes everyone saying you know it's cool it's cool that you're doing more beer for that just really motivates me to want to do more and do better and create more of this content be fine ladies and gents so thank you very much for that now today I wanted to run with the m16a4 because I thought I would continue the trend of using guns I didn't really use when I played bf4 actively the last weekend was the mp7 and today is the m16a4 and this I think is the first variant you can fire it in first or single fire and if I remember correctly can I get a ride nope oh sick drift bro I thought he'd beat you then if I remember correctly there isn't a full auto version of the m16 in this game it's just this on the burst and a single fire one you gotta watch out without and I do wonder you know what's the reason they did that was it because of all the means from the full author m16 in bf3 how everyone how like overpowered it wasn't everyone used it it just became this thing where it was like oh you're using the m16a3 you're a scrub it's just easy mode but to be fair though if you use the m16a3 in bf3 with the heavy barrel and the I think it was the first call for grip it was just a laser beam it was an absolute laser it was fun to use though let me tell you now I did oh hello there's a guy back here I did want to try and push that's someone at the top maybe I did want to try and push over to the other Island there we go cheeky little kill there thank you very much I saw someone here on the mini-map say where have they gone they've gone on the beach maybe no or where they killed they've disappeared into thin air oh I can hear the new cab that's a friendly Yuka thank God for that oh don't want enemy you calves hey as I was saying I was gonna try and push to the other islands but I keep getting interrupted by attack boats and infantry and one of the things I wanted to talk about today was battlefield six or whatever the next game is because this week there's actually been a few snippets of real information about what's next no details on what the game is or how it will play what time area will be set in but we got an actual release date so before this week it was just fiscal year 2022 which meant that it could have appeared towards the end of 2021 or the start of 2022 but there was an interview we've I think it was GameSpot or IGN and one of the coyote a people I think it was one of the finance officers or something confirm that it will release in 2021 so that probably means like October November 2021 providing there on any delays I suppose or providing they don't change their plans which you never know they may do it was another guy there look at that son that dude still in there and a word they're just gonna jump out now they are still in there beep thrown on the floor with a suppressor there so so that's cool I mean I was kind of I was a bit worried you know that maybe it maybe it would have been like end of 2022 because of everything that's happened with carbon 19 and the delays people working from home but at least we've got a confirmed date of 2021 now which is you know maybe a bit sooner than I was expecting but still feels really far away and that's a lot of time to wait isn't it for the next Butterfield game but I'm kind of glad in a way because I you know want the developers to have more time that's that's how I feel I think if I had more time to refine things and bug tests and just really pad out the design then ultimately we'll end up with a better product that's my hope at least but the other bit of information was about you know how the game will blow people's minds I think that's a can I please write never like so someone else from EA said that it's like driven by next-gen innovations and it will blow people's minds and it's crazy and what can we take from that obviously there's a lot of hype wrapped up in that statement or not that wasn't pervasive that's just the gist of it but they were going on about how the next-gen consoles are so powerful and because of that the next VF game Wow will use a lot of that technology to innovate I guess and with the game coming out at the end of 2021 again assuming the new consoles would have been out for a year which means the user base on them would be a bit bigger and also the developers would have had more time with that hardware to get the most out of it optimized and all that good stuff that just a dead guy on see if I can snipe the student vehicle here I wanted to hit the guy on the gun but yeah the next-gen consoles I mean they're pretty Opie like the specs of them they're pretty insane come on there we go only took me like five shots before I killed that dude yeah the specs of those consoles are ridiculous really trying to hit the pilot with my m16 that would have been a good opportunity there but I missed it oh the Xbox series X for example like I know that's like four times more powerful they say than the Xbox one X that's a lot of horsepower it really is and when you take a look at everything inside it it is essentially just a basically full also that if you just click it fast it's essentially a modern high-end gaming PC you know you've got like an nvme SSD in there you've got a 12 is it twelve teraflop GPU which i think is about equivalent to a twenty eighty at the moment pretty strong oh my god when he shuts did I miss bed I don't know how much RAM is in there as well as a la route so the new consoles are really powerful you think something like bf5 and bf1 obviously they had to run on modern generation consoles like the Xbox one and the ps4 and the hardware in those quite old now perhaps that limited the scope of those games in some ways you know I think the the SSD is actually quite a big deal too big feature because it means that you'll have faster loading times what is going on here I'm suppressed heavily how did I get away with that who's shooting at me what is that other boat no it's a warthog yeah you'll have much quicker loading times and assets will be able to be loaded in quicker too obvious that means you can have bigger levels and for Battlefield you know that's that's quite a big deal isn't it imagine if you could have a level of the size of firestorm that's pretty big but have like conquest flags all over it and I don't know like 150 players or something now maybe that's the kind of innovation that they're talking about in those interviews Snippets yeah be cool I do wonder like what's what's next for Battlefield like how is it how is it going to evolve and change with the times in terms of the basic gameplay of it is it just more is it just bigger is it scale more players more vehicles bigger Maps better destruction you know is that the future for the franchise because many of the games are doing you know what battlefield was always good at but they're doing it better now so it can be really interesting to see how everything goes down with the new game yeah I'm cautiously optimistic and I mean the other announcement I suppose this week that I haven't covered was that they actually wrapped up production on Star Wars Battlefront as well that means that they're kind of fully don't think I can get that guy they're fully focusing on the next Battlefield game like the entire studio is probably working on battlefield 6 it's full power full steam ahead on that game I'm on my own here I think there's like so many other people around there's always people in that building and that was really confusing and almost got me killed I'm gonna get jumped I was about to say like there we go I'm dead well that was a bit of a killstreak wasn't it hope I wasn't ranting too much then but yeah dice is a pretty big studio comparatively speaking to most of the studios I would say so they could be working on multiple projects yo new IP are they doing good a new Star Wars game something different for Star Wars are they working on more Mirror's Edge I'm not sure how successful the last Mirror's Edge was but no a lot of people like that franchise it's good it's not bad you know plenty of people around here though that could kill me yeah I'm got to be very careful here I'm gonna dip a little bit plenty of enemies around and cuz I'm firing loud as well I'm all over the mini-map right now let me do a big wide flank on this point oh yeah what do you guys think like what what do you want to see Battlefield do differently or do next let's dude here always forget that I can spunk you in this game and spot people do you think it's something like warzone is doing where let's say you did have a massive map like a giant map sighs the firestorm 200 players its PvP but there are also contracts around as well like missions that you can accomplish is that what battlefield needs what do you think it needs do you think it just needs a full multiplayer feature set at launch where everything works like custom servers and all that good stuff thought you were still alive are dead I'm sure the developers are having a fun time at the moment brainstorming and coming up with ideas maybe they already have any the headshot Wow okay maybe I should have switched to single fire then get across there right yeah different guy still a support player here somewhere it's nice man you just kind of pull down on the mouse a bit as you're shooting and you can get nice little bursts with this it's good fun oh my god the FPS just really went weird then it's like the server's broken or something did my game just close I think my game just closed something happened the server broke I don't know I was about to talk about my first time playing paracel storm well I want to see what happens here you have lost connection to the server that's please I think that's that's the only appropriate thing to say right now well that's a shame the server just died but there we go never mind anyways I hope you guys enjoyed that let me know your thoughts on some of the topics we talked about down in the comments below and if you enjoyed the video leave a like as always thank you so much if
