and welcome to call of duty black ops cold war the game is out now in certain regions i've been given a code that lets me play the game now and today we are playing on playstation 5 4k 60 fps and i'm really looking forward to jumping into the game now that it's finally out we've got some extra guns we've got a couple of extra maps zombies as well and campaign the next two hours though we're just going to be playing multiplayer focusing on that also i do have 10 ps4 ps5 cross generation codes to give away and we'll be dropping them periodically in the chat but i want to thank you all for coming here tonight it's great to see everyone in the chat thank you i really appreciate your support so what i wanted to do was create a class although i don't have them all yet i played a little bit earlier just to make sure everything was working okay and there were a couple new guns like i said we've got the qbz and the ffar that's basically the famous right the famous i've not unlocked it yet though level 40 well we're not going to get that tonight that was 31. are there any new smgs yes there are we got the bullfrog that's the bison and the ksp 45 i'm guessing that's the ump i've got the org and the dmr14 m60 there's the pig any new snipers oh look at that that's the big lad right there the m82 nice i mean i haven't unlocked any attachments or anything so i guess we should just load into a lobby see if we can get some kills here get some frags so i'm gonna try and get the new levels because we played a lot of the levels already in the alpha and the beta i'm just i'm ticking the gamers that i didn't really enjoy in the beta that's fine let's see let's get us in the game here let's do this what's up british boy hello sniper hello anis what's up mark thank you for becoming a member check settings oh checkmate that's a new one come on everyone vote for that people are already level 17 what's that about do you check yes i checked all the time mate that looks like a an office or an airplane or something that's a dummy i've not tried zombies yet stone break i have played through the campaign and i'll be uploading a vod walkthrough of that yeah the music's pretty cool isn't it what's up simon hey lee i saw you in the chat earlier lee oh my god the chat is popping off crazy waiting for more players so i think some regions got the ps5 today but i reckon a lot of people playing this right now will be on ps4 xbox one i don't think the pc servers are live yet i reckon that's tomorrow or later tonight i couldn't get on earlier anyway uh bradley thank you for becoming a member checkmate yeah and if you can if you've got a connection that can support it watching 4k 60 you'll get the absolute best quality oh wow check this out so this is set in berlin cool right where we go so this is hva you represent the people aircraft hangar i think i don't know what it's supposed to be though like a training camp or something i don't know it's cool it definitely looks a lot sharper than it did on ps4 pro and here's someone above me there someone's trying to get a flank off you push up this way kind of reminds me of a paintball field right like it feels like that kind of thing it's weird we are pulling ahead they're all airplanes i wonder if it's like somewhere that they and test airplanes or is it a training facility for the sas or something like that there's our first kill the email operator is down yeah those times are falling behind oh that's a frag watch out here's the picture what is this strange they are taking control the spawns haven't flipped yet this would be a great map for us that dude go past me i don't know if you're losing the advantage it's sledder words obviously santa's got a sled right or a sleigh yeah this is a sniper map 100 let's have that proximity like this narrator is firing it's like i've got a bow i think that guy had a combat bow or something what was that is that a kill streak i need to get that yeah that's the one slew yeah it is a bit sharper than modern warfare definitely on the ps4 pro what's that guy there that's just the dude thrown on the wings grenade out not sure where that grenade went to be honest still got the tactical reloads like in modern warfare could really do with a weapon site a bank some people have already got their christmas decorations up yeah i mean for a lot of people christmas begins after halloween right just as soon as halloween target eliminated target eliminated okay cool definitely feels like a consistent 60 fps as well them i felt like on ps4 pro it was dropping the frame rate at times but this feels like a solid 62. it's nice christmas definitely starts november the 1st i suppose it just depends on what you and your family are used to it [Music] can you change the field of view yeah you can what do i have it up 85 i can put it to 90. i usually use 19 most pc games so we'll go with that uh brian is the ttk longer in this yeah it is longer than attack helicopter that's what you mean enemy destroyed right i have to put i don't know if the this is going to come through there i hope so care package please come through come on come on come on yes what is it a spy plane that's so underwhelming why is it what why did it blow up tagged him there's a trap or something there's an attack helicopter there i don't like that that's a kill that's a kill yeah don't lie down chop a gun enemy spy plane contacts there's two people in the plane here try and get a flank let's go they've run out fragged i was trying to get behind him sultan i like bananas too i had a banana earlier today i think a lot of people can get on board with bananas you know hva's opposition it blended really well there enemy deleted enemy deleted i say that sometimes the game is too loud i can turn the game down a bit that's fine nice grenade uh fifth yeah i did play the campaign requesting spy plane above i thought i got the wall back then but i just got the assist dude you see that guy sniping up there [Music] i always run out of ammo i need to get scavenger perk enemy care package above no no no no no stun grenade outside i didn't really do anything that good is that it was a nice little triple kill a domino how am i playing the game already i was given a code to play it if you're in certain countries as well you can get it now or if you fly vpn airways and you go to new zealand get it for you oh we do 2110 i'll take it right so we've played those maps you can just play versus bots here if you want that's kind of interesting did i get i want to see where that bow is i did get the bow combat bow yeah let's do it okay i get a sight yeah that's better zelos is the game freeze to play no it's fully priced game is it slide or dolphin dive croon slide a jd no it's not 120 fps mode hey danny you'd only be able to see 60 anyway because youtube doesn't allow 120 fps streaming what else did i get i got a muzzle break i want a bigger mag for it bradley thanks for the five cross play i guess yeah cross plays turned on um where's game game cross crossplay enabled there you go any fancy stuff for the dual sense yes marvin so if you guys have been following the playstation 5 coverage you'll know that the new playstation controller has got some really interesting haptics and vibrations in it and i was playing i'm playing with mouse and keyboard at the moment i just plugged my mouse and keyboard into my playstation 5. but earlier i was playing using the new controller and every gun has a different feel on the trigger and on the vibrations it's kind of cool like lmgs they're much heavier and they vibrate more in the middle of the controller but an mp5 only really vibrates around the trigger but you also get vibrations when there are helicopters above you explosions like it's kind of cool obviously i don't have uh vibration in my mouse and keyboard but when i was using the controller earlier it was it was interesting you know they're doing some cool things they didn't change the pressure of the triggers so the pressure for the triggers for every gun was the same but i think some games will do that what's the store looking like that's it there's nothing in there i reckon they're gonna add stuff maybe in december uh joseph thank you for the 10 how's the campaign it's all right i mean it was quite short i completed it in about three hours and 15 minutes is a quite short campaign and there's some choices that you can make that affect the ending i think that overall i enjoyed the modern warfare campaign more but the campaign for this is fine there's some interesting action moments and there's a really cool level where you go to the kgb headquarters and you're undercover and it's kind of like a hitman level where you can choose how to do your objectives that's the best level in the game by far but i won't spoil it for you but like i said earlier i will be doing a walkthrough of it i can't show the fps if we're playing on ps5 house thank you for the 20. i'm trying to get this other new map is there input lag with keyboard and mouse on ps5 there's a little bit of input lag yeah it's vsyncs on and you can feel a little bit of that but it's not i mean it's perfectly playable it just doesn't feel like you're playing on pc where you get that one-to-one native feel uh vladik you can't do 4k 120fps on the ps5 yet that's coming soon i think i guess we're playing satellite because i don't want to just keep lobby surfing until i get the other new map because we might be forever i don't want to keep you guys waiting so i think these guys are playing on pc it looks like it i didn't realize the game was on pc uh ryan thank you for the two you're the reason that i got back into cod since modern warfare three damn that's crazy sniping on this map is really good isn't it stephen you have the ps5 in your cart twice and it disappeared oh that's a shame yeah i've heard that they're really hard to get hold of take the objectives might turn my sensitivity down a little bit taking charlie nice oh yeah also with the controller when you reload stuff like this you can feel that vibration it's cool appears k.i.a somebody just shot at me then didn't they it's four in a row target eliminated here's the combat bow so you get five shots it's a fire arrow okay i wonder if it's a one-hit kill incoming didn't manage to get anyone that time do i consider sniping to be op sniping is really strong in this game definitely i think if they do like esports stuff for this game the snipers will be super happy hey yeah we just got his head there that was funny it does sound awesome doesn't it kong ethan at the moment yeah on playstation it's capture 60 but i believe they are adding 120 fps support i don't see any reason why this couldn't do 120 i was playing on the xbox series x early at 1 20. really nice try and snipe some people off be maybe help my team push onto i don't see anyone dudes walking around with a bow chair pack is ready oh they just stole it no that's my care package bro it's not moving who's not moving what does that mean i don't know enemy spy plane inbound thread down multiple enemies by playing contacts multiple hostile spy planes detected dammit down a doctor thank you for becoming a member that's very kind this is playstation 5 gameplay enemy care package above we're playing at 4k 60. plug my mouse and keyboard in i almost died i'm gonna play let's play the half [Music] switching sites how does it feel it feels good golden yeah feels good i mean if i was playing with the control i'd be awful like an 80s action movie kind of jake hey freddie we got two new members as well mitchell don't see anyone pretty bad didn't we probably because i'm just out here sniping everyone rather than playing the objective i'm going to turn my sense down a little bit our sensitivity let's go that's the wrong user interface i think that's the playstation interface to just pop up there can i just put i can just type something in there can't i yeah that's cool let's go 8.5 losing alpha oh my god the dude's running around with a bow like an absolute mad lad put that bow down it is a one one-shot kill that's kind of crazy where'd you go i'm taking alpha right okay i've got my bow yeah there we go there's my first bow kill oh was that double yeah that was a double kill oh your videos keep me going in these crazy times been watching for years and we'll continue for years to come thank you trippy ultra thanks for the five been watching since you were 14 now you're 21. that's crazy thank you for becoming a member very kindly [Music] sam yeah the the sniper rifle sound sound awesome i think i've got a is that an attack helicopter or something requesting attack choppers oh here we go well i've not had this before okay get some nice so loud oh my god ruin us we've got carol baskin down there i can't turn around there we go attack helicopter protect me carol basket no the trouble got shot down that was awesome that was actually sick i love that that was a good care package together no second chances oh no i run out bullets um that was quite a battlefield moment there wasn't it right back quick too slow far too slow is the volume okay now guys i did turn the game down a little bit there's no way to turn this around fall back when does the playstation 6 come out i'm gonna say november 2028 [Music] right we're going to drop two ps4 ps5 cross gen codes in the chat right now unlocked russell adler volume's good okay sweet yeah we did a lot better that game oh garrison music is rocking i love it i don't really like search and destroy chief on this still haven't got a mag i'm not playing on pc i've got a mouse and keyboard plugged into my playstation 5. you want me to show you the the ui playstation user interface right there do you believe me now hey benjamin thank you uh look what's in the store it's just it's just the cold war stuff at the moment there's no mtx in it yet people said there wouldn't be any new maps well this one's a new map take the objectives hardpoint located clearly pc hardpoint is secure we are pulling ahead okay so this is a tank factory or something right you go outside and inside bam neutralized there's gonna be someone waiting for me here isn't it this is a very clock like classic cod map that's cool in terms of the layout bro ready target eliminated right he wants some john rambo falling for g and if you can't aim like me appears kia good luck using it i like these tanks though these tanks are cool they're abrams aren't they it reminds me of gi joe or transformers that style of tank hold this up head glitch here we have lots of hard points damn it the input lag's not too bad knocks it's noticeable but you can get used to it it's fine wasted almost got killed then it feels a bit more polished than the the beta definitely attacked him i can say that you can go under here look at this this is sneaky ultimate camper spot there i don't like that hindsight it's not does that have an fov slider yeah it does i'm playing 90 fov at the moment know how you can mount in modern warfare and war zone i wish i could do that in this game [Music] it's the spot here this is the one that's killed i wanted to put it through there i'd love to be able to mount here just popped up from out the ground proximity mine in here bottom of the ladder it's going to ruin people hard point i shouldn't really be in the middle bad spot so many head glitches on this one package above hostiles have captured the hard points enemies spy plane inbound i get behind them strike some cool sound effects i don't know what the hell that sound is it sounds like a dinosaur dying or something not sure about that dude just got deleted not that i've ever heard what a dinosaur dying sounds like that right bro give it to me now what is it cruise missile first time i use this i guess there are people in here i didn't hit anyone okay going sounds like an a10 yeah it kinda did on the right side i didn't clear it it's in hanover not berlin right it definitely said germany though didn't it we have lost the hardpoint hostile spy plane established overhead locked down we have lost the hardpoint setting proximity mine i think i'm on the map yeah dude knew exactly where i was locked down thank you simon reilly is that simon reilly as in ghost from call of duty is he watching my stream right now that's awesome he's trying to get that kill and then dodge the grenade hostiles have captured the hard points they've all spawned over here how many codes we've given away two codes so far eight more you're gonna pick me locked down go right here oh i just walked into it didn't it damn it how was that was that a pigeon why are there pigeons no is it three levels of prestige i know some people were talking about that because it's quite important to people prestige god stay here come on that's gonna kill me isn't it if someone triggers that i'm dead whoa that's stunned so hard then hey john thank you for the 50. i'm over here okay get the pigeon i don't know if we can get the pigeon michael i don't like that attack helicopter there keep doing what you are doing we have this contest ruined by the kill streak that sucks you should get a uh stinger or something that's gone these guys i'm gonna get an attack helicopter on my own i think hostiles have captured the hard points grenades are no joke in this game you're so posh all right enemy care package my care package down setting proximity mine to mine let's see what we get that's the hard point i don't know if you could get a chopper gunner on this map would it be effective probably not was that napalm strike detected all right have we got time for this oh yeah double kill let's go it's like an old pc alias isn't it axle playing the objective oh you can play the objective in card we got the victory we are in control how's the sick game uh bay thank you for becoming a member it's very kind to you the care packages are going to kill someone j dog yeah i think so if the care package lands on your head you're probably gonna be dead rascal thank you for the two all right should we leave that lobby do a bit of customization here what's this bonus is that some kind of code thing like a pre-order bonus stefan which console do i prefer now both both the new consoles are great it's just your preference they're both very good i can't fault them if you want more launch titles the playstation 5 at the moment has has more to offer you i think mars morales demon souls astros playroom is really good it's not it is a tech demo but it's actually a game as well uh sackboy is quite fun just depends on where your friends are i would say you know if you play a lot of multiplayer games and you can only play them on xbox and they're not cross-platform no it's all up to you i don't really understand the console war you know a lot of people are like oh playstation's better xbox is better ultimately we're all people who play video games right so whatever your preference is just go with it maybe you like the ui better of the xbox maybe you like the games better on the playstation cross platforms getting really popular now as well right so platform loyalty it isn't really going to matter as much apart from for the exclusives uh what should we do now so is that is that only two new maps let's have a look moscow cartel miami satellite so those four were all in the alpha and the beta we played checkmate we just played garrison armada's the one on the c and crossroads is the one in the snow so one two three four five six so there's only eight multiplayer maps although i suppose you do have dirty bomb as well that's got two maps i think they're bringing nuketown in december as well right there's some kind of big change coming to warzone i don't know what it is though you combined arms really good for sniping we're gonna drop two cross gen ps4 ps5 codes in the chat right now we might try zombies towards the end zero yeah lots of people have been playing zombies i feel like there could have been a couple more main maps though maybe 10 rather than eight that'd be good bit more content uh crossroads has got the tanks on it go with that yeah we'll try zombies in a bit are your characters clothing customizable as far as i know no personalized so they've got different outfits like they have in modern warfare and war zone i think i think that's all that is i don't think you can like take his hat off or anything you've got gold camo already steven you kidding you've just been hardcore in this have you raphael in mp does everyone have the same character model can you have two teams of people choosing woods i think so raphael yeah where's that massive sniper stealth thoughts i think i've unlocked it yet i'll go with that one again no actually this isn't a great sniper map is it try the ak in the shotgun hey jesus what's up what's up kari thank you for coming hey aculite domination is that the real acolyte i don't know take the objectives ashamed there's not uh i mean this whoever's doing that has got cool first kill with the ak actually get this point here there's someone here come on you know you want to push did not want to die this spot's really good if you can get it oh no are you gonna die oh that was a good shot we've lost the bow we only got one shot kind of like the ak with the iron sights though it's cool feels like a strong assault rifle oh there's a guy with a shotgun in the corner i live in england getting yeah i do maybe i should use the shotgun let's start out i need to get up close though don't you 69 dude find this night hey we got him sick try the shotgun dude you got arrest securing foxtrot oh they've got a spy plane above i'm screwed we lost charlie and not what hit one hit kill from that distance do go in with the combat bow that bike over there kind of weird how you can see the bikes through the walls you just get a wall hack with them strange behind this or in there grenade any noticeable tweaks to sbmm i can't tell i mean sbmm won't properly kick in i think for a few more games because if you think about it like it's brand new people have only just started playing but i don't know how fast it works i did just play one game and then i don't know there's a lot of question marks i don't think the developers want to tell you how skill-based matchmaking works you're saying you could exploit it losing charlie throwing frankie it's annoying i want to get some more shotgun kills keep trying to get in this bit here there we go brilliant got me with the name can't go in that bit there are jewelry in the enemy artillery i wonder if you can get a upgraded magazine for this with higher caliber bullets i feel like it should pack more of a punch at range but it doesn't securing literally missed that guy right care package chopper gunner on this map would be amazing so good he's ray tracing guy um i don't know i don't think you can see that in the options or anything did that not work that marker there we go you have to hold it down a bit we lost charlie enemies by playing inbound i didn't see any options not sure you can re-roll that all right sentry gun put it there i like that sound that's cool [Music] for me yeah what's up max thank you abby hype for zombies cool yeah we'll play zombies i've not really played zombies in a black ops game for a while but this one looks good oh i thought i was going to get the triple care package they said that this has ray tracing on ps5 was that part of the marketing or anything i don't know i know it's got rtx features on pc but i don't know if it's got ray facing our console drag out do i play search and destroy not really ricky i was given a code that would lock the game early uh lots of people are playing by using uh vpns though just the game is out in certain regions i reckon you can build such a sick build for the ak make it really strong it's just a random grenade isn't it fair play i don't like that grenade sound the xbox series x has a ray tracing back around 13 gigs is that true maybe i missed it i'm pretty sure that i downloaded everything that i could yeah ps5 and xbox amd cpu and gpu um hold on let me just look in the in the settings i don't think there was anything about ray tracing here field of view the only thing i've done is turn motion blur off uh i don't see where else it would be really unless it's uh [Music] like on the store somewhere [Music] check the game content six game contents are installed there's no other game content you can install so i've got it all [Music] yeah i'm pretty sure that i downloaded all the things for it [Music] oh yeah what's up wanna play the snow map and get the tank uh jose no i'm go i'm into a capture card i use obs to stream i use the 4k capture card i want that sniper class that one is really good i want that one on that one game effect you just bought a gaming chair cool good for you you're gonna have an aimbot now is there a performance mode um i think so but i think you have to do that from the playstation settings any codes left yeah we'll drop two codes now is there a bow pass yes i don't know if it's live at the moment though i don't think it's live probably gonna be december when the first season launches domination take the objectives right oh no are you going for that boat yeah ow gently look down you can't shoot them out if he goes if he turns around yeah you can actually hit the pilot difficult shot though when they're moving like that i wish i had c4 be come on bro this dude's just doing sea donuts look at this losing charlie control i've played all the campaign yeah we're losing this fight taking e oh karim however you say it sorry combat ball ready oh no i didn't see that dude combat pose up we're in the lead what's up lovely boy how are you doing thank you for the donation have a beer teammates are just getting murdered out there we've lost the lead he just got people camping the attack boats here that's funny i mean they are ridiculously strong though i think he knows that i'm in here hostile rcxt in your ao can i destroy an attacker with a bow ready in combat bow missed the first shot hey we did we got it okay well it must have set on fire and just killed it i don't know if that was someone swimming around underneath just ambient sound effects losing day security i feel like i'm going to run into a nest here oh you don't care about that stone at all this is interesting how you can just pop your shoes straight away it doesn't appear to be a height limit or time limit on it or anything like that what if the sharks are still there proximity mine flanks hostile spy planes detected nice shot secure get it [Music] yeah i'm going to stay indoors while that napalm strike is going on i don't really want to be involved with that yeah they've done the uh throwing stun the sounds so well on some of the guns some of them don't sound great hey chill what's up from jordan how you doing they're all zipping across zippy boys they're gonna be here how's that missing that's the kill i wanted that is the kill that i wanted that spy plane established overhead there's a guy down there dude ah there's a bernard what's my favorite gun i mean i don't have one yet i barely barely played it i like the l96 looking sniper rifle resupply it's interesting i'm not unlocked here that's a kill that's a kill someone over there shooting at me i will get one that's zipping across i promise securing delta skeet shooting losing e come on go on the zip line go on the zip line enemy spy plane inbound ahead i don't see anyone there attack helicopters there i'm legitimately scared of that it's making the room rumble can you just go away helicopter that'd be great shaking my aim and everything what about this oh no should we get the attack bone for a bit try this out oh this was really strong in the beta package above it's still really strong that's so good my man's just trying to get his care package i could count the hell out of this i think they've got it for look down executing come on lads more of you need to go across the zipline let's go i need kills i don't think so dude was locking onto me no that's rude please give me a break losing a pilot that thing [Music] please we're gonna try it in a bit please don't kill me now we're back in the game myself anyone else hope your team wins that's a close game isn't it come on come on how many attempts am i going to get before the round finishes you just do that shoot before they get on it that's nearly dead they jump out let's get this uh pear package see what it is chopper gunner chopper gunner chopper gunner come on please enemy care package above what's that counter spy player that's kind of boring i love how the fire still goes when you're in the water it doesn't really make sense does it matter not much makes sense in call of duty so it's okay hostile care package inbound taking delta [Music] that was my chance it's close match i think we are going to win it though unless something tragic happens [Music] how many attempts have i had of that now how many of them we kicked their sorry asses i thought they were going to get the guy on the right as well hey racer what's up scroll down on the loadout select there's a sniper default class there okay thank you what's up adam hey cod num xbox what's up that's not the official xbox by the way hey

case my team can handle it dr gray they'll explore the site and find the entrance [Music] zombies oh my god hey this is cool i haven't played a zombies game in ages the only one that i really played was the first one world of war all i remember was that you're supposed to knife him you get more points something i need to watch geeky pastimes and noah oh this is cool [Music] [Music] guys i am so so confused right now i can't well i can't afford that mp5 i know you do zombie trains right that's i don't know how to do the zombie train but you do the zombie train and then then you shoot them so you run around like this you run around you make a zombie train and then you go and you kill all those zombies i think it's something like that right that's it maybe i should get into zombies because

doesn't do that much damage though good for crowd control i guess yeah it's not it's not actually i try the um no i don't want to waste the monkey points yeah this is uh would not advise getting the grenade launcher that's another perk isn't it that's so cool another walking corpse stamina run faster okay so now we've got three parts armor or something is there ever any point in repairing the
