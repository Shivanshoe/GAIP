you know those friends or content creators who say hey this gun is the most overpowered thing in war zone if you're not using this you're doing it wrong and for the most part usually the ones that they pick are pretty good but I wouldn't say that there's an absolute best primary weapon in the game however today I wanted to show you what I think is the most broken thing in the game at the moment and definitely the best secondary weapon it's this bad boy the 3 5 7 with akimbo and snake shot ammunition so I've been seeing a lot of this in game recently and when I was killed by it I was like how did I die so quick wow what just happened well I did a bit of research on this and the three five seven is a revolve with it I would just never use because it's got that horrible trigger delay on it but if you level it up a bit and you get the Recon perk you put that on and then you get three kills in five different matches with it you can unlock akimbo which is that so you have two guns at once one on the left one on the right and then you put the snake shot ammunition in which is basically shell ammo so essentially you've now got two incredibly high damage shotguns that you can fire and you can still have insane mobility so this is how I've got mine set out and you're gonna see some clips in a second from a solo match that I played and honestly I do think it is really broken I think it kills people in warzone way too quick you can have this as a secondary weapon you don't even need to take overkill so you just pick a nice assault rifle or a sniper for your primary and then you go with the snake shot at Kimber 3 5 7 as your secondary this I've got it no muzzle 3 5 7 long barrel 5mw laser light weight trigger you absolutely need that snake shot ammo of course the perk akimbo it's insane is is the most broken thing and I think you're going to see a lot more of this in the game over the next few weeks and maybe it will start to annoy people we'll see with that said let's take a look at a solo game that I played earlier this is just crazy ok I'm gonna drop Superstore cuz there's a recon there and I just like finally superstore at the beginning it can be quite funny times there's a couple people nearby that guy is definitely going for baby shall not do it and try and do it body armor okay I have to try to finish this now I've got to reload in alarms there we gotta get to the Gulag sorry can we um can we move this waitress I'm sick of it every time I open those doors in that type of building that crate is just always well Miss quite a few shots said it in my you know I'm gonna gain I'm gonna rush this guy called it a p90 I'm not sure if I can get onto the roof very easily there you have to get the ladder on the background hiya okay mr. jumped off let's go get this load out then no one's looking at me though all these people can fit by husband I'm gonna get me some snake shot yeah I haven't got the right name for it yet I need to come up with a clever name for the loadout some kind of snake fun so here they are the bad boys look at this the laces of doom I think I just heard a door there on the left below me [Applause] guy just got absolutely wrecked did you see how fast he went down what give me a UAV where's that recon I was actually someone in this building it's really camping in the roof of course and someone hunted me down I don't know if that's them I don't think so I feel like their threat would have changed if that was them they're not peeking any of the windows it's quite difficult to see though sometimes you know the point of this video is to try and test these things out so I'm just gonna rush in definitely upstairs Yeah right above me c4 that's not what I wanted to do okay didn't matter that I messed the c-4 that is I mean what is that time to kill that is so fast don't see this threat though dropped an airstrike on me she'll be alright in here though I always get worried that it's gonna get me through the war they're not rushing so that's good where is that guy okay over here somewhere that's not the bounty what you get is cheap she wasn't it shooting at me from the fire station I'm just gonna go hide to make more money see you later what is a bounty in here that goes right next to me not too close though you know what we're gonna get in the car I'll hunt this guy down there's gonna be an action-packed game friends action-packed it is really risky to play like this because most people carry c4 or RPGs now but it's gonna test these revolvers out targets in there you know I'm real I'm sweating how did I survive that I should so be dead right now I'd be I'd be upset if I was that guy but the range on that man that's man remember guys you wanted win solos you gotta get cash and you go to spam UAVs and get bounties like this game of Jasper I'm gonna hunt you down buddy I'm coming for you they're like right on the edge of the gas over here but this is not really any vehicles around up there so I don't know what the plan is and they've got like 10 seconds before the gas moves sir my plan is to kill this dude and again that quad boy yeah it's gonna chill here in this bush I see because they've got to move any second now not close enough yet for the heartbeat right okay that guys don't have any armor whatsoever I kind of feel bad I want to be honest I do I do feel bad about that I like to do crazy hammerhead I'm just gonna prune it over to that guy cuz I want to get that bounty but they're right there we have to jump here we go oh no no lose another one there was another guy camping in there why how would they not engaged each other right well I got lucky and there's no one to fight so I've got like one second I'll take it got off scot-free there where should we go there's a few options down here that we could they're gonna be they're gonna have people all over them out no doubt wait I get that he's in the bone zone though I don't really like going there sets on weekends I think it's not in a bad spot really as a bit cover we've got him anyone in this plane no we're good okay all right we're just gonna chill here check the heartbeat no one around by the looks of it wait for the gas always reminds me of aliens when I've got this thing out and then I get sad that there's not been a good alien or aliens game since alien isolation there's not around didn't mean to do that because people can hear you coughing and it's quite loud but I think I'm okay just trying to be sneaky someone found an RPG down here problem is I don't really have much ammo do I've got 60 bullets okay that just gave me a shave and there's a sniper over there I don't even know if that was aimed at me you know I think that was just a random RPG I think if I stay here behind me what the hell is going on stop it has he seen someone there there's no one there oh it was someone there okay there's two people on just go chill see that coffee is so loud they got the movie for there yes we have the same names I think I just sort of run through the plane maybe I'm not sure just in my peripheral vision there but then come safe to me I'm gonna get to the next own here there's a dude in front of me here somewhere he's just done a fight and 13 is a beam at that distance hopefully this dude's got ammo but I'm bit worried that there's someone right here because he was like you know someone any of em over there okay he got beamed 1v1 now don't think he's behind me could it be over they're probably in there right no I guess it could be the guy from before that was in the in the bombs are maybe just keeping my head on a swivel here oh there we go we got it celebration let's go right okay so snake shots though man when ovm 13 did the work at the end there but so many those kills like with the snake shot it's insane I didn't realize this but you actually press left and right Mouse at the same time so if you're on console you would press left trigger and right trigger and you fire both at once they're like individually controlled which is kind of interesting but you just got black black and if both of those shots are on target you break the armor and you get the down for the kill but it's just insane mad anyway guys I hope you enjoyed that let me know your thoughts down below if you did like it leave a like thank you that's really helpful and subscribe if you want
