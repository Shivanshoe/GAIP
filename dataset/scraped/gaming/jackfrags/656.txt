hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're using the Uzi in war zone yeah that easy the one that no one really thinks about he's always so sad in the corner by himself but I've leveled it up and this is the build that I was using in the match you're about to see the two most important components of this though if you want that Uzi to be competitive in war zone number one the FSS carbine Pro barrel that gives you a massive increase to range bullet velocity and recoil control and also the 41 a 32 round mags that have much higher damage than the typical bullets and even add more range on top of the barrel I think you need those two attachments for war zone you do have to unlock them though with challenges a little tricky but once you get them try this build out you won't regret it and also it's a bit more interesting than everyone just running around with a growl and an mp5 at the moment now in this game too there are some absolutely filthy car 98 shots a sniper that I just never used but after this game I think it might be one of my new favorites I hope you guys enjoyed this if you do leave a like and subscribe for more let's do this right we are gonna go to the silos as playing with Benny central and he told me the silos that's where you drop if you want to win games usually they've all got boxes so you can kind a little brown here and then head over to superstore on no base makeover this dude's just there's no gun anyone else don't think so what we got couple um fights and a car 98 was better than the foul which is like everywhere at the moment for some reason it's pretty early une there check behind because sometimes people like camped here can I stop him nice be a cover there nope it's two just jumping up and down right now okay I'm not playing that game anymore sorry sure in that door headful step underneath nothing those on the roof there's been absolutely poston in the back there as well car that's annoying that's actually a really smart Claymore that was actually a really smart play from that guy get me the stayed after he threw the gas grenade I'd have been really vulnerable there and he'd probably just could have kill me I didn't finish looting this time come back boon let's slap it on there Pretender than to see him you just got cracked oh my god one here is that noise no selfish but he's sorry I still haven't actually unlocked the Brewin I need to do it one of my old mates tell me it's really good and there's an Uzi what we wanted the self res UAV I hate this buy station okay got one to the east here I'm just gonna rush this dude screw it I don't even care I come in this way now where have you gone that's pretty fast considering the range dude on that roof as well I'm not going up there though that's just very fun idea I swear this superstore is really creepy when you play solos and it is just aliens isn't it again there could be someone with ghosts hiding here I'd never know probably give me a jump scare so anyways I'm gonna go on the roof so I can get a bit of a overlook one thing I've noticed they like people die so quickly in solo matches now and in quads it was someone here nearly at me oh come on I wanted to do the cigar execution but you just you gave up Jaime me don't then no stop growl there it is nobody around everybody hates me going in the garden eat some worms he's got a sniper alright that's giving your thumbs up please spectating I'm sorry for that one sleep tight my friend I reckoned I'm gonna get the recon drone out another look around I plugged it in overnight it's fully charged where am i where am i oh there there's me we've got a full battery in this bad boy so dude on the green roof can i snap here not the same amount of damage is it like you would get out of a HDR or a x50 but the rate of fire is really quick miss summary shot sighs hello just brush this dude that window just broke on its own what the hell where did you go mo is that white building mm-hmm maybe I should have stayed on the roof now I'm regretting my actions no I'm gonna get the bogus door feel safe in here is that the same guy no it's different dude that's the one from before I think there's a Jeep behind me and there's a guy behind me firing at the Jeep and there's someone nearby as well that's what I mean [Music] screw you but the guy that was firing at the Jeep is still out there so is the guy in the garage I think I think there's two more err no idea where I was is he slam the garage I just wanted to peek so I can head shine right so dude in the white buildings gone or maybe he was the guy that I just killed it's like a murder mystery this I'm trying to piece everything together I'm gonna move over here because the circle is in a fortuitous position for me here so I can kind of gatekeeper me there's someone firing here suppressed it's really difficult to see that what's with all these loadout drops making noises my second time that's happened he was looking at someone oh he was shooting there's someone definitely it's making my other ghosts in this game now or something what the hell if anyone else is out there they're gonna have to come sail right in a [ __ ] okay okay you've got to go for those shots you have to go for them if you never try you never know someone while shooting at him though with the purple traces I don't see anyone else out there so I'm just gonna fall back there's only two of the people left in the game pretty confident and my left here is okay I've got a nice bit of heel cover here that's the strike over there but he spied that from over there Oh Cindy at the bomb find other areas I'm assuming the other guys at the bombing they're probably both over here gonna go dead silence and see if I'm get involved yeah it is oh he must have killed the other guy I'm really glad that I managed to get window would be easy cuz I just don't see it that often I think it's really good I'll put my build at the start of this video so you guys can see what it was but it works okay that is to be honest I mean even it like medium and longer range is pretty pretty tasty some nice car 90s action in there too yeah that was good how many kills there we go in the end 12 not bad not bad at all anyways I hope you enjoyed that guys if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music] you
