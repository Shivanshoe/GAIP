everyone and welcome to modern warfare season three it's just gone live today and today we are gonna be playing some war zone squads all player squads that just changed it to four instead of three we've still got solos but they've removed trios for the meanwhile I hope you're all doing well it's got going out as a live stream at the moment but it will be a void afterwards so thank you very much for tuning in so before we get stuck into a match I just wanted to quickly go through some of the new stuff that they've added so in the battle pass I've gone through and unlocked everything and the main kind of new operator this time is Alex from the single-player all I'm going to details about that because I don't want to spoil anything we've also got vehicle customization and there's a load of charms and emblems like this little Tamagotchi thing on your watch I think that's a new version of Mara as well some new takedowns and everything loads of XP boosts customization for your truck your helo which we just saw there's all sorts of like like milsim operators now as well they've got actually different countries now but if you want to represent your your country's gear there's some options for you there if you're interested in that kind of thing but I'm going with Alex and I think he's also got a dog oh he's gone that dog is in ecology ghosts isn't it it's called Riley I think or very one that's like kind of similar it where's that honest there's a few different variants of that skin but the new guns are the SKS right here this bad boy and we've also got a new pistol which is the renessa it's like a burst pistol weird I got a couple of notes wrong one I've got a couple of blueprints for it renessa this one God one that just looks sick but the SKS I've got no idea how like how well that gun is gonna perform it's got a cool skin on it anyway I'm like played the game at all today so this is gonna be my my first match and yeah should be her should be interesting this is the vehicle customization here but they've just added a halo skin skin for the truck the TAC Rover a defender and also the quad some new finishing moves to hopefully we can get some finishes in this match but with that said I am gonna get into a lobby with these guys and we'll try and join a game all right who's got the lobby up hmm I guess I don't use that yeah just join align I can invite Westie as well okay yeah thank you I've got two daggers yeah well you can you can put that assassination yo guys with Talan you can have that on any operator no oh that's cool yeah rock you up or don't or dose three we got three I'm just gonna pretend as long as I don't think he has the skin there live editor dogged yeah I think no I think I have what like is it the takedown there you have to apply yes well I think I've got that did you buy Talan no I think it's on the Aleks skin as well yeah top dog it's okay season three legendry oh all right so it's not it's not the talon assassination then could be a difference what got a prosthetic leg this is our kill streak attack dogs let's see it I want to be the dog Cameron right control the dog once can you was there like a modern warfare 3 mission or ghosts dog AI there was definitely a dog with a GoPro yeah it was called Riley yes yeah it was ghost wasn't because I had fish a.i it was actually a Riley Easter again when I gonna fight matches for Christmas I think he was like towing Santa like a husky on a sled ISM yeah well no he's sacks it was flying in the sky instead of reindeer it was Riley with a red face it was Captain Price missed that one it was really good yeah you have to shoot a clock like midnight and then Santa aka Captain Price would fly by it's so rad like a little Christmasy jingle is great I'm outside Gaelic is when they did a snowball fights income fight it was like a what was at the gun fight tech system now you grab your weapon before fire instead of today heaven across [Applause] OSBI thing yes so I'm looking forward to this guy's be interesting to see what they've changed I know there's a few changes to war zone they've increased the loadout drop price to 10,000 and they've changed the loot as well so the stuff that you get out of the boxes on the ground is actually different so it'll be interesting to see how this goes London thank you very much for the -

Africa it's called the Renetta I think yeah and that's the Italian thing I'm a platinum print first Adama first unit vehicle one Wesley is the thing is short stout one oh nice shot Cameron SD eliminated Austin is that the classic HDR there actually keeps the skinny background I thought it might change that's really cool who's on top sit stop it's Mahina Sofia yeah well it's my thing now though the old design blended in quite well with its surroundings yellow just pretend to be like a big Hornet or something yeah we made buzzing noises to play flight of the bumblebee know what why don't we let the other one riders out dad and a dad fire the bumblebee yeah that's a real one yeah yeah more for comedy that there's nothing funny about this it's pay respects what's happening what's happening every needs a lift we got a Wookiee on the loose and it's the RPG how fast is not so far it's quite snipe the area I regret taking the RPG now meantime we're gonna get Collider so they can line it up up a hill you find as well there's gravity boots are those okay yeah your your prosthetic legs just jammed into the top of it oh but you can see it when you look down oh right what's the og how you doing hey Jonathan sheets oh I imagine that gunfights are just really prolonged and mad now yeah whatever everyone's doing a bit more passive as well okay no because the poor man but just because you know today you don't want to be a bit less thirsting because if you if you do like people they can come you're still gun fighting other people so other things gonna take a lot of the newer players to realize that yeah people will just get carry on into the first thing for a while oh yeah does this SKS takes my farm Oh or yeah I think I think it should yeah thank you thank you got any spare stud yeah thank you it does take sniper on that's their sign marksman rifle isn't it yeah yes I'm awesome what a trouser yes yeah Jake oh they added SKS and this as well do you I don't know how

side the war yeah yeah it got me getting I'm trying to do guys I'm took the snap on Ruth sank ups nights doc I don't know what to do you have to pick me up and then once I'm playing the guy's number laid behind me behind me what's happening he's landing on my head oh he just got come on me what believe me so hard bed that was crazy with you coming there's still someone a lot of people running don't know plate flat I know that I was there I had ghosts so I don't think you would have seen me on UAV I suppose cuz I jumped out the truck maybe that was there I was in intense my two squads everywhere this game is getting crazy now Brandon thank you for becoming a new member I appreciate that a news Idol thank you for the to do you think there'll be a new war zone map another war zone map yeah back in boys beam nice sources stockier I think I lied on you guys are you clean yeah I'd go for it maybe land around here though safety in numbers and all that I can hear Chris let's plate here tonight dates feed plates is not our alive the zone is chasing us earth oh yeah sure everyone everyone's gonna get pushed out alright we're gonna have people right behind this like yeah yeah we'll have a lot of people all someone just called in their friend and then now another vehicle is armored down nice nice okay we've got a girl I'm up in the vehicle one right on green Ryan green an old friend store tandem founded go goes guy next to me this guy is gonna be behind you can watch out Joe and Joe let's go till I come out further yeah long nights get in my still you take enough for it I took there was a guy Bayless watch out sure I'll be 450 meters we're good 50 meters yeah he's on the right this is so spicy that see boy I mean you do like in Tom yeah you got this you got this right come on Tommy let's do this man squads initial impressions it's crazy this is absolutely crazy it's a completely different matter two trios it's just is it Cameron if camera wins this we could stay in the game let's say Eagle gotta get that one dude Cameron let's go [Applause] win middle as a great sea father well played go ahead shot nice job right let's see let's see what we can do with very limited time I mean there's only two contracts really yeah three by zones for actually yeah kind of glad I sort that out I'm gonna go for yeah building over there Jake thank you for the two first time don't know a long time watch that's very kind even yeah that was a great see for from that guy very well time I don't think we had much of a choice though cuz we've just been in a long fight I'd redeployed had no loot really just the LMG and the other guys were probably low on armor plates and we just had to get out of there but unfortunately that squad right place at the right sign wrong time for us nailed us for that see for a job in what way is the meta different oh well it it feels a lot more trihard in this because you have to really stick together like if you're in a 1 V 2 or 1 V 3 in trios if you're good and skilled and you have a bit look on your side maybe you've got a decent frag grenade or semtex or stun out you can win a 1 B 3 especially if they don't have many armor plates but if you think about in this if you're down let's say you do a 2 V 4 you're a massive disadvantage especially if the other team is fully armored just if you think about it that's so much HP like for people or health full armor of course is a guy in there is this squads is this what it's like yeah for first quads how many people are up there - it was two of them oh man hand in hand yeah that's definitely a lot sweaty er than trios I can tell you that like it feels a lot of sweat here oh yeah you just take fire from 16 different angles or ones it's the building meta isn't it you've got to get your loadout get a sniper down a building that's how you win they just died twice - explosive that huh that's great it's good yeah very skilled are we all in their party uh yeah I mean you want to need that extra dog though them and I think we'll get the wind we do there will be an eight-man squad dog presents can we give the dog armor what this armor isn't it or more you know give it a few player who stuck yeah I'd like to see is it like a helmet Hill Street you can put a camera on the back and do the thing from the campaign just let's run him in I wanted them to do like puppy Royale on April Fool's Day and just like 150 people she was mind if I restart my game real quick yeah go ahead oh yeah come on I'll be quick 150 people control a dog and then it's be off for a day but you a dog [Laughter] instead of armor place you need to go and find balls of pedigree chub more the more pedigree Trevor you eat the more healthy yeah what would you what would like some of the some of the other stuff babe what would you cash be cash bones yeah get binds and you can like you put them down somewhere and then like you get like a doofus sticks hey guys can you drop your dentists dick I need to buy a cape so I can fly killstreak is Clifford the Big Red Dog yes cliff what was that what was that what's that animation that Pixar animation was a ball Superdog yeah Bob yeah yeah one movie not saying that I don't remember it to be honest I just watched on would have you seen that I played it is that one yeah on words the one that's just come out with them spider-man and star-lord Chris Pratt and Tom Holland oh no it's like it's like like trolls right dead well so like two hours yeah and their dad is dead yes and they try and take a joker only half of them comes back make a grown man cry oh yeah I was crying comes back only half of him comes back and then they have to go and make the other half of him come back just his legs I'm deadly serious tough oh the spoilers no no this is all in the trailer I haven't bought anything all right I mean I'm sold that's what master watched how do I join you I've invited you oh yeah or you can join on Westie Oh Jack you can't gain are there any sweaty loadouts than the m4 in the RPG alone for an HDR is there anything sweaty I don't think so really MP 77 and b7 if you're gonna be rushing but you were all writing no yeah Ram sevens good building at all times yeah okay so tactic for the next match I might try the okay no tactic the next match is go centre ozone in the beginning of the game old Sonora zone just strain a bush as if you because they you might as well try and win the early fights in the central zone and then just hold that just yes for a while prosthetic legs are white because the you either don't you either die earlier or later to people waiting for you to run in so yeah Christophe how are you I'm very good thanks Christophe gamer why don't you play Valerie I've been playing a lot of valor and I played several hours earlier today and yesterday and it finally got working it wasn't working to begin with but yeah it's very addictive that game add ENC master thank you so much for the 50 how long did it take you to download this Jack I've been trying to download the update all day so dnc what I had to do I couldn't download the update on European servers on PC so I actually had to use a VPN I used I have a subscription to Nord VPN and I used that to fly to New York we u.s. East and then I logged into a battlenet and it started to download it quickly but on the European service it just wouldn't download the IVP and then it worked and what's up busca how you doing I'm glad you missed today's stream well thank you for coming busker I'm pretty sure that Mohammed why do you always use iron sights on your mp7 just quick a IDs speed I don't think I'd use mp7 in squads I'd probably use it in solos though I think it's my favorite gunner solos Jedi Jill gaming are you disappointed that they removed trios I think a lot of people would prefer it if it stayed if it was trios quads and solos I think that would have been ideal but maybe they don't want to split the playerbase up up that much but from what I've heard like they've got a lot of players on this like 30 million players or something stupid so I don't know if that would be a big problem for matchmaking times but yeah we'll see I I think I'd have preferred if they left trails then I'm sure they might put it back it's probably just a switch that they can just go yet on/off whatever [Music] senator zone let's go for maybe this and then work our way towards ya that's a good spot I'll Ted thank for xx at the construction site isn't that yeah at Brandon thank you so much for the fire been working from home during these crazy times and the vod's from these strings have kept me sane keep up the great work and stay healthy brother Brandon thank you so much man I hope you're working for my from home okay and everything's good with you we drop an earlier parish you straight away yeah inch the parachute phase pepper yeah try trying what I said try using a VPN toxic gas gaming do they have duo's now no they don't have doors Shane about used to dragon breath yet no I haven't I'm not trying to yet that's the shotgun with the incendiary shells I live in the UK corner we should make this a cullen yeah yeah my Jules really good man I'm all healed I had the double jaw surgery in July 2018 for those that don't know that's what he's talking about it was a bit of a long recovery but it's all good now and everything's fine the only negative impacts of it is the sometimes when I yawn like I do like a really big yawn I get a little bit of muscle pain and also I can't really feel my lower chin anymore because when they do the surgery they have to cut through those nerves in your face but apart from that yeah it went great I can I can eat properly now I'm not self-conscious about smiling or anything like that yeah I'd do it again I don't regret it although it was a very difficult recovery like the animations cool that's worth somebody legendary I've got one already yeah and it's got a 2nd baronet which one will dropping it I'll go for that one Thank You Xena flemeth I accidentally dropped my stopping power gum there that was close if you drop the stopping power gun you don't get younger to keep it it loses the stopping Barnes yeah ouch it's just a suppressed pistol I think we all get money if we do the scavenger thing so we can just go back to their shop and get a loader and thence in a building and wait to the end of the game Jack they've passed the EBR it was bugged the bbr was completely broken one of the particular blueprints called the lion breaker was broken and he actually did a one hit kill headshot but they fixed it in this patch so maybe it's not so good anymore another boy it's care if it'll i'ma start [Music] all right exchange just get the best price and performance you can afford you don't need to spend thousands of dollars to get a good gaming PC anymore you can get a pretty good gaming PC for like five hundred six hundred dollars I think especially for something like this yeah it's for a weapon right I got the library got enough money for that yeah finishes box drop that afterwards I've oh do I not haven't mentioned it's cuz you replace the load um I I picked outside when the guy loadouts all learn traffic that's no no it's fine no I just forgot about it hello to our marker reporters get your ammo get your ammo it was hot right so sinners own the kingdom there's a nest right there someone can tell you sure they're just gonna show up when you see a special one of those lying around the pile of loot like that you got to make Evanier he got a dinner can't resist I mean that sounds so close but it can't be right did you hear that gunfire yes but it's probably still like 300 meters away yeah it always sounds really close it was saying that they kind of fix that but rants to read them I didn't sound any different to me no um it's 45 they're still like but sometimes they've said that like buildings and rocks and stuff will occlude sound better now okay apparently this is thing I'm not like if there's a building in front of you will make the sounds choir on the other side yeah I think so I think that's how it's supposed to work okay I mean this is the thing I don't quite believe it because I've been killed a couple of times already by people who just didn't seem to make any sound whatsoever and they definitely didn't have that silence on that last keep the first game we played like that team just ran up to us there's no sound effects on the roof yeah we can't get out quite good building this one if we just want to sit there forever it's really interesting what changed mm-hmm your streams are gonna love it oh it's not gonna be many more after this if this is the way I carried on I think if it's too bad Somerset over that's gonna sell no they're not you're not not gonna do anything what about you guys then you'll play again then just make Stolley one study to study three and every single match just log into a new account old player going on with the bank this broke his armor good shot Logan thank you for the team with visits let's get this great let's roof his classic camco roof for yellow you can sit new because no no the one I'm in now because if you get down you just come up the edge and then you're in a safe safe side we go and there's only one way up to the roof I think there's a there's a ladder in that yeah the ladder that's the Laden ladder oh you can see where he got shot yeah as far as brutal and they blamed him on the wall very wet what spray is nothing using that spray as my enemy no where's his team and what is that Jack there's there's a helicopter Amara on its way look east trailer I can't be real are these Easter eggs say what if it's one stop thumbs is it one squad No like bang I'll get the hell nah I think it's one squad everyone's each other own individually I've never seen anything like that I don't see anyone besides looks so weird it really does this I'm not hardly just disappeared I mean Christ or something no I think it went beyond our the render distance and current not a hundred percent sure though I think we need more ammo what are you done my bedroom oh wow oh yeah [Applause] don't get the dead honor yeah striking Oh what are you guys down here seven limit to this look you just say forever hang on Jim broccoli it's my don't you dare put Ben 10 on the wall then hey then I guess the thumbs up from me should we go get this crate I like that there's people right in front our shooting West or straight in front rounded our tracks co-star essentially there's a space here what you do okay now we're given the thumbs up curve gets a like comment subscribe this is my army of ninjas of currents do you think if someone climbed up this ladder they would be confused and start shooting at them like what's going on here it's too many of them no they'd be like what the hell is this season 3 never I climbed up into there's definitely one in the fire station weather wise Venus was definitely the current face that she looks like a Karen to me a Rufus this is the growl or is that the Laura Croft I do I do like the the Benton where's Ben where did you [ __ ] Ben come find you is it I don't see him Tom don't see Ben put him back on there Sunao [Laughter] shoulder is it unlimited hey bud what's up it's very creepy of them yeah it's just about to say that looks at 100 kill the guys on it this is just our life now video game this is the game a game where their job a Call of Duty sticker book those are both coming so why is just something going down there down block on the roof a film I wish I had a sniper on our side oh there's someone's pushing us now that was my snapshot okay momentary flutter of perhaps getting in a fight with someone we need to steal that roof I think what stay here the whole game coming changed you've got to get back into the stored mentality and send it on people if anyone else came in if we tried to sell this buy this stock doesn't die yeah well to be honest we need to be sent more central zone yeah I agree we need to be more central I've got a recon drone if you want to see for it and they're not just over there and some have a big gas mask here they patched that though apparentiy song no star tried it yesterday and it won't wait what does see for recording on a spin yeah yeah no we did it we did it yeah we do they're still on that roof they're still on the roof I get to that
