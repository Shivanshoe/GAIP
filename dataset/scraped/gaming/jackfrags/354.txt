be honest you can hear other creatures what is that i'm severely lacking ammunition as well right now please ammunition i've got to do some scavenging find some ammo there's got to be somewhere around here somewhere look at that but that's six bullets guys i mean how many shots did it take to kill that thing it was a lot more than six wasn't it go to this house with the water wheel i feel like red chimneys by the way iron isn't it it is yeah anybody home grenade launcher bunk yes please thank you very much well that's a bit of extra firepower isn't it can deal with the lichens a bit better that way well we're gonna head down the river yeah this has got to be the right way looks breakable well you know what we've got to use for that don't you there it is looks like there's a different ammo type for this as well you see flashbang maybe oh it's goopy it's so goopy thing is do i really want to be wasting my ammunition on goop i don't know if i do i definitely wasted that one i could have just pulled it down you idiot jack i'm gonna need that oh no what is this here there's a mill there's a safe reservoir elevator oh no oh no no no no no into the depths of hell we go the fish guy looked kind of harmless though when we saw him for the first time wouldn't have to fly i don't like this that's gonna be locked isn't it yeah locked as well we only got one way oh i see a little shiny there crystal fragment two bullets and two grenade launchers hmm i don't fancy my odds we'll do our best oh there he is oh no he's right there watching tv if it's for you i do anything all right i'll

my baby how do i get out of here he called me a sneak thief as well hello i don't really know if i can afford to get in a fight can i craft anything now ah nope right it's knife in time unless i get some ammo here okay we're going on a boat oh no it's one of the big guys just when i've got no ammo as well perfect i wonder if i could bait them into a mine that'll be good explosive rounds get them together that's close enough put the mine down is that the end have we got chem fluid guys i can crash some shotgun ammo yes nine let's go i'll climb up there excuse me lads oh it's dirty love the shotgun yes so powerful there is a boat here well this is ominous rapid i guess it is engine powered though what was that is that the little guy i think that was the little guy not so little anymore maybe i can go up there i'm gonna check this first what the hell research post or something what the are they doing here stay the down ethan i gotta say i'm surprised you made it this far oh it's chris it'd be a shame if something happened to you now sir chris why not you killed mia now do me and finish the job hey cap i'm getting some serious motion readings out here we should move on what kind of readings what's moving unknown but my guess is we've been here too long and miranda knows it hey hey did you say miranda how are you involved leave it alone ethan you are out of your depth what about the sample analysis it's definitely related to the mold oh my goodness oh stay back i knew it was you i don't have time for this [Music] miranda sent you to slow me down you're pathetic what are you talking about [Music] it's so gross [Music] uh please it's gone what am i supposed to do i don't know ether i don't know anymore he said the exit's underwater oh so this is instructions a sluice gate in an instance of heavy rain there may be damage to the local aquatic life move the windmills with a crack to start the electricity pull the lever in the gate has to open the swiss gate so i've got to get a crank start the windmills well that ain't gonna work is it if i can drain the water  there's no power yeah some kind of a code there isn't there sure i'll need that for later turn on the electricity hey how have you even got here how did you even get in here dude seeking something in particular i do not understand how we can get that crank from in here maybe can i just steal that from there seriously no i want that can we not reuse that it's broken it's busted maybe we got to go to windmill 2 first and there's the second windmill oh no we're in the water demon's lair here though aren't we no no no no no god hey please not up and down no up and down no up and down [Music] please can i go i'm going oh sure why not damn i don't know why i find this so funny is that how i deal with the peril is that what it is oh god oh god is that the power stinks do it yeah disgusting [Music] okay okay is that i'm just running around pressing levers now oh i think this guy's got some confidence problems you know where's he gone no no no no how about you just go away it's so annoying oh man no can you jump on this and get me yeah kind of ethan quick push it push it am i safe maybe i'm safe i think i'm safe i never thought okay yep i never thought i'd be fighting a giant fish monster in this game i thought i'd be against vampires the whole time based on the marketing but the giant fisherman no never in a million years you can just shoot that this whole time you could choose it and i've wasted so many grenade launchers on it oh this game fakes you in hard i caught myself a big one yeah it's like a ship or something an old ship covered in moss this boy can't come up here i suppose he could change into his landform and climb the ladder although it must be difficult with that massive thing on your back this one work yeah we got the crank finally it's only taken about 10 years i can't climb up it like this use the crown try and get eaten crank it who's the hobby now laughing is hard dealing with the stress that must be it let's go i knew it was coming it scared me anyway crank crank second windmill done okay power let's get back there i think this is the building here i've got to copy that pattern but it's rotated the black squares at the bottom that one's got to be blue one's got to be orange almost got to be blue almost got to be orange and that one's got to be blue that's it there goes the water got it the sea monster goes with it find a way out great i still gotta fight that thing quite clearly you're coming on land where did he go yes give me the things yes ammunition love that oh there he is i'm doing what i know best oh my god he's vomiting on me [Music] no i don't want to take anything oh he's got me oh it's corrosive why because you're disgusting being and you must simply die no no no no no no i'll take it back i'll take it back i was explosive barrel there is he throwing up again oh he's charged me got me in the corner i'm gonna be quicker every longer i can't get the shot on him saving what oh my god oh that's very close i'm so glad this covers here can i craft i can't really craft much can i shopkin ammo well i feel like i'm ruined [Music] mines hey boy don't swear come on no no okay right that nearly got me my face last shotgun shell got him oh my goodness in death as he was in life disgusting ugh you're damn right ethan

what's the plan when you have all four flasks what are you trying to get at i could lend you a hand not trying to get on my good side go don't get cocky i kill you if you weren't worth the trouble there's a stronghold not too far outside the village go there and get my flask do that and you pass first head back to the graveyard self-centered prick bit of an invitation then from him could do is that is that alive i mean it certainly looks like it doesn't even right get back to the graveyard there's a little building here that's a nice looking revolver i'm glad that i went in this building mother miranda gave me a mountain now i can do lots of could do experiments this is my secret special laboratory i need three today but they all went pop this revolver looks sick it's kind of like the peacekeeper from battlefield that's awesome i feel like it's going to be very strong though watch out for these flying things they're bloody annoying hello two shots are you kidding right i have to save all this ammo because it's clearly very good rose is waiting for you it was a goat that could be the devil no go don't attack me go please i wasn't gonna shoot you black phillip i'm the witch have you seen that movie very strange movie but very good at the same time kind of similar vibes to this game good luck i thought that was a ghost or something coming out there is that above me i don't turn around oh this looks awesome the lighting here ray tracing is really doing good work and that's where we saw all those crows remember i love it all ties in [Applause] uh i don't like the sound of that hey lads it's me ethan this is you oh no i messed that up oh you got a bow and arrow and kill these guys what they've got for me sniper still doesn't mean one hit very useful who's firing a bow and arrow at me yeah i'm not going to miss that noscope oh i missed that one though it's so wily really difficult to hit there's more of them although would like a bow and arrow that'd be awesome i thought i'd missed it there's another explosive there sure i'll need that what's that shotgun ammo yes open the gate come on make it easy make it easy for me very slow though is it open nearly through oh there was way too many there i just don't have ammo i've got a big ammo problem oh my god this is awesome pipe bombs more ammo and a safe it's about to get real isn't it that's down there there's a gap there gotta be this way oh this is so gothic i love it this must be they're den it's like a level from doom or something super cool love the level design it's blasting time it's blasting time you can you please stay dead i do have some pistol ammo build 1911 pretty powerful now i think i can craft some shotgun ammo too if i wanted [Applause] let's stop by that grenade launcher maybe not such a good idea when he was right there oh no no no running is always the best option it seems especially when you're in the dead okay big guy big guy oh he's charging me right you know how we deal with big guys where is it there it is i've got one left you're not dead [Applause] i'm going to craft some shotgun ammo here as many as we can as many as we can say hello to my friend

seeing what they did to rose await your patronage how is that possible last one head giants chalice what [Music] well i guess this is the way it's a heisenberg it's all opened up what's going on no yes i remember this i put that in here a giants chalice yeah how was i carrying that in my pockets what the that doesn't seem legit it's making a bridge this bridge was in that little game that we played wasn't it i'm getting across the chasm are we going down the whole thing goes down who built this stuff was it the big glass maybe it was just the giants what if it was duke put it all together himself don't worry about the kid even it'll be fine just get your ass across the bridge there's this factory that looks awesome can't wait to get in there here we go ah ethan winters welcome i didn't think you'd make it past daughter moreau but i suppose you survive worse back in america i like you i'd like to speak to you about rose and miranda oh come on in don't worry it's not a trap it looks like a truck what are you planning it's been very welcoming to me i'm not sure it's gone all industrial all of a sudden i like it eisenberg where you are is it a trap that's a long way down what the hell mia truth her let me guess you're thinking take me out like the others and then he gets going save rose right i'm healing my daughter look you got this all wrong shut your hole i'm sorry about that take a seat listen ethan you're being played what are you talking about you think this is a game i said lady super-sized ugly ass psycho doll an amaronic freak don't you get it it's a test to see if you're strong enough to be a part of miranda's fell i don't want to be a part of miranda's family neither did i but here we are and i'm next in line right kill me move up the chain well that i don't give a damn about your personal issues i just want to fix my daughter so do i do you have any idea how powerful a kid is even miranda scared her last time you freaked i swear to god what is that you and me together we go save rose and we can use her to grind miranda into beast my daughter is not a weapon  you last chance you don't want to find out what's in that hole i'll take my chances your future idiot ethan what's down here a rancor oh my god what the hell is that  oh he's got a propeller for a head yep he has a propeller for her head it's never a dead end nathan you know that well i don't want to find that thing i'm sure i have to though what was that thing we're in the trash compactor right is this another star wars reference you bet there's loads of metal scrap around in there trash compactor but he seemed like he wanted to work with me i don't know he doesn't really like mother miranda does he hey they've got things on their heads what's that they look like the things in cyberpunk holly crystal score cool very very industrial i love it all sorts of different level design in this game i appreciate the variety takes a long time to put stuff like this together this place is messed up wow i've got to get upstairs what's heisenberg doing are they people damn that looks good though doesn't it that looks real nice i've got to get back upstairs how how do you do it thanks to your consistent patronage i've expanded my services how do you do it well i don't know what i'm gonna do down here but i certainly don't want to fight an army of robot soldiers or anything could be all sorts of weird experiments here looks easy to break but it was easy to break no no no no these guys are tough they don't look that tough but they are that tough green down here green means good how do you get two for one there i killed both of them in one shot i think that's possible that's mean crafting material that's cool what's that it's a casting machine can't use it without a mold what the hell now is this how he makes them robot drones there's something there doesn't fit of course it doesn't fit so we need to find a mold and make something probably that thing that i just tried is that a guy with drill for hands are you alive soon soon to be alive got the mold don't come alive yeah i knew that was gonna happen looks like the borg what do you think ah damn you hey you smashed that down mate it opens himself up for an attack you gotta hit him in the heart though little mini bar right use this relief mold i'm gonna craft me a key for that i think what a smell thing do all sorts in this game don't you all sorts of stuff a horse seems useful that's going to get me in places that i shouldn't be literally need three shots to the head to do that i mean it's not it's not gonna work there is it so now i need a horse key anything through there they are kind of like the board aren't they oh we're back here and that's the other side i can break that down then back up generator missing a cog i won't be open will it head up the stairs is this i thought it was a little grenade there or something cog mold okay so i've got to go make a cog that i can use in that machine here we go that just spawned some creatures yeah it did cool cool cool i've got a little opportunity there where you can shoot them that's a bit different though yeah that's different come on excuse me damn it man they're so strong he knows as well protecting his heart nope maybe this knife is the way perhaps it is okay we've got the cog i could use this boom back up generator hit it ethan yeah look at that oh no the soldiers are on the move now that's no good such a disappointment why i thought we could join oh my foreign there's loads of them so he kind of did want to join forces but she took me took us to be her children she locked us away in the village decades of being forced to serve her can you even understand that humiliation was he created by miranda then or something is that what's happening here i'm not like my siblings i want nothing more than to be free from that so i need power i need enough power to destroy her these are the fruits of my power the strong will destroy the weak that's the way the world you should have never refused me ethan i can't trust you what a freak yeah he definitely knows i'm here let's move away oh man i haven't got any pistol ammo oh i'm gonna get trapped i'm just fighting the board you know what you do you're dead big explosion as well can i just knife these hold on yeah don't need to waste ammo [Music] thank god for that kind of reminds me of rage you guys remember that game in software hello i'm gonna try this i'm glad that worked well he didn't turn around oh i'm trapped he's not happy is he yep give him a good kiting excuse me mate no no no no no oh god that's it come back this way horrible i hate that absolutely hate that open up open up oh my there's a propeller face no no no no no no yeah at some point i am going to have to fight that you can go go open it open it no he's going to break through there it's definitely going to break through there what the hell we're on the other side now oh i'm beginning to dislike the borg i would not like to be assimilated though wouldn't mind me in 7-9 just to say hi miranda thinks we're nothing but children oh she doesn't care for us no she's long lost all her humans i must destroy her i would also like to destroy her i don't give a about your family drama what are you doing are they mining i'm just gonna what's going on bye guys you keep mining keep mr heisenberg happy what is this place looking like doom again looking a lot like doom the giant spinning fan of doom up there hello you've got a jet pack give me that give me this open up i'm gonna put some mines down i need to use them come on that did you i'm dead god oh my god if you did like a leaping attack on me yeah i was about to say that'd be devastating excuse me excuse me oh man i thought it was going to get me there kind of done that he's designing with this horrible floor where you just shoot them in the chest what good are they going to be in battle we got dudes hit the center right up we go well that's precarious oh god we've been sucked in my shot ethan's definitely got very stable hands oh my god  that was close only got chopped into a million pieces huh well we can't just jump down there can we there is a pipe very carefully get the ladder that'll take such that green door there i mean that is so rusted that would be really difficult to turn did we make it soon she'll start her ceremony with your rose if that happens it's all over for your kid and for the whole village but don't worry i'll stop it i'll use rose to kill miranda poor papa you're the only one who doesn't see your kids power [Music] take rose i'd like to see you try what is her power we don't know it's not really been explained obviously ethan's a bit weird because he can just stick his arm back on there's more he takes so much punishment as well now what's so special about rose something is like making footstep sounds directly above me there what is that oh my god how am i supposed to fight that look at this i've got nowhere to run what do i do oh there's this weak spot on the back this is crazy oh no no no no no i shouldn't have said that right he's a bit stupid though and he just runs into the wall come on charge me charge me i hate that so much it's like something out of silent hill that it's weird obviously this is resident evil but i feel like this is more silent hill oh god he's just charging around like crazy what the hell it's a flamethrower then i'll try another oh i wasn't paying attention i was looking at my inventory what's the day then ah i'm stuck how did i get out of that one charging up his laser again the police just beamed into that thing can i get the magnum out the wall spain i feel like i should just trapped in there either hello friend where'd you go i was ready he was there the whole time he was just kiting me are we doing like that get behind him oh goodbye goodbye goodbye i exposed around this time terry likes this not very much not at all now stay down we got him big bang yes debated again well propeller face is dead that's good we did not like propeller face not one bit may rest in peace get out of this place that's a boss room if i've ever seen it just reminds me of resident evil 7 what the oh no he's here oh it's magnesium it's an x-men crossover not bad you're a persistent that's so cool i love that but i've got a rebellion so stay out of it all the way at the bottom again fat bastard that's again tank i'm not going all the way up again there's no way i told you to leave it alone ethan you are in the way what do you care chris you killed my wife you son of a you think i killed mia that wasn't her it was miranda what what she's a bio weapon what is that she changed her appearance and pretended to be mia oh she also survived being shot so now i'm here to finish the job  why don't you tell me right away because i knew you would want to be involved and this job is hard enough without civilians getting in the way why huss chris what the hell is going on all right ethan all right i guess i owe you an explanation yeah you do hand me that wrench i've just been living with miranda the whole time long story short miranda's insane that's obvious in this village all these monsters and freaks this is her life's work some sort of crazy experiment with the mold knew it was the mold like louisiana god damn it all this time i thought i could save my family i can't escape from here i can't do anything that might not be true take a look at this my men sent those pictures a few minutes ago miranda keep looking what you up to rose holy we gotta go relax my men are monitoring the situation but they have my daughter you don't get anything you don't stand a chance against miranda by yourself holy crap i will stay down here and finish planting explosives you take that elevator i'll meet you topside i promise you we will get your daughter back together damn straight we will and when i find miranda she's a dead woman all right ethan and you take this and do me a favor try to stay under the radar it's a tank with a rocket launcher chainsaw on it that's so cool we're gonna get to ride that i hope so all right then let's test this baby out start her up yes metal polymer composite huh time to fight fire with fire so he can't use his magnetism on it i think that's what that means already cannon fire cannon god machine gun oh my god so we've got a quick little practice there this thing is awesome it takes ages to reload that camera eisenberg i'm coming you're like a god damn cockroach you think you could take me on i definitely can't i know i can't this'll be my warm up before i kill that oh my god that's so awesome uh-oh can you hit the wingspot while it's doing that yeah i know your game reload it mate i missed oh i see that gap give me a shot right in the next oh god what should i use a big magnum explosive surely one left too bad hey i don't think ethan hasn't even come on where's the weak spot oh man this is insane i do see fleshy bits now he's moving really slowly you really should have taken my deal is this can't be the end for me i must goodbye heisenberg i preferred you as
