hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome back to battlefield one today we are playing on sinai desert the round has just begun and as we can see already we've got some big boy planes coming over to attack us i'm using the given 98 sniper here oh he's going down bang i just fancied getting up in the mountains perhaps taking a few long range sniper shots we will see we've got another dog fighter get him son get him nice he's gone down oh he's trapped get out of there buddy take an objective button ruined [Laughter] i'm looking forward to this not playing in a while i'm gonna put a cable in this why not hey no way one bullet 1k bullet plus was there some patch notes that you didn't tell me about did you buff the game bullets what just happened oh so cool and the best thing about sinai is that people just love to go prone in the desert like that it's never a good idea there's a boy on a bike over there me tank look at this mad lad leave him i mean it's such a cinematic game this isn't it see i don't know why they do it there's an armored truck there put cable in got the guy anyway i thought i saw someone on the radar back here initially i didn't really enjoy this map because if you remember this was the base amount for the game another bomber here but they did change it a bit right between beta and launch oh this dude's going down as well look at the bodies see if my war zone practice is paid off assistance kill i'll take it there's another bikey boy what i don't know why i find those so funny yeah i don't know what it is trying to take e you see anyone oh there's someone on the cannon there you can shoot through that but that's quite a difficult shot see you're creeping over there someone else got him and when you play this game it's like you're playing the trailer that's how it feels to me at times it's almost like it's scripted but it's not and watch out for the horses as well and the bombers of course yeah it's it's a moro mess luckily big daddy his dad is here to revive me don't understand that name but thank you for the res give me a taste of the cannon didn't even hit them try again that's a lot of grenades we have lost objective butter dead look at this it's like a well i mean it's like a full-on trailer this is you could just record people playing this map i don't know record every pob for like five matches with 64 players and you'd have yourself a trailer obviously you'd have to cut it and put some nice music in but maybe that's what they do don't sit still that one's sword over the head oh it looks like we're pushing over there i'd love to kill another plane this round what is happening what is happening and now look at this give me that gun that's my gas mask is that lee enfield right is my only cover a motorbike in the middle of the desert oh god artillery truck just ruined me i'm losing a i'm trying to spawn on this dude oh right in the face what is that i thought that might have been artillery then there's someone firing uh a gunner there's someone on the mini map here too we oh hi careful enemy soldier that's the one that got away was always one of my favorite snipers in the game along with the ross mark 3 given high fives really good as well hi train goodbye train can't really do much there but there are some people back here trying to take b so we can put this peacekeeper to good use here one excuse me 80 rocket guns i'm getting revenge on that guy [Applause] they're all there still oh they needed me can't throw him back in this game there's one there's two there's three anyone else no watch out for the mines vehicle what did i say i said watch out for the mines and you've driven over them anyway and set me ablaze why are you like this i'm getting a bit mirror's edge here all right dead love those animations man it's such a good job with that she wasn't enemy downstairs [Music] i'll get the other one okay oh well because a plane has flown into the building and destroyed it pretty standard let's see if i can get a d i've not really been on that point yet we have taken objective apples you get the other one just about can't really jump through the windows can you train's coming back shut the back now at least we're burning this flag here where was that guy this dude has got my number and if i could hit them through that they're rushing this makes me feel like move over russell on that thing rest in peace more gear solid i'll try and get another one no promises all right train's gone i have to worry about that anymore get a melee get that meat cleaver out for halloween who shot me then pushed oh we got sniped oh that was a nice run we have lost objective duff you're taking d back already don't look at it get off that cannon just see the arm there thread the needle beautiful every time guaranteed it's an assault player just missed the brand's nearly over can i get one more kill just gotta be patient you just got to wait for that headshot and there it is bf1 i'll tell you what though this game is cracking isn't it it's a ton of fun there's just nothing else like battlefield still brilliant anyways i hope you enjoyed that guys let me know your
