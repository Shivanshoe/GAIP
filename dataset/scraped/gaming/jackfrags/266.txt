what i'm about to read you is pretty crazy and i think that this could be step one in what raven software were talking about when they said that they've been listening and working on anti-cheat measures behind the scenes so this article was doing the rounds on twitter earlier and i had to read through it and it's just crazy the kind of stuff that she is doing the lens that they will go to so this is an article on vice and it goes as follows sellers who market hacked accounts for call of duty warzone are running out of stock suggesting new security measures are hampering this black market warzone is one of the most popular online battle royale games with around 100 million players according to activision the game is free but players can buy or earn upgrades by reaching certain goals or beating challenges which give them custom and rare weapons or skins this has created an underground market where hackers take over players accounts that have valuable upgrades and resell them some of these hacked accounts can cost as much as 300 according to listings in discord channels viewed by motherboard for accounts with unlocked damascus the hardest to obtain weapon skin in the game the price can be as high as two thousand dollars that's just absolutely mental but thanks to beefed up security hackers are having a hard time getting new accounts and there's a quote here since accounts are in short supply due to security measures changing we'll now be offering a variety of unlocked services in short we can help you unlock pretty much anything in modern warfare cold war read an announcement in one of the discord channels i wish i got any good news so far none the call of duty market is pretty much screwed in terms of lobbies and accounts one of the channels admins wrote a listing published by an established seller and admin in another channel showed that it was out of stock and in that channel a user asked when aged accounts meaning accounts that weren't just freshly created and so may come with additional upgrades unlocked and potentially be useful for cheating with less chance of detection were getting restocked never responded another user so that means perhaps an older account that looks a bit more genuine maybe it's got some legacy skins on it like the rose skin for example skins that you can't get anymore they're valuable accounts they are gone said another user why are aged accounts so expensive now asked another and the answer is that activision has been implementing new security features to strangle this underground market according to a games industry source with knowledge of anti-cheat technology who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak to the press the company has implemented a capture system that slows down the automated tools that the hackers use to brute force accounts using public lists of previously hacked passwords moreover as the biggest sellers have dozens of accounts activision is able to track and identify those stocks and account farms and ban them all the source said the price of cheating has been going up you have to buy accounts buy more expensive cheat and buy a spoofer these days they added while the stock of hacked accounts may be drying up a bit the selling won't stop as the industry insider put it there are dedicated websites for hacked accounts as well as sellers on ebay activision did not respond to a request for comments and this is really interesting because i've never seen anything like this before and last week you know i talked about in that video how on some cheating forums some people were complaining that their id spoofers didn't work anymore and when you read an article like this you can start to string things together and think okay well maybe activision raven have actually started to step up security measures and this could just be the beginning of it i think this is really interesting yeah obviously you're never gonna completely eradicate cheetahs in a free-to-play game in a call of duty game nonetheless that's the most popular first-person shooter right now in the world the amount of players it has it's call of duty it's like the coca-cola of video games there's always going to be cheers but it's safe to say that more could have been done from the get-go definitely the amount of cheese that i've personally experienced in this game others have experienced people talk about it all the time it's a thing but it looks like maybe at last they are actually beefing things up trying to do different things and putting some pressure here which i think is brilliant and i hope that they continue to do this and go harder on it even further and with the new card game coming up there's an event tomorrow which we're about to talk about in warzone i'd guess that they want to make sure that the topic of conversation isn't just there's a lot of cheers they want people to focus on the new content so that's that really interesting if you've got any insight into this let me know down in the comments below and the second thing is we've just had a load of information about an in-game event tomorrow that will reveal call of duty vanguard so if you jump into the map right now and you go into the tunnel here you'll see that the train has crashed it's no longer moving it's crashed there it's done really interesting location there's not much here no easter eggs or anything but that's something new loadout drops have also changed and now they've got this propaganda style rapping on them now we know for sure the new game is world war two and the event tomorrow then so this is going to revolve around an armored train and it's going to be a pve event where you can squad up with three other people they posted an article here on the website with a ton of information in so we're gonna just take a quick look at that now in hours from now the biggest battle for dance has ever seen will take place no matter your country no matter your division no matter who you are and what you bring to the war zone we want you your target is a heavily armored train a moving fortress with multiple lethal turrets but we've identified weak points your primary objectives are to plant tnt charges in the tunnel by the dance hospital where we know it will pass through according to the latest intel if all goes well the mountain crumbles with that monstrosity still in it worst case scenario we're sending you in with rifles and launchers for a reason soldier until today you fought against each other nato against warsaw pact coalition against allegiance now with this new threat we're all one squad for this mission rather yourself and the three strongest members of your strike team for this operation it's the first of its kind as we all need to work in tandem to scratch that death machine off the map if we get the job done well during the battle of the dansk rest assured you and the squad will be rewarded for your efforts custom firepower and plenty of special keepsakes are up for grabs including some for being a part of this massive mission i imagine that'll just be a couple of weapon skins calling cards maybe a charm or something but of course those who do significant damage to this enemy and rendezvous to the x4 point in time will get some additional rewards that will make them stand out from the green horns in our ranks another important order and this is really useful i'm glad that they said this nobody should go into battle cold all normal operations will continue in war zone until 10 30 am pt on the 19th of august when the battle begins at 6 30 pm bst uk time not only do we recommend your attendance we encourage it in between 9 30 and 10 30 hours pt all operators will receive double player xp double weapon xp and double battle pass xp by playing warzone hq was also provided the following intel although this may pertain to the operator behind the screen rather than the one in the field there will be a playlist update at approximately 10 30 am pt do not quit out of warzone if you're playing prior to this update as it will happen in real time and not require a relaunch of the game just keep checking the play tab for a live update that will bring about the start of the battle awesome that they've said that so you won't need to restart your game or anything like that it should just auto update but i would make sure that if you want to be involved in this event log into the game at least an hour before maybe even two because there's going to be a load of queues there's going to be servers overloaded it will hit capacity so get in early make sure you don't miss it and that's about all for now guys i'm going to be live streaming the event tomorrow on youtube so make sure you tune in for that notifications turned on if you don't want to miss that let me know your thoughts below if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in
