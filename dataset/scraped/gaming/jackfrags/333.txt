guys and girls it is nearly time look at this the official battlefield twitter account just tweeted a little video of battlefield june 9th 7 am pdt 4 p.m cest that's when the reveal is going down and this is a brand new asset i've never seen this before the font has typically stayed the same but we've got a new light blue color scheme going on here and just the general glitchiness and style of this video it reminds me a lot of the f3 and bf4 and also the audio listen to this for a second again i don't recognize that audio track i feel like this is something brand new that's been made specifically for this game or this trailer and if it has that to sound like a modern piece of music a modern theme so it's even more likely now that the new battlefield game will be a modern game and just the general vibe of this teaser it does feel modern slightly futuristic perhaps i've gone through this frame by frame and i can't see any obvious hidden messages or anything like that i know sometimes with these marketing videos they do like to hide stuff in there maybe i missed something the only thing that i could kind of make out and i do think it's reaching a bit if you pause the video here you could say that this shape kind of looks like a soldier wearing a modern helmet with night vision goggles kneeling down and then you got the gun sticking out there could be completely coincidental but you never know i've seen people do stuff like that before some people have suggested that the new game is just called battlefield and we've talked about this in the past how that could be an option for the franchise going forward if they start with a live service model a bit of a soft reboot of the franchise i think that would be fine but i do see some issues with that in the fact that what game comes next is it battlefield 2 well we've already had that but that didn't stop call of duty calling another game modern warfare when they did their reboot so it could just be that it's called battlefield but i'd expect some kind of subtitle or number it could be battlefield 6 it could be battlefield and a year like they've done in the past we'll have to wait and see as you can probably tell this is quite a short video but i just had to share this with you guys i know some people don't use social media june 9th that's when the reveal is going down not long to go at all now the 9th of june we've only got 8 days to wait it's not far away at all and i'm incredibly excited about this as you can probably tell let me know your thoughts down in the comments below based on this video what are you feeling like the vibe of the game's gonna be if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
