whilst i'm having a great time with warzone caldera on pc i've been told in my comments that it runs terribly on console so in the future i will have a look at that see for myself and check out exactly what's going on there whilst i haven't been playing warzone as much as i did when the game first came out of course it's a nice change of pace to come back to this game with a new map and get my competitive sweat on for a few hours warzone is still a great social experience too where you can kick back and chat about the current goings-on with some mates in the downtime and today i've got a nice chill game for you some great girls in here with geeky and name but i've played with a couple times before also i wanted to say that i'm planning on bringing back more educational content to my channel tips and tricks for warzone and other fps games like battlefield that kind of thing i used to do a lot of that in the early years but i phased it out as i didn't feel like it was just entertaining to watch and people just knew it all now but i'm very wrong over the last two years sitting back and observing comments and reactions i think there's a lot of new or inexperienced fps gamers out there who could really benefit from those kinds of videos there's just so much misinformation nowadays as well additionally the amount of nonsense that i read online about cheating when it's just good gameplay or basic game sense has exponentially increased recently so sometimes a bit of common sense sharing knowledge techniques etc can help with that too so if you're into that look out for that coming soon with that said we're going to get into the action now huge thanks to everyone using my code jack frags and caps in the cod store if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you're new around here do consider subscribing below let's get it are those guys still over there on the roof anymore oh they're running away the hell one down hey el nino you just gonna stand there and take it okay remember me there's one more there go chase some bitter film company [Music] really i killed two of them there's just one left over there somewhere oh god what's in front of us i can't see there's all sorts of invisible stuff that you get stuck on this map it's like i think it was a pineapple yeah what's this vehicle dude got him nice yeah that's the guy i'm just gonna go and get some stuff this anti-tank rifle is nuts i've not really used it before oh the yeah it's so good why does it sound like a tiny toy gun but it kills instantly oh yeah when it's got suppressed on it if you don't have a suppressor on it it's pretty beefy sounding where are we going by the way should we go do recon you're the captain i'm not you are captain tom you're the captain now what's a scarier thing for someone to say if they were like hijacking your boat to say like i'm the captain now or to just come to you being a random passenger and say you're the captain now let's deal with it um there's one of those supply drop things on the left yeah that means there's a team because it just disappeared right here should we get out of here draw i don't see anyone it should be 150 somewhere how close was it tom uh quite close i think like before the road i didn't see it it's good it's good that loadout was quite far away from us yeah yeah we had one that was like one of the supply drop things where oh it was a kilometer away well they're top of the hill somewhere yes didn't actually see them they shouldn't me or you now they hit me a little bit they're stunning so one jump down towards you that's when i marked that one's coming down now we're going to try and get out of here i'm in a bad spot when cheeky [Applause] these cracks yeah stunning one down there's one running at the top i'm gonna res name did you cover yep you need to play it stone i'm gonna shake and [Music] [Applause] [Applause] messy get the execution [Music] i've got this terrible stg world here what is this we're good to come back check yeah why not you've got all of the money you're so rich they have their loadouts as well good air strike though son you got served there us i'm pretty sure he killed me but sure and i was able to kill him danger close get to the new safe zone gas is what's with all these planes in the sky yeah that's i've only noticed that today occasionally they do a bombing run on you where one bomb drops near you that sucks it's kind of annoying because you can see where people like people can see where you are because the bomb drops like directly on you i don't know what i'm going to do with this i just like carrying it what was it about the canister i still haven't killed anyone with one yet i've got one kill with it there's someone in front of you [Applause] somewhere there to someone are you moving here yeah this build is not good [Applause] he's dead i didn't get to use my canister have you killed anyone with one yet yeah i've got one person played a solo match nice completely accidental though if we get into the final zone it's a three versus one we should all pick one up i'll pick one up run at the guy and i'll die yeah and suicide grunt just run the respawn on the right uav active all right there is a mine down i see someone down there him it's another one closer i cannot get used to these vanguard snipers at all [Music] bombing run see yeah so that's the thing where that'll be one shot there's someone at the top here i think is there or was that just a plane attack i saw some muzzle flash here i mean we're central here so there's going to be someone in one of these buildings on there still down there just shot me thanks there's a jeep on the left break his armor you want to thanks where's that shot even going so confused bricks armor again and it took me about 10 shots [Applause] a wiggly one is that a bombing run on the left or cluster strike where is that yes bombing run that means there's someone in our building oh good that's interesting yeah he's enough to saw him all didn't even get an angle there okay that was weird he died after someone oh on the rock yeah there's a different spot there myself that one's in the house now [Applause] did you kill him nope there's one just waiting in the house in the back of the house focus on them nice walter you know on pc so what easy who knows we're good come on i'm gonna take that i've got an ammo box if anyone needs it still got one as well if you want i'm just full-on am i not really in a bad spot here that was weird that guy died after he downed me for my headshot the house just arm went up oh there's someone else no is that guy though yourself name he's moving son he's moving here on the left i'm gonna [Music] there's another one over here
