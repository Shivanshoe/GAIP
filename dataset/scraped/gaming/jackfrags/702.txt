hi everyone hope you're doing well today we've actually just had an announcement about the future of battlefield 5 obviously as a Live service title a lot of people were wondering okay is this it for the game what's coming next and I have to say that after reading this post and seeing replies to people on Twitter from the official battlefield account after a small update in summer that is it for Battlefield 5 it will receive no more big content drops no new chapters for all intents and purposes after this update in the summer it will remain the same forever so let's dig into it now what's coming after Battlefield 5 chapter 6 as you are aware the current battlefield 5 chapter into the jungle wraps up on April 29th that's in seven days as we look to the future we will release one more standalone update this summer that brings with it new content weapons and game tweaks one more standalone update we are targeting June for this update was still tackling the challenges from working from home and we'll let you know how things progress for us over the next month and I assume that this update is this map whatever map this is I don't recognize that but that looks like new assets to me so some kind of desert map set in North Africa perhaps and then it goes into a brief overview of what's coming a new update will be released this summer it's a bit vague yes but the fact that the picture of the maps there probably means that we're going to get a new map and the language here I think is really important because I think this is where the finality of it all starts to creep in following the summer update you'll receive battlefield currency or company coin as weekly rewards giving you a chance to unlock gear you may have missed so they're not saying following the summer update there will be more big update drops or more Maps or whatever it's just we're going to get company corners weekly rewards events and activities we're also applying various weekly initiatives such as the reintroduction of Friday night battlefield servers where the community can play battlefield 5 in a friendly atmosphere throwing back Thursdays where we'll be looking to bring you together across all our battlefield titles are in the works too and then I think this is probably a welcome thing we are continuing our work on the community game updates we are committed to bringing these we'll keep you updated on when you can expect them to start coming online so I assumed that we may get more features in the community games dice showed a lot more features than what were actually delivered so hopefully they can bring those to the table as the battle rages on for you and your squadmates old and new will continue to PT fo with you for a long time and then there's actually a bit about anti cheat this is the first kind of acknowledgment or communication I've seen from dice MEA in an official sense about cheaters because there are a lot in the game right now and they said that I work against cheating in battlefield 5 we'll continue to the members of our anti cheat team are working daily towards making the battlefield experience as free of foul play as possible and this is just the PC issue let's be honest but discussing technical detail into our methods may unfortunately make cheating worse but we want you to know that we're constantly fighting the battle as a reminder there are steps you can take to help us keep the fight fair you can report suspected cheaters through the origin overlay if you're playing on PC or through your respective consoles if you're playing on Xbox one or Playstation 4 and then it wraps up with thank you all for joining this journey and we look forward to sharing more with you this summer having a community of your caliber is a true privilege in the meantime we'll see you on the battlefield Brian McArthur senior producer and that is it so I thought that the language there does feel pretty final anyway but that's all filled have actually replied to a few people on Twitter already asking is there any more big updates after this like a chapter 7 chapter 8 is the eastern front anything in Russia US versus Germany more Pacific and I think this reply to a tweet from FinFET seals the deal I don't think there will be any more content for battlefield 5 after this summer update so if in fact asked is this confirming chapter 7 will be the last major chapter slash update and battlefield actually replied to FinFET and said there will be no new chapter but there will be a standalone update this summer with new content weapons and game tweaks so it looks like that's it that's all we're going to get for battlefield 5 and that thread continued and someone called Connor asked I hope that I understand this right so you say that the game won't be expanded at all after summer the game will receive no new Maps weapons factions after that battlefield replied again correct and we'll have more details about what's included in the summer update closer to that time another one here we are continuing with new weekly missions and new rewards and our update this summer will deliver new content to support that we otherwise have no further content plan beyond our updates to community games and ensuring healthy game performance now some people will be disappointed in this there's no doubt I personally was really looking forward to perhaps the u.s. vs. Germany Russia vs. Germany maybe even more Pacific but it feels like that may be dice and EA are done with the game now and they'll most likely turn their full attention over to whatever is next for the Battlefield franchise in my opinion though however sad it is that there won't be any more content for bf5 I think it's the right decision I'm not privy to any information about player base or number of sales for the game but from my perspective as someone who lives and breathes the gaming industry I'm always online looking at information looking on to news websites reading content watching youtube videos live streams just the general hype for Battlefield 5 I feel like it's just gone now that's it and I'm not really enjoying playing the game as much anymore mainly because of the lack of new content it was pitched as a Live service title but I just don't feel like things happened regularly and they didn't make a big enough splash when they did Pacific was the best example of that however it took a year to deliver that and we all know what happened after the success of the Pacific all of that positive sentiment and goodwill within the community just got all washed away with the ttk debacle that should just never have happened in the first place it's definitely been a roller coaster but it looks like after this summer updates that will be it for the game and as I said though I think this is the right move and I'm kind of pleased that they've got plenty of time now to focus on whatever snakes in a previous EA earnings core they said that the next battlefield experience was coming fiscal year 2022 which most likely meant October 2021 so you assume that dice have already been working on that game for a while I feel like production on Star Wars Battlefront 2 was definitely slowed down as well so maybe there's a huge push and all the attention is on that next battlefield title and I think can only be a good thing I assume that there could potentially be a delay now with everything that's happened from Co vid so maybe it might be the end of 2022 before we see the next battlefield game which of course is way more time for the developers to put whatever is next together I am kind of sad though about battlefield 5 because I think it could have been so much more but it was obvious that it was rushed and the content was so light on it because it takes so long to put together it could have been that updated frostbite engine battlefield 1942 that I imagined in my head with all of the greatest hits of world war ii but it just looks like dice didn't have enough time to make that and the direction of the game really wasn't what fans of the series were expecting or longing for they went for untold and unknown instead of the classics the gamers who have been playing world war ii games expect but there are some gameplay mechanics of beer fired that I think are fantastic I mean the gunplay for me is still some of the best in the Battlefield franchise definitely more enjoyable than battlefield warning terms of the shooting mechanics and I hope that that's an element of battlefield 5 that they continue into future titles and I really hope the dice have learnt a lot too from how they delivered the live service in battlefield 5 I think it was their first time doing a live service the games industry is changing it's changed so much over the past what like two years or so most of the multiplayer FPS games that are popular are now in this live service model perhaps because of the size of the maps in battlefield and the scope of the game they just weren't prepared to keep on delivering regular content at a high standard and they can definitely learn from that and build on it for the future I'm sure it's a sad day for a lot of fans who regularly play battlefield 5 on a daily basis and we may be hoping that something big and something more was coming for the game yes it's disappointing and I'm also sure that it's sad for a lot of the developers who perhaps were working on big future content drops for this game and now have to just scrap all that and focus on different things whatever's next no doubt this is a big sacrifice and the potential of battlefield 5 was not truly met but perhaps this is the worst it can get and all of the attention now is on that next Battlefield game and fingers crossed this sacrifice is enough to make that an absolute gem if I was in charge the next game would be multiplayer only modern day bring back all of those sandbox elements that have been lost along the way that's it for today I just wanted to keep you guys up to speed if you don't follow the social media accounts and what not how do you feel about this disappointed happy nonplussed let me know down in the comments below with that said thank you all for watching leave a like if you enjoyed the video dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music]
