on hope you're doing well and welcome to more Call of Duty war zone today we're gonna be playing quads for player squads and I'm joined by broker machine Westy and study so it should be really good fun this is a strong battlefield squad I would say all four of us are really big fans of the Battlefield franchise but we've never really played as a squad together I've played with Westie and study before but now we've got broken machine in it should be good fun you know we're all big battlefield players let's see how well it translates to a game of cod war zone and what's really cool as well I think broken is actually playing on the ps4 so I just think it's kind of neat that you know it's 2020 and you can have three PC players and one yes four player all together cross-platform playing with each other and against other cross platforms too so I'm looking forward to it with that said we are good to go I'm going to unmute discord I hope you guys enjoy this and let's get into it hello a lot from destruct maybe destruction yes hello let's queue it up let's see how what's going on with these these lovely console over here we go well I'd be interested to see in the list of players if it does actually give us more console players or a mix oh yeah or just exactly is that oh I saw a light do you see there I saw a lot of console there so did I I saw a lot I suppose bit of a mix eh maybe I guess we will get different parts of the list there yeah there's no way to see it other than now all that in that brief moment is there yeah that's the only time I wonder why cuz I'm sure that be in the past you could see the whole Lobby yeah they stopped that because people realize exactly what we're testing right now talking about in the tournament's the people that would have the most wins would be the controller players also love me supposedly right players you can see that they would all be console and then the PC players were playing against basically all PC players at their own oh this'll be well here's the other thing broken is we can also test whether using a controller and PC does the same thing whether it has the same base because I know because it probably must be a bit rough going from you know 100 FPS and nice higher for BT you know it's been playing through a wing mirror a wingman I don't think it's that bad what console do you play on well uh wing mirror wing there who makes that later afford schools a wing mirror Pro all the lack well I'm ready I'm ready for this first game right top black pipe we're gonna do this we're gonna get this okay can we get the win the first game I don't know maybe only it's easier for me hey well I brought like a hundred to five I think yeah I'm in like a hundred so I've got what 20% more peripheral vision I guess hmm well that's a quarry there that's all for Amin oh yeah as a quarter lion let's gain first wedding that's what they say no I don't mean to jump in it's a quarter go for it yeah thank you for tuning in everyone if you're watching live if you're watching as a vaad thank you very much as well I've got a couple new members as well Christopher Sparhawk thank you and Ryan and also a donation from Nash that's very kind you -

two people dropping down I've got no range unfortunately good position where you guys are now to see if you can get oh they're still in that tower jack are they you know we can try and sneak around

doing good thanks do I ever use the foul or the kilo I've tried using the foul Tyler but I just can't I can't get used to it I know it does really high damage but I think in this in this game in warzone you you want automatic especially when you're playing squads or trios foul might be all right in solos I've never really tried in solos maybe I should give it a shot David Williams thank you

you've been here for seven years thanks hip-hop broke and that guy you shot out like me to life things they're miles away now 200 metres away those written down build in there yeah karma Mexico sorry go fizzle canals on the wall and then we've got yourself into a sniper by the looks of it it's may has to come by now we could totally rush that I'm hit one down so what'd you get these are the guys that flanked us by the way there is the guys that flanked us in the car in the car I go Claymore on the door in case they go meet two more on blue marker the same guys for you say okay we should probably start moving now I guess yeah I said I've only got the snipers are need maybe Gary superstore I'll be mmm they got in that car and drive away didn't they so hopefully there's no one there's a growl there Jack thank you on the ground yeah I need anything I know stocked ground okay it is a little teddy bear on it nude plaits just saw them on blue like just in front of this here there's one in mug there but it's the team that was taking it there brunt there they've run this way there's another team that's gone to that by over on the right-hand side on that on re almost door on this door yeah he's probably gonna get to the top of the building and then jump off oh it's a lot all I got that watching me they're watching me from the door this is gonna be interesting I've got a precision air strike once I get to the roof this is the people in the other building minders - yeah they were looking right at us just so you guys know I can't use the nest right the bugs no I think it may be Oh bro karma anything god damn it so we just move off left yeah and avoid these guys hammer in that door are they're everywhere they're looking right at you mm-hmm pressures on boys that was close and one no no there we might go have a gun reload him can't see him okay LM a sniper one down a blue can't see him can't get the angle from here start yeah you're on your own in the mine [Applause] he was gonna buy accessorize one of the repair fee fi a Parisian designer there Mike there's one in the tower of fire station Mike blue Micah just want to see if there was a grenade launcher Oh nuts just smash the window fire station think you dropped down Misun yeah we're gonna have to they just respawned goddamn and we've got some spare sniper I could Rob yep there you go thank you across they were a rather large area yeah this sucks did we go part do we get far laughs oh that boys on purple okay gas is coming yeah we have to go so bad we're gonna get sniped in the back from the right I can feel it yeah absolutely can't say I'm surprised faster fireteam as I'm sure this yet found one of them hey you've got been around I have that's why you think this area needs more covert across yeah yeah yeah they need a house in the middle of the runway that would make sense no just loads of broken-down vehicles all over it easier smashed plane you say there's one purple mm-hmm I think one now I'm a hit Coffee mist I'm a hit I'm a break whatever more you guys that's amazing yep where are these shots going oh my god really low here a single shot we could have most of them if we knows there's two left now yeah they're in this compound bit well done call that was insane who had to run out across in the open they have no choice was going back yeah behind that concrete found in the armor no ice we have like an air strike running man no unfortunately not we have to move yeah we've got to give them a little bit circle we should go to the buildings right yeah we should probably go buildings there's an air strike on them [Music] no one's got UAV or anything no not yet is there a by near us not online in the circle Oh God say I mean they've got a lot of cover if we start shooting though you're gonna attract attention there's definitely people in these buildings yeah yeah oh behind sounds like my blue let's do a team on blue by the way it's team or purple downed one stirred off this truck you like I just came in he found the guys just gonna run the truck over us yeah blue there's still guys on the road okay over there all purple I don't know where they've gone on the edge running

broken it what is with this sniper right here it's not my own sniper I feel like it's like yeah that's fine I think just keeping an eye out on the on the left those are the guys that killed me all they've got the bike a blue moon like a blue marker in the window in the window doesn't windows I'm a broke or smashed otherwise three full van team's full man twos down another in the window on orange want to get a bit closer maybe to move on these buildings there at the end on the balcony here on the edge of the building phones moving guys we should okay for now yeah where's the rest where's the other four-man team oh hey team are there fighting inside the building inside the motor guys I blew both teams a fine pushing a little pushing up a little bit I'm just gonna chill back here a sec they might have RPGs who's just smile on the ground Falcon II hit down on the balcony down on the balcony nice nice nice nice I think they might have RPGs so I would stay a little bit passive in this one they have to come out they have to be completely open if we don't really focus yeah yeah we if we really set up they'll be screws how'd you get there oh how are the nine people left best thing in the world must all be inside of the building not to sight though on the stairs or missed him they've got a push-out in the window upstairs Elam - Mike - left - where are they yeah

played yeah Gigi Oh maaan [Music] considering that I didn't have my loadout and I don't think some of the others did either that was pretty good how does he say that's like another crazy game like this stream this video is gonna be lit it was it was a nice comeback Michael Starr yeah that was a lot of fun the team worked though good communication from everyone maybe I was just like not leading my shots enough for something because I'm used to my custom HDR which is basically hitscan I should be leaning a bit more maybe I don't know whatever other one Darkseid you said you would donate if we won great game lads Darkseid thank you it's your loadout dammit sorry can I show you from this screen an icon it's um let me just think it's monolithic suppressor it's the pro the 26 inch pro barrel

around me peak sorcerer Hernandez thank you for the seal why do you prefer the HDR over the x-15 HDR has a faster bullet it's a bit it's a bit easier to hit with it when you've got it like a custom load out so yeah it's it's just easier to hit targets they're both will knock someone with a headshot there's full armor I think so the only advantage that x50 has as far as I know is it has a faster rate of fire like it cycles the bullet faster hello from Houston Texas what's up map [Music] directly on Green Martin there was a still alive maybe more maybe more yeah it was car 98 or pistol for me

cardio up in times like this haven't exercised for about five weeks as soon as they shut the gym I was like oh no I can't work out what a shame Jim what I've not heard that word before it's a gymnasium what do you do there you go look socially awkward whilst everyone else looks way fitter than you do people watch and judge them before you even know humans that heard there's like a watering hole fern watch we go want to get fit okay that's a great place to catch a virus full squad full squad full squad I see msn oh they got high advantage on as each night whoa you know boredom that's where they like pick heavy things up and then put them back down yeah the gym yeah then it makes it like a little bit but apparently that's a good thing hmm it hurts yeah it hurts but apparently that's a good thing well can have you heard of this place before team on the bar and press like he is between me and you right now he's between me and you look L is this founded we get this bouncer yeah well it did stronger so corrupt it was anyway yeah he's inside well this containers behind me on the guy in the buildings I need to get rest immediately of them dead I think he's from there from the purple market towards bubble market somewhere oh no I asked him you do him there over the building and they peek those windows no he's in the window no he's not he's just moved which we knew wasn't vegan they were definitely running across that's the only place that conceivably could have gone they could or they could have done the oh nice foreplay line is was a mr.

got any tattoos are you stabbed one but I've got it removed at times that I'd go walk the dog or take him for a longer walk in the moment he's getting like two 40-minute walks a day he's being treated like an absolute champion is he henching like is he like a mostly dog no no no no night oh he still he's still smaller than he's supposed to be like he's I think he weighs about 14 kilos and he should be anywhere from about 15 to 18 I think so he's technically still smaller than it should be but we reckon he's fully grown now she's probably just small Oh so yet to hit someone mid fall even that coat on your side to that zero milliseconds later that's going to be in the tick got to see the tick right okay they are capturing a point over there by the by the bank I've got a bit of cash here we could be buying UAVs and self roses yeah we need to stop really going off here because enemies up here right yeah they've just captured a flag on it's good lager on the no we're here now maybe green

team's running right ass but it's always it's always good to play a risky game round oh you all have to like okay yeah I did survive yeah I killed the guy that goes though he was he was that skilled he killed you with the pistols but he was that stupid that he didn't he didn't finish me off down he didn't finish me off we might get lucky here loadout rocks if there is one we just go here stays are you from last night yeah basically this is when we play that tree that's a sweaty Lobby right there that that was the definition of sweat there that was a sweaty low if they're fun to be had there

know it's kind of very similar isn't it so I don't know I think 21:42 would be interesting but I don't know if it would appeal to a lot of our field audience I think modern-day would be a much more accessible for most people much more palatable maybe I'm wrong although I'd love to see the Mex again you know like 21:43 was great played that a lot when it was brand new back in the day I was at uni playing it a lot with Tommy ragin bong and Nick when the man thank you for becoming a member you got thank you very much that's a malware what stream quality is this I mean it should look pretty good
