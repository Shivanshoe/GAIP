my that's a life we've got hey we got it but we need to hold it really yeah that was good i'll play yeah but if we can skip up sniper ends there i'm out i'm out come on come on come on come on back towards their spawn artillery revive come on let's go okay i'm coming it doesn't seem right i think it's fine thank you get back inside that i'll get you packed don't worry before you hit the ground there everywhere everywhere he's just there what the hell i didn't even get in there i don't know like is he still across there yeah look get drilled we've got hey there well done we did it oh come on

take the crocodile here's the crocodile okay let me resupply and get it i'll bring the i'll bring in the crocky never smile that a crocodile i remember that weird song maybe that's it oh yeah and done we've lost uh a b and d now gonna be and that's right for our busy benders all visible boys also this machine gun is the worst machine gun ever invented on the next battlefield all i want is to go back to separating anti-tank weapons with a restrictive gun like bf2 you could only have shotguns that was fine damn oh you can have carbines as right no on bf2 no i'll be f2 here and i like that though i like that the empty tank was anti-tank and shotgun so you had a role to play you were close range and anti-tank but on this obviously you just have like the best guns in the game obviously medic technically is the best infantry class is that he's fine now i'm just just getting that look my bong is into the knot it didn't work they went the other side of the road to e check are we losing a let's go get money oh yeah i don't want to lose again two on my body enemies still here five guys burgers surprised here at the corner i'm dead that's close what d or even d d um oh yeah i'm trying to get around the back of them there's all these sector artillery on us here quite a few enemies i'd say it's very fast to rebuild the full coaster yeah what's yeah they doubled it in there many many well some say i've reinforced d you've gotta get one of these points or potatoes all potatoes oh i can hear a tank unfortunately we just lost it now we still got c we've got control we lost every other point though that's what i mean like you have to go for e straight away after this but any chance flying over to e we're losing c though yeah but yeah we're going to bring it back we're good gonna run interference let's see there's a guy on these oh no he's there uh i think he's dead just get everything except the church i think that's probably the best option here yeah they're running today nicely deal they're running to d from the charge let's attack that i've got no spokes left whoa interference there you've got to stay alive now yeah i think it's more important it's on the other side of the hill right you're ready can you get me up get me up at the bottom yeah i'll try it we're losing either we're losing it gotta hold on to e gravity go for e go out to e just hold it let's go get on the point goblin run goblin goblin got him got him who's the only one come on come on don't respawn very spawning i'm gonna lose either one ticket one ticket come on bleed it there we go we got it we beat the level 500 clan look at that 500 385 gg that was very close
