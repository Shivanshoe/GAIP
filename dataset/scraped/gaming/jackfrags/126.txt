hi guys hope you're all doing well just this minute we've got an update on the future of battlefield 2042 and this was posted on the battlefield website along with the twitter account and all the various forms of communication so we're going to take a look at it now battlefield briefing the journey to season one and there's some really big things in here that will have huge implications you've waited patiently to hear from us on what we're doing to address the issues with battlefield 2042 that you have told us about and the direction that you can expect us to see take in the months ahead today we're stating our team's commitment to bring the game up to the highest standards that we all hold for the franchise we have heard you so we are heavily invested and committed to the future of battlefield 2042 working on taking action on multiple fronts to address feedback and implement extensive fixes to the game key features that are important to you and getting team play where it needs to be we've had to make some big decisions to ensure that our next set of updates can be focused on delivering these improvements with the most substantial one being to move the release date of our first season to early summer that is a huge deal most people thought that this was going to be maybe march but early summer for season one does that mean june no commitment here but i guess june july for that this decision gives us the time to focus on improving the battlefield 2042 experience while finalizing the development of our seasonal content to ensure that it all reaches our standard for quality so it seems like there's a big delay there for season one upcoming updates here's a snapshot of the features that we're bringing into the game as soon as possible scoreboard in our next update we'll be adding a refreshed in-round scoreboard alongside further changes we've worked on since the holidays this will be an ongoing evolution from what was shown in the work in progress that we shared recently you guys remember that scoreboard that they showed definitely was missing a few features on there we've heard your feedback around including two tables and separating your own team versus the enemy and we're working on incorporating that for the release kill death scoring and end of round reporting will also be coming in a future update okay so that seems like splitting the scoreboard into two adding kd on there and a lot of people wanting to see that all platform voice communication the arrival of voice communication voiceover ip is just the start of the improvements we're bringing to enhance team play and communications obviously that's going to be great for console players and anyone who plays solo player profile giving you a better overview of your career on the battlefield and how far you have to go for your next unlock so being able to see a broad overview of your stats i suppose that is for team player you can expect us to incorporate a clearer tighter squad loop a refined ping system and an improved reward loop for when you and your squad play the objective gunplay will continue to receive feedback based improvements too and then there's a bit about portal here portal remains an integral part of the game and we will continue to expand its tools modes and tweak player experience games finally we have a team analyzing specialists and working on them we're not quite ready to talk about actions that we'll be taking but as soon as we are you will hear from us obviously no detail there on what they're changing with specialists just analyzing them working on them as i've said previously i don't think specialists will be removed completely i expect that this will be separating them into more harder focused classes where you can only get a certain gadget if you're playing as that particular class of specialist i expect that's what they'll go for because specialists obviously a key part of the narrative the live service monetization in the game so i don't think they're just gonna get rid of them and replace them with classes me personally i feel like that was never on the table and then there's this a new feedback loop we're committed to pushing up the quality of the game both through our updates and how rapidly we will respond to critical issues in the live environment we're also going to clarify the direction that we're taking and what's motivating our decisions to bring improvements to the game so expect to get more insight as we expand our existing feedback loops to involve you our players more directly our team has identified several areas that we're targeting for improvements this is how we'll be incorporating your feedback going forward number one we will present specific major focus areas to you along with our current thinking detailing where we're planning to make changes two we'll then take the time to observe and listen to the conversation that you go on to have about both the area of concern and our proposals for adjustment three later you'll hear from us on the topic again but this time your feedback will have been faxed into our consideration and guided the decisions made for improvements these conversations will be centralized and accessible here on the battlefield website and summarized across our channels so it looks like there'll be a more open dialogue maybe or a feedback form once they present their ideas for changing the game we'll be able to respond to it in some kind of official capacity i suppose i'm not really sure how they're gonna handle that later this month this process will kick off with one of our key focus areas map design we want to outline to you our vision for how we're going to approach and factor into our new maps enhancements to the gameplay experience by addressing feedback on openness and lack of cover in key areas i think that's a really good start because yes the maps are bigger there's 128 players but it's obvious that there are certain parts of the map where there's not much cover not much detail even some of the objective areas aren't that interesting or fun to fight around so it seems like they might be going back to those initial maps here and adjusting them adding geometry changing the way they look i know a lot of people wanted the maps to look a bit more war-torn so perhaps that's a feature with this too big topics like map design will be loud and broadly shared but for more nuanced areas of the game such as portal logic we may have those conversations on smaller scales the important part here is that all these conversations will happen publicly and with everyone invited to take part some of these feedback loops will cover bigger areas than others and some loops will take longer to complete and realize in the game than others that's not an indication of how we might prioritize issues with the game but a reflection on the nature of game development changes to our maps and core gameplay will take time so that isn't coming any time soon then i'd imagine that these changes to the maps will happen before season one though i'd hope so anyway i feel like adjusting the maps could be an easier task and less expensive than making something completely new our commitment is to explain our reasoning behind future decisions and to make sure that you understand where we stand on your feedback we want you to see more of the big picture of where we're going and incorporate more of what we're already hearing to ensure that our work is meaningful to you we'll start this process ahead of the launch of our next update you'll read about it here on our website when we start these conversations and if you're following battlefield across social media you won't miss it when we do and then there's a small topic at the end looking ahead to season one when season one arrives in early summer it will mark the start of a year where we'll deliver four seasons four new specialists and new locations along with more completely new content we know that this release is later than anticipated for many of you who purchased the year one pass as part of our gold and ultimate editions to acknowledge and thank you for your patience and continued support these players will receive an exclusive bundle containing a specialist skin weapon and vehicle skins a melee weapon and player card all to be delivered in the next update and there's a picture of how that stuff's gonna look and that's a skin for mckay looks very different to the current options available kind of interesting reminds me of crisis in a way but it has to be said that a lot of people aren't gonna care about these skins it doesn't really mean anything just handing them out like that and then the blog continues we'll continue to keep you informed of the future updates via battlefield com twitter account you can also follow along our tracking of known issues and game changes that we're able to make in real time on our battlefield forums we are committed to and focused on ensuring bf 2042 lives up to our ambitions and your expectations it's a task that we're dedicated to accomplishing and that's signed off by ryan mcarthur who is the senior producer on behalf of the battlefield team and that is it that's what we got there's a lot of stuff in there i'll leave it up to you guys to digest to make it what you will for me personally i think waiting until early summer for some real new content it's a disappointment but obviously they're taking the time to look at the base game make some changes with the maps the gameplay flow i'm kind of sad we didn't see anything about performance in there but they have mentioned that in the past would have been nice to just get some kind of update on that but there are a ton of concerns from the community with the game of the franchise at the moment so i think that they have made the right call here delaying season one working on the base game but ultimately the proof's in the pudding that is it for now i think because we've received this much earlier in the day i don't think we're gonna get any big updates or news at the ea earnings call later tonight but i will keep my eye on that just in case and if there's anything interesting now make a video keep you guys updated so that's all let me know your thoughts below thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
