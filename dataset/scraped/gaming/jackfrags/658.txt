hi everyone hope you're doing well and enjoying the weekend so far today I've got some battlefield 3 gameplay for you on the brilliant strike at Karkand map now originally this was a map in battlefield 2 if you guys remember that and they did remake it for battlefield 3 here I was just running around earlier today having a great time with the m416 on the assault class just dropping people and have started this a bit later on in the round there's this great section that you're watching now where the only flag that we had left was the hotel the a point on the US team and I was just digging in and trying to hold the Russians back as well as I could always great fun to come back and play this game so if you've been following along with the games media this week you may have noticed a few articles popping up about a potential remaster of battlefield 3 or even the next battlefield title just being a remaster of this game and in this video I wanted to talk about why I think that isn't the case I don't think there will be a remaster of battlefield 3 but instead as I talked about in my Battlefield reboot video I do think that the next game will borrow a lot of elements from battlefield 3 and battlefield 4 of what made those games so fun and enjoyable to play capturing the essence of those games and transplanting it into something new so the idea of a battlefield 3 remaster isn't a new idea it's something that's been floated around in the community for many many years I mean in October 2018 I made a video on the idea of a potential bf3 remaster where they had 4k graphics and they ported it onto this hypothetical new version of the frostbite engine and got it to work well on Xbox one and PlayStation 4 because if you recall bf3 was on the original 360 and PlayStation 3 as well as PC but the consoles back then didn't get the full fat version of the game they got watered-down graphics play accounts Maps game modes whereas the PC got the whole package and the graphics and the performance on PC massively excelled over what was available on those older consoles at the time and that video just talks about how the prospect of a remastered version of the game where maybe they fix a couple of the bugs and update some of the textures and lighting fix a couple of exploits maybe sell it digital only for like 15 dollars or something yet to me and a lot of other battlefield fans who love this game I would say that's quite an exciting prospect and something that a lot of people would enjoy but that's all about video was a prospect an idea something that would be cool but perhaps unlikely to happen and recently with these articles popping up it's sparked that debate again is this actually a real thing well like I said just now I don't think it is and as much as I would love to play a remastered bf3 I don't think it would be a smart business decision for ei or dice right now especially when you consider the we know now that the next battlefield game is due out October November next year and as far as battlefield 3 was and still is when you go back and play it by today's standards there are a lot of things that haven't aged that well with the game like when I was playing it this morning there were so many things so many parts of the map where I was like if only I could vault this this tiny step if only I could hoist myself over this wall and you're running along me you still get stuck on tiny stones and ledges they look like you can just step over them the user interface as well is very simple and elegant but by today's standards it's a bit clunky and difficult to navigate at times the gunplay absolutely fantastic in this game love it to pieces when you go back and play it you can definitely feel that the netcode isn't as sharp or as good as it was in bf4 or bf5 the hitmarkers sometimes feel delayed or as if they've got a bit of input light to them and of course the suppression mechanic was definitely overkill and I think for people who play a lot of modern shooters if you played a game like bf3 where sometimes you're being shot at and your bullets aren't going where the crosshairs pointing that's quite a jarring and weird game mechanic with all things considered I guess the point on trying make is if Feist did make a remaster of this game and just updated the textures the resolution for consoles and the lighting for example perhaps it wouldn't be as well-received and popular as it once was in 2011 and 2012 irregardless of the games mechanics though I think a remaster of bf3 would be expensive to put together in terms of the development costs and also the marketing spend behind the game and would Dyson be a really want to distract from what's coming next year surely they would want all of the focus to be on that and kind of related to that I think you have to put yourselves in the perspective of the developers of these games obviously I can't speak for anyone but myself but when I try to imagine if I was a developer a dice or a producer an artist and animator QA tester whatever it might be I think that I would much prefer to work on something new rather than retreading old steps and old paths that we've already been on a lot of people that work in the games industry are very creative people and working on stuff that's already been done before perhaps wouldn't be as engaging satisfying or fulfilling as a career so I do think in that respect it's more likely that they're working on new stuff and to be honest with you as a fan of the franchise I would prefer that too I would prefer to see something new rather than a remaster of this game I'd prefer to see new mechanics a new updated build of frostbite really flexing what that engine can do from a logistics perspective to dice only have a limited number of employees to work on their projects and they've already come out and said that they've stopped development on battlefield 5 content they've stopped development on further Star Wars Battlefront 2 content to focus on the next battlefield title all guns around in that direction so let's say there is a new battlefield title plus a bf3 remaster assuming that it will be diced making it then that's pulling resources away from the main project the next main battlefield game that they need to be an absolute home run and that's ultimately going to sell a lot more copies make more profit for them and drum up more excitement for the franchise so taking developers away from that main project and putting them on a remaster maybe it doesn't make that much sense and you might say well what about a different EA Studio they could be making this well I've had a look and I can't really think of anyone that would be doing this most people would say well dice Olay will be doing it but in January it was announced the Vince Zampella who co-founded respawn will be heading and coaching the new dice la Studio they're thinking about rebranding and also in an interview with the LA Times he said that they'd be working on an original as yet unrevealed game so dice la doesn't seem to make sense for me okay what about criterion will they worked on firestorm it's just been announced that they're taking over development of the new Need for Speed game that's a massive project Bioware well they're working on the next Dragon Age and remaking anthem and there are a couple of other studios that they have but I just don't see any of them with a lot of FPS experience that it would make sense to handle the development of a hypothetical battlefield 3 remaster and when you put all of that together that I've just spoken about I don't think a bf3 remaster at the moment is the right call and I'd assume that dice and EA would look at everything then come to that conclusion as well however as I mentioned at the start of the video the idea of the next main battlefield title drawing from a game like bf3 a game like bf4 modern combat sandbox gameplay accessibility I think that's much more of a likely scenario as to what we're actually going to get next year and as I stated in that video that I posted last Saturday June 6th I do think that rebooting the franchise at the moment would be a smart move but a remaster of bf3 at the moment as much as I would love to think hours into it and see what's improved and changed it just doesn't work for me right now ultimately though for me personally the biggest reason I don't think there'll be a bf3 remaster this year or next is that the driving force behind it behind the development of the Battlefield franchise is the people that make the games like I mentioned I just think that people want to advanced they don't want to look backwards and just do the same thing again but with shinier graphics evolution is a much more exciting proposition not just for the game developers but also for us the people that buy the games and play them I'd rather get something new and finally I don't think it has to be said but leaks and rumors appear on the internet all the time on message boards on social media and YouTube videos sometimes people write stuff they make stuff because they're bored they just want to have some fun they're trolling whatever it is so until there's some kind of an official announcement take everything that you read and hear and see on the internet with a bucket load of salt because anyone can post whatever they want online be skeptical all the time look at the facts go through the process in your own mind come to your own conclusion with that said let me know your thoughts down in the comments below do you think a bf3 remaster is on the cards this year or next or is the next game just a remake of bf3 I don't think it is I think it's gonna be something new a reboot of the franchise maybe I think it makes sense but we'll have to wait and see thank you for watching the video thank you for your time if you enjoyed the video leave a like it's a great way to help me out if you didn't like it
