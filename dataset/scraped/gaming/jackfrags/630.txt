Far Cry six yesterday we got our first proper look at what the next installment in the Far Cry series will look like and it's safe to say it seems that they're definitely cranking the craziness and production quality up a few levels think renowned actors screenwriters the possible return of us from Far Cry 3 and most importantly dogs on wheels more on that later but in today's video we're going to be taking a look at all of the information released about the game so far some in-game screenshots and what to expect from the gameplay in Far Cry 6 a big thanks to Ubisoft for sponsoring this one and if you want to know more about the game there's a link down in the description below so having a big act to take center stage in a video game is not something new but when I saw that Giancarlo Esposito was going to have a major role in the new Far Cry game you could absolutely understand how he would be the perfect fit for the game's villain Esposito has had big roles in Breaking Bad better call Saul and the mandalorian and that gritty bad guy just seems to suit him in Far Cry 5 the game's main antagonist was Joseph seed and he essentially wanted to see the world burn and you were sent in to stop that from happening I don't think he was quite as memorable as someone like pagan min from Far Cry 4 all of us from Far Cry 3 and the vast comparison could actually be really important as for the setting of the game or Far Cry 6 is set on an island called Yara whose leader is anton castillo played by Esposito and he rules with an iron fist you on the other hand play as Dany Rojas a native who joins up with a guerrilla faction to overthrow the president's control and you can choose to play as male or female while the setting is fictional it very much has a Cuban feel and aesthetic to it you can definitely see where they drew inspiration from there's also one more character that's been revealed and as it turns out it could be the most important one in terms of the overall story and that is Anton son Diego so far we've seen an incredibly well done stylized title sequence for the game with an absolutely banging soundtrack and then another cinematic trailer where anton castillo is trying to teach his son diego a Far Cry games have intended to have children in them before though but in the case of Far Cry six there seems to be a very big focus on the character of Anton and his relationship with his son Diego even to the point where Diego is right there on the cover art and seemingly Anton wants to mold his son to take over his reign when the time is right in fact there will be a dynamic story in the gameplay between all three characters and this time you'll even get a voice you'll get to see your own character in previous Far Cry games even the last one the main antagonist tended to be this overall bad guy who appeared at the start disappeared for the middle then you have to do things and they pop up every now and again just to remind you that they were still there but this time you the character like I said you'll see yourself and it seems that you will interact with the two other main characters here quite a lot the narrative director on this project Navid Guevara has said that the team wanted to ensure that you got a good amount of face time with Anton to be able to see things from his perspective and as such there will be an ongoing dynamic between these three characters your character Danny as I mentioned can be either male or female and this time around you will speak in Far Cry 5 you could choose to play as either male or female but you were simply known as the deputy and you didn't speak so I think it's good to see more of a character this time around and so it will be interesting to see how that changes the dynamic of the story one of the more interesting things though I think with this game is Diego there are a lot of theories floating around the internet right now with some evidence to back them up that Diego is in fact vas when he was younger from Far Cry 3 the idea is that Far Cry 6 is actually a prequel to Far Cry 3 and the actions of the game will turn Diego into the person we met as vas and I wanted to touch on this and why it could be interesting if it was correct and also look at the evidence for both sides right now we don't have an actual time setting for Far Cry 6 just some screenshots the cinematic trailer and the idea that it's a modern setting what exactly covers modern though well that's the question Ubisoft maybe they're being intentionally vague here to stop people connecting the dots now one of the main reasons that people have come up with the vast conclusion though is the scar you look at the cover art for the game you can see a clear scar over the right eye of Diego and some people have said that Vaz has that same skull I do have to say it seems odd that Diego would have a very similar scar to the one that vas has but it does become more believable though when you take into consideration a comment that Michael mando the guy that plays vars made himself on reddit a few months ago and he replied to a comment on Vaz saying the following thank you so much vos is my spirit animal having co-created that character is something that will always be dear to me I still get recognized as buzz and I still feel that outpouring of love for the character it makes me very happy who knows maybe I will reprise the role very soon then he does a little sticky out tongue teasing again that doesn't prove anything but he does kind of look like him doesn't he it would be a what if Diego is in fact vos and the actions of the game lead to him being shaped into the person we know that he turned into perhaps at the end of the game we might jump forward in time and Michael mando will be making appearance as an adult vas once again based on some other evidence though not everything lines up for starters vas has a cannon backstory already which completely goes against this theory he was supposedly born on the rook islands in 1985 and was a member of the rocket not only that but far cry 3 he set in 2012 and Vaz is an adult there yet in the cinematic trailer for far cry 6 we can clearly see a modern cellphone on the table and at this point Diego is still a child so that simply doesn't make sense in terms of the timeline and while I think the idea of having a prequel would be great and I guess we can't rule it out especially if he be soft have thought something clever here but the modern tech in the trailer seems to put a stop to any of the vas theories for me at least unless there's a time machine involved but ok let's not go there maybe Vaz will just turn up as an older character the setting does seem very similar to Far Cry 3 based on the screenshots and what about the island of Yara then what can we expect well Montana from far cry 5 was gorgeous but Yara is aiming to not only give you that classic Far Cry feel when it comes to the vistas and environments but also add nuance into the mix in Yara you're going to find tropical beaches jungles but also the islands main sprawling city something new for farcry of course I wouldn't be far cry without some kind of jungle environment but the idea that there'll be a big city for the first time is really interesting to me not least for the fact of verticality and parkour I mentioned earlier that Yara is heavily inspired by Cuba but what we don't know is exactly what year it's set in the island of Yara it seems is almost frozen in time but Ubisoft gold they say is to make a living postcard with some vintage thrown in and it's implied that Yara has been shut off from the rest of the world for some time so when it comes to the weapons and vehicles you're definitely going to get some unique stuff here during your time in the game you'll get interesting weapons that have been cobbled together from whatever you can muster you're part of the guerrillas and you're fighting against an army that has tanks military vehicles and modern weapons but the stuff you'll be using will be heavily modified and recycled guns with custom scopes rifles that you've stuck together with glue and maybe use parts of cars and exhausts the game is going to have some really unique weapons and I'm all for that one of them even looks like a nail gun in the screenshots the cars there looked to be maybe lots of 80s American convertibles and there's a horse I presume you can ride that to get around the level plains as well in the sky it looks like they'll be making a comeback there is one other animal though that I promised we talked about Torito and this I suppose is a continuation of the fangs for higher systems that's been in a couple of the Far Cry games now chorizo in Far Cry six is a sausage dog with wheels of course his Doritos obviously had some sort of sad accident and therefore it's been equipped with some wheels to keep him moving and in the Box there it looks like there's a couple of scopes and magazines so maybe that's how he will help you during combat delivering supplies cute and lethal I like the combination and you know we'll remember cheeseburger the bear from Far Cry 5 how could we not but chorizo will be one of the new buddies that you can take into battle with you and I assume they'll also be human companions too like there was in Far Cry 5 sadly we didn't get to see any real gameplay just the gameplay screenshots but hopefully we will see more later in the year apparently Ubisoft are planning to do more of those forward events in the future and as of right now Far Cry 6 is set to release on Feb you xviii next year it's been in the works for four years they say and it's coming out on PC ps4 PS five Xbox one Xbox Series X and Google stadia that's a lot of platforms let's just hope they get it right with that said that's all for today folks do let me know your thoughts on far cry 6 down in the comments below I have to say that I'm enjoying the vibe of the game if that's a thing that you can enjoyed the production quality definitely seems to have increased and the fact that they've got these big actors in that TV style intro the soundtrack it's just a cool setting and those screen shots they look pretty next-gen to me can't wait to see some real gameplay though maybe I'll get hands-on sooo I hope so if you enjoyed the video
