hi everyone hope you well today I've got some awesome warzone matches for you the first one I'm using my best gun loadout from the video yesterday the alkyd the 556 magazine and the Joker the javelin missile launcher thing as a secondary now the algum still trying to work out exactly how to play with this gun because technically is an SMG but you put the five five six rounds in and it does awesome damage and just a great rate of fire mobility all around nice stuffs and the Joker of course well that's excellent at taking out vehicles and hitting people behind cover or on rooftops with that said there are two games here the first one is my highest kill game so far so it's pretty action-packed and the second one has just got a absolutely mental ending I'm playing here with Tommy from two angry gamers and my friend Carl with that said I hope you guys like this if you do leave a like sit back relax and enjoy I reckon we get boneyards phone royale what [Music] nice to get the gun into another
