did you know that battlefield 3 had a co-op campaign i bet that a lot of people didn't and it's actually a lot better than you might remember i'd only played it briefly in 2011 and i wanted to dive in again so i invited my friend tommo to play through it as he's never tried it before as far as he could recall we loaded up going to a game together and what we found really surprised us a variety of engaging missions involving foot soldiers helicopters humvees and more we had a blast and recorded it all and here are the highlights for you if you enjoyed the video leave a like and let me know your thoughts below if you've never seen this before i think you'll be quite taken back by some of the stuff in here let's check it out look at this character model tom it's unique isn't it i mean it's still by today's standards very uh aesthetically pleasing and realistic and what modern military look like i've got an mt4 9. you've got an m16 a3 with a grenade launcher on by the looks of it does not give us the same gun no we're different we're different people tom car wow wow right what are we gonna do it actually blows my mind how good this game looks like it's insane isn't it i'd argue it it looks better than 2042 and it's purely because of like the clutter and just like realistic environment how greasy it is yeah the lighting looks really good 2042 looks too apexy doesn't it but too clean javelin there we go there's an m16 there if you want it i've got a javelin apparently let's go did we just go up on the bridge enemy scout what's our objective here i think we just have to hold off their advance okay look there's a guy there i mean yeah javelin i'll do that oh yeah i see him shooting tom this one man dad oh tom they're coming over there look at them all oh my god man okay right maybe i should get a gun rather than the javelin lmg would be actually solid jack if you can bipod it oh yeah i'm gonna get one as well bipod equipped oh god the recoil man quite a bit on in there spam that q burn i've got a reload on i'm out of ammo damn it on the left now i need ammo um actually there's an m39 here i'll take that 230 rounds let's go ruined destruction oh i've been i've been headshotted wait i can raise you look at that amazing oldie to revive tom i'm going to die i'm going to die i'm going to die i'm going to die shot me where he killed you there god i actually nearly died are we bad gamers bank tank tank okay now i need the javelin now i'll go get the jumper i mean i've got a javelin as my secondary oh yeah you can totally do that yeah i'm an idiot i fire it appear locking boom is that it god this looks so good man i'm running this on like max settings the animations are brilliant aren't they yeah for sure they ended up using this system in fifa or did like was it the other way around fifa yeah what system the animation system the bipod system the bipods in fifa i don't remember that yeah hey there if you want it cheeky ak yeah great we're gonna go over here now the humvees are moving tom where are those oh yeah sick looking on the left side oh that one nearly killed me it's a ride earthquake 11 years old yeah 2011 this came out so many like modern aaa games today they just don't look anywhere this good choppers yeah yeah javelin i think it's friendly oh it's friendly it's running we've got to go back to the defensive line over there yeah we just got to stop him advancing here ak is awesome what i said this aek is awesome man oh oh no it's a tank it's a there's a tank there my hit you um are you down i'm just worried they're going to rpg okay it's coming time i can feel it i can feel the rpg there it is there is it's got the ammo somewhere bang i killed it with my claymore you got it i put it i put the claymore down and shot the claymore where are these bloody rpg guys run what was that i'm up there so like a dude rpg on the roof left side left side loads of them and another tank another tank are you serious nope i mean yeah yes all right i'm in cover resin we successfully held the line it's not over yet come on tom oh there was a ladder there we could have taken a snipe advantage there was literally a ladder get on the chopper okay land it god damn it i hate this place go thank god for that oh my god first time let's actually say it though oh it's really good yeah i just i just saw as we were running away there was a ladder with like a sniper vantage we couldn't just held down the entire time with without javelins continue next fire from the sky baby let's go an american convoy escorting the general approved classified intel has been almost on there and it's over are you flying flying i guess you're flying i'm on a cannon right here we go you're actually fine yeah i'm flying i love that look we've got some black oaks here don't fly into them don't fly into them they're playing why are you doing this they're playing today oh my god why are you doing this come on oh i got third-person view as well i've just got to escort them to the land but they're flying so low they're just like scraping the mountains but hey i want you to lose in this all right where are the enemies down do you see anyone on the thermals got the thermals on okay the boys are landing i think okay i think they're gonna disembark look at this oh we've gotta cover them when they approach oh my god tom this is sick this is a really cool mission this is awesome i kind of remember this but i don't know if it's just like it might just be like you know another a combination similar more team tom fema dead right got infantry here trying rockets dead yes i need another strafe run below us dead perfect do you see any more targets i don't see anyone there yeah yeah fine rockets sold them in the field here yeah still on the roof there as well on the roof below us yep got him beautiful this is full control as well this is like i'm playing multiplayer there's no restrictions i love that okay so i presume they've got to get across the bridge seeing the destruction actually happen it just feels so weird to me now it's because the last battlefield game i played was 2042 and i'm just not used to it it's when i shoot a building there just crumbles for these cannons oh yeah and just blow it up yeah look at that cruise again front as well boom making some explosions on the bridge you see any targets yeah i just heard that loading they advance now on the road one more load in ed it's a really cool car mission man must be really tough though if your first experience in a chopper is this when you first get the game ruined it's done didn't stand a chance there's nothing more yeah do you have a tv missile there's a secondary press two um i have oh we do have a two ingredients oh yeah yeah take him out you guys want it nice we've got rpg by the water tower there look why is the rpg flying in the air tom he's falling he's gonna die he's dead what that was strange but i gotta he had a jet bag he had one of those futuristic uh rpgs he did a rocket jump maybe it's a dice uh star wars battlefront crossover oh we've got anti-air tom antion yeah take him out probably lock on them get the missile off i'll move back a bit yeah it's one off nice firing beautiful two dead nice this area isn't in the multiplayer either no it's all the single player right six rounds of the rockets look at them all down there living the dream i mean did we even need them i don't think so why did we put these guys in danger were they were they getting something it's an important mission to secure some i was reading it at the start but then the game basically there's something in there that they've got maybe i can read it before i press start could have been a hostage yeah oh that's a lot of infantry many man manny [Laughter] there they are going to get on board we're safe marines get out of there while you can rtb for aar what's that mean return to base for after action report [Applause] and crash into them and fail the mission don't hit them they'll hit them firing firing splash warm splash for the cover warrior two o out fire perfect locking walking if i did one bullet of damage it went friendly foreign oh

right they seem to have more health i try to get the lead right on these guys yeah cool i love the way that site looks though yeah it's a nice optic usually i don't like these thermal ones i like the white nice i think it's because it fills up the entire screen so it's almost like you are looking down the scope what's up the entire screen but the effect is also you can still make out like facial features and stuff and and the environment it's not just like enemy is yellow everything is green yeah it's done well tasteful you might say yeah oh realistic obviously looked out actually looks like in a real sight because it is similar to this absolutely beautiful lots of love and care went into this game didn't it yeah it really did i wish we could know we were in the good days before we left them that's it right you go you're going on the left three two in position [Laughter] very good great comments from me there boom boom boom yeah i understood what you're doing okay they're moving up

dog tags in the bag he's living the dream right now what the hell help me out that cool animation i mean it was just the multiplayer one you know when they grab you turn you around pull you by the neck stab you in the chest yeah and rip your dog tags off here that's the last thing i expected from the ai though even though it's behind me i thought that would be a fail yeah i thought it would be an instant kill it's the matrix okay all exploding tom that's so good man i love the columns like i've assassinated someone now okay took his dog tags revenge they used to cover quite well too they [Music] this makes me want noodles though i want to get some chicken broth or something get some noodles we'll have noodles when the job's done okay first we execute ramen then we eat ramen [Music] cars just pulled up oh my god what the whoa this is isn't this what happens in the single player i think yeah i've got massive nostalgia from that just seeing that building with the flags inside of uh french flags i'm sure you hold this down yeah you're inside it aren't you there's an area like it in the multiplayer as well uh yeah it's one of the spawn points in metro i can't see what we're
