welcome to hood outlaws and legends this is a brand new pvp game with an interesting game mode that gets quite chaotic at times the premise is simple four players versus four players each player picks a class with their own special abilities and perks you then deploy into a level where the objective is to sneak in assassinating gods along the way you then steal the vault key from the sheriff who by the way cannot be killed only stunned take the key find the vault open the vault steal the treasure chest and attempt to carry it back to one of multiple extraction points but you walk slowly when you've got the chest and when you get to the extraction point it takes time to complete and up to two players at a time can manually winch it leaving you and the rest of your team vulnerable the ai is no joke either and it will mess you up there's also capture points on the map which can be contested by either team to enable better respawn areas all in all this leads to some pretty intense engagements where strategy is key today i'm going to show you some highlights of a match with tommy acolyte and tomographic great bunch of lads and this was our fourth game together when we'd started to learn the gameplay mechanics a bit more a big thanks to hood outlaws and legends for sponsoring this one link is down in the description below if you'd like to check out the game for yourself with
