hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're checking out mafia definitive edition and a big thanks to 2k for sponsoring this video this is a full remake of the first mafia game and today we're going to be playing on pc on maximum graphics if you're interested in checking out the game for yourself there's a link down in the description below and here we've got highlights of a few of the first opening missions i hope you guys enjoyed this let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you do like it leave a like sit back relax and let's take a look around the city of lost heaven in the 1930s so this game came out in 2002 and i did play it originally i was 15 years old probably shouldn't have been playing it but i was and i think back then i had a pentium four okay we're at the river and a geforce two five six graphics card tired out of questions but it looked amazing at the time and obviously with this being a full remake they've brought it up to speed with modern games i'm looking forward to this i'm gonna run these vehicles get out of the way cops one thing about the driving in this game it was a bit more realistic than most of the games at the time so the cars have a bit of weight and physics to them this is the uber of the 1930s right here i reckon these guys have given me like a two-star rating maybe it's not been smooth so far i have to say the bridge is up in it yeah we can make it we can do it let's go what the hell are we doing just sit tight and pray [Music] never done that before me neither okay so little italy now your night's not over i mean i have been taken hostage here basically right the headlights look really good on the cars very nice volumetric lighting there so you can get in trouble for breaking the rules of the road in this game although i believe you can turn that setting off if you want well what are you waiting for so where to st michael's church directly i recognize that lady's voice careful please i always drive careful then you'd be the first where's ah that lady's done loads of voice acting work the speed limiter oh i don't know about that eyes on the road please let me know down in the comments below
