say hi to the model 37 shotgun now this was supposed to be a chapter reward in the final chapter of battlefield 5 chapter 6 into the jungle but it was mistakenly added to the game and they just let everyone have it anyway now seeing as this was kind of towards the end of life cycle a couple months after this they announced they weren't even going to support the game anymore i didn't really use this gun if at all and about a week ago i hopped on with some friends two angry gamers tommy and adam and they just decided to play some bf5 and something that i noticed was in the kill feed this gun was popping up left right and center and i was being killed by it a lot so i wanted to give it a go and my god this thing is out of control it's really good the hipfire on it nuts so let's jump into the game now see what happened enjoy now to truly experience the power of the model 37 i thought i'd come on devastation yeah this map you just blend in so well with everything i don't know why i've got the well rod that's my secondary but we're going to go with it yeah i've recently done a vid as well on uh underground with a shotgun i'm sure i can hear someone okay oh goodbye uh i mean the hip fire is pretty good i get that dude i got you mate no biggie okay you're not supposed to bring that indoors you know that's illegal oh my god no wonder people are using it i'll blow this up dude i told you about driving indoors there's someone out there show me the money there it is i'll get one of my big sticks back all right mate you got a shotgun no machine gun you got one of these maybe not are you sure yeah it works if you want i'm just building it back no it's not allowed i'll just blow it up again watch like that this guy is getting so annoyed with me [Music] oh man oh that's too funny i'm sorry oh throwing nails at me now i'm going i'm sorry goodbye uh-oh i'll try and actually use the boomstick oh my god i didn't think this through did i i'm ruined yeah i'm an idiot there's some rats in the church oh my gosh what no stop shooting at me dude i'm gonna revive the phantom of the opera here and shocking some people what do i see there see a little truck okay here we go bang 90 damage yes but we didn't get the kill but i mean we got 90 of the damage so yeah i think we contributed there i will take this off if it's the last thing i do no that first guy must have been low oh my god oh that's jason bourne i didn't stand a chance anyway i got a high ground now here's someone here hey it was a bit off then steve are you serious why are you just pronouncing i could barely see that guy yes we'll provide the phantom again such a fun game is to just casually play this gun as well it's really difficult to use but when you hit those shots it's very very satisfying and there are some enemies on a got some more rats here i don't know what our voice is gonna do i don't really know why i'm saying that you think i'll be safe here under this from the artillery it's just fine it's fine it's a real truck it's a bus well engineered everything's gonna be okay i'm back here again well it's more dangerous this time that's three people now that's an interesting spot to be fair i don't know how they got up there oh yeah still one two punch there that felt good the enemies have enough objectives there's only one way to stop that road kills i did say i was gonna get them all and this may be the only way sarah i forgot what her name is what's her name i don't know why i went with sarah either no it's something oh a bit more french than sarah maybe steve are you kidding me dude again i swear to god steve gets me one more time prone with a light machine gun i'm gonna snap [Music] i'm gonna find them i haven't even killed that guy where are you going what did you have drilling that was good steve will be in there somewhere guaranteed the fact that you get seven shots as well with that build i mean it's a bit crazy isn't it look at this i swear it's steve again [Music] steve three times now i have to get revenge look betsy that's what i'm going to call it betsy we'll go with that that's a good name for shotgun there's not long this is not long left in the match betsy and we've got a target is that steve no that's not steve tell me where steve is [Music] oh this isn't good yes ah sarah again trying to go for the rest i mean betsy going to get some health back and we're going to get in that cathedral and find steve i know you're in somewhere steve tell me where stevens where is he yes steve finally forgot him i don't even care to kill me i don't care we got steve steve's dead i can quit i can actually quit as a youtuber now i'm done content creation's over i've killed steve i'm happy it's fine well we did turn around their cap a bit no no i'm i'm the only one that uses a shotgun although there is like four shotguns in the kill feed right now it's getting bad yes only took four shots oh brian anymore oh my goodness it just melts people i'm not even aiming well this is really fun man i'll recharge through here if i've wanted to see it's destiny i don't see anyone it's a good way to get across that gap though isn't it dead guy here so one more kill at least with the shotgun oh betsy don't look out a bit too late i'll hide around this corner here betsy's hungry come on feeder come on you know you wanna six shots stay away can i get the charge oh man
