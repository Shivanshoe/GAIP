right so they've added gliders to poke gee we found one we're about to fly for the first time and see what it's all about and maybe we could take some people out from the air let's see enjoy lovely day for a run let me just find a flower over there in front of us can we intercept the air drop in the glider like taking out a v1 in a plane you can refuel when you're sitting in a vehicle refueling vehicle all right beginning one of you yeah Toby's in the buggy cookster I've never done this before by the way so what could possibly go wrong I won't keep on that line you're going okay now you can shoot our this Johnny pictures okay let's go how do I take off bullets space shift shift Jah Chris feels completely safe don't know how to take off Johnny go back in the moisture why are we in flu I'll put back in the moist it's treated like a clean that doesn't work Johnny push for ago it must be a control okay okay check we get ran over by you lot now aren't I always wrap it on the ground air control are killing Cooney cute waiting for that to blow up a building yeah I know how do we fly up let's stop let's stop this cool that's it oh my god Jack it's not safe alright let's go to the drop zone right so I kept it point D Jack were like really 45 degrees up there easy I don't know what I'm doing be Johnny oh crap oh crap there we go straight around psychology it's like a roller coaster out of all I'd see the sky from prescribed for Scott backwards why would I help you crashed [Music] please just give me a binary tutorial on YouTube or something what a cute I'm just holding s and sometimes it goes up sometimes it goes down no Jack not the dream the most difficult thing in the world to drive you do not understand good news the buggy that I came here to save one of you with is also stuck oh man how is that it's not ideal oh no it's fine give it just give it a little tickle out I don't get 3-vector a little tickle off the wall what the bug that the thing laylamon those controls annoying curative guys I dare you to have a go I very like to take off Adam let's just touch the wings incoming all right now that's fine if we find another we'll give it a go yeah you have a go and they will say get in motor glider it quit Byul all right good luck Adam all right for all to fault I'm up Jack I don't know what you're complaining about I really have no idea if you can fight this is fine I've gone straight up trying turn this is I've turned but this is lovely I'm having an amazing time this has changed the game for me this is great I mean it's a stealth jet then is it well I'll hear it now right I'm not really slowing down slow it down slow it doesn't have air breaks jello it down you might just have to follow me on this one I mean go go my faster the pickoff very fast yeah you're a lot better at that than I am that's a tree I have nightmares like this just enjoying a nice drink a Pepsi and my glider here oh you got your glider Jonny yeah could we do we do wingman right bombing game coming final Oh dad how would you see see it's beautiful isn't it what s you tap s to raise the nose don't hold it just raise the nose give it out a tooth that's why I was doing wrong you were just holding s yeah basically you were trying to point the nose at the sky Jack I was aiming for the Sun have you yeah you've done it there's a bite down there Adam I see that is ridiculous out of this that's the full let's go Jack honestly I wasn't expecting anything then I just thought for a joke I'll just shoot at it where's this body should we try and finish about there down there oh my god oh there's more there no now we don't go down there okay oh this is such a weird like perspective I'm gonna get banned for that they're gonna report me do you think if you run out of fuel would it keep on gliding or will he just dip into the ground yeah absolutely I cut the throttle ages before I landed and it didn't slow me down all right he's the game-changing this isn't it if you find one it's a boat on the beach why not some local fire it's on fire if I might have exhausted careful the laughing out for me yeah I mean it looks like we're a bit hot there I don't know what we're gonna go now the dreary London can't refueling I'm refueling okay what mine is law it's perfectly safe and that's all right I put the full fuel in there Adam okay onward you know I find it very hard to slow down yeah that's not an easy thing to do you've got to kill your speed basically by reducing the motor and then angling up tangled up and then right left arm there is a tree get all the good right think they should do [Music] [Applause] I've got three grenades button yeah you want to do some air raids and give me mood not say wouldn't it I'll me come to me right now I mean coming to you creasing speed Johnny oh no okay are we gonna go low and faster we can you're a fine slow what do you want you go pretty low because there's cheese now what do you want lower okay I'm not gonna dive along the whoops do it depth charge a long long is it that's lovely that it's okay you're fine right I don't want any Johnny I I'll just crash no doubt you can do this you can do this how she gets going because you giving me anxiety I'm have enough problems over to the fire oh it's not even possible I think the propeller hit me the Indiana Jones me you stay away we got mats yeah listen I
