one hope you're doing well and welcome there's more Call of Duty warzone season 4 as just gone life well earlier today we went live and it's full of a load of new content there's some awesome stuff in here and most importantly one of the new primary weapons is this bad boy vector now I have spent the entire day brining and leveling this up I've maxed it out I've got all the attachments everything's there even these weird hollow-point bullets this magazine that fires like two shots at once don't use that I've got everything and I've built what I think will be the best build a warzone there it is I think it is the fastest firing SMG in the game it's pretty nuts so we're gonna be testing that out having a bit of fun with it some reason in warzone it's called the fennec and can maybe thats a copyright thing but as the vector i've called it the vector whatever and one of the other weapons that's available straight away is this bad boy the CR 56 a max you might know it as a Gallo or a galley depending on how you like to pronounce things I don't know which one's right or which one's wrong but I haven't really used this one as much I got it up to level 31 and I've built the best build for the current attachments that I have I think later on you probably get the monolithic suppressor there maybe there's some more magazine options too but I've got the 45 round magazine there commando for grip of course you can put lasers on there a couple of interest in stocks here too oh we're gonna be testing it see how it goes but primarily today we will be focusing on the vector now the interesting thing about this is that I've put a different barrel on it you can see I've got the zlr 16-inch apex which actually changes it quite a lot like if I take this off it's a lot shorter that kind of looks like your classic Call of Duty vector doesn't it but for warzone I think you want that range you want that accuracy you want the control so that's what we're going with now also during the stream today I'll be giving out some Cod points I've got 10 codes which will give out 2400 Cod points each so I will be dropping those in the chat and I'll say when I'm about to drop them so first-come first-serve you know there's only 10 but if you get one Congrats and I think 2400 Cod points is enough to max out the battle pass so you could get all the new stuff in it it's all been released today let me show you one of the best things though about the new battle pass where is it barracks trying to think where it is oh yeah vehicle customization guys we've got different owns now there's a default pretty boring pretty I'm not about that life ride of the valkyries [Music] come on what's cool about that you can actually get that on the helicopter you go full Vietnam if you want there are a couple of other horns as well yeah if you want to feel like you're at the funfair I suppose then they've got the the Cucaracha that's the last thing you want to hear before you get killed in war zone and then this one I'd quite like this one if you ever fancy a race reminds me of Mario Kart mainly but of course I've gone to ride of the valkyries I mean why why wouldn't you come on there's a couple new skins as well like Eagle Rock I like that one and this one's just horrible so naturally I've picked it it's very green looks like a like a twister ice lollies or like a sweet that you would buy at the store a sour sweet looks like a are those little sour sweets called they look like little people something sours anyways I can't remember I got a new watch as well it's like a minimap watch yeah it's like a live mini-map of where you are in the game that's cool new operators as well of course we got kept in price the latest version of Captain Price that's the I think that's the default one that you get oh is that the one at the end got nightfall Midlands premier then Bantam and dead of the night add paint to his face I don't know if they're from the campaign missions and I think there was another one Sarah Iskra skin sour patch kids there you go sour patch kids that's it that's the new skin for Iskra so I got that there's also gas is it gas pile on the campaign but I think that's coming a later down the line you can't get that one yet and there's another operator called Rose which is coming I should put some XP tokens on shouldn't I don't want XP token it's dudas did that not work there we go it worked apart from that they've added a new game mode which is called warzone Rumble which is 50 V 50 team deathmatch I've not played that yet so we might give it a go towards the end of the stream depends on how I feel but they also talked about like modifiers to warzone which I'm sure we'll experience I purposefully haven't played any warzone today so I could give you guys my first impressions and excitement behind everything and just get it done for the first time and see you know see how it goes but with that said hopefully that gives you a good idea of what's new season for launch and we'll be getting into a game here I could actually I'm gonna drop a code right now you know so this is for 2400 Cod points guys in the chat and there are 10 of these in total good luck you'll see you should see my name in yellow with a tick next to it certain thank you for the 10 I love this new music by the way we've got a couple new members as well Matthew Bosher and kathmandou thank you so much guys a fusion destroy said Rumble sounds real good for weapon upgrading and camel unlocking since the map is so limited is it limited have they only done like a portion of it I'm not sure but yeah I'm sure we're gonna test we're gonna test all these thick all these things it's gonna be good also there's new loop so they've changed the the loot table it's a bit different new blueprints in the loo table if I remember correctly there's added I think they've added these one at Caesars look at this what's the sound that I've got oh oh is that gonna be in the game not sure alright mate ghost and price together at last I'm excited about this guy's my first game of the day first game of the day are we gonna get a win I don't know that's a nice looking skin nose and they're like the blonde is that rose gold I don't know what you would call that go get my aim on point oh god I wouldn't ever want to pick this up get over here price has got like a really cool take down as well but he's got the cigar so hopefully we can get one of those as well today look at this this is a nice little matchup isn't it I like to see it Alex on the left price in the middle ghost on the right that's cool a gamble thank you for becoming a new member I appreciate it right you want to go super store first first game yeah I don't know I don't know if that's a good idea maybe something like here yeah okay so he's confirmed that there are some other things as well like I think I put mini guns in bunker eleven you know that secret bunker you have to go and use the phones get the code and then you can get into the secret bunker number 11 there's many guns in there I've seen videos of it or there's so many people here why are there so many people that's not that's not good oh of course it's a terrible shotgun oh come on and a foul please I'm not a fan of that they've got fouls guys they've got fouls on the ground frosty is in the gulag straightaway all right well you know what the foul it's the weapon that I've not really leveled up so I don't think I can fairly judge it but I've tried it in war zone before and it just it's never worked out great for me maybe I need to get all the attachments for it but is that a birthday off Albert stal wall I don't like that word stal what peculiar and I come up here is it clear I definitely feel like there's going to be more people around you know like the amount that landed here drop it in sorry got to give like no big deal ready for me can we get the first guru like can we do it what's kicking off might at least be done yeah right ooh am i fighting you're not gonna be against oh yeah this is the watch not mini-map okay that's interesting so that shows you on the map where I am where is that is that like right in the north maybe up here like around here under the map stalwart [Music] mind the squad are dead as well all right so there's Game one done tons oh go again another one exciting start they're enjoying it I'm gonna drop another code here guys no codes will be regularly put in the chat here's another one got that bad boy in there yeah if you are watching this and you're struggling to update the game I know a lot of people had problems with updating the game this morning one thing that I found on PC at least if I use a VPN and connect America like New York so you log out of battlenet you turn on your VPN you connect to somewhere like New York it works well for me and then you log back into battlenet you select America usually that gives me good otherwise it just doesn't happen ready ready saw so this is just me and some other dude I'm missing a player why it's HAP Diego that's cool [Music] all right then let's have a look at this one you want to go there let's go for that one a close thank you for the donation that's very kind Eman love watching you channel keep it and Conrad thank you for the hundred as well is that Kat I was getting to Meg last night [Music] Mike never said he lives in New York and the download was fine yeah yeah for me like if it's a patch day I either have to get up really early in the morning and turn my PC on start downloading the patch or if I'm getting bad speeds I have to VPN and then I find that the American servers are just a bit better the download speeds that's what I tend to do and it works right for me like that's like the fourth patch now where I've done that and yeah seem to fix the problem Ram 7:00 in the loot table but really fancy that claymore yeah and me and the boy rocks it on get a victory I hope so I hope that we can need to get that load out so I can test the vector guys look at these files everywhere I don't know I'm not I'm not about that like pp19 that's above me so the oceanographers still there that's sniper rifle why they fouls everywhere oh man I don't know if the community's gonna like this yeah quite difficult to use slug shotgun this foul skies come on that's like the sixth one that I've seen this game what the hell yeah I don't know what the connection speed is like on xbox or ps4 like what are your experiences with that guys you've got good speed on console or is it just the PC problem I'm not entirely sure to be honest I don't know the crossbow all right let's go to the buy might the boss it's really weird hearing price in war zone I like the voice actor that does his voice though I think he's cool what Brock sits on let's go just get it done come come please buy a loadout please buy a loadout did you buy a load up did you buy a load up you know give him the old thumbs up enemies right here we go look at this array a fire though how cool is that it's an absolute monster in multiplayer James said seven hours later and you're still downloading oh my goodness oh it's a chunk oh no Brock Suns down I'm gonna get pushed I said 1 B 3 now I'm screwed these guys are sneaky Fairplay covering their back as well with the proximity mine that was nice [Applause] [Music] okay right there put snapshot grenades in the gulag I don't know if I agree with that I'm not sure that I agree with that these are I think they're the most wanted contracts as well so they've come back to right oh man they've like changed so much stuff and put so much stuff am a little bit overwhelmed so be honest at the boneyard a deep-sea said 19 hours you've been down does that update even been out for 19 hours why so many fouls please do you think they're trolling us is that what it is Infinity Ward have looked at the stats and gone ah so the file is the least used weapon in the game right so how do we make people use it just put loads of it in warzone hmm what's that helicopter okay I think that is like a supply helicopter or something right like if you shoot that down it drops a load of Lube I think that's what that is pump shotgun just respawn yeah I'm just gonna go and see what this is because I've not seen this before I'm just curious I might die but whatever right so there's a squad over there shooting at it but this will obviously attract a lot of attention Rona [Music] so they're trying to shoot it down or they're having a fire or something fact I'm gonna be rest just gonna wait here and say that's two from that squad that are down there I try and push this maybe right they also added an m4 with three round shots instead of full also yeah I think that was the one that I saw in the house right that makes does that make sense is that the one that I saw in the house one with a weird name Oh Sam thank you for the 25 thanks again jack for your great videos simplify Thank You Sam that's very kind right I'm gonna drop another code here guys but I'm gonna leave it about like 20 seconds before I drop it because I know that the stream is a little bit delayed so in about 20 seconds from now you'll see a code in the chat and I think you can use that on battlenet are we gonna go into a solo game here I did ice are you saw reddit that I think they removed vehicles from solos I don't know if that's true though kindness seems like a bad idea to me though but I mean pre-round usually you can see the vehicles here right there's a third code you guys enjoy that whoever gets it it's 2400 cod points hey David Johnston hey Tommy to be honest with you the vector pretty good in multiplayer I mean I've been grinding it the whole day of unlocks everything for it why is this skin what is the skin in warzone I've only had one engagement with it which which is just then in that previous match and a guy beat me with a mp7 I think or a growl sure for ninja you got it awesome Congrats yeah look they've taken all the vehicles out I don't know how I feel about that I think maybe that's uh maybe that's a bad mood can we just drop here it's gonna be hot like everyone's gonna go there [Music] let's go for it oh man there's so many people okay right we're not we're not doing that we're not doing that we'll go we'll go back there though we're gonna go back in why not didn't find him on the plate just popped dead silence everyone here dead no way my god how did I lose that fight how did I lose that fight I'm terrible man what was that I was just too overconfident I think that's an F in the chat what is that is right now as Captain Price it's dead eyes Pete Ross you can redeem the coves on Barnet yes major I did get the guys together it's really cool to see pricing girls on ego come on put me in twice the price let's go I think it was a slug shotgun [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yep hopefully I can make up for that that's pretty I was pretty bad wasn't it bigger big ooh at least I know if I pick that shotgun up again gotta aim with it on hipfire oh wait how are you here nobody likes you you weren't invited to the party I'm sorry no please we're gonna have to have a word about this we're gonna have to have a word yes we can it's simply not acceptable infinity water troll in its all and hard it's just everywhere I bet this one upstairs as well watch did I hear a footstep then [Music] there's no follow-up area maybe I did hear a footstep I don't know now we're gonna go hi ice please vice please I'm sure I can hear footsteps or what you hear it's gonna go dead silence just in case and my maybe someone around here hello the c4 on the roof yi-yi-yi it himself off the roof he blew his c4 I'm out that rocker box kind of growl don't know I would just put three times scope on it as well oh well I'll be that guy okay this hasn't been lured by the sounds of it lead the pack it's really interested in seeing all these new blueprints oh can you believe it guys can you believe it a green m4 Alleluia [Music] soul of the Beast I mean I do want to go and get the load out but that buy station over there by the school say one of the worst ones that you can get it may be I don't want to go over there cuz I know there's a player over there whatever let's do it if he dies he dies can't open this is why have they taken the vehicles out why would they do that it's bursts oh no oh Osama what why didn't you tell me before I picked it up it's a bus no no no no no I can't believe I can't believe that's happened I'm never using that why would you put a burst and foreign haven't got ghosts on this bus really I should have had a hobby sensor okay it goes theater providing there's no one on this roof and they're gonna murder me third area go to be murdered oh good please let me jump over that wall all right get the ghost could be someone I'm there oh there we go cool right someone just took a shot out there why can I not get on that and start pedaling yeah I don't like the fact that they've taken out vehicles like I don't feel like anyone asked for that you know why why would they vehicles are fun I mean in solos they make things really interesting you know whether it's getting from A to B or it is c4 helicopter to get on top of a camper it took why why would they take in the mouth why where is everyone vehicles are great because they pull people together which you can see them on the mini-map and people just gravitate towards oh oh there's a vehicle core let's go over there then otherwise geez it just turns into a campus like this where people are on roofs there's this on the roof of the building don't if there's someone underneath me now don't think so because they I don't think they're annoying I like babies Oh Amy from was over there wouldn't there yeah I can't it's just on this roof isn't it all operators will redeploy yell break this guy's just given up peek and now babies move okay it's cash yeah I don't I really don't what everyone comes back literally everyone comes back in the game that was spectating that's crazy he's got a laser sight he's just camping it come on pick the window this happened over there that's the galley that wasn't bad fingers right in solos I don't think jailbreak will have that much of it and in fact because a lot of people just disconnect from the game don't they instead eyes like when you when you disconnect but when you die and you lose the Gulag most people just D say I think you'll have a big effect in in quads and how does the livestream have subtitles I think YouTube just Auto trans codes and like it just does it was it by itself it's a supply chopper over there so if you shoot this down [Music] there's stuff in that bag I don't know how it works I'm just gonna I'm just gonna go and see I mean it's probably a really stupid idea but I want to see how this works no I can't interact with that there wasn't any it wasn't any it markers or anything then account does anyone know how that works in the chat yeah you can turn hit markers off as well sorry you could hit markers you can turn subtitles off as well you don't have to have them on like the helicopters gone now go up to it that's a different contract yeah there's so much new stuff that I just don't I don't understand what it is try this war zone Rumble then 50 v 50 shoot the chopper shoot it down it's the briefcase a briefcase helicopter Niko what does that mean what does briefcase helicopter mean it's briefcases now what what does that mean it's contraband contract right okay so it's a new contract you get a briefcase for a blueprint alright I see so you get like a secret weapon blueprint or something cool thanks guys yeah that's that's brand-new as well I'm not I'm not seen that before yeah in about 20 seconds guys I'm gonna drop a new code in the chat 2,400 card points first-come first-serve whoever gets it that will give you enough Cod points to buy whatever you want in the store and also max out the battle bus I think you can do it with that so what's this then so this is the 50 B 50 mode I can't open them up so you just spawning with a loadout [Applause] this is weird Sony follow them up you know up job any moment either [Music] [Applause] here's have a big fight crown storage is it like is it different parts of the map every time it's this is weird I didn't expect this I thought it was going to be like 50 V 50 52 50 team deathmatch [Music] [Applause] it's a scratch this is really weird at least they could have made it ground war or something or put flags in literally just a big team deathmatch isn't it I'm not sure how I feel about this then no vehicles either just so many sniper glints over there big TD it's 50 that's not for me let's put it like that I don't think I can really find much enjoyment in that to be honest no not really about that I think maybe if it was 50 versus 50 battle rail like with a circle that pushes in in this loop on the ground I'd be interested in that but that's just big team deathmatch isn't it couldn't you have objectives or vehicles or something different maybe they're testing something without like testing the netcode out I don't know that's not very it's not very engaging for me that a practice Brown it could be a really good way of leveling up guns oh yeah that's that's not very fun for me it's forgetting the growl yeah it's from locking guns maybe I did see in the in the graphic - season 4 there's a 50 Cal sniper riot rifle like later down the line which is kind of cool it's not in the game yet coming soon who's that guy Vincent that's very strange isn't it what happened then was that guy invincible [Music] that's really confusing [Music] I don't understand what happened there guys there's a new bunker to open is there really your sin what's up the bus it's a booze okay how you doing don't know why I said it's a bus I just messed up the a all right let's go now you can't kill anyone Wow everyone is invincible in the lobby dude I executed that guy twice I execute him twice what's that about give me a gun give me a gun give me jung-im got a gun guys that dude was toured up as well you might open the door at the door it's a sort of Chuck Norris is that right yo I don't know where the enemies are out so gonna run to my teammates is there a gun LMG shotgun now roll though that mate helicopter is it down and we push in looks like we're pushing alright boosted are let's go now you got res hundred bullets of hell here we go last one n p7 s right my god you want to get off the roof okay what did he kill him with a D paper what's what does that mean no guy downstairs Houston's dead now okay why I'm gonna just hold up in here sim they come in ilex bra won the gulag it's nice guy never look on the roof that guy just dropped in right top of me [Applause] the guy above me me I didn't mean to climb the ladder but we're gonna we're just gonna go with this it's a crazy crazy started again there are they both disconnected I miss that swing first as well poor form that is let's go solos again did they're done but another cold coming up here guys get ready in about 20 seconds I'll drop it in the chart yeah really first-come first-serve this is 2400 cod points which is enough to max out the bustle pass so whoever gets it feel free to do that if you want or you can just unlock some skins that you like I suppose it was one that I just got which was like the Ninja Turtles I think it was for the for the riot shield it'd be one of these yellow that's Ninja Turtles and there was a melee as well Kali sticks hang on go go Ram Jam like [Music] kind of like Donatello stick was it Donatello Donatello was the purple one wasn't it Leonardo had the swords Raphael had the daggers and Michelangelo had the nunchucks I think right codes out I'll see that takedown again watch he said that without moving his lips how did he do that Isis he's a different breed he's a different breed you're surprised that I know that dude I used to watch the the turtles all the time when I was a kid in the UK it was called Teenage Mutant hero turtles though it wasn't called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because I think the TV standards people decided that ninja was too violent for children so they called it Teenage Mutant hero turtles instead well yeah I was all the time and all the toys as well all the little action figures now remember there was one specific Christmas where they just bought out the blimp you know the the Ninja Turtles blender you could have that as a toy I was so good and that's that's like all I wanted for Christmas I didn't really ever want much to be honest when I was a kid but that thing I wanted that thing I really wanted that thing yeah I'm big fan of this new music that dude garden assault rifles so quick no I missed it no mr. play here's another guy in here you might be I was rude that was really rude it's my big news six RPGs I do think that six RPGs is is a bit too much the other guy was on that roof there it's camping then now I have to go over there to get my contract I'm gonna try and what's that now a foul please or I could mmm go for the snipe nope not peeking anymore whatever let's just go out there he's around here somewhere is this guy smart enough that he knows that my yellow crates in there [Applause] don't know if he's an esse dumptown maybe he was just waiting in the corner all right there is another crane here that I can hear I'll know the cash got all that cash in the wall can't get it it's annoying Oh where's that then downstairs I don't think you can get on the roof of this can you go there's a plate need that all right oh please why are you the way you are sway some armored plate I'm just gonna pretend that you're not there I'm gonna pretend you don't exist I'm gonna get some armor plates I'm gonna go complete my mission three minutes left we've got this s silence as well thank you very much Oh orange crate minigun many go are stopping power I'll take someone just open the door they're really slowly did you hear it I'm gonna have to get the jump on this guy please with no place I'm a big disadvantage please give plates one plate the zones come in as well solos are so bad without vehicles bad oh why did they take away vehicles it's gonna be even more comfy it's just gonna be it's gonna be the mega camp fest isn't it I don't agree with that [ __ ] ma what's my headset sennheiser 363 day come on that's RG bar g let's go it's just afk dude move you got to fight to win right in I think I was dead then anyway cuz the gas was uh [Applause] all right let's have a look I mean I suppose I could try and spice up by going for bounties and stuff like that what's that what is that no doubt who's this Ron the middle devil as a sniper they're looking at me schwarber we do you high damage man this Kelly law damage why don't you got please no I just want this all right that's so that's not the blueprint so what that is look at this there's a guy in here please stop playing the game like this please I beg I beg you please there's another guy out here oh I don't like soullow without vehicles I mean that was stupid I I didn't think you'd still be peeking it okay right we're gonna go solos again but I'm gonna go for bounties that's that's what we're doing we're just going for bounties might be difficult though because I mean previously when I play solos what I do is I get a bouncy and then I hop on a quad bike or I getting a Jeep and putting people down that way that usually works quite well I might change it to art beat sensor let's go with that Jack if you complete battle past season 3 do you get season for battle past for free I don't know part Welsh I heard that this is the hottest place to learn about the eggs I don't know if there are any eggs here to be honest Adam I'm not not entirely sure you'll be getting eggs not in this stream at least yeah I'm gonna drop another Cody advice in about 20 seconds 2400 call points I'll be going in the chat get ready and go if you get one of the codes guys tweet me cuz I'm probably not gonna see it if you put it in the chat just because the chat is going like crazy it's the most price takedown they could have made isn't it I love that yeah whatsapp Ricardo from Italy how you doing how are you going so high level already I level the Montreux need or Johnny promised me there was Easter eggs here I need the eggs there were no Easter as far as I know so in this what they've done is they've opened up a couple more of the bunkers one of the bunkers has like a massive Soviet missile in it like a giant rocket that wasn't there before okay bounties bounties that one that's the one also if you open bunker 11 you get a guaranteed minigun hell screw I don't want to go I'm gonna go home I missed it he's got it guess I'll die I mean I'm ruined darling I really wanted that you've taken it from me someone came through here as well I could just go for that one need a gun I'm gonna have to get used to the foul on I that's how it's going down yep maybe not bison yeah okay let's have a look what if this do I get I get between 150 to 200 okay there we go I'd be in here as well exactly where I'd be I'd be yep I'd be in there just chillin like a villain okay I was easy alright next the whole pace of it is changed because the lack of vehicles I just absolutely owned me I wouldn't be hard I was a dead-end wasn't it I think went to the wrong building Arjun falling forward piece oh I'm streaming in 1440p but I'm playing in 1080p and the reason I scream in 1440p is because youtube codec is way better quality at 1440p alright the 1080p codec just isn't very good I will drop another code soon guys will drop another one soon that was tight what's up Oliver how you doing and you take a most wanted contract yeah you can back in a deal baby dig why is it burst it's the one that we had earlier hello cheeky lil I can't put my armor playing it won't let me put it in I think it's bugged I'm pressing for nothing's happening that's not a good bug that's that's really not a good book to visit oh that's new I'm pretty sure that's new anyways oh man I can't put it in there's nothing worse there's literally nothing there's no worse bug than that doesn't I can't think

please it's not working no I mean uh I'm screwed oh my like if I don't have any plates what can I do not being able to shoot would be worse maybe whatever I mean I'm so dead but it is what it is why didn't you pick up that thing rebind the key I'm not gonna not gonna all therefore I'll try rebinding the key that's what I'll do that's a good that's a good idea Chad thank you let's try and rebind the key mission ability where is it should be in here right what is it um is it that I just put that to like hash or something no guys this is a this is a horrible game breaking bug I hope that this

are now my friend I'm try this war zone rumble again let's see if it puts me in a different different area I doubt that was actual Shroud in the gulag because if he was playing war zone he'd be playing on us service and if that was Shroud he would have killed me way quicker than that put it like that oh yeah another code I said I'd drop another code didn't I here we go so I've got three more of these codes in about 20 seconds I'll put it in the chat this is 2,400 card points first-come first-serve there it is I was the same area I thought it would be a different area there are vehicles this time but their vehicles before I don't think they were vehicles before maybe I'm wrong I really wish they defer objectives in this I do think it is a good opportunity for people to level up their guns though you know it's feel like that's all for this isn't it for the free players right [Music] what's it the first thing is it first the 50 first 100 it looks like first 300 maybe we'll all remember mr. Hart did you see the new season 4 Intel mission in war zone where you need to collect Intel for ghosts no I've not seen it I go there's a couple of things I'm just unsure I need to like shut everything you can go on the reddit and find out what exactly is going on there there's a few things I just don't know about tell you what when you get locked on with the vector it just absolutely destroys absolutely rinses people sniper heaven isn't it this 400 is it the fastest firing SMG in the game this I want to do that Easter egg Preston is there a new Easter egg and you take a briefcase you can but not in just no I don't think I've haven't seen a briefcase in this mood like you can't even open them up in this I just kind of feel like I wish the data should have a ozone on it we should just be the whole map find a weird to me missing it level up your guns only felt keep it sounds like a portable jackhammer Oh Derek Livingston what's up man how you doing Derek thank you new subscriber I appreciate that man yeah we've picked up a lot of new subs in the last like 60 days or so like cod war zone is really popular I'm very grateful for you guys coming - coming along you're tuning in for my videos and livestreams like it's um you know it's awesome hopefully I can keep you guys entertained I love it you got all the way out here that's funny that's like a battlefield moment that you just jump out of the car and it keeps on going nowhere they'll keep it then we'll move everything fun after a week pizza you like this nd was the truck I'd get the wifey wagon I changed it it's a new one it's not the wifey wagon is there ain't one a truck whatever that means that's critical damage right there I [Music] like their nice and this is a galley or the gallows one of the other new guns he's got higher damage than the then the m4 in the growl I think it's slightly higher damage but I don't I haven't really unlocked everything for it so I haven't like made him like a meta bill for it yet it seems alright I'd like to try in squads to be honest Oh No [Music] yeah imagine if this was the whole mouth 50 B 50 and I had a zone there like pushed in like that's what I want but this is not very fun to me this just this kind of thing over and over again this area as well like it's not I think it's great because it's just long lanes and you're gonna have snipers at the back which is pretty much how it is all the time from what I've experienced we're gonna lose this one but looks at it I'll queue up for another one of these though because I want to see if it's the same will it actually be the same map again like if you guys in the chat seen different variants is it always storage time it's a game for free is that yeah you can get war zone for a loopy it's not always the same map right it's like call of duty Metro they just tested out as a weird final kill isn't yeah really good for a free players to unlock this stuff well know what I have though on the gala now level 34 I think that's the monolithic suppressor classified barrel a different type of ammo there I think that's a different bullet in that mug so that could be a really good choice I don't understand why you can't see those final upgrades like it doesn't really make sense to me what's the deal with that Brandon Jack my friend jewelry absolutely loves you can you give him a shout out shout out to Jory thank you for coming along and watching my stuff yeah peppy gamer that's right if you use a VPN for me I live in the UK on patch days when there's a big update my download speed is just trash but if I VPN to the u.s. I can usually get a pretty good speed Joel do you think the Galil will replace the grout um I don't know we'll see I feel like it's in between the m4 on the ground if er interion this game's halfway done the drain fires definitely a bit slow than the growl I know that just feel slower need to look at the stats usually people day and mind the stats pretty quick haven't seen them yet which VPN do I use at the moment I use expressly then I have used one called tunnel bear and I have also used one called Nord VPN but the one that I've got a subscription to at the moment is Express video revenge believe in second chances he's got some poor voice lines mr. price head upstairs it's a good place to practice your aim recall control level up your guns I mean earlier I was just on multiplayer on modern warfare leveling up there the vector they've got 24/7 scrapyard at the moment which is one of the new the new map scrapyard was a muffin I think scrap guard was in cod4 on modern warfare 2 it memory serves correctly [Applause] I was just playing now I know that the vector playthrough around four hours earlier today and I got it to max level maybe less than that with double xp tokens I got a load of double xp tokens from about us so I was using us we might feel like the vectors should get a fifty or sixty round drum 45 is the max I make whatever I've got on this phone is that's the max is this usually open this bit here I don't think I've ever been here you know in war zone is this bit usually here you guys recognize this or if I just never been here is it modern warfare 3 I thought it was I thought it was Cod for scrapyard it was either Cod for modern warfare 2 yeah it's pull map anywhere quite like scrapyard Eddy friendly fire there then why do I stream on YouTube instead of switch cuz my audience is here this is where my audiences just makes sense anyways so I mean we're gonna do a little wrap up here guys it's not a warfare -
