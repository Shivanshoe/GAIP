hi guys and welcome back to battlefield 5. today we're playing on xbox series x 120 fps that man is green for some reason that's not the start that i envisioned but with all of the hype for the new battlefield game all the excitement why is it hang on something something real bad is occurred here everyone's green it's okay i don't know why everyone's green but they are but you know we're just gonna we're gonna go with it it's the new rose skin but it's green instead of black yeah i wanted to try and improve on the controller again i want a bit of a mission right now to get better on the sticks i think one of my weakest elements of that is sniping because i'm just not very good at making those fine adjustments if i have to do it quickly you know that's where i really falter but practice makes perfect you're going to peek again oh that's a mess i wonder if i'm going to have any more green people let's have a look is that a jet coming in well it wouldn't be a jet would it it would be a plane that's not a headshot dice maybe i'm going to aim a bit higher up like that oh i got a flick didn't get the headshot i will get better i definitely think having the elite series 2 controller helps because it's got like tension on the sticks and i mean it's a preference thing obviously but i just put mine on maximum tension and it just helps me i think make those finer movements i haven't played bf5 for a while on consoles so i don't know how this is going to go down but it seems to be doing all right so far oh my god that's a lot of bullets yeah i shouldn't really be peeking that should i they climbed up it's the the character models haven't loaded the proper lods for some reason so they all look weird and they're green only mr big pipe here in the plane oh dear okay right anyway you know we're gonna strive to improve see if we can get better there's a head there there it is see i still think that i would be slower than most good controller players oh no you're kidding me [Music] that's a long long way away a reaper where's another recon they're not going to race let's have a look i want revenge on that guy they were miles around the island down there was it this one they're in there somewhere but where there we go ow well that's someone else yeah i don't know why i just did a 360 then just felt like the right thing to do all right we're going to go on this flank here because it could be that the guys up on the bridge aren't looking here and that guy isn't looking [Applause] medic i'm being looked at now i like everyone no stop it stop that really not playing the objective here either am i although we've got b you know so i'm just that annoying sniper player who's trying to pick people off even though it's probably useless at this point i was not an enemy there there's enemies here right i've been spotted haven't i climb up there's the potato in full force there was more than one wasn't there surely did they climb up man if they've climbed up there that's the back range on my team i think that was them there right yeah if i swim across is it even worth it can i get up i think i can get up that side right i'll stay under the water for now just pop my head up there for a quick check there was like one little bit of news as well that i hadn't really talked about with battlefield for 2042. it's not really news you know so i don't i didn't want to make a full video about it but i'll talk about it here so you know that game mode they've got two game modes that they've not really talked about debris just flowing in the air one of them is hazard zone and they just said that's like high stakes you've got stuff to lose squad based high tension all that stuff but the other one they're gonna show ea play in july and they keep calling it a love letter to battlefield there was a little bit on the website about it oh here we go and it was something like explore the wide universe of battlefield or something along those lines i'll put the exact quote up on the screen what's that artillery i think so they're not gonna peek over there do that i can hear them all running across the bridge so whatever that means you know the wide universe of battlefield some people have speculated that it could be like remasters of old games or old maps and stuff because i keep calling it an experience right rather than a game mode i couldn't actually get up there though which is annoying oh yeah like i said in my last battlefield video it's like less than a month now to wait until i reveal more but yeah that bf4 video did great i was over like a million views it was crazy and it was uh it was just gun master it shows how much hype there is at the moment for battlefield bf42 in particular nice everyone just prones on console i've talked about this before haven't i oh i'm dead now we need a big v1 that's what we need do we not have any squad points eight thousand let's miss the big pipe though in the bomber all right this is okay we push up a bit here oh watch out can i get to this bit here you made it what hang on did i did i just [ __ ] did i just shoot a grenade in front of me and kill myself is that is that what just happened i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to watch that back i think hi guys jack from the future here so i just slowed this down and watched it and it's not the grenade right but just see if you can spot what happens before i break it down so i snipe in get the shot and then i explode but did you see it right there the teammate behind me the assault player threw a dynamite with the intention of blowing up the sandbags i assumed but as it was coming down i shot it mid air and the bullet went through the dynamite into the enemy player but it exploded the dynamite at the same time and killed me what are the chances of that happening i've got worse luck than nathan drake apparently oh that was okay i have to one hp literally one hp i'll have to go frame by frame on that and check what happened though [Music] chop the grenade the sniper there oh you got me connor here see what they did there when you put their name together and say it really fast we've only got four tickets are we not gonna do this i don't think we're gonna do this that'd be a shame i like this map that's the guy i gotta get on the point that hello come on lads oh we didn't do it we couldn't make it guys how many kills did i get was that a good round 18 yeah that was all right wouldn't it i think maybe we improved a little bit there you know baby steps with the sniper rifles and everything but i hope you
