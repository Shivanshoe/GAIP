i think i need to come to terms with the fact that not every game has a shark easter egg in it it's a sad day we are losing this fight nfw scopes oh he's right there as well do you think if you knew you were about to die in real life would you just go i'm dead yo that was a sick shot look at this i just got quick scoped we just thought i'm dead just yeah i'm gone someone here can can hear them the rad destroyer oh this area looks quite nice isn't it i wonder if they've got ray tracing on this on ps5 and pc i just got some rtx features on pc but i don't know what hmm the one that got away i thought it was the enemy i didn't see the name tag a christian thank you for the five can you give a shout out to drunk 3po uh c-3po has gone off the rails this isn't working we're behind i don't think that's canon though he's best mate r2d2 trying to get him into rehab [Music] yep i don't think george lucas would sign off on that one would they this mp5 is nice they have tablets in the 1980s as well that was the uh ipad 80s edition yeah this thing is ripping hmm no one else around here enemy spy plane inbound i just want to mount on this so bad hello 15 bullets left oh you're having a laugh look at that pathetic pathetic that ends the kill streak i hate that i hate that so much eric thank you for the four war zone in cold war well something that i realized earlier if you're on the main menu of this alpha and you press warzone it closes the game and loads of war zone so that's pretty much confirmation for me that warzone is going to stay on that engine and they're not going to make a version of warzone for this engine which is just a lot more work and i don't think it'd be as nice imagine if warzone was on this engine be weird brett thank you for the 20. mr streams great way to spend time at work well there's going to be loads more streams now i've got my new internet tomorrow i'm going to be streaming a single-player campaign i'm going to tell you which one though but out there looking for easter eggs as well did i have a chopper then i didn't even realize i had a chopper yo oh he went for the jump shot i'm over the podgy's popping off here look at podge [Music] pug pog oh the flick shot dude's sick sick gamer now please please let me play on the desert map vote desert vote that map guys vote satellite let's go everyone vote satellite vote satellite yes finally i wonder how this runs on the base playstation 4 um has anyone tried it on place ps4 it's got a shotgun here what's my internet speed as of today it's a one gigabit line one gigabit up one gigabit down deathmatch for queen and country mi6 don't let us down but it is costing me an absolute fortune we're taking control well i want to give you guys the best stream quality as far as i know not many people are actually doing 4k streams on youtube so that's good you know i want people to know that oh jack streaming if you want to see some gameplay and you want to see how it looks how it really looks in 4k i can go and watch jazz channel and there it is you know that if you come here it's always going to look good and it's going to be 1440p or it's going to be 4k uh what is the entire enemy team just camping over there what's what's happening here this needs more players doesn't it it needs more players 100 i mean i know it's um it's 5v5 so there should be one more on their team but just feels a bit empty uh what yeah the time to kill is much longer than modern warfare in this game i don't know what that sound is it it sounds like the rytech from warzone just random explosion sounds they sound like fireworks as well they've gone back to fireworks i don't i'm not a fan of that like i don't know if you can play bigger game modes on this map combined arms on this map could be quite cool there's just not enough players here enemy rc xd detected oh i thought i'd get the shotgun out give it a shot gun enemy spy plane inbound like what is going on there i felt like so many so many of those bullets should have hit weird oh i was gonna cook that now you throw on his head what the hell was that it's like a maximum speed crisis thing speed jump shots are really op as well if you haven't worked out let's use this artillery no that's my streak gone enemy napalm strike incoming a napalm strike i don't want that where's the fire i want to see the fire there's no fire sorry guys have i got a napalm strike i've got something at the end not sure what it is victory's close crush those comic bastards i can use yeah finesse so that's the same for me motion blur keeps turning back on every time i join a new game it turns back on look at that what what's happening to those bullets i don't understand well that's the satellite map so you've seen that one now that's pretty good game i know i don't think the guys i was playing against were particularly good if we go back and do armada again the first one that we did i'll build a sniper class uh where is it that one get that off how do you just take the attachment off remove that's weird why would you want hip fire accuracy hmm the victory skin ball skimble the victory symbol scared the hell out of you hey harlequin what's up destiny mata matic how you doing uh dez norman what software do i use for streaming at 4k obs i'm using uh other media 4k capture card obs and the nvent codec i'm streaming 4k 50 000 bitrate and it should look damn good is it available for everyone blaze chris yeah it is it is i could try sniping on this i guess hey demo what's up for those sweet 360 noscopes hey gerald from colorado what's up how you doing it's agent 47. xamarin this isn't out for pc it's only on ps4 at the moment yeah you can download this if you're interested in playing it yourself seeing how it feels on playstation 4 i don't know maybe next weekend it'll be out on pc and xbox i hope so i don't i mean i can't confirm that because i've not heard anything about that but this map looks so weird dude on ps4 pro i don't it's like the soap on my screen what's what's happening why look at this soap i don't want soap right we'll do some sick sniping man yeah taking a [Applause] get the tank and that's tank warfare guys right there that's uh that's how you do tanks you see it's uh it's simple oh you've got infinite infinite rounds as well [Music] i don't suppose i could drive up there with a tank could i oh don't you dare that's an enemy tank right there i feel like i need to wipe my monitor but i don't you know critical damage is it all right and this is so opaque hey it's a tank though you know like it's uh it's a tank so there you go okay d thank you for the donation it's very kindly so okay it's not that little sniping position here although someone just fired at me i think i've been made yeah there's something there's something really wrong with the way that it's rendering the scopes don't know what it is this is the spot right here yeah we got a tank then as well uh joe thank you for the 20. jack it's me pudge you made my day shadow claps what's up punch dude you had a stick playing the game podge with that sniper rifle it was good man well played i enjoyed it how do you host our spy plane established overhead losing c i mean i could just stay the whole game like couldn't i i guess we just lost c there's a guy here already that's pretty early isn't it i think in before my attack helicopter gets instantly shut down charlie's secure instantly no joke of a lie instantly why are you just saying hamburg over again i don't understand losing alpha why would you do such a thing are you trying to make me fat i mean is that what you want tank let's go took alpha i damaged myself uh excuse me you just you just took a tank shell for the face in your boat attack choppy kill someone's sniping at me that resolution is not right there's something that looks like 480p something some kind of a bug or it's not optimized i don't know man oh help me out guys it's now changed to hamburglar okay i don't know what to say guys proximity mine approximately mine i do it did i get the mine down how does sniping feel i don't think it's as satisfying as modern warfare or war zone though because i don't think there's any bullet drop but it doesn't feel like there's any ballistics in this game it just seems like it's hit scan i'll bring myself echo lockdown and the sounds are satisfying when you hit that headshot trying to work out why you're saying hamburg i'm so confused so i feel like that shot would have hit in modern warfare because i was leading in your war bank i don't know i imagine you can warbang some things right securing alpha what is the damage on this turret that was just insane just absolutely beam that dude losing f i'll get the d there's someone here oh what was that where's our tank i want it back enemy turkey artillery put it on the side air space full you're having a giraffe on you you're gonna give my position away it's my buddy

used the rc-xd yet losing c twice air baseball has got me killed so many times in warzone yeah it happens a lot this game looks like from the 80s well that's it steve i mean it is it is set in the 80s but do you mean it looks like a game from the 80s i don't agree with you if that's what you mean yes i understand it's one just played please pizza oh i could go for a pizza you know nice pepperoni

you only listen okay you don't watch i suppose if you're at work your boss might catch you you also be like what are you why are there explosions coming from your desk what's going on here you can't find this map it's annoying bro this map comes up all the time for me it's like the most popular map that was my kill dude are you you're an animator enemies i didn't even realize that guy was an animal i was around the corner dice what kind of pizza should i get is pepperoni a good shout out i think it's a good shot oh mark dude just got his head blown off insane come in peace thank you for

chest at the bottom there's a shark i just don't i just don't believe you i losing b i'm gonna do it anyway if there's a shark i'm gonna be so happy i mean it just it just kills me guys spy plane established overhead you get to a certain point and then it's restricted then you just start dying you need that jalapeno and cheese combo on your pizza my dude it's mouth heaven ginger king video thing thank you for the advice i like jalapenos i never used to when i was uh younger i didn't really like him but as i've got older my tastes have changed i'm all about the jalapeno man it makes me feel alive again you know get out of here ollie gaming get out of here as you can't bait me in with sharks that's not fair yeah neon arcade we are live at 4k yeah this is a native 4k though so if i was playing a game on pc like i'm gonna be tomorrow you'll see that's the true 4k quality on youtube looks good didn't it it's very expensive though to be able to stream at this resolution ah generally locked down you swear one of these days he's gonna breathe fire i'm gonna breathe fire what does that mean i don't think i'm a dragon actually i've never i've never checked maybe i should check up losing charlie securing d runner oh my god i didn't know what that sound was is it a rattlesnake or something what's what's going on turns out it's a proximity mine now we know i've not properly paid attention to it before now i have been killed by a couple times but never again hey my proximity might kill someone can we not how did you get me uh cameron thank you for becoming a phantom that's very kindly guys we talked about spawn kills and you've gone ahead and give me a spawn kill we're not cool with that enemy there's no one on e so why isn't that guy capturing it please go capture losing b securing e come back we're being dominated take those positions taking i kind of wish you could grab onto it from there where does that go then oh a shark there is a shark guys you weren't you weren't basing me i love you it's actually a shark i'm so excited right now i've gotta there's multiple sharks multiple hostile spired can you get killed by them [Music] probably not i'm so happy right now they've got fish air as well look there's fish i down this kind of weird offensive i mean it is swaying a lot okay it's quite hard to hit when you're in the water sniping i don't know where that bullet is going i think it's inaccurate you know looking at that i look like a hit above the crosshair oh maybe i'm just bad maybe i'm just bad we knew all along it's all a ruse revenge revenge of this artillery strike as well that was terrible there was a guy down there using the repel so i couldn't use it to survive multiple enemies i don't know why the repels are like that in um in warzone they're the same aren't they only one person at a time can use the repel strange i wonder what the uh technical reason for that is if there is this guy here somewhere he's still losing it there's still someone there it's quite a big capture zone isn't it there is a shark easter egg in every game ever made yeah we were right good job chat we knew all along thank you for the
