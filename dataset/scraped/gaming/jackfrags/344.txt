hi guys and welcome to call of duty warzone season 3 reloaded so a big update went out for the game today and it added a few things to the map including nakatomi plaza from die hard it also added rambo actual rambo and john mcclane from die hard there's a ton of meta changes too there he is looking good generally speaking cold war sniper rifles have been buffed the ppsh has been buffed they've also changed the way the suppressors work and this is really important a lot of people are going to be running the sound suppressor now on smgs instead of the agency also on sniper rifles this is important cold war only because the mw1s haven't changed at all the 5 mw what laser now improves your ads speed so a lot of people are going to be taking that as well a couple of other map changes too including some weird tents that have been put up and some cia outposts there's also a new game mode and they've got this 80s action hero event i haven't played any real matches today the only thing i've done is jump in and get a thumbnail so i'm looking forward to this we're going to be playing today with tomographic and handler i've never played with handler before his name is ryan but he's got a really cool channel up on youtube where he does modern warfare warzone stuff but thank you all for joining me today just a heads up as well if you guys pick up any of these new operators in the store do consider using my creative code jackfrags and if you buy them tweet me a pic and i'll feature you in a future video now there's also an explosive combat bow kill streak don't know much about that don't know how you get that but i wanted to show you guys the takedowns for the new operators because they're kind of cool you can't preview them in the menu anymore for some reason so we've got rambo's got two and they're kind of insane so this is the first one so i just recorded this in a lobby of plunder check this out i mean what the hell throws a knife leaps into the air explosive crossbow oh explosive bow and arrow pretty crazy um rambo's second one is like this brutal knife takedown like what's i mean did he really need to stab him that many times two three three three times crazy and then john mcclane bruce willis he's got like three gun skins and one takedown 228 i think it was i think he does this in the movie surrenders and then pulls out a gun but there's no gun in his hand there for some reason [Applause] interesting i haven't seen die hard in ages i mean it's a great movie i haven't seen in a while but does that happen in the movie i don't remember it does happen in the movie interesting also today i forgot to show you guys sorry today is the last day that you can get the limited edition warzone year one poster loads of you guys have already picked this up but it's going forever tomorrow if you're interested in getting this link is down in the description below there's all sorts of easter eggs and references to war zone year one in there created this with a artist called taisel very talented link is below if you want to pick it up it's also available on t-shirt that said let's get into the gameplay see if the boys are ready and we'll jump into a game hello hello jack you boys ready yes sir sir join in on tom send you an invite have you seen the size of uh john mcclane's head what do you think is it that big it's too big you reckon it doesn't have shoes yeah oh yeah are there any other operators in the game that don't have shoes i don't think it's him yeah i've never seen toes in this game before i don't know if i like it next gen modern warfare engine toes that's when he crawls through the vent isn't it see outfit he's wearing yeah so i guess he took his shoes off i don't remember but his head is definitely way too big are we doing regular trios or did you want to try anything else i'm done for whatever you guys want we can try that anymore let's do like maybe we do power grab just to get ourselves into the action and then slow down sure i think this mode is a little too crazy by the sounds of it it's probably a good way to like explore the uh the new drop what's the description of this game mode it's very vague okay what was it just collect tags to earn rewards yeah but there's so much more to it what rewards so like you'll see when we get in the game on the right hand side apparently um as you get kills you can work your way up to like a specialist bonus like a modern warfare and there's kill streaks that you get unlocked um like you get an airstrike at like seven kills or something and then you work your way up to like a respawn token which works the same way as it does in uh rebirth right but it's all it's all very weird is there a circle i think so yeah it's normal br it's just this extra thing okay close abs man my god yeah sylvester stallone was jacked for those movies it's crazy i guess he's probably still pretty jacked though to be fair yeah and he looks a bit smarter it's just the set the size of those apps oh it feels so good oh they buffed all the cold water you want to be using the um thunder the sound moderator now instead of the the last suppressor really on some of it's not like if you're using one that's got a load of range then you might as well use the giu because it doesn't slow the ads as much okay but uh yeah the the nimble snipes like the swiss you put the first suppressor on it you get like an increased ads speed as well as a nice booster bullet lossy that's really snappy yeah i built the tundra but i put a agency on it maybe i should change it i think with the zrg you can you'll benefit from the sound moderator because it's so heavy now warm-ups done time to kick back a bit of mobility crazy bullet velocity anyway i don't think you'd feel the difference right in the gi on it yeah maybe the tundra is worth trying some other way what was that today uh yeah i was gonna try the tundra so is this there's some new contracts there then unfinished business so that's how you start the that's where the news is for the vaults yeah they're always there but that's how you start the the vault contract you might as well land on one i haven't been here at all yet jack this is also my first impression of it uh which one do you want to go for uh yeah i don't know which one's more contested at this stage oh you start with the milano yeah apparently you come back with the weapons you had okay there's somebody's a lot of people yeah that one uh that looks like pain jesus i think we should get a respawn i mean there's so many dog tags there what the hell here we go okay dude they're all gone you spawn with full armor as well oh yeah yeah yeah the dog tags if you run over them you get all of your plates back well there's one here whoa i'm super speedy yeah like it's like shield swapping apex okay is it like cranked where you move faster as you get killed yeah yeah yeah okay it gave me a uav as well stud was saying what you should do is fight around a dog tag and then when you're getting hit by the enemy you could just run through it and get all your health mid-fight right are we going to go just explore the tower i mean this seems to be the spot that everyone just dives there's an actual [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] here i'm in the parking garage and it is very hectic in here oh he's loaded something i don't want pushing in the building wait there are blocks like actual like ai bots shut the door there's bots in this really i'm killing henchmen or something oh no right now and there's a bunch of bots i don't actually know what you get from grabbing that dog tank jack i think it's a respawn you see your tokens on the right hand side above all the killstreaks oh my god yeah i'll still drop it into the area what this is very confusing i thought i was trying these guys and i'm like wait a minute those aren't real players literally bots you know bots can be uh challenging i guess [Applause] there is a christmas tree i mean it doesn't feel very christmasy in may i have to be honest i mean it's come on jack die hard christmas well is it it's the biggest debate ever of course i go for that in there it's an easter egg do i i'm moving so fast for this crank [Applause] every kill you get will boost your movement speed jack even if you've played the crank game mode in modern warfare before permanently or look at me look at me you are quite fast okay i've slowed down now should we go to the top of the tower oh this one here i'm going up oh right okay this goes all the way to the top oh my god so how can we get handler back in the game then i know there is a set uh yeah if he hasn't unlocked the respawn then i got only broken you only get so many respawns yeah i guess so i'm back this is cool man this is like a really elaborate map design it's cavernous isn't it i mean i've got nowhere i don't know where i'm going or you can't get loadouts in this mode though jack okay you can only use there's an attack helicopter as well yeah it will kill you if you take it out it drops much of root i think yeah but these it's not like that though is it it's uh it's like the plunder ones that just shoot yeah how you doing there jack uh it's okay i mean it's a bit chaotic right are you fine people um there were some people up there i don't know how to get here okay so there's a whole new level here a whole new level i don't want to just throw it down but so how accurate do you think this is to the movie because i haven't seen it in ages yeah i haven't seen any ages ages ages it's probably like 16 or something sorry on the rooftop that rpg went through the building heavy weapon drop yeah what's that about yeah so that'll be like a minigun or oh we can get up there tom look there's one on the roof i don't know where the stairs are jack yeah right here on me okay be careful there's people running around um is that a minigun then or something i mean what's uh i don't actually know it just sounds like it might be because they're out at the moment now so losing ground are those enemies up there good cover thank you i opened the crate but [Applause] get anything let's go on the left i'm so you were right about this game being complicated there's so much to it [Music] you got a respawn jack uh yeah i mean that's the first time i've died nice that crate is still at the very top okay can i grab that respawns back dude i just slid after you using the speed boost i went for miles oh my god okay that one takes ages to open so i imagine there's something good in this although the zone is coming [Music] i'm lost it's a grenade launcher and a pbs that is unfortunate disappointment an artillery marker that's okay well that's something [Applause] how big is this artillery gonna well i'm sorry i've just artillery this is all right what did you say tom this one it's a [ __ ] oh god that must be in the movie those steps to find so they've got they've got voice lines from the movie for these characters yeah i don't think it's being done from here like redone by other voice actors so there's literally no way we can get ryan back we can buy him mr buy station there was a a thing that dropped at some point that we missed that was called the respawn drop right so i guess if we capture that it brings whoever's down back huh look at this scout yeah i guess supply box that is rest yeah my guns are kind of awful as well wait i've got three guns yeah i've just realized that as well one two double tap one yeah you can carry four i think oh good oh god [Applause] acquired i wonder if we'll get any of this in the main vr eventually [Music] a specialist token i'm thinking of specialists was in the easter egg bunker right yeah the juggernauts yeah we can buy we can buy ryan but [Music] okay overdrive the dog tags gave me overdrive and i can run really fast and slide like a crazy person what forever nah look oh it stopped you'll see it when you pick one up there's a little uh circle that pops up at the bottom of your screen it's on a timer but if you chain it if you keep getting kills it'll stay okay ryan there's a lot of love for you in my chat right now man [Applause] so you can carry expected three weapons or four i think it's four two okay maybe i'm wrong maybe it's just three oh i got a crate what's that do this is crazy dude this is wait no it's a loadout box i thought it was just going to be like the little drone thing oh my god that's a respawn token though right what did that do [Music] okay yeah that's that's that's something that is back i guess there's no snipers in this mode i feel so naked oh no i can't believe that i'm so sorry yeah just blame it on jack's placement of the drop it wasn't me it was wrong okay it was a self-inflicted roll out of the truck expectation for so long we finally bring him back and that's the first action he does yo what has happened here you can't get so this has been broken for the since the colder ones come no here there's people up on the array as well i've got a specialist so i can see his steps right now he was just trying to direct me to kill him what's that what's up i'm behind there you go buddy what the hell [Music] oh you enjoyed it i think i hear someone in here tom okay there might be someone in there there's people down here as well should we have a go look there's loads dude they've got a mini gun or something [Applause] oh you got to start spraying that gas green [Applause] [Applause] uh you put an ammo box down dude you're good i think i had self-rest yes okay [Applause] it's dead here i'll find yeah i don't like sylvester stallone speaking to me it's weird was that sylvester yeah something nothing like him it didn't sound like him i think it's just from the movie and it's just bad quality because it's from the 80s oh my god you could slide forever yeah all right boys yeah let's go yeah buy station marks 14 000 basically so let's just feel the safer option you know it's weird having this many guys i've got two pharah's a grenade launcher and a bbs age i'm only meant to buy another gas mask you tommy it lasts like 30 seconds man you [ __ ] can't buy you kidding come on please tom tomlinson i can't buy what do you mean it doesn't let you buy it right i guess we'll get this one no no no no no no don't kill me don't come with me don't wait oh my god is [Applause] the pain i guess i don't want nice uh i've been counting tonight this guy's above one alright so i mean are we gonna be able to use this playstation i think we should at least oh where did that come from yeah what was the airstrike yeah i didn't get a warning okay okay i think i'm safe tom okay as long as they don't kill you you'll be fine right okay i'll have the sound of that dog has dropped down from the sky and his body yo they got a mini gun up there [Applause] it's done i think i'm using double sniper man so you got the minigame [Music] okay let's go i'm just going forward all right i think where exactly i'm coming to get you rambo with a minigun oh my god let's let's go it's not great though is it in warzone it's not very good i mean it'll be good now that we're in this zone overdrive [Applause] is up there oh look at that last zone i think i should have one respawn yeah i think you have one more yeah this mode is crazy survive tom so i should respawn with everything that i had yeah i'm down no no oh my god the save are you back jack yeah i'm back okay he's got south front he's going to finish me keep the pressure on minigun it's all on you [Applause] i don't want it to be all on me you know why is my heart rate increased in real life or in real life i don't know i mean is this a stressful environment for you i thought that was yes this guy's running on the uh the lower platform jack he's directly below you is it yeah yeah on that brown turn around a bit a bit more to the right there he is [Applause] get to the chopper either kill everyone or stay well how many people are left so eight people eight yeah you've got the minigun i think you just wait watch and try and captain what if it's a super quick axe fill like really fast yeah like the gulag flag or maybe [Music] did you play roe jack no oh yeah bring believes him yeah yeah it's like that isn't it i have to race to the heller next track okay so that's out of that movie soldier ain't coming any soldier incoming are you serious have you got any streaks left or no i've got nothing no i've got a mini gun and a dream time he's capping it [Applause] oh man oh god i don't know i don't know might get me oh my god dude i've got that advanced gas mask though i can yeah that's a good idea actually yeah i'm saying the gas for ages let's play the gas this is really really freaky you can see when the cabin is the bottom okay yeah let's go jack go go the other ones are [Applause] [Music] wait there's still to be enemies i don't know where they are what they're using their gas masks i guess i'll just stay and hope i get it waiting for you let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go we do it let's oh my god what the hell man that was fun but i don't know if it was like it's so rapidly like just chilling next to you that's the weirdest game mode ever not war zone it's like an lcm like uh not well i don't know like one of those events when they were unrevealed something like the cold war revealed it was more fun than the zombies thing before we set the nuke off yeah it does feel like something new that doesn't it yeah it's a lot going on though my god my brain is just completely frazzled right now [Applause] i think there were just three solos who were afraid of shooting anyone yeah they were like oh that guy's got a minigun and they didn't know it's actually awful oh you put it to work though gg um do you want to try normal tree i don't know if i can do another one of those straight away yeah i want to try and do the uh i mean we started that match trying to do the vault but everyone's going there in that mode what's the vault then what's what's the deal with that well you uh you start that contract i don't really know the whole thing but you start the contract and then there's some instructions to blow up a vault and once you get in there you get 100 000 in cash sorry yeah i'm just a hundred thousand hundred grand no yeah just a hundred thousand in cash you so you can do that in a normal br match you can just get a hundred cases there's three new contracts around the buildings like you saw in that at the start that's like last match okay damn yeah right 10 loadouts if you want you actually could buy 10 loaders yeah i don't know why but you could or you can just give to the poor stand on the roof somewhere and just chuck loadout money down for no just make it rain yeah that was so hectic gg gg's clutching that up that mini gun actually came in gave him pretty clutch get yourselves a proper wall that will be deployed soon uh guys i hope you enjoyed that um i wasn't expecting to win the first game to be honest with you but thank you for all tuning in we've got 10 000 people watching which is just crazy uh thank you so much guys how you all doing have you had a good week nearly friday nearly nearly friday we're nearly there my arm is really sore actually i got my first um fizer shot yesterday and i feel a bit tired and my arm is sore but apart from that i'm good so it's going to be pretty chill for a couple hours you know it won't be that energetic tonight but yeah that was pretty intense all man that's enough simon thank you for the 100 appreciate that buddy ivan you just turned 22 on tuesday happy birthday man it's a good age cool to see you play with handler yeah paul he seems like a really chill dude i've seen a couple of his videos as well he's very good great control player what's up cst hey clay christopher mark garrett what's up right okay so we'll see what the uh new map is like [Applause] nice job so it's just crates then like a scavenger thing [Applause] okay oh yeah i guess okay so we've got that one i've got [Applause] oh you double tap there yeah and it just i don't know i'm so dead should i come back down all the way up to floor 30. i mean they're both like ruined but i mean i was just killed by rambo how did it feel jeff felt like rambo part two mounted on his car [Applause] is the contract like over it had i think we had one more crate to get yeah i don't know what happens after that though you get a key card or something right i figured i'd save this so it's my first impressions as well for the content so extra this background my god is a new like is there any menu soundtrack uh yeah it's like a 80s b-roll i guess um i have my music quite low though so yeah i've only recently started turning on because it makes solo videos much more intense should i switch to john mclean do you buy both yeah use code jackfrags thanks summer i got you man i think they've done a pretty good job with his likeness but his head is uh massive john mcclane yeah absolute melon head then if he looks any different in cold war i bet he looks worse in cold war it's different engine isn't it so yeah not as advanced i mean the scale of the head more than anything oh the scale you reckon the scale might be better it's so alien grab some target practice while you can that's what it looks to me like like an alien like no like like alien is an alien jack you know the horror movie yeah like you know how the alien itself has a massive head right yeah that's what he's animals he's from another yeah there's animals that's what he's trying to think warzone john mclean is basically a xenomorph yes okay it's good tile guys that's a good title yeah i'll hit all the all the seo everyone's saying send them off and stun the phone at the same time you deal with the c4s you get a key card which you can use to open the vault okay matt first match what was that tama my brain is still on overload after that first match you've been drinking energy for tonight no just uh i mean yes thanks jack and i've got a g fuel right now delicious oh yeah i hear the soundtrack it's pretty good do you think bruce willis knows that he's in war zone that's what i was yeah we were discussing that when you were definitely oh wait i feel like it's definitely a royalty there's definitely a partnership going on because i think you saw call of duty tweet out because uh broadcasting die hard and they did like a watch party for it right so there's definitely some some sort of promo going on between the two companies or the three i guess the die hard and rambo by the same like publishers in studio same studio like universal or something uh maybe i bet disney owns them they're showing everything down there sir [Applause] you were bought by disney yeah okay how much did they pay for me go away oh this guy's going for it he got it yeah he's got it i'm breathing today there's still one oh it's so cavernous though entire building i don't know it fills me out of all the things they've added to the map maybe this is the best in terms of the biggest yeah like people actually wanting to go there you know yeah i'm down it's a guy on this building didn't realize um yeah definitely because when the um when the update went live over dansgate 4 it wasn't really one of those spots i guess summit was kind of popular but yeah nothing that everyone descended on i think so much just too far if they survive they can redeploy he's on green ryan the very top yeah right this up all right could oh don't know does that repel that ends up inside doesn't it yeah you went up 30 floors last time you went on that way i have this zip line but i don't know if this will when you go to get on a zip if you look at the name when it says attached to zip it'll tell you how many floors you're gonna go up [Applause] you're doing it all right all right yeah okay let's go he killed tom [Applause] i come to him you're good yeah wesley science would be great heinz [Applause] oh so these choppers just patrol it in every right then just shoot at you yeah i didn't expect the attack helicopter to be there in normal yeah because they're in plunder and they're sewing no for this one if you take that out it drops something okay you sure yeah because there's another tower that happens in [Music] [Music] [Applause] dude that thing is horrible i don't like that oh we need some money yeah that building is like a ground wall map just mushed together enemy uav over here dropping in waypoint where is it i just got voice lines from the movie this guy here they could have recorded it oh yeah guess i'm dead okay it's kind of weird because the voice quality of these lines is nice because they're on like a they've put like a walkie-talkie post post part of the you know what i mean the voice chat effect yeah obviously couldn't find many for enemies because it's just the same one when you pinged yeah i'll find a place i'll find a place i'll find a place oh yeah that was definitely a place i'll find a place are we gonna find [Applause] impressionists do it but i guess uh truck here oh yeah can't really do anything about that one's out of the truck yeah actually the guy on the truck the airstrike i think we're on uav i guess somebody else is dropping in it was the guy on the truck that airstrike you're on the roof son yeah oh that throne knife though hello here is it found a sniper rifle found and killed coming up tom there's still one person right next to me on the outside i'm just gonna full send over to you yep somebody's in this building [Music] good there's another one directly underneath me jeff and if you have an angle uh i'm gonna shoot over in your building okay i just throw the play box down [Applause] can we afford loadout now we can right yes yeah i'm dropping cash down i only got 700. i can live with that there's still someone right here right here [Music] you sure another one on me i'm in trouble here [Applause] a little bit wait this goes with the specialist bonus uh from the tower maybe did they do the vault or something too okay did you buy uh we did not we got a free one okay i'm gonna use that one this dude had a stoner is it stoner star never left i think i did like one video on it and it was pretty good but i didn't use it after that i mean i was trying to use it when we played with stanley of the day but oh my god you're so slow though with it yeah i felt really i couldn't keep up with you guys why is this crate like highlighted because we have a specialist bonus it's that thing that scans claymores and stuff let's try this tundra oh yeah the ads is a lot faster with the uh sound suppressor that feels nice ryan's a result of his own stream sniper no jack by just naming himself a user with a load of numbers you know what that's a great idea it's a great idea you really need it when you play multiplayer just getting recognized all the time isn't very fun do you change your account name every now and again no because activision only gives you like one token every six months no way yeah [Applause] you've got a couple of accounts though right i do not that heli just doesn't leave does it i guess you would be fighting up there yeah you'd need some rocket launchers right take it out dude if we got specialists of those guys that's huge my chat is saying that's from the vault obviously i'm on that guy okay so they must have done the oh no dude what the hell man okay so do you think they put that in just to stop rude campus in downtown is that what that's for i guess but it's not very fair to the people who no it's not fair but it's there like i think if you're on top of that roof i don't think the heli would oh god they dressed up there you can buy there's a bike station on the roof no way just gonna snipe the pilot hang on oh i did you can do that no maybe you just hit it at the damage no no no no no no i just got a red headshot hit marker by shooting where the pilot is is there a is there a man in there though is there a figure yeah yeah see him you killed him i didn't think it would actually happen i was doing it for a laugh and no one laughed and then it happened and now i'm the one apparently if you use cold-blooded it doesn't attack you i had no idea he could do that so battlefield moment right there it's on that that is the fact that he's going on the clips channel jack it's going on the battlefield things you can do in vf6 i mean all i've really done is save the guys who are on that roof yeah you've given them the package yeah and they're going to kill us yeah i mean it's only a heavy weapon drop and you know we all know that's the gas is moving what if they put like a multi-lock missile launcher in it or something either something new something crazy oh they jumped off there this way i'll get a uav yeah that was orange his teammates further back [Music] oh i'm getting high alerted uh top of hospital [Music] he needs to raise his buddies doesn't mean we've just down both of them uh i finished one this might finish there's multiple teams out sniped by another dude yeah i gotta kill the top hospital okay under the bridge are we going to zone these yeah yeah nice shots um i gave up yeah i just gave up swiss swiss uh we could get self-resistance maybe or uav yeah so there was somebody in the top hospital earlier i downed him and got the kill okay dude this is so exposed with all the fences and stuff [Music] yes sir thank you finally no this is i don't know it's not as big as the tower no there's no way what do you mean in general you know it used to be in general yeah they might be ghosted ryan kevin oh um i don't know i don't know i might be seeing things i just don't think i've been here that much since the map changed i think that's what it is yeah it's cleared contract for the heck of it [Applause] you've got gas inbound safe zone relocated [Applause] hamlet do you think you play more modern warfare uh recently i've been doing more war zones but for the past year or so it's mainly been search and destroy he's a gamer next objective located they're two separate games though aren't they you can only compare the two mechanics of the same the attachments come over which is nice from the two games but extra settlements [Applause] this actually feels like quite a substantial update i'm surprised hmm [Applause] i think they undersold it a bit to be honest we're getting like two movie skins and that's it the fact we've got an actual die hard themed drop spot which isn't gimmicky yeah it's kind of crazy [Applause] with its own like vault type thing my bob i think i'm a jig [Applause] oh someone just shot at us then i think yeah twins up on twins oh yeah yeah that one hello oh no you want to open the front it's all for me this is tracker three one yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yep so ready to just snipe him out the sky someone just shot at them maybe bang okay it's just up down here i'm being beamed absolutely beamed and thank you stay with me that's horrible yeah i don't like the voice things it's like mono isn't it yeah it's playing through my monitor speakers [Applause] down jack i can't have him shooting my boy like that song you know no i respect it i appreciate it he's still uh top of this building right here yeah sure your heart's right jack drop [ __ ] police [Music] [Applause] at least two on this building right here [Applause] that's the guy from before yeah i just need the terminator and wesley snipes maybe mr t robocop get down from here okay this is a good fight i like this fight yeah here i'll come close now i haven't got the confirmation i'll find a place i'll find a place you may not have been raised right here he's not looking at me he's running he's running eyes i might die to the gas we'll see i should be okay [Applause] is so nice yeah like i'm just seeing people's uh tracker first steps back is a great perk especially for solos oh yeah okay we're down a good position really enemy uav uses buildings to cross i guess moving out we shot out from this direction before don't think so convenient uav in a box friendly uav overhead try to push the buy station yeah hit the buy i'll get another self and everyone has ghosts of course they do we've got gas moving [Applause] in it's just heidi from the recon drone over here oh you need cold blooded for that one what's the one wait okay did i see something on the radar next list for him like one second i want to buy gas masks or

god for every single like a weapon i'll find a place not now maybe later i don't know maybe later there isn't a there isn't one for the most wanted contract [Music] [Applause] that was the most wanted yeah apparently you mark something and the character says no no not now maybe later i'll find a place god it's that's the amount of lines of dialogue they could have used it didn't have to be from die hard as well [Music] he's just looking all right for a new apartment in london can we not just rob someone from another movie or is that actually copyright in some way [Applause] i got yeah extra

up the stairs i'm holding [Music] no okay at the end of the day uh here at the end of the day i'll find a plate i'll find some plates [Laughter] are we still looking for one triple threat [Applause]

need to regain the load [Applause] get ready i just hear bruce willis kev yeah i'm playing as john mcclane in die hard you win this fight and you return to the front line but if you lose you're done here sort them out or capture the objective [Applause] [Music] they're on the road jack the other team yeah you see him one got downed standby i don't think we should drop there ryan i think that's pain definitely not yes i'm sure jack will find a place honestly i don't know if military is even looted there's so many contracts there you want to hit military let's do it yeah look down there i got a kimbo gulag headshot from mid-range in my fight it was great i just had rambo versus john mclean and the guru like oh well the ultimate showdown oh wait guys bad guys in um all an experiment horror villains in like freddy krueger i mean it'd be great if they did i mean they've added uh and they added jason didn't they uh no well they've got they've got the saw skin so it's not wow [Applause] [Applause] that's like one of those dj khaled things at the start of this one [Applause] was he in there he's left the view left of you one in the building as well i was so dead anyway almost daddied and they had me on heartbeat we spend that entire round at factory fighting just teams and teams just keep coming back and we never found the place i'll find a place that's the only reason why we landed there is to find the place we didn't find a place i definitely know if it's worth it time you found a place what was that a plate time you found some plates i mean that's probably why they did it no one can decipher the same place or place do you think because john mcclane is barefoot he has no footstep sounds oh my god that would be interesting used to just not put shoes on your character because it was louder than normal oh my god it's a game mechanic we promise yeah your feet were quieter on mud and stuff snake blisking yeah that's a good shot stevens 288 thanks for the five get yourself what's your plan to use now since mid season update i know man the met is really good the game feels very balanced right now stevens they also i didn't mention this at the start they massively reduce the spawn rate of stopping power which is great great change but the meta in terms of guns like ram 7 is really strong farah's really strong a max is very good still lc10 mac 10.

changed massively they've made it like they wanted to make it like an anti-tank rifle so they've made it super slow i broke him it's really cumbersome now so you're going to want to use that sound moderator suppressor instead of the last suppressor you going for that ryan i have dead yeah he's in on the stairwell broken other staircase i'll back you up if i can uh you can't find a way unless you go all the way across ryan [Applause] he is not on heartbeat anymore so he ran okay um he did i thought i thought i put it yet i wanted for webbing uh here's something nice well you have to try this swiss jack oh you're going to smoke pretty nice no [Laughter] it doesn't have much fun with that tundra not gonna lie let's let's swap overhead bro healthy target has been marked kill him don't

teammates now as well wait wait yeah in vehicles you jump out the vehicle and let it drive into them i saw a clip earlier where someone literally just go over them and kill them well let's test it you have the uh do you have the swiss level jack sorry do you have the swiss level at all uh like 30 or something i think we should be able to do the build then okay because the first suppressor unlock is
