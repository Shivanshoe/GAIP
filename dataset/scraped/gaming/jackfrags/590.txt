hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to more call of duty warzone today we are going to be focusing on what i think is still the best gun in the game and that is the bruin now it's a gun i've not really used that much in warzone i've leveled it up and typically i've always gravitated towards assault rifles mp5s and snipers for warzone especially when you're playing in trios and quads but i've just stayed away from the bruin but after using it myself for a few days i really understand why it it just is the best weapon in the game even though it was nerfed recently it beats a lot of assault rifles in most situations it might sound a bit silly but those are the facts and this is what we're going with today this is the loadout we've got here monolithic suppressor xrk barrel attack laser i've gone for the hollow sight some people like the vlk because i think it has a slight reduction to recoil on it but for me i prefer the closer range scope 60 round mag of course you want that under barrel some people put the commando for grip on and swap that out for the tack laser i don't think you need the commando for grip on the bruin simply because the recoil on it is so i mean it's super easy to control so this is what we're using today we're going full meta and i feel like in the kind of lobbies where everyone is competitive everyone is using meta weapons if you're not using those weapons you will often just lose so that's what we're doing today i'm playing with the wonderful study and westy today and we should have a good time i'm really looking forward to this so we're gonna unmute and see if they're ready to go hey guys hello hello are you ready to go yeah we are indeed just send me another room yeah send me an invite as well please come thank you no worries there you go got him right let's do this so what what guns are you guys going with today ram you're going to try ram you're on the run i'm going to try the holga because apparently it got buffed but i don't know if it's really good enough even with the buff such a sink yeah i've not used the whole get i don't think i've ever used the whole getting one of my own loadouts i've picked it up off the floor ground loop but never purposefully chosen it it's one of those guns in war zone that you rarely ever see but um there is a there's a like purple tier blueprint in in warzone at the moment if you open the crates there's one in there which is quite decent actually um but i thought i'd build one and see if it works yeah although on dayz it was up to the north west kind of like where the airport is yeah did you play much daisy cameron i played a bit with like with my friends and stuff when i used to like when i first started working they all played it yeah and um like they were the ones who convinced me to buy a gaming pc so i could play it with them right and um yeah we ended up playing like a good few hundred hours of it oh damn yeah it was just like we had like a like a group and we'd all just like jump on every few nights and like try and do some stuff collect gear and whatnot yeah loads of people up there on orange they didn't play didn't play much more than the normal mods to be honest we've got a redcat access card and get out of here yeah you want to yeah all right guy here guy here right here being sniped where's he at down the team nice job he was a sight it was a solo where's the hell yeah uh it's in the airfield isn't it yeah let's go hopefully no one's dropped that car there no hell he's gone hell he's gone oh shoot the pilot damage it do anything you can we need that come back that's ruined us it's ruined all of our plans we can get a car no it's not yeah yeah go go for the car yeah a normal gun no one else is going to be there no which one are we going for by the way um you want to go to the one at damn or do you want to go out like back of quarry and plummet god [Music] one down dead nice oh my god nice that's a decoy yeah right let's get out of it good thing my stopping power works oh my god look at the vehicle that ruined it's stuck right off the edge of the building oh that's full jurassic park that is why is that skin you've got that's kind of sick uh it's battle past one from this season it's all black so shadow company is getting something it is trick 50 points watch out for the old lady squirrel okay we're going out the one about quarry yeah i mean we get our load out right now yeah it's too low oh the stupid buy station thing it's annoying oh yeah i hate it when it does that all right um can anyone buy me please please oh yeah uh oh no hang on apparently [Laughter] do you actually need plates do you need a spare uh no i'm good i'm good i'm gonna [Music] starting with the body hello hello look at that thick booty [Music] been doing his squats oh good being hunted any other fun oh no no oh there's someone resting over there on blue no do you want to go there's someone else pressing right here on this one oh no anyone i don't want to take a pot shot see him no one's taking a shower maybe no no they're fighting each other cool i mean why are we going bunker now well i mean might be money kill streaks might as well all right more money more memes there could be a mini gun or a juggernaut suited there's todd just think about the memes couldn't you get juggernauts dude i think you can get him in there yeah you're lucky [Music] that'd be fun fun what's that is this where is this yeah sorry it's a little bit further along is it i liked it it was good fbi [Music] i wonder if that there was just like a wind token and it dropped it in in here and you just pick it up and you win or a nuke it just comes up war zone victory that's called the bruin that's the bruin right now so you're describing here we go memes totally worth it look at that satchel all right ammo oh armor box yeah that was good that was 100 worth now we just break through this door here what's the code does anyone know the code it's uh one four twenty two three four five six four five seven eight nine seven what did you say eight and nine after that yeah hey uh it's wrong code cameron they must have changed it that's definitely not my pin number damn i thought that'd be it could have been onto something there could you drop that ammo box thought please i just need a bit of a ar and snipey where are we going do we want to push quarry in like yeah a hill here maybe do we want to run it or vehicle it run it run it back oh look is this has this always been open here yeah that's always good it's always been open okay that's where the nukes coming out of dude do you think they'll be an in-game event or will they just do a patch and a cinematic an in-game event would be would be too much like think about how many resources for literally one event would be you know if the map changes do you think they've got the capacity to do it on this engine no no way they would have to they would have copies of models on every single model and texture on the map it would be mental okay sorry that could be double the file size yeah in-game event is starting and then you just see a bar come up on the screen downloading 120 gig would you imagine all right they were fighting here oh they're still fighting here yeah sounds like it can down to the left as well maybe i think that was all down to the left right on green just going in the building now okay which side you go left or right uh he went left i left into the closer building yeah you want to get ghost from that loadout if we're playing quarry then yeah it's kind of important wait apparently ghost doesn't protect you from um what's the chords anymore advanced uav no the little hand trackers what are they called baby mona yeah it doesn't protect you from baby monitor anymore oh that's a shame i'll play right here i tried to snipe him couldn't get him okay well played i don't know if that's true i think it still does keep you off baby mono otherwise what would be the point of the baby monitor oh they're resting again look they just are they just like farming each other for kills or something what's going on they're both just res both teams maybe the guy's still on the left okay let's go upstairs can you get up here yeah you can hit the high ground down again i'll get it where's that respawn at i'm not sure i can't see anyone there's all this shooting going on from here down in this building they've both teams rest either side of cory yeah down in the box at the bottom of that building this guy behind in inquiry hey just fighting rpg house where is he cam i'm not sure i saw him on the mini map dude he nearly hit us with that rpg yeah he was behind pretty close he was one below i think he was like right there smg here disregard that was he gone he's running away is he running coming to you guys watch out west he might be right below yeah someone else shooting yeah i've been shot from north west up on the hill i think oh yeah from behind from behind uh trying to see where's that behind the three funny yeah no he's like he's like between us and the next building deck he was in like behind the tree annoyingly it's not a really good spot is that let's uh jump down there are those people on me on you can you drop down got him got him got him luckily i got away with it oh my god what gun was he using uh beaten m4 there with what oh that was the guy that killed me with the ram yeah yeah there's a gas mask here anyone need a gas mask oh you got any spare plates no so we had a team i think there's two different teams one was pushing up from southwest yeah all your loot is still there cameron on the roof but it might be a bit risky to get all right i'll give it a go all right he shot us from here jack on blue okay that's where he shot us from exactly was that the the guy with the m4 yeah i guess i don't i don't i don't think it was the same guy i think it was a different guy he was the guy that killed me hmm all the loot just disappeared i'll play uh on this roof here two of them move in here one down i'm inside dead oh play guys well done i bet that was the rpg guy yeah i think you're probably right okay my gears here that's fine we could probably go and loot them as well yeah i'm moving across the bridge third team is going to be like over here somewhere on blue those are the ones that shot you with the dmr i think it was like a ground sks that's what it sounded like play in i'm sure i got shot from the hill at one point as well most wanted target right there right there oh they go resting again resting again right in front of us moving from the the shop to our west i reckon they'll be in this building here there's just someone hiding there with infinite money or something maybe i've just seen that i've just saw the uh parachute um shadow it was where is it where's this king so he's going to be hiding in like blue or something yeah the king is just chilling in there we could uh we could easily put it i just seen him yeah do you want to push him yeah yeah listed watch out for blue yeah full team you need a couple plates scam i've got one now i'm all good i've got two now okay i mean we could do with a bounty really couldn't we well yeah there is a bounty in that building but we'll have to run through this unknown area where he's probably hiding in blue he's right here on the bike hey guys he's gonna go res again wasn't he yeah he was to race again it wasn't the team light though it wasn't the team wipe against alphas oh yeah good shot there's a gas mask there as well got that you go for the bounty yeah pick it up start get it oh i'm just being come on holger there you go got him down and then i got shot from the west as well oh yeah there's a sniper on top of the building miles away oh my god i got him okay that was dangerous oh he wasn't even shooting me then was it yeah he was shooting at me jack and you ran through the bullet dude i took that one for you cameron thanks jack uh they're on can you see can you it's the big building miles away started all the way over there what about this guy you down cam that was close to us uh i think he got finished off by someone else so i think they must have sniped him putting an airstrike on it a blind bag spawn what someone rest double down nice jack nice i don't know where he's going he was right here he was right here just gone in the train carriage one out the other side there he is let's push him come on let's get rid of this yeah let's go he's going all the way around the back break him down down nice well done hopefully there's no one here mental he's got around the corner he's he's he's finished sure there just sneaking around i don't know this is mad this is quarry this is what people do right now we didn't get the finishes on that building i reckon if we all three of us snipe at the same time we can wipe that squad on that but yeah we definitely could they were so they were just all mounted i think yeah should we get um i could get another air strike oh yeah yeah let's get self-resistance let's get everything watch out for these uh proximity mines let's just check this by first yeah yeah just in case okay all right i've got a plate box but if you want to buy your own plates i'll buy munitions i'll buy uav and then i'll buy a precision all player right behind us in here oh here here on here on the top well he's marked there look yeah he's on the top with a sniper broke his arm but never well well we can get out the hill i mean come on jump jump jump is he still out there yeah he dumped he dumped him down whereabouts he's gonna be in the gas we should get a position or maybe uav again yeah maybe uav nice one we could afford it if i dropped another one if you guys need it uh you could definitely get another [Music] yeah someone's just like either that or it's a spotting scope it might yeah probably spotting there you know it was there sorry oh they're just firing javelins at you what what is that all they've got was that a javelin i'm sure that was a javelin no it was um the drone exploding all right i reckon he's gone east but now he's kind of screwed yeah he's got well now you can go up the steps they can go up the steps there's the um we're watching the steps you hear about like if um should have got another uav i've got one i've got one i mean pop it for one guard i don't know here look all right there well they got heads better play another one another one up the hill out the hill out the hill air strike on me strike on me yeah they've gone full full kill streak there oh no i was so close to getting away as well they're gonna push the studs like we're in a bad spot now i think yeah yeah you're right you're pushing down we should start moving he's not pushing he's not pushing he's not pushing and now we have no money for westie it's fine there's a guy here as well on green he was up on blue jack on green by the way you had multiple players on green okay moving more than one as well there's more than one yeah should we just get away yeah hopefully he hasn't got bruins yeah we're dead we're dead i mean for green i reckon they'll probably come up around here on the edge of the hill it gives them the vantage all the way across that open area oh yeah down there where where market please let me see there i reckon he's going to be moving a bit left to that that's all right got him nice job so perfect right that's not the there was more than one there was a guy in a skull outfit okay like a skull ghost a ghosty boy oh yeah that would be the team that'd be the team people fighting on blue as well oh i don't know should we push up to the tent jack here before we get spotted let's go there was someone up here yeah no there is people fighting i'm just thinking we need cover i think yeah i think that can you get up those rocks you can never but we need to just follow the line now i think if you skirted along the edge of the military boundary yeah that could probably just get inside further along yeah i feel like we're going to run into someone on the left here that's why they're like that's why i'm using these rocks urgent yeah it's not brilliant cover but it'll do no i could even just push straight right now jack i'm blue i'm blown blue no he didn't see me i don't think he did now just one no only seen one he jumped over the wall he's on our side okay i don't have an eye he could be further ahead yeah he could be further ahead i've got dead silence gun shot there yeah behind i think that's from green from the team that might be coming in this guy's not gonna peek us because i can't even see him if he's peeking right now yeah that's a really bad angle okay good i know i'm just gonna wait here by the box okay got someone on the right in the compound yeah this guy's i think he's gone over there sod yeah i didn't want to deal with him if we didn't need to you want to deal with me you want to deal with me all right let's close that door is there any way we could get camera back here uh only if we had money unless we did and well you haven't got any buyers no no buys that's all break him damn indeed they would have seen my traces too there's someone on the right of us gotta be want to move on that outside wall broke armor let's move let's ah they've got the advantage here we're gonna have to run far right i think jack so use this as cover and then run really far right they're being shot they're being shot let's go okay yeah they've been done from on top of the hill and then we'll just use the wall as cover i think nice one you might get lucky there jack you never know no you don't i see him in the hangar yeah i've got to die nice okay just watch our backs here good kill oh yeah over the back yeah right on the far side of airfields back i'm safe for now yeah there's people up in the hill i saw him sniping they've actually got one of the best positions right now the only way that you could combat them is literally you'd have to run up here right now and take that position but you don't know whether this would be in the open we'll be in the yeah and you just don't know where the zone's going to end up either it might come down here you never know no one behind us as far as i know guy right here on the ammo yeah i think this was the guy that parachuted in when we were like there's the snipers they're right they sound right on the edge to be honest they're probably like right up here on blue i bet there's a team in here yeah you know what's going to say no one on the baby monitor okay oh look at that zone okay let's clear this building jack i think we have to dead silence yeah okay you want to check it and i just hold someone firing i think they're in the dragon's teeth this is clear but yeah they're in the dragon steve all right i don't know there was something there and there'd be sniped from the other hanger i think i see him i literally see him on blue but i just don't see his feet he's on blue right there he's actually just chucking everything he's got there he goes two of them let's keep keep pressure okay hold on yeah he's getting he's razzing him i think you can see you can shoot underneath it nice gas is coming we're very open now gotta go there might be people in that next hangar i'm pretty much sure they're guaranteed unless they were sniping people up on the hill pushing to the rocks you have dead science jackman yeah i do yeah but yeah i hear them in here if i they're definitely in here moving i can hear them i can literally hear them maybe to our west a little bit to our west i use dead silence oh my god foul you gotta start press i'm gonna full self rest i'll finish it for you you can touch me yet nice nice nice gus yep very weak here do you need plates there's more in there there's more in there oh yeah yeah that guy did not need to peek then nope he must have heard his footsteps i'm just kidding he's literally just waiting i mean we could do the old gas flank but they'll hear us uh i've got a gas mask yeah but it's the footsteps isn't it yeah you just want to make sure they don't do it to you i mean we're in here oh someone's snapping me yeah they got an angle they've got an angle on the right side three two eight i'm gonna mark it like that blue marker he's above it all right he's got a nice sniper angle on me unfortunately he also has to move yeah the guys in the bunk are gonna stay on the bridge watch our backs i'll watch the front yeah i've got the back they might just peek over the hill as well they're being sniped or some machine there are four teams left you know where two of them are you're the third and then there's another thing big play well done all right that's that team gone we don't want the low ground though that's the problem i really don't want them a minute the the zone's gonna there's a sniper speaker speaking something's freaking me what i'm gonna do jack is i think we should we should gas flank really far to the northeast can we make that over the edge right here where's this yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i think we can zone's coming back to us we're good it's coming to you okay give him a little bit armor not off you've got this wall super helpful broken two guys at the top one down nice nice one v two more the guy at the top to the right to the right to the right there he is nice the other night really wow okay and anyways i just had this feeling that we were gonna get stuck in quarry for the entire match yeah that was the quarry game that feels like it was an hour ago yeah warzone gives you that feeling sometimes you have so many gunfights per match you forget which ones were in which match he had some solid snipes that game jack as well yeah what was it brewing hdr brewing hdr well apparently we're cheating we're cheering okay good good to know they're working eh yeah the hacks are fully efficient oh no oh god i thought it was like battle that had gone down then or something because it came up on my screen connecting oh no i hate it when that happens dude he's backing he's hacking i don't know if i can play any of mine i don't know if i save the profile properly last time instead it's going to be some randomizing please no copyrighted music well i don't think i've got any copyright well there's one that well what about this one oh well exit that lobby exit that lobby i've got someone on my block list there sorry all right i only blocked cheaters so it's definitely a cheer uh invite me again please come on thank you there you go you're the best we could do our own versions of copyright music [Music] [Laughter] that is actually on one of mine but can we just say that is an absolute banger that song yeah it's the banger isn't it why is no one doing like a remix of it and it's been in the chance of something i love it you could imagine that would be like the most locked down song you've ever heard of yeah just when memes on the internet become a song didn't ksi get to like number three with his latest song in the uk charts i think he was nearly number one album as well damn yeah make him bank you're definitely getting that bag who knew it was easy as just fighting another youtuber in a boxing ring and then releasing some music if only we were all smart enough to do that yeah uh thank you for watching guys hope you enjoyed that let's get another one in el chunks thanks to the five mark hag thank you for the 20. don't often catch you live over here in australia mark that's awesome man thank you i actually have a lot of views from australia and new zealand if i look at my analytics i don't know why you guys like me but apparently you do uh we're playing european servers weapon m3 we're all from europe what's up brian from india how you doing do i have a white dog oh no that's cameron that has that it's like it's almost like a husky isn't it uh milko what recording software setting do i use i use obs i use obs for everything for streaming for recording it's free i use the nvidia codec which you need an nvidia graphics card for if you want to use that but i use all that stuff for streaming and recording hey shannon new zealand gang here it's because they think i'm australian i think australians can tell the difference like the british accent and the australian accent are very different but what i've noticed is that i've been to the us a lot and when i've been in taxis or at events with people sometimes they just think you're australian we're going for that i think so yeah all right i mean if we go anywhere on the west side of the map we're just gonna be running for the entire match aren't we there should be enough guns to get us started on on fire station train anyone going train well i'm gonna have to do it it looks a bit laggy oh yeah i'm i'm on 300 ping ah you guys on 300 19. why do i get 300 ping what is this what does this mean so i'm not sure my game's ruined i can't play this do you want to leave again yeah yeah i don't know why does it do this have you got like have you reset your internet since um not recently no um getting we're just seems to be certain servers another bug you're not downloading anything in the background i think so now but if you if you have like an insane connection it it doesn't matter right like you can download whatever you want and still play yeah because the game won't take up that much bandwidth at all what is your upload space thought 500 500 but that's me my my stream doesn't lag this is my download right so maybe someone someone might be downloading something mad ella in the next room yes ruin him ruin him just sitting there with the cats going fortnite she's downloading minecraft mods just all the time i need all the mods stud all of them internet is retired your friend thought i was canadian i mean my accent isn't canadian it's nothing like canadian is it uh ronald what gpu 2080i although i'm probably going to upgrade to the new ones when they come out i know there's been some leaks and rumors about the nvidia 30 series the 3080 and nvidia are doing a countdown thing at the moment so i think we'll be getting those pretty soon so i'll definitely upgrade to that uh el zaba does warzone have an mmr system yeah it does but it's hidden all the skill based matchmaking stuff is hidden they don't want you to see it yeah there's a lot of accents in britain there's all sorts of different dialects and accents even though england is quite a small country i mean there's all sorts of accents like uh in the west midlands you know we can't descends like this that's what people from the west midlands generally sound like founded from birmingham but then you could go to liverpool and get some chicken and a coke here we see the water you know that's that's the kind of thing but then you've got like yorkshire but yorkshire is kind of like this shirt but it's been up there i'm gonna be out on the farm today i would attempt more but i might embarrass myself so i'm not but yeah england there's so many different accents when you when you throw in britain you've got wales scotland's island as well yeah it's northern ireland there's all sorts cheeky train station is it yeah yeah yeah only if it's cheeky come on through the gap don't hit the sides don't hit the sides only hit the sides if you can't decide if you can hit the sides don't hit the sides what the hell was that soldier what someone shooting you okay yeah full team [Music] are they upstairs people pushing yeah no no no no no no i'm a broken one yeah i'm not good one that would come running at the back here oh decided not to kill me i'm just making this way hold on they can kill me okay yeah he's coming now yeah they're all roses so horrible they're all rose characters oh good yeah absolutely no i just dropped him i broke his armor it's annoying i've got no faith in the org either it's terrible where is he stud he was down on the bottom floor one of them he was running this way relocating shot back to the little bit thing to see if there's people pushing think we're okay you just closed that door yeah i did i've seen one here orange now left of orange here jack moving here i mean it's so difficult to see he just moved there broke down nice well done laughs do you want to go i mean i've really got no i've only

got no armor we've got no armor two of them down there do you want it here orange there's people outside [Music] people outside are down on the ground fighting where has he gone here out there there's still people underneath us though right finished yep yeah yeah still people underneath welcome back cameron thank you very much what have i come into lager here and one over here i'm going in i'm gonna i'm just gonna run inside okay he's almost pretty low really really low push him oh [ __ ] definitely nice job nice job he killed himself with his c4 yeah that's the team that's the team okay i want to take the p90 that player that was on the edge there that goo lagged in i need some ammo man i got nothing [Laughter] eastenders would like to know your position i look like most of my audience are american now we're like what's he standing i don't know what the what does that mean uh okay we're down inside now are we the team that we shot were over here as well so they fought out there and we i shot another one that was running over train station's bloody lovely it's popping off isn't it yeah sure i've just fallen off i'll drop a shot over here thank you yeah that's the guy sniped there westy lots of money he had oh he had the grand rapids m4 beautiful and my favorites yeah i've got the pizza p90 look at this the pizza store is it supposed to be like the burger restaurant one that's like i think it's supposed to be a pizza box oh oh yeah oh yeah i get it i get it yeah okay it's like it's like you're your local pizza shop your local pizza sake right yeah we do chinese again the pizza box is like 10 000 for five dollars on amazon or something yeah and it just says real homemade pizza on it or something pizza with an arrow to be honest i'd buy that this is definitely pizza it's like a youtube thumbnail over here they'll always say something like a hundred percent fresh ingredients uh vehicle on the buy enemy vehicle i'm driving away oh i wanted him come on yeah i think we should probably do that [Music] before the game punishes us no one's been here the spy's not open there's my daenery oh airstrike nice beautiful [Music] you want to get back up on top of one of the buildings yeah train station roof oh yeah did you spot him no no i've just seen him on the ov all right that might be the team that we're coming for jack i feel like the guy we just killed was part of that team it backed off though with the threat um there are a couple of teams around mark the king on a bigger roof yeah it's not really a great spot is it i really want to play it but i can't i can just play a little bit just a little bit my one's transformative oh you got a transformative one let's hear it look that's not right that is not right i got a minute let's see if i can find my one you can play the first note that's it just play that like over and over again [Music] my brain is so confused right now one loadout went on the roof up there and one drop right next to it you want to go for ghosts yeah yeah i'm just thinking it might draw out the other team let's go for it great 500 for staying alive jack put baby shark on you and your girl baby shark why yeah because it's your favorite song no i've forgotten about that song it's been months so now you've ruined me not for kids i tell you they bloody love it so they can't get enough of it i think it's going to be the anthem of children for the next 10 years the anthem of the six year old mm-hmm what was the anthem before oh what for what would it be it would probably be the art attack theme i think the kids younger than us it'd probably be that stupid crazy frog thing oh yeah god that was terrible draw the diamond here that i get but that was also in the age of paying like three pounds for a ringtone oh player here on the right to the roof there's a whole squad down to one and goes the other broke that one no no down the other no no no okay i'm inside let's go live okay i'm gonna get started there we go oh there's still one on the roof there's still one yeah one more he's to the right right to the west oh yeah he's throwing c4 at you jack behind this here pushing there again i'll play there we go brewing power what are they screamed at me killing in the name of is that what he said no you know what they went for they went for their loadout so they did come out for it westy with the 500 iq oh look there's a loadout crate i wonder if the enemy team will go for it oh look they did almost like they create these occurrences to bring people together [Laughter] the game is manufactured nothing is real life is pain this game is pain to be honest that team white is that bruin got to be probably probably and kilo that's my bet let's have a little kilo let's have a look let's see what he said hdr you were one away nice try uh there were people up here i think on this is that a bye up there wait by there up on the hill no there's not i must have seen a seagull oh how lovely it loads the place at the brewery yeah the rarest gun in the game never see them dear um can we let's get to a shop and buy self resies yeah or something okay then all right fine just look at the roof of twins just to make sure i think we're okay yeah i think we're all right we're all right all right all right all right don't want cash uh yes please take all the money thank you relocating yeah these lobbies manage it's so quiet now it's because people get murdered at the start and they get murdered at the end and there's nothing in the middle like what's happened to those mid-game events like you know the jailbreak and the fire sale it made them rare haven't they yeah but they don't they don't happen often enough because of the tournaments because if you happen to get a lobby which got jailbreak you basically oh right okay yeah but they shouldn't be catering to those should they no but they still have them though so it doesn't even make sense they're like they happen just like way less but they happen do you want to go to twins yeah yes but this is the thing like they could turn it down when they know they're doing official tournaments and stuff and then they could turn it turn it back up again because like they added them and they were they were all right they broke up the game a bit yeah they broke up the game i don't think i've ever been raised by a jailbreak i always oh there you go just seen him under one orange oh yeah on orange do you want to get on the other twin he's running back towards orange now running back towards orange just missed him they're running to the edge yeah they're on the edge nice don't have a uh i've got i've got strike i got strike allies [Applause] oh different team completely let's get out of here westy i start just trying to yeah we need to we're about to get memed poop pushed i was really unfortunate there you got sniped by the you literally got shot in the back basically and then the sniper on twitter someone just sniped in me yeah that'd be the people on twins i think is anyone gonna die in the next minute in a 2020 august war zone lobby what do you reckon place your bets now come on no well no i'm not going to finish him i'll make sure not to kill him jack don't kill him don't leave him i'll leave him up right i'm with you now stud it's like the mid game in this war zone like season has slowed down so much yeah they're still on orange right it's kind of bad they need to do something about it it's getting bad well look at fortnight you see like that you end up with like no one melanie's nice there's one just behind um they end up with like no one in the lobbies yeah they'll be res in that guy yeah yeah let's move what's the dinner again i know you think going to 200 players would help or wouldn't make a difference no because because that's what happens everyone just dies in that first initial okay there we go that was literally a minute when no one in the game died can i get my gear i think he might have no no i wouldn't i would definitely wouldn't someone's shooting at here yeah it's the guy on top of them we get on this route should we get on this route it's just another roof you know yeah yeah yeah another part of the ground oh just to the superman someone had a good roof needs a um a line up to the roof just gonna grab this gun does it have one cool um what why did that just despawn right in front there was also what was that javelin yeah it was a jazz doesn't mean what do you spawned dude that's so frustrating a gun that had been dropped there's an entire circle of custom loot in front of me and as i open the doors yeah i hear footsteps as well careful maybe it's just us it could be me underneath you yeah i think it is there's a heli team dropping ruin the heli ruin the heli yeah i know i know we're being sniped from the other team as well from the rooves dude this is not good can i get a spare plate please yeah yeah we're being sniped from the other roof guys we're being signed for the other roof and they're commissioning now they're pushing now first thing now when you say they're pushing up the stairs yes they are javelins as well javelins let's get it let's go let's jump off the back wait we're not safe for this just death fire station go gas station there is no way we're surviving that yeah i've only got an uzi so yeah that was not a good survivability i'm just gonna go up the tower get a little bit of height back in my day we would have turned around in 161 i think they're going to swim for us you know yeah yeah i reckon now come for us have a nice

with really competitive players like us who you know yeah one away also sitting in a fight yeah and everyone has just sat down not moving really because yeah well why would you you know you don't have to run out into the open end you're dead hey that's a bruin it needs a ranking system or something man like because playing like this it just gets so boring after a while doesn't it and you're playing for nothing which is why juggies was so much fun oh they get just dropped off the roof here stand him nice job if there's a load out i'm just gonna go for it yeah yeah this one might go down about in about 50 seconds you'll get it you're still guys on twins one just jumped yeah just someone orange jumping around yeah i see him still guys on twins [Music] train is three people died finally what was

most of that game and it's my highest kill count i got 24 kills in a solo match but it was a really intense match loads of tricky moments and good gun fights in it but the ram seven i wouldn't use the ram in trios or quads but in solos it's brilliant but if you want a good build for it go check out that video because i'll show right at the start right where to well i'm just going to wait and see

the right down there's one more somewhere i've got cute is that it no one more this is mad i love this what's happening right i've thrown a stun grenade thing over i don't know where that sentence came from by the way i think it might have come from downstairs do you reckon you're just meeting around watching stairs i'm watching stairs all right give me that i don't know man he could be on the right yeah he could be on the ramp here yeah he's about above his mouth yeah he's half dead yeah he's literally he's literally right above the glass right now skylight's there that's it you can see him there i can't see him i'm going up on the road oh we just had to go careful gotta go is that a crack is it should we just push them together it's just one guy isn't it where's he gone i've got a drone there the stairs here right maybe oh let's go right there oh man i need help i'm looking in he was just camping waiting whereabouts just where start is okay i don't know why i did that he just ran up to me oh you're inside jack yeah i'm inside that's me with the power would you like to walk right here [Music] i team wiped them so oh you got the guy that killed stodd yeah i got the guy that kills stud okay do you have any place cam uh no there's plates here though yeah we still died might only be one or two but just the one oh here you go here's another one i'll just pick one up thank you that's all right oh my god what a start he was actually playing that really well because he left the box so i just assumed there was no one there i didn't realize you could get in this way that's that's cheeky yeah this is kind of new to me as well yeah it's a little bit of a strange area this one i like it but it's a bit strange do you want to get load out yeah i mean we can afford star down a load out so why not yeah i'll get the loader there we go study does not need that help no help necessary this guy thought he was a quick scoper he did all right come on holder show us what you got who remembers overwatch eh [Music] oh i thought you're saying dead oh dead i think people watch the esports but that's it right or am i just being ignorant we've watched the esports and just complained the entire time about how overpowered everything is i don't know anyone that plays overwatch personally not anymore i think if you enjoy pain so we might like it yeah we're used to it i reckon they're on that far building so i just gonna get out the ladder but what about overwatch 2 which is basically overwatch 1.5 double things are going to be a new game well no not really they're changing the way that they do things i think that's i don't know i feel like the industry's going that way though it's like long term yeah like destiny 2 really should have just been called destiny and they just carried on yeah then they couldn't have sold all threat three on me but where are they i don't know they behind us i already got shot if they were behind us this time yeah here actually on the building i'm on watch him are you in your stairwell i'm a hit no no i'm behind it behind nice threat level two on me now maybe it was just that one guy from the team for now yeah he'll be going up the ladder here you can jump across that can't you yeah you can yeah yeah yeah threat three on me again i hear footsteps below me okay i'll watch the door i'll watch the door western you move away from the door and i'll watch it oh guy here it's going differently that was a reds down these rooms are terrible to be on nice i can hear this guy he's in the other building over here as well one here come off this way watch those ledges orange outside it might have dropped off yeah he's just dropped off i don't want to go in there you know footsteps below yeah i don't know what gunny had this is terrible that was oh yeah he's literally two right below us jack like literally right right here okay i'm off this way and then there's like another one over there somewhere so i think he's going to try and get the other side so weird should i back off to stop stop building you could do yeah you can make a jump i'm watching oh i've backed off to here they managed to get a plank on me i'll be in trouble but i'm doing all right for now i'm with you son yeah we're all together we're all together i'm just i mean i mean they're probably just waiting in the stairwells aren't they just waiting to get a pic it's like 20 dota it didn't let me pull my shoe it's going inside oh he's right here on the roof no he managed to creep all the way across god damn it hang on a minute that was the team that we killed at train station same team i came back for revenge i did ah what did you kill me with mp7 you think we should have just bailed from that fight uh no because we had the advantage but yeah i mean but those roofs are terrible they're so difficult it's horrible because not only do they have the staircases they've also got ladders at either end uh pushing right cameron holding back right jesus killed me instantly got the quick scope he just held he just held it and waited for me to come around the corner [Applause] [Music] it's all on jack um are there any most wanteds uh there but that's right next to them um you can go for a downtown one but i think downtown will be hot scavenger contract hey give that one a go go on the westy mark yeah you could just do a normal contract there i couldn't manage yeah i'll go for that scout there yeah you'd have money and there's fighting going on yeah to be careful of that don't know man it depends on which way the scout's going to take you and i guarantee it will push you towards them [Laughter] yeah as far away as possible 100 i don't support a football team george i'm not really that into football anymore i was when i was a kid but not anymore hey p90 let's go let's go in the game you think the meta is ever going to be based around p90 probably not they'd need to buff it wouldn't they it does need a buff it's good at hipfire i'll give it that but it's not it's not ideal there's no bf3 p90 though let's put it that way maybe this is not here i might be able to get this okay get the funds best gun in the game see this is now where we need jailbreak yeah where's the wrap hey the pizza let's go it literally is one of those boxes isn't it 100 real ingredients how'd you get on the roof of this one yeah you can if you go the other side of the white tents you can jump up on the back of another one yeah here you can jump up on that get up on the back of it and then you can leap across there you go stodd went first pick him welcome back welcome back commander that i'm ready two kings around you one coming towards you that one that i've marked moving his way up here poggers hmm i've got an origin to our object people fighting down here so they're gonna run up to us and we'll just kill them steal all their money we'll just pog them we will pog them you sometimes get cash up here you want that sweet 2k drop oh no ruined so oh do i get p90 ah now i think i need to keep the brewing i think we might catch someone running in here over there yeah yeah it's a good spot for us good overlook it's like endor forest though endor watch out there's my box when you um you'll be what you do only if you can't shoot the ewoks there's a massive sniper over here jack on orange yeah down by the stadium because i'll give away our position they might move up though then you've got a chance to beam them yes i reckon we stay here and just wait for that squad steal all their cash get westy back in the game get our loadouts win the match it's simple we only need a bit more cash yeah you don't need a lot unless we could lose something not really any other buildings though is there there's that but with the broom someone smashed the windows there there's four it's now that guy was in there earlier yeah three kings forking no three kings on the map right now walking down [ __ ] hell um where do you think that zone's gonna go it's kind of a weird place for it there's like no major spot that it's gonna be are we gonna get a loadout soon circle four so you've got another like four or five minutes maybe all right did i check this i did didn't i um did you check the garage that's been opened anyway oh this is where you've got the p90 dare i climb up the ladder cameron my phone my alarm is going hdr oh look at brewing that wasn't worth it i've already got it yeah jack someone on our end i don't have a sniper unfortunately yeah you have it's called the bruin okay just mount on the mount on the metal and there you go i feel i feel like we should wait until they get closer though i have become bush do you have a sniper stud no oh on tv tv the outside tv over here hungry right behind the tree that you can't see through i am bruin sniper you are bush we will win i hate how you can't mark through blooming fences it's so annoying yeah i am brewing weapons guy right okay they have to come to you sasha it costs twelve dollars to buy the battle pass to unlock this weapon man these lobbies are so boring i suppose we could go to them but then we'd die one way so yeah it's not let's not be the fool let's not be the fun in the game you can't have fun in this game jack up that's just down in front of you to the left that one there have they opened that yeah people figured it out no not that one yeah i didn't think so because that one's been like that for like a couple of months now yeah i went back and watched the team fortress 2 intro videos they're so good yeah valve is just brilliant like everything they do is pretty good apart from that terrible card game they released again card game the dollar oh yeah the dota 2 card game it just bombed didn't it no i'm bored it no was it free i don't know but no one played it anyway what about the did they have a doe to rescue oh dozers they're doggy i'm thinking of they bought out the lawn what what's the thing that lol bought out first whereas like the dover heroes or the lol heroes but it's no idea it's on a chess board and you have to team fight tactics kind of thing yeah yeah it's called dota underlords or something yeah that's really popular you can play that on mobile as well but their card game didn't do very well there you go there's a guy um oh they're coming your way oh yeah the pyro trailer was really good you go they're running down they're running out on orange we could possibly die instantly if we go there's a guy here no that's a brush that's a bush you're scaring me now stud they're running up here now like on orange somewhere they're going to the right of it they've got to go path of their own i think they do have a great path yeah i do not like this iron sight on the bruin it's going to be the death of me i don't see these guys at all where have they gone they are there they are oh no we've missed it jack we missed our opportunity no no no no no no no no oh they're gone in the house there goes it team dead team money he's probably got five hundred dollars because he's a fresh spawn god damn it got a bit i think i mean that's the that's the unifiable buy that's the only viable buy oh this is gonna reload that's the lie could you loot here oh no god oh god hang on jack i don't know i'm not i need to offer covering for you jack wants action dude i'm just jackson he's lobbyist like what it feels like i'm playing pub g after it had been out for two years absolutely yeah that's what i'm saying it was a lot like pubg pubbers do you remember [Laughter] there fun a young link going back to play pubg was a rough experience that was i mean you think this is bad do they just not engage at all it's yes like you might as well just go center zone sit in the building wait and hopefully win i think in this game i feel like you can counter people in buildings you know yeah i can actually think this is possible in pub g no just die only death only death honestly my favorite thing to do at this moment is is play solos and just get uh uab's and just drive around the map getting people people yeah yeah well that's solos as well if you die it doesn't matter you just keep going that's some action action did i just fire a shot yeah you did no insane i'm just uh did you see that i just found a shot yeah i thought you fired a shot and it hit someone and then they went down like can you believe that here unprecedented levels about i'm clear i'm clearing the area's eyes because i need ammo sorry players over here on the green mark so they'll be coming in that window in their building orange building on orange i don't see him teamed in yeah and now i've got now i've got no armor you've got nothing at all no i've got 60 120. i need a couple i need a couple of bullets i'm right in front of you on the rock on the rock on the left that one there literally he's behind that rock he's behind that rock all right i know he's gone there's a sniper is all like up here jack like here on orange he's good he's got ammo what about the sniper on orange no we don't care about him [Applause] okay i'm going for it can't help i'm covering it oh god there's still that player obviously down that you were shooting at that's yeah i've got ammo now i don't care i can actually do something you can waste bullets you might still be in that building to be honest jack do you want to push this side yeah coming down here i don't know yeah i don't know if this i don't know if there's cover here that's the only problem as well this is live this is not pre-recorded this is live how would i see your chat message i'm not a time traveler i wouldn't fake a live stream what would be the purpose of that right what were we looking at stud there was a guy in this building remember and now he's gone he's moved he might go around to this yeah i'm to go left once i'm up front big play there from superior that could be a different team we go right above us here maybe that guy was what part they would just spread out or something i think they're spread out that's very weird yeah watch this word rock here get into the shed maybe i'm just gonna see if i can peek and ruin anyone's good day yeah there's a guy here here i think he's already down yeah he's already down there's a squad over here as well north east okay down there the other side of the town i think we need to push far left jack far left unless there's on that rock over i'm on this hill now jack yeah there's another one here to the right jack you look to the right yeah he ran around that way the gas is there though he's going here no i've been creeping this guy right here jack right here you just dropped from orange oh stand on me north north north on me north on me coming to help throwing out a counselor no tag on the right stuff right right right he's lit armor broke absolutely unbelievable and i just got to say that was the most boring mid game i've ever yeah that is the most boring gaze of war zone i've ever played but fair play fair play that's well done well held i mean jack did all the work there he literally had one shot on him gg g well played oh man do you feel like if they just disabled sbm it would fix this um no they take it i think it would take a few couple though just take a couple of weeks just have a casual mode that's it fun for everyone you mean like a separate on get rid of plunder get rid of plunder replace it with war zone casual done when you say war zone casual does that mean just like crank up the juggernauts yeah literally whatever you want put it put it put in random stuff whatever i don't care you can have birds that you can ride or something birds that you can ride just yeah like sounds like rings mount doom you have the mountain game you know but seriously just just replace plunder no one plays blunder unless they're joking they're like they're having a laugh as in like they're literally ironically playing there's some guy in the back of the room i play plunder the only i played plunder maybe two weeks ago and my team accidentally won didn't kill a single player they were just running around lumber just getting money run a lumber they didn't i don't i did we didn't drop it off at all we just had it in our other person oh blood yeah what's the point what's the point isn't it for the free to play players so they can level up their guns yes they can level them up on warzone casuals this game drives us mad for this game would we have a battlefield refugees that's the one for refugees it's quite accurate just make up battlefield 6 news that's fine did you see the news that hang on air quotes news that was on twitter the other day i don't believe any of those leagues or tweets at all i don't think battlefield are going to go near battle royale for a while either they they they ruin themselves with firestorm they they did a half-baked attempt unfortunately like firestorm had some genuinely brilliant ideas but it was hamstrung by the fact that they were like right still got to be like battlefield 5 guys it still has to be like battlefield 5 but it has to be battle royale at the same time no no one thought why don't we just make a battle frostbite battle royale is what they should take models from previous games and just chuck them in just battlefield 3. just do with battlefield 3 bottles yeah battlefield 3. chuck some might live on a wall fighter in there yeah good to go put some ewoks in uh [Music] a multi-gamer plunder is good for people that don't own the game that want to level up their guns yeah that's true but they could also do the war zone rumble that they had they could add that back in like started saying they could do a casual mode what's new where are we going okay let's sweat are we going outside and then in order to try and grab the heli as usual okay see if anyone goes through it i'm gonna be like people have stopped going what stadium yeah yeah it's done now isn't it it's dead no one drops on the train either i don't think a single person drops yeah which is good dead let's do the easter egg start we can get you the blueprint what was it blueprintful uh gala the new cr56a

here yeah yeah you need to go to the or there's this one there's the one the monuments right next to us yeah yeah oh you run so fast when you run forward on it don't you yeah it's turbo speed i've been make because they have to right that's the only way they get it to work quit all right can we get back on it nah there's a quad bike up here you might be able to then drive back down and then get off the quad bike get back all right let's see if there's any lads pushing us from the loader uh shooting going on over here there's two plates there cam on the bye thank you very much thank you yeah shooting going on orange you might be able to peak that isn't that where we just down that guy uh nia yes near i got brew in here i'm here [Applause] finding people on orange by the way yeah you see that it was your finishing i'm a hit on blue peak on that car up on here live ping live thing running away that's a full team yeah that's definitely a bruin or something yeah okay we're ruined here try and get behind this rock there's nobody i can't see anything uh well good luck stud i know that was that was the team that killed us over by frankie and benny i know we were here star's got gear leg as well okay cool it's fine we can do it you can push your middle stud hold him back right right nice shot were you jumping backwards when you did yes i was yes [Applause] oh no that is unbel that's the luckiest kill i've ever seen in my life that was insane i'm just gonna uninstall the game after that like i feel like i have to that was awful you did the perfect stun went for the push on the flank and he was just like no he just randomly chucked the grenade at the wall yeah he might have cooked it as well because that exploded very quickly honestly i feel cheated disgraced i don't think i'll ever live that down there's my viewbot malfunction apparently that squad rolled up to us in a car and because we were like oh god yeah what the hell how did they know where you were [Applause] too fast for you 87 that was such an unlucky round it started off so well with us taking down the helicopter yeah that team that came up behind us they rolled up in a car apparently and none of us noticed did you hear a car nope no i wasn't looking at the mini-map to be fair no that grenade is going to scar me for life though it's oh dear it's ruined he's acting [Music] god jesus sometimes man just sometimes is snake shot still in the game jayden yeah it is they nerfed it though it's not it's not really that good anymore to be honest yeah it was a panic grenade demo yeah it was just look i was just really unlucky it rolled as well uh pratham can you play solos i'll probably play solos and tomorrow maybe what is this gun look at this mp5 a striker that looks super cool it's a nice looking gun oh is it the new gun i don't know that skin's quite different cameron you've been using my origin 12 loadout and it's amazing yeah it's really good isn't it the origin 12 is dirty taylor when are we getting an updated rap battle for card and battlefield it's not been worth doing for a few years like that year in particular modern warfare 3 i know sorry it was call of duty ghosts and battlefield 4. it was the perfect match up they were all releasing at the same time as well in the marketing they were hyping it up saying battlefield's better than cod and it made sense but since then there's not really been a battlefield game that has competed i suppose or there's not been that much hype i think next year maybe we'll see battle royale i hope battlefield can make a comeback next year if you run out of mama you can throw your weapon at them yes i think that would be amazing and it would be a one shot yes like oh like a like the amazing melee system in this game yeah amazing spam spam spam spam in a can uh train station got to be okay baby let's go let's go dun they're not like this they've got pistols i hate them why did he not chase me then i was done for because they're just sitting on the roof check they're just waiting on there for some reason i don't really know what the plan is yeah you always see them on the roof what are they doing still yeah i don't know there's no loot out there i think i need an island bitter uh he's above me here two of them on orange right above me okay jack oh danke all three of them on the top i don't know what they're waiting for can we flank them cameron can we do it yeah i mean we can oh i think they might be footsteps yeah they're here jack they're here right here right next to you yeah they're in the stairwell running down i've got a stun ready hold on guys i'll be there in a sec uh they've stopped running interesting uh oh they went out that bit up there damn it they got stalled i got dead silence i thought you were guys that were on this there were got one ah last guy so unlucky it's because they came out on your level still we didn't realize that they'd stopped up there i thought they were coming all the way down i forgot that you could get out there none of us were in the same guru like right um prepare to fight i've got three rounds to go ugh i hate that when you're in a queue is an effective way to get inside their heads let me spray you yes i see the spray man we go back oh it's put me miles away guys it's put me 1400 meters away it wants me to go to farmland right egg okay here we go boys let's do this earn your way out did it take you over a year of your life to aim down sight with that gun i don't think i even bothered there's a lot i just clicked oh okay no there's people here they see me uh [Music] maybe don't fire yes money uh is there guns in there still i got a oh god no not like this i don't know if it's up or down i have no idea if it's up or down it's the problem enemy uiv we're gonna be on that i don't know if it's up or down i'm coming towards you now he's on the set he was on the stairs i don't know if he's up or down welcome to audio audio design i tell you wrong he's running around no idea if he's a little done we should leave let's get in the car really someone ground their wall oh yeah i feel like we could yeah they're on our level jack yeah jack's got an angle 30 rounds 40 meters in front okay that's just inside oh no i'm just hitting them on he's right here right there the guy there let's try and run past on the right side right side of that he's just here someone just hit a claymore behind me behind me behind me behind me they just went through my claymore in this building right here on orange there oh yeah he's coming to you he's coming to you i've got nothing left i can't i can't fight he's gone in this building there he is did he go outside his armor no he's not going outside he's just running away gone up the stairs i think he's now throwing a molotov i've only got six bullets as well i can't fight it oh we're gonna need to get some plates on me we could buy some there's a buy right outside he's just running away don't hit that bike yeah yeah we also we have to avoid this guy though do you want to go out around the back that we didn't yeah yeah where we called those guys yeah [Applause] you might be up here so be careful origin 12's across the board jeep to the right oh yeah yeah he could be around there that jeep's gone for that bye hobby is clever 36 meters north where okay probably above though i can hear shots 34 meters now they'll be above us do you want to go through the stairs yeah are you you guys are already in okay yeah come on come on 41 meters north cam are there on the roof that oh that's not good for us if he doesn't move oh he moved goddamn yeah i have car 98 if he peaks his head again i can i can take him yeah yeah hang on oh the downstairs hasn't been lured really how'd you get down there down them uh there's some stairs right next to the cameron okay i'm just trying to the other side yeah i'm gonna teach you instead we're gonna get lowered out in ten oh yeah we need to be on the surface for that you know where it's gonna be it's gonna be about that car on the jeep you think wouldn't it be over here somewhere yeah i'll find out in a second maybe near blue i think yep oh my god all right yeah we gotta run around we've gotta take it we haven't got guns [Music] they'll run up onto the guy that was sniping that i managed to get oh yeah they're all on the edge be careful are they going for their loadouts damn it we should be oh sneaky hear them i hear them right on me he's lit he's absolutely lit that one there's one up on the roof still he's cleaning me now uh he got me he's gonna he's peeking me again he's trying to go for me now yeah there you go you stuck underneath yeah i got one they ran down there they're waiting for me now i think jack they've got dead science i will be ruined i'm listening for him i'm safe like no one's pushed me yet they're still around they might be on the roof because that guy that sniped me was on the roof there's a door here starting power is that a key card there hold on access keycard 40 meters right here hi there i think i was like 16 meters 60 meters over here now we can just avoid this cause this guy's got a stopping power mp5 that's dirty um when you're really really really really thirsty orange you see one there yep ryan orange he peeked it for a second chris push him outside here one outside maybe underneath i had one not running outside i must be underneath yeah he went i'm pretty sure i just heard him underneath running all right yep hear him right here like underneath opening doors probably where we were fighting for two footsteps yeah two of them yep like right here jack on orange something like that are they inside or outside no they they're gonna come up where we came up when we could get our loadouts now i reckon do you want to go for a loadout oh no no no they're doing that they're underneath you still got that stopping power no yeah idea yeah they're pushing us there might be three though that's the problem yeah they got bruins just keep pushing back keep pushing back did we just get out of here dude yeah we can get cameron back as well we could use this buy they seem to have stopped pushing hard they're shooting someone else i think i think someone else has come over we really need that loadout though yeah we do yeah we'll just buy you and then maybe go for it maybe work your way back towards it you go first son yep i mean unfortunately it's bruins that's the problem so it's just like if we get caught up we're dead instantly we got this one yeah that goes to the executive level which then will give you view and they're on there no they're not all right there's a heli be careful there's a heli on the roof now they're not in it anymore stage one fights quite something it's a bit interesting i have no idea where they are 42 meters in front of me have a look i think he's ground level though um oh one on the roof is on yeah marcum i think we'll be ruined if we try and go for a loadout 20 meters son where which way he might be coming up the stairs here yep right below us no he's not pushing he's driving away there's a people right underneath you outside the building those footsteps are above us stud they're above us yeah yeah i thought so here going down push yep pushing yeah he gave up wow he gave up yeah well at least you've got the kill for us guys nice job wesley by the way oh being beat from behind over here oh so i'm here getting that third kill right here jack on orange i'm a broke the hell he's off as i'm breaking orange orange all right he's behind that tent behind that tent dropped off right hand side right height he's on orange there nice is there dan that's right yeah was that him that was him i i didn't even manage to get my loadout i just used car 98. we could get cameron back again move away yeah i mean the guys above us are gonna have to come off now or they can stay on that side i think they went off with the heli so that's somebody who's got sniped on the roof then should we go back to that shop over here yeah sorry to call you such an inconvenience to get me back yeah yeah you destroyed that team dude that was it the team that we've been fighting for like 10 minutes as well so i'll drive you cash now yeah nice one did i see someone then you're all right i'm just saying should we move away from here i'm just thinking the guys on the roof they can stay on the roof and they're going to beam us as we try and run i'm surprised they didn't shoot the guy that shot westy at all they didn't even know the plane is safe to aren't they they've got a good position well they have to get off soon there's someone over there on orange yeah it's coming in another goo lager who's coming in over this way just so we know yeah he's landed over there how the hell he landed over here guys we got this the zip wires the roof uh i think there's some traces coming from over here be careful yeah oh you want to go stadium roof and see if we can kill them um i don't well have they got a heli out there not anymore oh there we go there's no there's now shooting over by the loadout okay and someone's rezzed by the loadout as well yeah there was a load of stuff happening over there i'll see if i can snipe from jack but let's see i just heard the shot yeah one just dropped down on the loadout now he's on the inside of stadium oh is that are they all off the roof now i see yeah there's no one up here i've just tried [Music] yeah i've just seen one there okay let's see one on orange ah the oh there's a guy he's got another vehicle that guy that you've been trying to kill is in that vehicle i'll be the guy they probably just picked up on our someone going for their loadout now mm-hmm we've got a sniper you don't do you i do no we can maybe we just taking their position yeah i mean it's good for us right yeah yeah is there no other way onto this roof apart from that zip line yeah there's zipline there's a zip on the other side i think right correct where's that airstrike going oh i'll find it for us uh yeah oh there's a there's a sniper right here if i'd have had that a second ago i would have killed the guy [Music] uh tree meister thank you so much for the 10. what do you use to record video audio what do you use to edit i use obs and you use multiple track audio with the go xlr and my microphone is a sure sm7b i think it's gonna be too late it'd be too light i wonder if these guys will go up the route that we just did and then once again in a big big loop i'm just waiting to see if someone i'm down on orange goes to that loadout last second going orange they're just thrown okay i have another helicopter there as well i can hear loads of shooting no no let's go oh cluster that's going to the people on orange studs yeah yeah so i'm a little concerned a little concerned that would have hit the roof right on top of me and killed me instantly oh man they're gonna be underneath for sure double threat as well you reckon they're wandering around going like where is it oh yeah someone just dropped in right here right here in orange triple down now they're right underneath me yeah we're gonna get ruined spotted i got spotted oh yeah nice come on no they know where we are come on they get a car one of them is gonna cut we have to dip after this yeah yeah it's fine do we want to go first or i think we go far right i think we go far right don't go far yeah let's just move all the way right yeah they can chase this if they want but 30 meters west [Music] so they're inside stadium yeah they're right underneath us yeah but i think they're following us so they can beam us yep oh man that's gonna be rough well jack's the one they want hang on hang on hang on if jack look let's walk this way and then keep basting that we're gonna go this way and then run back when your threat runs out i think we might have enough time i don't know ten seconds keep pushing keep pushing back yeah no i don't know but then then just run six five four then run this way run this way back because it shouldn't update and then we go i've lost track anyway yeah yeah yeah are you ready and then last second we're gonna go all the way left oh wait no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no i think that's a different team i mean they're gonna be in the zone two so you know ruined i'm broke on one nice nice nice you should have a good sniper oh no they've missed it completely down one get right dude oh nice dude let's start these out man let's yeah get that high ground up there mm-hmm did you get the finish nope they're gonna they won't try and push for it he might be in the zone as well oh yeah he probably is in the zone they're being shot by other people now i think they're on blue they got clustered i think just watch for the other team that were on the right be careful they're just gonna die in the gas what are they doing they sound like they're also fighting somebody yeah yeah there's people behind oh god right take your chance to get come something boys zombies dumb it i'm safe stud hold on unfinished the other guy was cracked i'm just gonna stay here good luck man this mp5 is really good who knew i think you should do a video on the mp5 thank you guys who knew it feels good to kill that squad though because they were just like such a pain they were memeing you out the entire time do we have any buyers we could get to that buy if we're quick there's brew in here jack if you want it uh i don't know if i've got time to go i'll take it i might take it i need uh how many plates you got um two i can drop one you go thank you yeah you can make it to that buy i think i think you can make it you don't have to call me back for the third time we need a bit of cash though don't we plate in there jack on orange we need to loot cash dodd yeah yeah yeah i'm looking at the loadout marks i might be able to beam him actually hold on tags where is he yeah he's gone in he died he just died someone killed him all right do we want to try and cross yeah and see if we can get cash for a westy this guy's kilo that i picked up like it's
