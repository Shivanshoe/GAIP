welcome to call of duty in space i thought that was the best way to introduce this game this is a game called project boundary and it caught my eye when i first saw the trailer i think it was a couple years ago now they've just released the demo on steam today i thought i'd jump in and give you guys some gameplay and first impressions just because it looks clean and it's an interesting concept isn't it like first person shooters in zero gravity i don't think we've had many of them i've got this like space ak here i think i've got damage there so i can heal mine's trying to fight me in space oh god i've got this little boost as well when you die you turn into this weird like ball thing well it's not a ball it looks like a capsule i suppose then i'm going to respawn and this is kind of like a domination style game mode as you can see we've got a b and c so it's basically domination for card isn't it or conquest small from battlefield nice bit of range there that's a revenge as well and i'm playing as a class as well there are some interesting mechanics in this game i haven't really unlocked much though because i i mean i've literally just started playing it but i'm playing as a guy called sergey or sergei wow i just got sniped yeah but this dude is like an assault class i suppose and you've got a boost you've got an emp and also this high explosive rocket launcher thing which i've just equipped here and you can fire this at the enemies there's also a break as well so you can quickly stop and you can attach the surfaces too but i'm going to go up to this b point here and see if i can get behind it and kill someone with these rockets just so i can show you guys gotta be in there somewhere oh where'd you go where did you go i can hear someone i think i can hear someone it's really difficult to tell because you're in space so there's not really that much noise but i'll show you the different classes oh here it is i'll show you the different classes when we get to half time boom sick you've been turned into a ball mate sorry among us i better not say that we're losing no we're capturing okay i'll go back but the graphics quite nice aren't they unreal engine 4 but i did do a bit of research on this this is made by a 1414 indie developer team so it's quite a small team but there's supposedly some cool stuff you can do with like your magazines and the bullets and the order that the bullets go in them so it's got like armor piercing rounds emp rounds and high explosive rhymes and i read an article that said you can actually like pick i need to patch my suit you can pick the order in which the bullets go in the gun and that will determine how you are damaging the enemies it's quite a detailed damage system they say i'm trying to capture this point here but it looks like it's going slow enemy nearby contested all right there's someone here it's quite nice the gun player i don't know about this giant circle on my screen though i don't know what that's for but you can also change the backpack that you're wearing too so you can get bigger backpacks that might be a bit tankier for example so you might have more health but you'll be slow you could get a smaller backpack that made you more nimble or maybe you didn't have as much health all right mate just peeked his little head up there that was really weird enemy nearby i think i'm kind of near their spawn here dead i'm not sure if you fully regenerate i don't know but you can get gun customization as well there's different weapons that you can choose from again i've just started playing so i've only unlocked this gun i think i don't even know if i can play as the other characters yet it's just like three in the game right now [Music] kind of reminds me of is it infinite warfare the one with space or advanced warfare no wait it was cod ghost wasn't it you go to space in cod goes but you're also infinite warfare is the one where you're like permanently in space but that's it in the future in it but i think this is soon quick look at the scoreboard here i've got 130 ping yeah here's the operator screen so there's only three at the moment shielder vodka literally says vodka and fixer and i can just pick a few different things well i can't because i haven't unlocked anything but you get the point spawning back in here and i think we flip sides yeah we're on the opposite side there's like weird quips as well for the characters i'm not into those but it is what it is look at these little guys there so you see how it says i've landed there and then i'm airborne so if you just want to touch down on the surface that's all you have to do a long range oh i got mints there look at this guy is that a special backpack no he's turning to among us and then it does this weird zoom in as well just before you respawn we're losing b so we'll use my accelerator here oh man there's something good about the sounds i don't know what it is they're quite crunchy you can hear the sounds of your suit and just the hum of space i don't think it actually has a home i'm going this little bit here there's plenty of flanking opportunities here i think i'll be much better off if i had a scope i'm going to use my rocket thing here boom oh yes there's a little tunnel there we move one absolute baller just floating through space like that is that bullet hole in my suit is that what that was yeah there's another game mode too in the demo 130 ping still i must be on a us server or something and the other game mode is kind of like a tdm elimination style game mode and then after a while the flag appears in the middle so you can go and capture it and if you capture it you win that round so it's more of a round based thing a bit more competitive and if your teammates die they don't respawn but you can go and revive them they get a little defib symbol above their heads and you can pick them up no explosion there yeah i mean the prospect of this is super cool isn't it i'm just gonna sit here enemy nearby this is their gimme flag makes you wonder like when the fall games are what kind of things are they gonna have for the suits for the guns all sorts of movement abilities it's just interesting to play something like this in zero g why was that guy spotted then is this some kind of like radar system i don't know because there's not a mini map obviously trying to work it out that's my accelerator percentage in the bottom right there i'll do a little landing here you can kind of hear your footsteps as well oh that's good that feels good there's a humongous there oh sh just exploded damn that guy was tanky now he's humongous look at him he's having a great time floating around in space just like i am yeah there it is i mean that's it for now i don't know if they're planning on introducing more game modes i presume they are the level design even though it looks simple i think they've obviously thought about the fact that it's in zero g you've actually got cover to work with as well i know when a lot of flying games try and do like pvp go on yes they end up just having big open spaces with no cover but because this is on a smaller scale you know they've added a lot of that cover in there i think it is that enemy not friendly i think it makes sense as well because of all this space debris so yeah it's quite intricate level design really how ambitious this game gets i have no idea but i wanted to show you guys and put it on your radar i just saw myself then like i said it is on steam right now with the demo can i switch to my pistol i do have a pistol i'll try and get a kill yeah so just try it out yourself see what you think oh we didn't get the pistol kill we won the game though the vacuum exiles thank you for watching guys let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you enjoyed the video leave a like i actually unlock stuff here is that a new gun a flash hider yeah project boundary interesting see you next time
