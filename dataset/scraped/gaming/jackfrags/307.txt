the gulag i cannot stand this place possibly the worst location on the war zone map you can camp there or match if you want to easily snipe people from the towers and you've got multiple levels nooks and crannies to hide in and it's where today's solo match ends not ideal for me really when i have to push up towards it but this was a great game for sure so today using the pharah raven did release a patch yesterday that nerfed it a bit along with some barrel changes but they had to revert it for some reason so the pharah for now is still incredible make the most of it while you can with that said as always thank you to these folks using my code in the cod store you're all legends so let's get into the match now if you enjoy the vid leave a like subscribe for more it's time for some pain okay my plan is to just go after people get my loadout as quick as possible get that pharah get that mac 10 and just go on a mad lad rampage now i did see someone land over here and the doors open there so i'm assuming [Applause] i've gone in here in the back nice little shimmy there kimbo slice what's that dude a fighter or something i'm sure it was a fire well thank you for the satchel appreciate it i did put a claymore down here just in case you see me yeah you don't want to be forced out in the open like that and if you do oh it was kimbo again and they must come back from the gulag yeah if you get caught out in the open like that don't crouch just try and get into cover as soon as possible [Applause] i think that was a loadout yeah this c58 hits hard i've already done a video on it but i mean it almost feels as good as the amex used to you know before they nerfed it let's get that lowly i think i'm clear enemy uav overhead oh mate you are stuck in the buy station it's an unfortunate way to end the free one over here but there was two i do want to get my ghost i'll be that car wouldn't it i've got a thriller class here i think it's got out i'm sorry oh god that'll do didn't blow the car up i just blew them up instead pick up a uav i really don't like going through here request recon fly over there's a guy right now [Applause] that guy's coming over uh you're right there mate doing the moon walker i'm not messing around with that can't stand right shields especially in solos man just really difficult if you don't have a stone or a grenade you're 1v1 easy to lose that the value of pain i call this worst place you could possibly be in a solo match especially if you don't have a vehicle like me although i've got a cluster going far on the left no behind me no what i made it right on cue i mean i don't know what the plan was there but didn't work out i can't go right there could get another uav [Applause] pop that request one guy up ahead on the other side just the beams the pharah can't escape it the only thing they could have done there is maybe if they had high alert it's the second i looked at them i got the notification looked at i'm just sitting in here because there's no way that was the only one from downtown there's still 15 people [Applause] captain price from the 80s loving life on a quad bike there oh that's a good pickup what is that airstrike that was rude on the roof here target marked [Applause] request reconfired uav entering the ao [Applause] wait in that truck there yeah they must be what are you doing in that ghost come on come on nasty the full laser beam i call that and you know what i'm gonna go get another get to the new uav zone because why the hell not request recall flyover yeah one got there where is that that's the two-story building isn't it the long one so you gotta play solos man if you want to enjoy it don't just come get your load out get some money run around baby people like that [Laughter] be so you get killed by a hacker and then you absolutely hate your life but that's what was done for you i'm gonna give this guy a red card i think camping in a building with a sniper get off the pitch that's so stupid i was the most wide up at prison no one's gonna get that i'm gonna snag this bouncy just get a bit of recon hopefully it doesn't turn into loot on the bounty target sort them out usually they do that late in the game four other players i know there's at least one of them in the gulag and my bounty unless the most wanted is my bounty but i think it's i different have to use that bike if i could actually climb all the rocks i feel like although this is incredibly loud it's the safest play for me right now because i couldn't oh my god it stopped there could be someone on the top there looking at me i wonder if we should just go a bit closer because the um the entrance is here isn't it [Music] is there anyone in there no it doesn't like it well we'll just wait here for a sec and then see where the zone goes you seen this emote check this out the celebratory smoke it's a cuban cigar now the funny thing with that is that you can shoot at the same time as doing that emote so i've got quite a good idea it could be quite funny for a video well i think i'll have to run it with an smg because hipfire only when you're doing that see how many people i could kill and see if i could win a game of warzone where if i try and kill someone i have to use that remote first and then just hit find them i think that could be quite good this is such a dodgy spot for me i don't wanna oh hello oh mate you stick out like a sore thumb there i've got some women they've gotta be at the tower three people left can i get up that rock yeah this one yeah i hate it here at prison can't climb up on the outside and people have got like so many places inside the hide that you just just heaven isn't it for a camper and solo they've not started shooting each other yet where is it going to go gas is moving in okay that's really good although part of the roof is still in so you've got cass moving in there might be someone there no i think i'd have seen him already i mean there are multiple levels there aren't there on the prison so one of them's got ghosts i know that they're fine okay nice head glitch here oh here we go i was getting a bit dubious there shake that one off 13 kills i can't stand prison though especially end game like that it's just awful i think the whole area just needs a rebound but it's quite a fun match actually we had some interesting fights there good times all round and that pharah is absolute dirt love it with that said thank you for watching guys if you liked it leave a like subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next [Music] one you
