i haven't really played and recorded for about a week now there's just not been that much new stuff even with the mid season event but i am looking forward to the iron trials mode which should be out soon and will change a lot of the fundamental designs within the game that will definitely shake things up and be fun to try but in the meantime couple members on my discord server needed a player asked me if i wanted to join so i hopped on with them and we had some nice chill matches no cheaters four matches in a row it was bliss and a really nice game to watch using that krig it's got no recall on it and they have reduced the damage a tad but still pretty effective if you enjoyed the video leave a like subscribe for more let's get it plates up here if anyone needs i'm just pushing the bottom of your building jack objective location yeah there's a guy down on the roof okay see we're upping that daddy there's a team there moving small caliber here yeah i see him rub one blue one has

he was hiding behind the garbage can there or the uh the bathrooms [Applause] some people just got a lot of hair these guys might have had some money though he's running away down the hill back there

the m4 so i don't have the distance okay that team they're on green they're gonna have to come down now okay i'm also doing a hard rotate i'm here oh i think we should stay here but i don't i'm not

you hit a rando it sounded like okay okay i see him up hill never mind [ __ ] him get into the trees broke in the gas oh no why didn't it [ __ ] he goes oh no why didn't the effing heal [Laughter] well there's not much cover there really is there no but i think we we should rotate up the hill now that we've cleared it all right then let's go oh they're fighting up there must have been doing recons or something good bit of cover here though the guy that forgot to heal like that wasn't a team wipe so he's still got people somewhere i thought was a teammate i i didn't think i saw it i'm almost out of a soul rifle i'm over here if we go over this hill we might run into a squad we got a nice little spot right here yeah um there's a guy here behind the firehouse i don't have the sniper joe all right there's somebody on the other side of the firehouse from us i'm gonna push that okay i'm gonna help jack yeah oh oh i'm getting looked at by another sniper down by the building okay we might push here just be careful we're in the uh warehouse down there see where it bounces too and then we'll make a choice i might grab a sniper real quick one down come on nice uh zinging to the left further downhill whereabouts oh yeah where your blue is just be careful it's still about here right okay i think so don't don't don't there's a guy by the wood i think he's on the rock let me get you
