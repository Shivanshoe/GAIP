today i've got an absolute banger of a war zone game for you with geeky pastimes and a couple members from his community name gear and arrow i went full try hard in this game using the dmr and the gallantry mac 10 blueprint which apparently does more damage than the standard map 10 as jay god proved in his latest video i'm playing very patiently in this one though i did slip up a bit at the end however i think you guys will find this really entertaining as always a big thanks to everyone using my creator code in the cod store i appreciate that you're all legends with that said leave a like

little thing in the little shack he's in there i'm going to blow what's in that little shirt oh it's not spotted i don't know i threw a nade in there i didn't get any tags so i'll get he could be in there place has been looted already watch for hostiles he's in the arch he's here moving i could stun him and we could drop you on yeah he's he's just gone through the other side i think no tag [Applause] he's running around he's gonna come around here let's see him here with me a new name man john walk it off they're done teamwork yeah they probably come about from gulag double threat those there's a guy up there spot up there get a uav geeky if you can drop some cash there i need armor freaking get over [Music] if we go down to the bottom and then start cutting away of course [Applause] is it apparently or anything hey this one here does anyone need this oh just jumped out of the fire station at the tower yeah don't move no eyes on there he is you should run out left nice teamwork [Music] good job are you still on the train there's a car following it down [Applause] don't cry and such are you taking shots from there respawn on purple coordinates marked [Applause] bounty target

there's another one in there in the little hole going this way i mean i could be really mean to do this airstrike target hit it this is excuse me oh jesus [Applause] i'm exploding along we have to move a little bit to the zone quite away from that i really do should we just go you want to bail yeah yeah [Applause] if i had to retrace shadows on for a while and i haven't noticed anything they've done but then you just parachuted in it's like that it's a nice shadow oh i can see the strings when you shadow as far as i know the ray tracing isn't actually on in warzone it doesn't change anything yeah it's just a modern warfare is it not [Music] i'm just having a crack at that because why not keeping an eye out in case there's a third one we should move in that building window go on the left he jumps out the back he's not showing up on he's got ghosts enemy positions take cover interesting has been doing maybe oh is that the airstrike yes down dead teamwork team one do you need armor or anything guys i've got another box oh christ can they nice good job that dude was very aggressive shall i put armor box down guys do we need that now or should we wait uh yeah you want it i could do
