all right here we go big slam [Music] love that combo hi everyone and welcome back to hype escape i've been playing the game a bit more since the open beta went live and i'm starting to get a better understanding of how everything works what hack abilities to take when to use them best weapon combinations etc and today i've got an awesome match to show you guys playing with tommy and adam from the two angry gamers it's my highest kill count game so far and there were just some really interesting plays in here i think it's quite fun to watch and a big thanks to ubisoft for sponsoring today's video the open beta for the game is live now on uplay it's free to play and there's a link down in the description below if you're interested in trying it out for yourself and the intention of the open beta is to have it available to play up until the launch of the game at season 1. with that said before we get into the match i want to show you guys a bit of a mystery when i started playing hype escape there's a specific sound that i heard every now and again in the game this one that little jingle there and i was like it's so simple but i'm sure that i've heard that exact sound somewhere before and to be honest with you guys it started to drive me a bit mad i was losing sleep over it anyways at first i thought is it my fridge because my fridge plays a little jingle when it's been left open for too long and the reason for that is so you know if you've left the fridge open or you've not shut it properly and you don't spoil the food so the sound plays and you think oh the fridge is open go close it but i went downstairs i tested that it's not the same and i was thinking maybe it's i don't know a notification on my phone or something went through them all couldn't find it and then a couple of days ago it hit me go to your sound control panel on windows right click and test one of the audio devices there it is finally i found it that was really driving me nuts for weeks but now i'm at peace again i hope you like the gameplay though if you do leave a like and enjoy some hot ball action go i will become ball we've got a sky breaker i'm helping he's gone back out we're too much of a ball jack down here guys i see an enemy oh god and welcome to the slam gold ball be aware of your location contenders sectors are very odd isn't it that it's not right don't like being pushed around like that dear jack must find enemies okay this guy's here and the whole the two squads fighting here okay we're gonna get involved yeah let's go below us on the way hey right on me okay i'm gonna come back it's always a wily one anymore no i think we're good oh you're on the rooftop oh yeah it's invisible he's nearly dead [Applause] oh idiot chasing her lots of guys around right in front of me adam jack gotta be nearly dead just guessing where she is no i don't know where she went bong's on her phone uh see you guys on the roof in front of us here we should get these

they're fighting yeah i'll try oh i heard footsteps behind me then we're gonna get sandwiched nice going to come up with some fire now yeah there's a whole group over there tom's fighting a different group to you right sky breaker time oh that's so much damage there's another one on the roof i'm going i'm going getting out of here that skybrake is devastating man are you alert contenders there's one on the notre dame at the top what the hell get down from there 70 damage well get it mine can't quite get an angle on them he stopped everybody slap so addicted that slam i feel like you need it though it's just one of the required hacks at this point because of how quickly people can get away you got to chase them and also for getting away yourself on the roof above you yet yeah we chased someone oh he's been minced they're at the corner another slam here [Music] oh so good so good on the roof finder sim yeah i'm shooting him we got a move attention contenders the crowd is about to
