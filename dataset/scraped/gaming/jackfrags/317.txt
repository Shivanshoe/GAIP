i reckon i can get everyone to jump up and down let's just jump everyone jump yeah there we go look at that okay you can go now welcome to gun master i thought i'd jump on bf4 play some today's full server here i've played gunmaster in ages i like this game mode very much a bit of uh 2042 bf4 related news kind of where did you come from are you flanked you're on one hp dude just called me so apparently get this so many people have been playing this game year four counts as kill m60 cool there's so many people have been playing bf4 that the servers hit capacity and ea actually had to go in and spawn up some more servers they had to make some more servers to deal with the amount of players that were coming in and i think that's kind of cool and that has obviously all been driven by the bf2042 hype but it's just it's just awesome you know it's just super cool to see a lot of people playing battlefield again hype for the franchise i hit this dude in the head there we go i mean i hit him three times i thought i'd at least have had the kill there suppressed i can't really face that but yeah i mean i might put a picture up on the screen now from battle to showing you guys like it's crazy 64 player servers are just full and most of them have got massive cues on them yeah i've got to keep my head down there that's awesome i love it i mean as a as a battlefield fan as someone who loves this game hey we got him i'm running across the top i'm an absolute potato yeah somebody loves this game i think that's great the real no not the real fake well at least we got there we got the one kill night shadow no yaks took me out with the a91 i love gun master as well i think it's great but uh yeah the hype for 2042 has been great i think you know the vibe of the game the direction that dice are taking it just looks fun doesn't it this looks like a laugh can i jump up that no can't even get up that are you kidding me dice i'm sure there'll be plenty of that in bs 2042 where are you going you're not gonna come this way no oh i'm on the bridge oh these stairs man i'm dead yeah how the bridge guy got me it is how it is you know the eagle's awesome i love this gun but uh yeah bf 2042 it was actually the number one seller on steam like the day after they revealed it and then i think after the gameplay trailer as well i think it was number one on origin and is it on epic games it might it may have been on epic games i was reading an article about it just semi-auto yeah it is behind me no i've got teammates there yeah so the hype is just uh off the chain right now and a lot of like my old mates who oh my god how did i not get a kill then a lot of my old mates who stopped playing battlefield really after like bf1 came out like i think bf1 is a really fun game but it's not it's not your traditional battlefield game you know they changed a lot of things um but a lot of my old mates have seen that 2042 trailer and gone okay right i'm in again you know they want to come back to the franchise now i think i got the casters kill there didn't i yeah i did are we even at the moment what we got m249 how awesome is this weapon model let's keep tapping more here headshot kill assist i was losing down there got him saga cool weapon this is hey jack hey i can't type to you but hello if you see the video hello how are we going oh nice little triple there there's more around here on the left oh dude 870. can i get him from that range yeah apparently oh my there team it's got him on to the um you guys say humble ump not got much range on it though in bf4 unfortunately yeah it's really bad i'm heavily suppressed right now that dude just presented a nice opportunity there i flanked them there one down here isn't that got him m16 m4 might be the slava up there with the m60 that was a 10 kill streak awesome we're getting it done then oh hey jack what's up oh it is the best one isn't this called the m4 in this game and then the assault class gets the m416 ow that was a lot of damage are you still there i should have read yes shouldn't i oh they've got a shotgun nice killer there with a saga but yeah let me know down in the comments below if you guys actually come back and start playing bf4 again after the bf2042 i still got a month away guys looking that's too far away as well just gotta wait here regen for a bit yeah he's pushing can i close this huh hopefully there's going to be loads of those little interactable things on the uh 2042 maps i'm so dead different guy yeah i didn't even see that dude while he is the night shadow after all so makes sense right as well we've got to get a bit closer don't we close the gap a bit there's one on the left here that's perfect range payback as well another guy behind me you're dead got him oh l l96 no l115 is called they renamed it didn't they in the back oh with their last bullet as well look they're just dead on the floor now i think we're still in the lead how many one two three ah that could have been the kill there's one nice little drag shot there's two come on unica there's a secret reload with this gun that i never ever was able to proc i've seen videos of it but i've never had it myself i don't know what the uh oh my god the hip fly's awful i don't know what the chances are on it there's one we need one more i can reload here i think but it's a nice reload that's gone quiet it must have spawned over here okay assist oh counts just kill nice is it block yeah glock 18 come on there's loads coming through look one two three oh that was proper john wick there oh i couldn't get the fourth qp says gonna beat me in that range with the pistol they nailed the pistols in this game or didn't they still feel so good you know this came out in 2013 this game okay well not much damage there you're gonna be okay last one knife can we do it might be quite tricky on this map because it's quite big oh this guy this guy run past me no okay you're going in dice what what happened then did they get killed i think they just got killed i was robbed i'm still in the lead by like one two three four five so that's fine i'm gonna be here all day aren't i i'm on the left oh god thank you teammate got him oh here we go yes gg [Laughter] wrong place wrong time my friend it was like it was scripted that wasn't it just running right past me damn gun masters fun man so many
