get it secondary another big lad here yeah oh i'm dead guys this is not a good start i'm dead there's no doubt uh there's no down it's just instantly dead it must be dance no no because it'll be rescued from uh from the thing i've seen downs in the game play first yeah you have a pistol or a melee weapon you can't have both okay it's like the gloves well unless you've got a perk that lets you do it obviously i found some i've nearly run out of ammo well i had some ammo how do we set this up lower the bridge yeah i i have now ran out of primary oh it's got an ak and a little mad 10. there's a hunter here use the correct terms i'm lad just chasing it with the basement yeah you all oh yeah yeah the propane shoot the propane tank shoot the probe attack nice the ammo outflow oh god you're all right this is more difficult than i thought it would be no it's not normal it's not normal this is not a nightmare i'm a zombie hey i mean i'm yet to get a gun molotov here it must be a safe room soon right now you've only just started the level yeah we've not really gone anywhere i don't see i mean you are absolutely covered in blood yeah the blood are covering i think is a bit much a bit excessive in it [Music] hello what the hell it's the full aliens then i've got an m1911 that's it you guys got pills or bandages why is the abs sense so high compared to normal cells this has got separate senses for ads and for normal for some reason have you guys got any healing abilities or advantages i've got a bandage did you reply said bandage to me please mr freeman there you go okay you just got to put the uniform manually wrap this up battle me there you go look at that thank you hit marks are a bit big oh [Music] oh behind us nice sound effects on the m1911 i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i can't get up yeah have you got my ak now i've always had an ak i don't know look at this random head end have you healed us there what happened then i think when one of us i have an ability yeah i've got one as well like a talon i'm going down oh i i didn't realize he was there didn't i get some help right so that okay guys you've abandoned me well i was on time he's not dying just keep him am i doing something that's it would that look like i could only watch you third person um you got it you got it it must be a safe room soon surely i don't think we've gone that far guys no we have oh you're dead it's a boomer fine [ __ ] it i'm out it's not fine um you scared the birds tom you don't like me let's hunt [ __ ] [Music] killed by the commoners all right continues remaining one okay so you get i mean you're legal at this point that's the start of the game yeah but they've made them harder but giving you continues based on the difficulty level i think definitely harder than normal difficulty on left for dead oh yeah death 100 um okay you do get some more cards look healing a teammate also heals you oh teammate 10 health team health i'll put that on look lovely and we get extra cards when we get continue you get points to get yes literally right at the start yeah because we because we barely went anywhere i mean we might as well restart i don't know what do you reckon i mean you know oh we've got some more money where'd you get that from it was a full inventory system yeah oh you can drop amount of people well you that's cool thank you very much hannah for the raids let's go daddy you can push them yeah yeah yeah these push it's quite important right this is it look we've got more health now 143 yeah this is good what's that arm rolling around what the hell's going on just want to push on right click sniper ammo there yeah push back on board because you need but you need i aim for right click there don't you it's just just to be nice and methodical using batch does not uh cancel your reload so if you're reloading on somebody's knee you bash them sorry then you got a machete at the moment i'm flying through this room yeah yeah that's that's fine that's part of it that's part of the horror isn't it amazing i'm keeping this uh bat it seems to be really strong flammable actually no i'm going to keep the machete because to be honest the pistol is dog [ __ ] so i need a primary like i just need to get a primary gun i should have put one in my deck locked doors can have alarms that alert the horde yeah i i know previously that was not ideal okay well this is where the first sword was like the first time at least but it can be different every round that you play yeah you were trying to get in this tasty room weren't you yeah what i like so i'm just going to come down here the tall boys yeah yeah get away from him just play rain play range come in the corridor back here [Music] yeah just busted him in the weak spot oh he's fatted me he's got quite the rain got him he's gone he's gone his arm just flies some nice ragdolls come on you need to keep moving they're not moving or anything on the street down there you shot me ow what's this i like how her weak spot is the heart just shoot the heart get in there tom yeah you're all healing though at least because when i die you will heal careful of the wretch explosion luckily we know that there's a revolver well you can get someone back in here or at least it was before i got the wretch that was in there spawned i'm not sure i'm not sure that's correct i'm not smiling i i need to just spawn behind you i don't know you revive oh there you go requires tool kit guys and i've got tool kit yeah i've i've bought a d fib this round there's bits of [ __ ] you shot me ow it's fun to be playing a game like this again yeah i want to get a gun i've got that what's this dude is this different to last time oh guys slightly come on back into it chopping the thing down and shatters into a million pieces now this is where we died last time all right the crows here oh no you smashed me again well i've only got oh the horde's the horn quickly got it going out nice are we running into the horde no no no this is a good place to hold them though then we've got more um a bit of elevation oh god please this is crazy inside he's dead he's dead hey he's dead just hold this room for a second why don't you have a gunpop i don't know i haven't found one yeah but you just fall with one i don't i don't support this character doesn't support his faulty can you shoot the big lad can we get out what are we supposed to do i'm dead this is just high key stress about this game [Music] i've got no bullets though he's just vomiting at the wall that's a shotgun i don't have a choice though do i let's go go let's go hello jack i don't know where i'm going pipes across the pipes nice oh god that's victory oh god friendly damage inflicted it's great there was a lot of team theme damage with some copper i mean i'd love for zero there's no reviving i'd absolutely love a gun that'd be lovely oh did freeman did you have defibs you revived tom is that what happened yeah i was on the ic uh yeah act one stage two i think it's the cardstone that you played a natural fog yeah and i'm natural fog has set on the area so that's a random card that the ai has played yeah they've got shambling armored ridden they've just added my cards i can't see your cards i've got damage we've got blood donor times you'd like here triumph tom kills with a melee weapon he'll do health well i think it applies to your team because my blood donor one says times three have you all have you all chosen that i've got blood donor yeah we've got three stacks of blood donor i've got plus 10 team ammo i'm open team stamina and team health it does say specifically though this card applies to you and your teammates you can get a defib here i just want a gun extended is this sell a gun where's the where's the shopping they didn't sell they didn't sell guns the orange thing yeah i'm gonna buy some bandages and heal you guys because i've got a uh i bought an ammo pack i've got a tool kit bandages there we go so my inventory is full now inventory oh i bought some handmades and they're on the ground now because i bought extras so i get them it's your lucky day hr build it hills here good come in here i need to heal painkillers here i've got a bad digs in a toolkit [Music] jumping oh boy shoot the boomer oh [Music] crazy are you in there oh he's climbing up guys he's climbed up he's climbed up his body i need ammo when i can't do an exam i've got i've got a machete no no he doesn't care [Applause] guys this hasn't gone well no okay okay this guy's got oh god dude how is he alive still okay he's gone he's dead yeah this is a swap zombie i have now used my bandage and that's done yeah let's not let's not allow any hordes i [Music] oh there's a wretch over there adam yeah here are the acids [Applause] you've got any ammo bombs got getting health back on me yeah every time you hit someone you get health back oh my god that run good luck defeating that uh giant lad with milo if we cut them into here and then what then and then fall over and die [Applause] i'd prefer not to i'm gone they beat you up maybe just run past them yeah get past them there's nothing i've got any stamina left he's coming oh you know freeman yes back out i turned into an eye let's just fly off the wall this is our last continue this is we've got no more continues after this all right look i just want a gun is it so much to ask listen i think we should for some reason we're not going down to be revived which should be happening and tommy doesn't have a gun but i don't think i think sometimes there is no down but i've seen it in all the gameplay footage right here we go so this is a nice card uh an unnatural fog i was wondering if one of the cards that they had been that we couldn't figure i've got martyr you and your teammate become when you're in your teammate and coming to her pass today all teammates getting 100 damage 20 reload speed unlimited ammo for 10 seconds bought some spare meds there if anyone wants them well i need some yeah if i if i bandage people it it heals me as well so i'm trying to these real people you can't hide okay i will get you when will i leave he's out there why me all right i've got a defibrillator a bandage and i've got let's do this uh firecrackers to distract people okay there's a tall boy he's the primary target right now get him get him you certainly need healing i can heal off these as they come up he smashes he's smashing around like a young rory calhoun and he stands he just stands ow why hit me then there's a spitter i killed him okay [Music] wish i had to go no there's a deep breath here guys someone pick this up yeah that's going to come in handy that's real oh okay those guys just don't know over the headshots again you know oh is it reloading good evening ridiculous oh sorry what come on man he's right there oh what yeah what's him well i love you guys but i think the big boys oh okay the snitch are you supposed to kill them silently or something big lads here by the way rocks he's really quick he's legitimately scarier than the tank just smashing me need to get the treatment's gone as well yeah i'm gonna use the d prints i know me and fema have the defense oh it's quite challenging i don't even know if we can kill that thing he's coming okay i'm rescuable farm health you have to smash that door open i'm back as well over here what are you doing i don't know panicking i wish i could see well that's uh i need to look at my deck i think i think i need to adjust my deck i wanted to get i need to get a card this company has a gun these these devs made left for dead deathless i'm not trying hard the normal the normal difficulty is plenty hard enough yeah this is plenty challenging it's good i think maybe we need to understand the decks a bit more though and have a look at the decks i'd like a shotgun that'd be good i'm going to edit my big day it's random what you start with though is based on the camera no no it's based on the card but the character starts with guns as well my character starts with a machete cards all right here we go okay start with the tac 14 start with an ak-47 start with an m1a insurance policy uh let's get that instead of that let's go with i really need to start with a gun get blood donor where's that yeah i've got blood donor uh yeah i got it yeah yeah i've got all i've got all the team ones okay here we go so the red ones where you can start with guns caretaker um team health trophy hunter what's attack 14 do you think it's like a dmr kind of thing isn't it sounds like a dmr tonight pack 14 i think it'll be an smg won't it what was the little tech nine thing i had i thought that was attack 10 reloads why is it loadout cards and drawn cards so loadout cards that's ones you just start with is it yeah and then i guess there's only there's a finite amount of loadout cards you can have i'm putting my i'm getting an m1i as a starting gun then yeah i think that's a shotgun oh i've got it i'm going for it automatically grab automatically break out of a grab that's a pretty good card [Music] yeah i've got that i didn't apply it though i just put all the team ones on i know loadout cards are just you can put any you can put anything in there i think what it means is that's your starting card and then you draw five to begin the game so you one you definitely want to start with you want to put in that slot okay i've put my gun in that slot for example because you know i need gunny there's one there's a card here your secondary weapons have unlimited ammo yeah yeah there's also a card that gives you make so you can have a primary gun in your secondary slot so you can have an ak and a shotgun so that would be good for that one but again you see these aren't you only draw cards at the start when you continue and you draw a new one every time you get to a safe room as well move speed attack 14 is a shotgun okay [Music] oh i think m1a isn't that just um isn't that just a carbine well it just looks like shotgun shells that's all next to it they all look like that all right i'll go with the top 14. i'm going in one here all right there we go are we tell me when you guys are ready yeah i'm ready but you could make the full melee madman on this that's what i'm doing okay every card that's got relay on it but then you don't need to start with a gun then you just well then you play my character because he starts yeah i've started with combat knife as my bash is a combat knife that counts as a melee weapon well if he plays my character he starts with a machete no but isn't that based on the card deck that you had no it wasn't i didn't know any card that started with a machete it says when you pick him he starts with the machine okay okay i'll start playing him then i'll play professor fat have you made a deck adam yeah i think bong's just finishing is the secondary weapons have unlimited ammo that's quite a useful talent unless maybe if you don't choose a weapon you automatically you always start with the machete that could also be it um look at the perks he gets more double move speed that guy as well which i don't know if that might be useful for milo all right are you ready to go right save deck that's saved yeah right well we might have got under yeah yeah yeah we might have gotten lucky with the directors like cards you know they might be really strong ones or something it said that they've common infected to the more damage to the body so that might have been i don't need to watch the trailer before we play mate marketing skip i wonder how many levels i wonder if it's just the first two levels four i think you see yeah yeah you know he does angelo starts the machete off from the m1911 so the card was an ak that i got for hoffman yeah so yes you get stamina regen with angelo so you definitely want him for me okay i'll start with him corruption quite a big dick you've not named your decks guys sorry sir um okay now ridden i know there's just what enemies are in the thing yes tac 14 good team talent 10 health blood donor craving hunter yeah i got some good drawers there are they ready yay i've got the fattest shotgun ever okay that's not that's a very weird first person model i'll say it's just my giant wrist i'll put my wrist right grenade pain meds uh i'm gonna get a tool kit so that we can open maybe one of those oh there's an ammo pack here guys someone can pick up sniper yeah get some pick up i'll take the rear i'll take the wheel you can't have pain meds or bandage so i thought yeah it's just one supporter well actually advantages are two pain meds no no this character can your character can okay that's why he's like a support suppose you don't have to open these doors but you could find loot in them yeah um just the ones that are alarmed you don't want to open yeah do we have a plan or are we you know do we have a plan that's it this is uh we're still going to go bodies everywhere everywhere oh we're going to nail it this time just trying to get some ice we've come in handy i just found some sniper remote i'm guessing that's for the m1a come on get that truck ding we got a winner i like having guns oh uh you want to get get back in this corridor this is the one come come to the end tom just beaming when he comes through the military doesn't prepare you for civilian life is infected kills now okay that's pretty mean it's flaming isn't it invincible i mean it's [Music] that door's alarmed then yeah what's that what's before i don't know if it will be now locked doors have alarms so is that a guaranteed horde moment then i guess uh if they break it and i'll just see when somebody i can use the toolkit to stop the alarm oh yeah the lockpick thing but there's also special doors that might have i know then [Music] vomiting through the wall um that's a horde then i think we're all right but it's fine just keep chopping because you're covered in filth where was the big lad free man i think you've chopped the [ __ ] out of me though yeah sorry i had a hundred health you know i've got 63. reloading i'm not trying to shoot you i'll kill you if you do that again the team damage seems quite um unforgiving yeah yeah try not to hit each other should be able to get long up soon so many bodies on the floor um can we actually crouch past the crows and not alert them yeah you just go right don't go left or right don't we have to climb there but we can climb up it's fine yeah you can get past them hold up where you gotta go anyway oh no rescue all right i'm gonna go down here no no no reloading stay back i wonder if we play this on classic mode would you have revived uh yeah it might be that you get more damage on that so you rescueable jackal not yet no i feel like we're playing some hard mode it's well it's just the middle one in between them okay birds we've here a d frame for jack you can get a jacket i think you just climb up you climb up here you're right behind me oh there's a medpack behind you as well i think it's i think it's past the birds is it working bomb it says miscellaneous i don't know what that button is oh i've been pinned the f1 oh this is not good could you drop the default kit to tommy yeah i shot an alarm door that's that's not right you can drop it from the inventory thanks thank you okay all right okay i mean i was just shooting the door and then he just ran into it say for him [Applause] all around me i mean it doesn't feel like a victory hmm there's friendly damage all around there uh maybe the bear like that unnatural fog so they're the same every time uh i've got the health on melee insurance policy uh plus one extra life lose 50 copper each safe room that's all right all right i'm gonna buy lovely friendlies man a couple of bandages ask you to be here best you went the door's clearly marked you don't get many yeah i've got my tool kit and i get two frag grenades can you have two i can have two because this character can have two grounded two frags all right let's just clone steady she makes a horrible noise a sniper does a lot of damage if you go for the weak spots relying on you for the ogre i think we should just run past the ogre though him no i don't know if we can tom he's a filth that must be destroyed he's got a lot of help i don't think we can we can kill him look at that i think he's meant to follow you through the level like yeah feels that way anyway as you're doing damage to this i think you'd be all right i don't think we've got enough ammo to get him loads of ammo i haven't seen this many ridden since the cold [ __ ] maybe not is no this is a really bad idea we should just run well we'll let it pass it then where's it's coming through i'll be fine there's many hordes here he's coming oh no he's on fire as well jeez get into the cover okay i'm inside he can't go through here would love to try and get where you are now you know it's all boy he's in um the reach of the zombies is mad right i'm dead oh no i'm down i'm actually got a downed animation now [Music] at the end or something oh there's an m1a here yeah that's the one that i have it's just me we need to find freeman there's another d frame no [Music] i don't think uh the melee character works like in this because like the enemies like like three or four hits sometimes i'm dropping ammo i'm sorry i'm not dropping it using it has anyone got a heal no we're all ruined okay baseball you get overwhelmed so easily well you need like to know what you need something but you need a combination of about 17 different cars to actually make it really good cheese in here i feel like cheesing gonna go there but it will take you literally forever we're going to find our teammates some kind of horrible effect here over here was that was that effective hp this is not good [ __ ] out yeah move back me back oh no try not to shoot each other we can move thank you and there's something under that little thing for that to the right there's a gun and then ammo there's another ammo site there oh he's saying he's in tom need to reload is that pistol just under there uh a machete good lag going on your body's odd my body hurts i try age before being something here i know oh it's another shotgun here attack 14. oh well but it's pretty good i'll grab that i think it might have hey yeah oh yeah this one's got attachments on it this one's actually got like three attachments i'm gonna take this one got an extra an extra ammo i know unless you've got that card already used it and said raymond have you got it hey i'm just in the next room over here oh you you can come this way you can come this way this is stuff here reloading i feel like we should be getting knocked out no you get i i got knocked down you need a card for it there's a card it gives you an extra life and it costs 50 copper safe room yeah but i reckon in the in the classic game mode it doesn't say that it says unlimited continues on the classic mode that's the music sounds mad very loud didn't it yeah what the hell's going on study deafening oh oh fat boy's here no what would you do i mean he can't come in there tom please get out of there he appears to be in are you pleased what's that and freeman's dead one rpk oh god he's coming i'm in an alternate shed look for me ow freeman shot me in the back of the head it's just as a rescue wait look around for items you might be oh i'm insane let's go get into the safe room into the safe room we need to open this door oh my god we're going to end up killing each other oh no no no no pretty much dead oh the fps is not great here no it's gone it's gone it's gone it's okay let's just just calm there's a tall lad oh boy everyone calm down do this fall boy he's the main problem hunter another tall boy why is there so many special infected is it one of the cards i don't know please he said he said two bullets left [ __ ] up well what it's my favorite i've got a sniper oh shotgun oh my nice three brights over there yeah that's ridiculous these places remind me of my father and it smells familiar demon is perished they'll be back and a great number long live freeman all heroes revived thank you orbot thank you slide job a slide job [Music] play job times three rewards i know we do get spoiled i thought i thought i guess we could play the whole act what might just do half of it or something you can equip a primary in your secondary slot i could get here 10 health is there no there's no buy station right i believe in ambassador freeman i've got um if i heal you it heals me as well so that should be could mean i'm gonna buy you know if i hang on can i hear you now or are you are you guys at max health now is it oh yeah my max health 61 now what's up when you get yeah when you go down is it like you you lose maxell perhaps i don't know i've got a tall cat should i get one i don't have one [Music] i've got a couple of grenades bandages pain meds can put you you can break the health barrier it is quite massive sure you check guns look at their like um the ogre's here oh god he's here oh god showing rocks we're just hiding in this is that what we're doing now we're leaving let's go come on oh else is going freeman okay he's in the bus but i mean it certainly feels he's driving he's i'm sorry it's literally doing like almost oh there we go is if you do enough damage to his weak points he goes away well what there's a bit of a different thing to the tank it's more of another yeah it's like a little mini boss you avoid trying to do enough damage to him to get him to [ __ ] her up basically good come in here i hate these armored ones yeah they they take about 10 million shots from the machete as well for the head i was like there watch out watch out that shotgun seems very good yeah it's uh it's pretty good they've got a nice spread on it as well hold it down snitches how do you take out a snitch without alerting the horde um it'll be quiet around it and then maybe it maybe i don't know oh no no no it's large arm long boy [Music] what do we do about the snitch i don't know a grenade at it we just crouch pass ignore it a grenade trolley would insta kill it i think if you get close enough um i've just been oh i'm stuck to this wall here i have no ammo of any kind i'm there there hello oh you kidding me as well lord teleportee is it you got him there's bombs he's about where we were no i hate those guys right they're really really annoying oh god what's it dude your box hello he's coming he's he can like run and just lunge and hit you like well let's defeat me over again guys although it seemed like if you're just getting that garage and just shooting him in

chat [ __ ] i think that's good you can't just you can't just kill them with sheer damage as well there you go how's that not in the horn i recommend doing what the game tells you to do yeah i'm ignoring the ball demon we need to blow this bridge this is hr across the glory guys across the lorry bridge there's multiple roofs oh my god behind you well no pressure though send the three there's loot here guys yeah pick everything up we can are they just gonna board the ferry though with us maybe what's what's up yeah it's not like it's at sea yeah okay so it's gonna be the boss isn't it just licking it through the ferry i thought you were just going to run up the stairs oh no no no no no oh my frame rate is awful right now i'm going to get freeman i won't let him die please come back i'm trying to kingdom in a really bad way no i'm down i'll be done yeah i'm stuck oh my god i could use my assault right now he's done finding me i don't want to be abandoned i don't want to know i don't want to die here oh nice you're gonna abandon me after everything i did this is this guy's got a minigun why isn't he using it i need that there's a minigun there though freeman there you go i would like to see the minigun fire before even fire it i don't know oh it's like a sentry gun reloading you can use it you can use it adam yeah there you go engage engage engage oh my god why don't you shoot the big lad next to you adam the tall [Applause] running them i think we've got one continuing uh you're floating in the air yeah you're fine you're having a great time that's working that's working as intended i think this is going to be endless yeah you need okay uh yeah yeah that was that last continue look that was it this is our last chance maybe the checkpoint is there though that would be good no there's no way that we'll have to get to that bit won't we just be running across the bridge there wasn't that bad was it you just gotta so we might as well just run all the way through well i want to get up in that tech room if i can because i had loads of [ __ ] and we just minced about it there too long and actually got trapped and we get a new card as well plus 10 team health i'll get the tool kit again bandages up there with money as well worth knowing the copper you can refill your health to permanent health oh permanent health yes you can repost down in the health at the with all right so let's just get everything we can come here it's my bro let me get this cyber again you know open this tech door oh it's not a tech door this time uh sorry it's gonna be another one though right big bad another one another one on a boomerang no try and take as little damage as possible in this bit i need the help all right let's i wanna fight it's gonna be a tech room i just think we got unlucky this time oh there's another shotgun an 870 express here where's that can i tell you that yeah yeah yeah it's different to mine but maybe a pump on it there well mine's pump as well but it's just might be a longer longer barrel one nice shotgun is there anything else to get oh [Music] if you've got the other perk which lets you have a main gun it's a secondary he doesn't let you work i don't actually agree uh wait so what you should say is pandens yes just get right to the top get right to the top straight away at least this morning now isn't it guess what's yeah watch the same kills [Applause] hello they're rocking up in humvees let's set this bomb come on come on come on keep reloading where should i set this up on the top somewhere you have to come here um we can't get the explosives all right that's a good place for that though because you can just kill them all on the top where do you have to under bomb oh my god guys oh god oh no the long range file is it clear this area oh my god okay i'm gonna get back to that minigun i'm over there where do you have to plant it guys i can't see where you have to plant it nice oh boy sometimes i'm hitting him it's over here it's doing nothing okay i can't really shoot them down you guys got that i'll stay here with some oh my god there's so many enemies we should go with them jack go with them i'll just keep this area clear so you've got a clear route back there [ __ ] me man there's like 200 [ __ ] zombies in there i'm gonna come with you guys oh no oh i shouldn't have got off it running now yeah the best place i think for that would actually be facing the bridges there is a d frame here that we could um why don't these ai do anything they could be shooting yeah i'm pretty sure they're supposed to be i'm stuck that [ __ ] spitter i don't know i don't know about something i'm down i'm down i can use my ak on the ground just quickly i've got a defrib though so we might be able to oh you're kidding the spear got me fine i mean what could he do nice reloading i'm rude so difficult [Music] yeah i think some of the actual animations of when you get grabbed or like janking forward of enemies dining out but other than that is classic left for dead fun yeah you need all four and you need to just go together yeah i guess yeah you put it and i guess you shoot through the windows on the lower deck on the mini with the mini gun perhaps that's what absolutely it's designed it's interesting they appear to pour in from the bridge so or well yeah i suppose if you could run forward and put it on that bridge that would do it i rate that three out of three that's good he's not ready well i presume we're gonna try it again no i'm gonna i'm gonna end it i think that must have been right at the end right yeah yeah that's the last bit yeah we've not not finished it just uh just on an immediate yeah medium difficulty oh yeah we can't sadly yeah we're playing on you've got oh stream what do you think it's very left for dead obviously it's made by the guys that made left for dead uh it's alpha at the moment so there's definitely a few bugs going down for sure um but it feels like a new left for dead game uh a bit of quite challenging as well i don't know what like i feel like we were doing it on survivor difficulty there which is the middle one we had higher friendly fire 35 percent for only fire two continues it was good fun yeah i think it's out june next year next year as well so they've got a lot more developer time with it i just hope that when it does come out there's a load of different maps and scenarios you know to check out but uh it's in alpha at the moment um i don't know how you get a key like i was sent a key so i think you can sign up on their website if you want to try it out for yourself that's the only mission that's available so what we just played there that last bit is right at the end i imagine that once you go and plant those bombs the boat blows up and the bridge disappears and then you're on to the next one has potential looks excellent it's a bloody hell very nostalgic can't wait to play with my mates yeah it's the kind of game that you just have a laugh with your mates in it hope there's a versus logan there is the versus mode can't play at the moment though it's very nostalgic for me because i played a lot of left dead when it came out and left for d2 and the versus mode was great i don't know what the progression system's like there's nothing in the game with that at the moment i imagine it's tied to the cards that we were looking at these decks here you can create all sorts of decks and then every new round you pick you know shuffles and you pick whatever you've got it's an interesting system and the ai also plays cards that challenge you that's cool yeah i enjoyed it lots of frame rate problems though it dipped a lot of times but uh yeah there it is guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed it if you did hit that like button great way to support me thank you if you didn't like it dislike it not a problem at all with that said subscribe if you want to see more and i'll see you in the next one bye
