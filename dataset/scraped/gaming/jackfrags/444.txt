this gun has no recall i'm convinced of it watch this it's going in a straight line isn't it all i'm doing is very slowly moving my mouse down to just counteract it and this is the finn lmg it's an absolute laser beam so the gameplay that i'm going to show you today is using this gun and there's a streamer that i watch occasionally called pawneehof and he recommended this i was watching his stream earlier today and he did a build with it i'll throw that up on the screen now i thought okay finn lng well when it came out i think i used it like once or twice i bought the stupid texas chainsaw skin for it and it was just always a bit of a meme because there were just way better options at the time but now the meta of the game has completely shifted and this as you're going to see is a reasonable option in the current meta do you couple this with an smg of some kind mp5 mach 10 i was using mac 10 in the video look at that if someone's head peeking you ruined it's a laser beam and with this build you get 75 bullets as well before you have to reload so you can just keep putting down consistent fire it's amazing honestly it's great give it a go i'm playing here today with broken machine and westy i've left most of this match unedited because it was just a brilliant game look at that it's crazy there's just nothing just keep holding mouse one but it's a fabulous match and we were up against it a couple times some really good squads in the lobby that we were in and i wanted to show you guys what it was like as always though thank you to all these guys using my creator code in the cod store i appreciate it if you do use it tweet me a pic and i'll put it in a video like this one with that said check out the thin lmg if you use it let me know down in the comments below also leave a like if you enjoyed the video subscribe for more let's do some beaming down the route yeah one's on the roof [Applause] no hit still on the roof yep i think he's going up you can't see him yeah he's definitely dropped down 100 nice any more no i don't think so it wasn't a team like though oh wasn't the teamwork which is interesting anyways i don't see any more on the roof double dudes the image let's go here crack one down it's the driver splinter there found him nice that'll probably be the third lap he's right there there we go and the mac 10 is still definitely the best sng there's no doubt in my mind oh yeah it's insane it's insane you have to use it at close range you just have to like there's nothing else that will compete against it in my opinion i was having some success with the um mp7 yesterday because it's 950 rounds a minute so it's pretty fast yeah but um that's just you can't beat the mac 10. it's insane not a helo there two heroes here [Music] [Applause] um bouncy uav something yeah yeah we got some fights behind us at the spy they might hear us we want them to come over we want the kills give us the kills bounty contract identified

here are we clear yeah we're good we're good relocating can i get myself yeah he's inside green he's hacking bruh oh [Applause] yeah we can get you back we just need to make sure this area is clear

you out yeah i got an armor box as well oh my goodness me this is insane that's a great game so far oh sniper on the hill sniper on the hill on orange moving looking at us yeah he's looking at us got so wrecked he was a little bit murdered there just wondering if we could pick up a bounty maybe never mind someone showing up on minimap here on orange position let's get him i need his gun did you want the bounty or the target uh orange just do our he was on orange there were shots well just right here yeah he was on the orange bar watch out because he could just be ratting in some plane i'll stick with you broken sure he's probably in that little box repositioning you know where people like to camp someone died here i think he died here i think someone else just killed him there's a little fight going down here a couple of dead players okay right well boneyard's our play then isn't it any guns over here no um the two guys that i was that i picked up ain't nothing on heartbeat no nothing at all 44 meters dead in front of us dead in front not playing here he was dead in front 44 meters at the plane by the hangar you know the one i mean i got a guy oh i just got that guy still over at the hangar okay that's good for you broken be careful yeah he's thinking me it's all right it's all right broke down sticking him see if i can push right sniper there penning as much as i could on that red mark on the right hand side i'm getting a big flank on broke he's broke should be healing right now relocating come on repositioning i don't think so found a guy on the wall guys on the car uh we got to cross an open area do you want to do it now hang on hang on we can hold it we can hold players out here behind us broke die on this wall now [Applause] oh my god we've got aroma welcome i'm crossing well we can try to reload this takes ages we got it's 3v3 3v3 oh easy yeah but we're down the hill yeah i don't know where they are oh hi threat i just got looked at from south south sniper on green copy your mark that's right nice it's these two down here it's just these two cracks pushing that was a really hot match that's warzone at its finest right there absolutely dude absolutely no cheaters lots of action lots of respawns loving it lots of dog lots of progress that was a really high kill game as well what did we get there we go 17 15 12. nice that's really good so there we have it that was the thin lng and i really enjoyed that match it was good warzone has been a bit tricky to play the last week or so there's just so many cheaters at the moment it's almost every game honestly blatant aim bottas and i really really hope that the devs get on top of it again because it seems like it's getting out of control right now i feel like i say this every three or four months but it's at that stage again and i really want them to show a bit more care and tension with the game but if you do try out that thin lmg build let me know your thoughts down below the one that i showed at the start of the video i think that is a better option in the video today i was using the attack laser instead of the stock just for the quicker ads speed but i reckon the stock's the better option because of how low the recall is it's essentially not very fun to use also if you're still watching thank you i know you're the most dedicated people that stay till the end i thought i'd give you a heads up about this i've opened up a second youtube channel called jack frags clips and all it's going to be is really short clips and snippets of new stuff old stuff and i'll be posting

seeing some of those clips like i said there will be some exclusive stuff on there i've linked it down in the description below youtube.com jackfragsclips and click on any of the videos watch them like them dislike them comment subscribe just interact with them in some way and that will really help me out because it's just a great way to start getting some growth on the channel so head over there subscribe there's going to be all sorts on there thanks again for watching guys love you lots i'll see you next time you
