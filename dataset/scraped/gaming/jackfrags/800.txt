okay so let's just check what each other looks like yeah we look identical now what what have you got there I don't know honestly there's a pistol bang bang bang yeah this is SMG I'm up over my bat by our bank I've got a bandage I brought this I've got a Saiga 12 this we don't have to hit people with that several times right okay am i loaded how do I check my guns loaded I think it is as long as you loaded it before we went in okay I'm gonna no don't these huts nobody just Jamaica zine you pick if I go please come out it's full Adam I should be able to pick that up shouldn't I hey crowd so that you could take it oh thank God for that right so you put it but in your like in your in your vest okay right now what do we do how do we escape from tarkov well we're going we're not escaping we're infiltrating this idea shopping the main idea yeah and we gonna Rob some stuff for them then we're gonna escape so everyone is that enemy yeah um yeah because we're not a scab so the scabs aren't gonna be friendly with us other players are definitely not gonna be friendly with this okay so basically if we see anybody who isn't us open fire so is there any kind of like skill based matchmaking in this like will it put us against people who are also terrible at the game I was hoping that they would add something like that because it appears that basically anybody with who's basically a terminator I could just turn up at your game and rep you and I don't I'm not fan of that your character movement is very laggy is that do I look like that for you as well yes oh just say hi to you I'll cooperate maybe you see the mister maybe you miss you right and we cooperating I think we just if anybody found the corn the hair that's doing that Oh remember that we're just come down to the right there's no compass on telly I think he's dead is that human or was probably a scalp I think if it was a human he wouldn't stood in the middle of the open so there's a kill yeah so what do we did we just search him he's got a Mosin somebody records that was a player I'm not sure oh yeah it was it yeah she was just got a dog tag all right Masami it means you got rekt Jack how do I check how many bullets are in my mag is it hold oh no that's reloaded to do that is it hold Alton ah nope there is a bun I know there's a button Alton T of course auntie got it fault yeah so there's no map in the game right well we haven't thought we haven't got a map for this also the map wouldn't show you where you are on the map it's merely just a piece of paper but is it like a website you can use we yeah yeah like Daisy but shows you where all the loot spawns are as well so can you get good loot off the AI um a little bit good loot but you can get loot like you could get like backpacks and go so it's the primary goal to find containers and hope you get something good well so you've got a heart our hideout and you I found some tape on a guy we killed and I know I need that for crafting something to upgrade part of my hideout and so we go up that ramp it's there didn't actually get into the shops to go to I care there's a new wardrobe don't want it to look at sometimes where people extract really just fire off like a whole mag what's the point of that and that they're leveling up their recoil control that's not I'm not a joke you though yes you are does this do anything makes knowledge that this can you open the door slowly like counting card no I don't think so that you just touched you did I yeah yeah instantly I'm good it's a human I don't know some bracelets of green traces came out of the darkness and that was that possibly you got alerted by your door kick well yeah I might be the case so you're just gone now are you yeah that's the go well I'm just gonna run towards them and see what happens you know good Zack that's two of them I think Adam is popping off you can't spectate me no basically all is ruined so how do I find a way out then I don't how would I find an exit so basically you got a guy outside you'll find the train track and then run to the end of the train track so I shouldn't try and kill this man well I mean that you asked me for the way out but if you want to kill that man you might have really good guns and stuff that you could steal right okay I think he's still firing at me from somewhere he's killed me right so do I get a breakdown about now like what happened kind of it just tells you that he killed you and it shows you where you were shot Chazz you in killed me your kill list it just says question mark though I kill I killed someone maybe it's because I rub the tags alright right so now we do a scout thing yeah and the Scout thing is just it gives you a random loadout yeah was he a human how do I tell if he's a human I don't know guys is this a human I'm gonna search this man I just killed someone at him he's got a load of propane tanks this guy ain't killed no about that holes a broken LC some screens is quite useful yeah so it sounds like there's a shutter with the lorry outside it yeah that's me Adam stop stop stop something moving okay if you could see me I can't see you are you outside yeah okay I'm gonna run up to someone who I think is you not well okay I'll be the Crouch to the corner so if it's not there not cross the corner it's not me no they just stood out in the open and you shot him in the face did you hear a gunshot I heard that gunshot you're definitely in my game okay we're definitely in the same yeah because you heard that gunshot when I killed that guy yeah I see a scout he just shot at me did you hear that no I killed him he might down and I'm heading towards the van that had open military crate in the back of it oh yeah I see you on him stop yeah yeah yeah it amazed me outside yeah we're good for good okay there was an enemy down that way he was on the lower level and he shot up and he whittled my arms I was still firing you run a beautiful hot air atom like that a lot yeah looks good doesn't protect from bullets though I can imagine so what do you want to do well we've got 30 minutes so I think we need to find some good loot they go out I peeped it some salawah and a couple of bandages and sulla will help you yeah yeah that will so how do I give you that you could just drop on the floor but you could put it in that crate maybe there you go you got it Ricky I discarded it and magazine just flew out of your head no no it was a silencer doesn't make it any less weird that's really close isn't it go on I'll cover you use that stuff you pick up the stones oh no that's gone forever Adam this is war Oh dad so he's instantly killed me did he come from outside it was behind us where we came from he dead yeah so yeah so now we have to wait another 20 minutes if you want to do ass covering could you drop that mag please yeah thank you Shh this time it'll be different it's like ESL this IKEA it's got a go-cart track out the front yeah why don't they do that in real life absolutely done and I think they come in I'll watch the top of the stairs I mean that's that's it explosives starts at around there on yeah my rig is has helped me stay alive that they've not come and challenge us though now because they're players and they just sat there camping they've probably been how long into the round away push two minutes well if you're sewing just started you think you got one I killed one on the left but there was another two on the right somewhere see them let's get into that bit on the left if we go how that Bob Oh and dead ahead I'm dead what goes have you got that oh no it looks like a nice eh k with this suppressor on it well right but there's no helmet I've got to help me either I'd like to try and stay alive for a bit longer this round I'd love it I probably trying to die Jack ice headed this way that's right okay Jonah play is the traditional soccer player yeah give me the legit talk of experience okay that's it right now what well that's that's taco this without now we wait for somebody to walk you for the Red Cross there and shoot them okay ready and now's your cue it's your cue Murray won't pass the door very I think Barry's gone I'm going up to you you think there's someone here well maybe I know that he's out here to the right I can hear him reloading and stuff well should we both peek at the same time or mmm I predict we go go out and we're both gonna die instantly I've got an idea I hope that I say what you did I'm gonna push down the side yeah maybe you come behind us though couldn't he yeah but you can hold that way I can just distract him a bit he's actually prowling on the floor look at him how are you not dick dude I've hit him like six times he's right on me with a Molson I'm out of ammo I don't know is it mainly you gotta get he's dead geez that's cool Riggs good because it's got armor built into it although it's got 7.5 armor left in it on this Ivan robberies Mawson on the armor the ammo for it check his pockets you want his backpack I don't know what's good what's bad so we can take this stuff that we've got here and put it on our main character if we wanted to is that right is that the point of doing scam runs yeah yeah yeah see when you extract you can put all this stuff into your main rig is this it oh yeah extracting six five this is an attraction yeah apparently is that my first ever extraction from tarkov duh so another man killed about 10 escapes we don't killed him stole all his loot and stole all the loot off the sketch absolutely that he killed and then we ran away it's a great success I think yeah I just saw a guy run up this ramp on him oh really yeah like he's at the top of the ramp might be a scar but it uh they were sprinting though so well they what they should if we haven't shot these calves they shouldn't shoot us okay there are certain maps where there are different a is that an scabs that also shoots caps but not this one that has a very good girl apparently well I'll be damned if I know that yeah he run up here he's killed a scab there on the right probably gone inside yeah two hobbits lay here with it being a carbine I assume it's some medium long-range rifle he's our human yeah it's quite human movement shot him in the head he said as the pouch at the bottom is a player so that was a player oh I always see okay yeah that was a player but he was playing a scout I mean that gun domed him no don't forget a helmet no did he know no why should we throw and find the shops area lovely food dish it looks disgusting whenever it is ah just like grandma's babushka less Oh enemy bed it's the right right Adam they were moving very slowly in the middle there from right to left buy us another push over to this store nice to him are we doing on we're just gonna kill this dude yeah I think so look the play or scale don't see where they've gone out oh that oh the Bay Area assume yeah him he's down I saw the blood splat then three shots that took there's a dead guy here the guy's got a helmet so that's gonna be a player isn't it because they look quite different than the Scout right well this guy doesn't have a pouch though so apparently all right that is discovered then searching this guy he's got an aks-74u FAL lower level well I don't see him down lower level in the middle on the right here Adam down here don't think you hit me yeah I'm good I'm healthy headshot you get him yeah once dad I only saw one Oh another one where dad nice Oh dead was that why were they coughing is it more down there well yeah moving about I've gotta reload I'm not actually bleeding everything somehow he shot me in the arm and I'm not bleeding hmm so it's worth looting all them at some point oh I'm dead you kidding me what angle no idea I didn't even hear silence well I think I can see him and see if I can get him get revenge I think there might be two did you just go downstairs oh damn it I'm screwed this game is tough man this game is really tough [Music]
