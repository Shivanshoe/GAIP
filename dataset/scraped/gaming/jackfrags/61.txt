before we get into the live gameplay commentary i just want to say that i can't believe this actually worked it just it doesn't make any sense but it turned out great so the finn lng it released in what like halloween 2020 i remember it was part of the event they had going on with the texas chainsaw guy i used it a couple times it was a bit of a meme not great not terrible it was okay but recently there's been a bit more talk about it and tommo mentioned it to me saying that it's kind of good now and then i saw a video this morning from a content creator that i watched called pawnee half and he suggested a build for it on rebirth island and for whatever reason if you go with this build the hip fire spread is really tight the recoil's great and it's actually better hip fire than when you press the aim down the side button doesn't make sense but that's how it is this is the build that i went for shout out to pornhoff again for that and i played one solo match today at warzone and it really surprised me how good it was this was an absolute laugh i've never used a gun like this before in a solo match so it's a bit different and i think you guys will like it also i have to say thank you so much for the support on the last solo rebirth video tons of great feedback on that one you're all absolute legends and just a reminder i do have a cod partner code if you use jack frags and caps in the cod store for the upcoming season starting in a couple days all that godzilla and king kong stuff if you buy anything like the season pass or skins use my creator code and i'll get a bit of kickback from that thank you also if you do use it tweet me a picture and i'll put you in a future video so let's get into the game now if you enjoy leave a like this will surprise you i promise okay i'm just gonna focus on getting my loadout really [Applause] there was a guy on the roof here [Applause] nice little satchel there gpsh it's really difficult to tell tell where they are hold on i'm going to use throwing knives now to finish people off that way people whoa panda that way that way people all know that i'm pro that's a joke by the way i'm not pro here's someone else it's an enemy snoop dogg i'm still playing the snoop dogg get back to it it's still funny never won't be get my load out here pop it right there i don't think that's gonna bounce off the roof is it that's fine here we go chainsaw so i've got no idea how this is going to be in practice and what kind of range i can use that i just watched pawnee's video this morning and i've not used it yet so it could it could go terrible let me get shot inside the head there am i smoke grenade i don't quite have enough to use that uav do i in the building you're gonna push yes [Applause] oh man i'm not done with you all right right sounds gave you away mate rose skin you only get 75 rounds with this build but i think that's enough for solos you know and i've got an own gun a secondary in case i need to use it but i'm not intending to i just want to try this out and see if it's good i mean look how tight that crosstail is that's hip fire as well behind don't really want to be outside here but i haven't been here yet so i don't know okay get some of this yes a pizza oh how am i alive i know i still have the throwing knife oh i'm such a dummy get back to it respect me i'll give him the old coin toss gas mask yeah i presume that i still had the throw knives but [Applause] i did not it's weird like it's really low down on the screen [Applause] someone over here uh should i have won that fight get back to it i mean i did nearly die but you know i was hip fire and that was a decent distance away there i'll try and get a second load out if i can i think i've got one with high alert that one [Applause] they've not gone back for this stuff no no down there okay now i'm feeling it three kills already with the fin that is down here usually they camp up in the towers going around enemy uav active cheeky little jump up spot you can do there you guys probably knew about that one but i always like to show yes it's right on your tail pretty sure i just had a footstep down behind me as well on the wood i knew there was someone sneaking around i mean it absolutely toasted him [Applause] ain't gonna be an old sarah's there i test the distance here okay that's yeah that's way too far sounds like i'm under water or something a few plates there [Applause] that sounds like it's on the roof head bodies cook up the daddy [Applause] no he's in there unlucky girl's face enemy soldier nearby oh he didn't stand a chance gas is inbound marking new safe size this done definitely helped then but ghost face got the running around there buy station costs are adjusted i don't even know what the ttk value is on this i should look it up it feels like it's sub 400 but maybe that'll be a bit too fast this pony was talking about the damage as well like it's pretty uniform across the board because you've got those frangible rounds you start shooting people they just get slowed down upstairs watch your sex resurgence will be gone you're being tracked by an enemy too is that fair can you call someone a freak for crouching just want to check down here in case this might be the death of me though guess it's right on your tail no we're okay yeah i just wanted to clear that in case uh someone comes up there when the circle eventually enemy soldier nearby get smaller and i've got to rotate upstairs again [Applause] there's someone in there [Applause] i mean that's pretty insane isn't it break that quick from that distance in hip fire it's right inside oh mate you just got absolutely toasted yes you've made it to the top ruined by the chainsaw i've got the armor box there now as well in case i need it i've got to move that's clear time to cover your tracks there's an enemy team hunting for you double threat on me again another one tries to jump through a window and kill me i can't believe how effective this is might as well pick that up see how low down it is look i can't see anything on you're that ground moving i don't know where i should go here no one nearby ow where was that from one of the roofs actually there's no one on my right here there's a load out there where were you in that window there okay i'm gonna go out the gas i think and go left that's quite a good shot not much of an angle there for them i'm going to be in here yeah just chill let's see in front of me can actually see where they are when i get the own gun out gas is inbound back to me okay i just play defensive i feel like i should you know screw that i'm just gonna get positioned i cluster the stairs here mark target for air is [Applause] i don't think they're going to be up here they're probably give a bit crash there not that i need it this is a really good position are they coughing there it is wow i can't believe that i actually don't believe that that's way too good that's way way way better than it has any right to be and it's weird that you get better spread and recall when you don't aim one of the attachments maybe i'm not sure let me know in the comments and snoop dogg with another victory on the war zone that's a video it's dumb but it works we'll take it right thank you for watching leave a like if you enjoyed it i'll see you next time bye
