abs doesn't protect from that i'm afraid no no no no no no no oh god nearly killed us all surely you can run over it lucky without exploding no no no you can't explode yeah touch it with a helicopter even tickle it with a helicopter don't do it besides you're both dead all right [Music] no no not by the load at least no no no what's the problem it's still hit oh he's driving no that's a load of breaks that's fine look no it isn't it isn't fine i can go backwards as well max speed no problem where is someone shooting no stop no nobody nobody i feel like someone shot that nobody located this guy yeah still shooting the track i'm still shooting it the loadout that's not supposed to happen anymore i'm going to be honest with you this is the easiest gun to use in warsaw if you take the xm4 build it like this got no recall it's got high damage and if you're on your game you can absolutely ruin people and in this match i'm going to demonstrate what you can do with it you guys are going to enjoy this one if you do leave a like season 2 tomorrow i'm going to be live use code jack frags in the cod store subscribe for more let's get it he's doing it as a tax write-off how to destroy a historical landmark they did it once before in 2017. they have to dismantle and put it back together right right okay so it's more it's not for you yeah that's my seventh golden yacht yeah yeah being the ceo dice is hard if you download the gold nft edition you get this in like two years time do you think ubisoft will still be like going with the nft thing no bloody no the pr is too bad on fts right now yeah until until basically until someone comes out with some evidence to show actually guys nfts are fine yeah you know it's not gonna be what if cod did it if cod did it and they gave me money jack then maybe warzone nfts as long as i'm benefiting from it somehow then i'm okay with it activision's made what like five point something bajillion dollars this year off of micro transactions i don't think they're really you to sell it then and that's something they take money from themselves it sounds really stupid but like actually it gives incentive divide doesn't it from activision's point of view i don't think they'll do nfts because they don't need to they mean like no someone just needs to make nfts that are um ecological that's it issues that come with nfts are the main problem right now because it's like you know you basically get outed as soon as you support them you see what happened to troy baker yeah yeah well that's what i'm saying so until as i'm saying i think i think some nfcs are going to come out that are actually proven to be head you know what these ones don't affect the environment it's going to go way there you go yeah because if they can do that like let's face it if you had in-game items for a game that you didn't play anymore that you could sell back or sell on someone else make a bit of money and then you could use that to buy your next game or your next item or whatever the concept isn't bad but like the fact that it's linked to the ethereum blockchain yeah it's just always permanently ruined well hang on a minute and that's awful for the environment what about the ethereum what is it the the new one they're going to do the ethereum too go ahead oh god i have no idea what just happened he's done he's dead he's one
