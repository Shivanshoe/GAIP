it just occurred to me that although bf 2042 has been out for about a month and a half now i've not actually done a solo gameplay commentary i mean i've done a few live streams i've done some highlights montages that kind of thing but i've never just done you know a classic 15-20 minute video what is happening here playing the game and i'm gonna rectify that today by doing that and we're starting things off with breakaway just joined us over here i spawned in the latv recon can i make that gap i can i wasn't sure about that one oh okay there's another one oh multi-boy no oh my god oh that's not a great start but you know what it's a start we'll take it so today i'm using the mp9 oh my god and i've got the suppressor on it that actually works the type 4 big big big drum magazine lwg grip i'm just going for a red dot there on the front do you want to get in this okay so look at that guy in the chat what the i'm hoping that we can just get some nice flanks make some nice sundance plays here and have a good time i've not even used my wingsuit once yet i'm embarrassing and we're on breakaway this is my favorite map in the game i think is there anybody stationary that i could take out i have noticed though a lot more people are using soft lands now will that lock on where are you going are you kidding did that helicopter why did they never go to the target that i want them to go to i wish that you could like say in the options menu prioritize things close to me or prioritize air vehicles or land vehicles or something so try and get this recon down here well not exactly what i was intending to go for there i was hoping to fire a shot whilst i was mid-air but if it comes back we'll see if we can get it one enemy on this point right here there's another one was it an angel we just done it a circle yes oh my god we did do a circle around one another there okay we're clear we got the point i always find it so weird how they just speak russian like that because that's angel angel doesn't sound like that someone just fired a shot at me didn't they well that's a bit messy two people on the point i can hear them there's one leg shooter love that two people again one more where hiding here somewhere hello irish came back we got him i'll jump in sure why not capture the point so they've got full control here that doesn't surprise me usually this happens the russians take this area and the oil rig c is typically the one that people fight over the most although look at this a lot of people fighting on d here i think there's a vehicle let's say if there's a vehicle here i'm going to be so mad at those grenades i'll tell you what this mp9 is disgusting in a good way you know the res can hear someone look at it it's so gross i love it yeah i hope you guys are enjoying this i like this point it's really good for infantry i see someone on the radar here they're coming over i've been scammed maybe i should move back you're gonna die falco you got there careful that's a friendly one isn't it i feel like i should peak it was worth it there's more though isn't that where you going okay we pushed him off there should i go towards a someone was looking at me there with the sniper still looking at me with a sniper ow what if i get in this truck and just tune it towards them see what happens could be a laugh a war zone special that is or if you want to go further back maybe like h1z1 these are i'm sure there's something to lock onto yeah it's a big boy again oh on the roof that guy had me dead to rights there if they just carried on shooting a little bit she move in got a medic there dead the hell is that now those big things explode don't they push down to 80 and you do have the range if you want it to change ammo types someone's got a stinger there can i look at that it's a nice and easy way to get around there did i survive that i should be dead too far in the mix there definitely my game crashed and i've joined another breakaway server although i'm on the now so we're just going to play it out and see how it goes still got the mp9 hello buddy what are these guys doing here i'm sure there's one more there isn't that i thread the needle there oh look i was about to say look at that needle threading and then mckay just came out of nowhere flanked me and killed me medic yes legend run up change my ammo type let's do it now uh that one hello boris boris where's that mckay gone come back ah i thought i was going to lose that fight there stay away from me oh what are you what's this it's normal you're sniping my team up there i'm trying to snipe the hovercraft you can get a maria come on maria maria no you had a long and fruitful life to live cut down in your prime i was rooting for it to be honest really was yeah i really need to figure out what's crashing my game i'm happy a lot lately i'm gonna try a different graphics card and just see if that makes a difference or it actually crashed just then what is wrong with me why oh my god i hate that so much ah guys i'm sorry i need help honestly i really need help with this i keep crashing on multiple games insurgency battlefield warzone and it's usually like a directx dxgi error sometimes it says you remove the graphics card from your computer obviously i haven't i've tried ddu where you remove all the drivers install them again tried that i've got any overclocks on my gpu cpu or memory at the moment i just reset it all to default i've tried various things in windows i'm just at a loss to be honest like i don't know how i could fix it i mean i could try a format just reinstall windows 11 see if that works if that doesn't work then i guess i could try a different graphics card maybe drag me up the wall i don't know man if you've got any tips or hints or ideas let me know in the comments below please i'm sorry to cut this video short but there was some good gameplay there i didn't just want to waste it i thought maybe you guys could help me as well so with that said thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this bit of 2042 solo gameplay there if you did like it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and
