doesn't need any heals oh there's a guy right there please i wanted i wanted the res i'm sorry guys welcome back to some bf4 live gameplay commentary i don't know why but you guys really like watching me play this i mean i know it's a great game but for whatever reason every bf4 video that i post always gets mad views on it mad engagement comments all that good stuff so you know what ow i'm gonna do some more i suppose i should say thank you don't you need to keep your head down mate all the kills back but they've changed ow ow ow that's not that's not cool hit me with the olga e3 is it algo org what would you say i don't know what the correct pronunciation of it is that's a i'm not spoiling there that's just champagne doesn't it look at all these enemies looking and i'm not ah nice i get on this quad bike oh it doesn't have third person on it interesting so this server's actually got a few custom rules on does it say anything in the chat your reputation is zero with a clean impression record okay i've not been a naughty boy then i guess oh my god it's so difficult to drive in first person in this game what is my field of view oh hang on wasn't that there's a guy right there yes and another one here and another one let's go yeah i'm just gonna go full try hard in this video let's see how many frags i can get i've got the m416 lovely love that okay there's gonna be a lot of enemies on this point isn't there is that the am94 oh my god the guns in this game just iconic aren't they lovely bit of top fire there that fire is so good on this well i suppose we should go back and try and get c and d here you can be gone kind of like the liz rockets in 2042 but you can't shoot them down which makes them really painful what about this flag is anybody here no i think because i've started capturing it they might come here now it's a decent server as well look i mean the rounds only just started we are losing but i think i could stick this one out you know well we captured this but you need heels what are you what are you what are you what are you jamboozled why are you fight why are you just firing i don't feel like this is a good idea to jump on this guy's quad bike but you know it's a battlefield game it's all about sandbox who knows what's gonna happen we're going to see are we okay please don't just they've just abandoned it sniper there see that gotta get rid of this spawn beacon lads come on you can't just let that stay there go all the way on the outside you calf what what happened then oh that explosion is a lot bigger than i remember it being wait wait wait wait sorry i don't even know what that was i'm so sorry i reckon it's just several people here a couple here nice little top fire again we do have a spawn beacon here which i love i kind of wish i had a bigger scope for this to be headed honest tamper good bad artist interesting name very good okay there is one more there and the gun play said it before but it's just got so much character in this game doesn't it that's what it is every gun just feels something unique it feels something different like the m416 obviously you know it's built for close range isn't it can i push this i don't know i'm going to try but at the same time you know i'm trying to tap firing here and dropping people at longer ranges it's effective anyone hiding in here revolution that was actually classed as revolution in the trailer i remember that we good guys can we turn down the sun some nice god rays there there look at that i'm gonna run out of ammo here i've got nine shots yes i'll die i'll try and steal a kit let's go in there how am i gonna make it get this what we got as well ak i don't know i saw someone run here cool you might want to watch out i've got your buddy luckily it's a medic kit oh it's just good infantry game isn't it it's just good infantry and you know what this ak-12 pretty good as well feeling it and we're losing this why are we losing this i can hear someone here anyone else on the roof and you just you know what you just think straight back into it don't you everything that you used to learn and practice when you played this game it all just comes back to you well it does to me anyway it just feels intuitive to pick up and play lovely ak watch out buddy i'm gonna go around this way i just realized i've got five shots [Applause] can i get some ammo yes oh my god can you believe it they actually dropped ammo get that suppression in and it wasn't on target straight away there but those first couple shots maybe suppress that guy they're just pouring in here you go middle where you going are you going left i'm gonna get myself an ak-12 okay guy there keep my head down a sec grenade little fire on our hands here will i go take the low ground maybe see if i can catch him out i like round on the left here little head glitch good and there was one over here on the radar no no no no no no no i don't want to die in the end let me in we're good two guys were there and there's one back here on the mini-map and they're pushing in well that took too many shots didn't it hang on okay we've lost the middle of the map i'm just so focused over here trying to fight this point that i've got about the middle are you support player i think you were right so i'm gonna get this do you have ammo i do and i want that back oh that was a great run though how many kills did we pick up then we got a few 18 killstreak it says there right okay well we're back on the m416 we've lost b i've not really fought over b yet have i not this round anyway i picked up the magnum as my secondary all faithful oh i just about saw you a magic cucumber great name who's unfortunately you can't hoist yourself up in this game i'd love to be able to do that though i think there's a lot of enemies here put some pressure on from this side see how we fare is that one there oh i saw someone we got the point though which is good i think there's a couple stragglers though yeah there's one see that's the muscle memory kicking in there i just knew that that amount of bullets at that distance would kill that player see if we can hold it for a second this reminds me so much i've escaped from tarkov i don't play much talk off but this particular area with these buildings it looks like is it dorms i think it's called dorms right guys if you enjoyed the video do consider leaving a like below thank you that's a great way to help support me a lot of love for the bf4 content still and if you guys keep supporting it i'll keep making it hopefully these gameplays are entertaining and insightful for you and they've all come up there's one there's one more guy there they just made it through didn't they right here yeah love having this suppressor you know keeps me off the minimal let's go let's get behind him no that's not i don't want that pickup let me mess that up i know there's a guy there but i want to ignore ow ow please geez okay we'll stay on this point and cap it where was that guy i'm presuming my teammates have got the angle um there's a guy here and they're in the corner very nice got the point my res two lores is here i know you can charge him up but i just want to get him back in the fight that not the predator lasers that was weird i feel like if i stick with this grenade launcher i'm just going to die so do a bit of damage to that guy grenades coming in they're gonna push this i think look at the roof and they're all over that oh that was close that was so close it's so much fun fighting over this though it's a great map oh this shadow actually gave them away then did you see that i saw the shadow before i saw the model i think hopefully i'm not just seeing things but i think that's what happened there they're still all over these factory points they've done such a good job of holding us back almost double our ticket so i don't see us coming back although you know bf4 it is possible to do comebacks because of how the conquest tickets work that might not see me obviously not hello bro that was my kill i'm behind to rock it [Laughter] fair play i want to kill wait wait wait wait wait on the go wait wait don't you dare okay i guess we'll i guess does that work no yeah oh kind of push me i'm flying it's [Laughter] a bit fine isn't it that but whatever okay right let's go let's go let's add a little boost there you know do the old superman i wonder if i can actually get a kill streak with this is it possible to not suck with a grenade launcher because typically it lets me down oh there's a lot of people in front of me here that's lads okay it kind of didn't let me down i think that's the first kill streak i've ever got with this thing okay hello yeah have i killed myself no i thought i killed myself with it i definitely did some damage to myself though i won the pickup sniper rifle the spawn's over there doesn't it this is really dangerous but i'm doing it anyway please die i fall through the vice why did i fall through the floor then dice come on i just want the sniper rifle here it is boom right okay who can we take out let's see yes love that yes i missed an rpg i can't that's that's so lucky the fact that i hit the wall behind me i can't believe that i'm gonna find that guy i want revenge hello hello hello one more back here on the right right there right here oh counts just kill res maybe anyone nearby nah that was a sick little kill streak and we'll go back here we'll try and get revenge eh more enemies around are you friendly please i did see like uh an suav pop up then come on come around come around need some heels you need some hills lads you need heels i'm here for you i'm here for you that's a terrible that's like not even a joke at this point how was that they're all under there you can see their little legs yes come on you're running across a big open gap there mate can't quite see them what if we go all the way around here yes i think the entire army's looking at me though one in there you know maybe like a bigger scope would be better here wouldn't it like an acog or something or a hybrid i'm gonna keep chipping away at this e point from this angle i think we can do it nope oh someone else got me mk 11 love that with an ir scope as well okay okay i see oh the guy climbing the ladder actually survived then are you going where you going i'll see you lovely we're losing d that's really useful to spot them i mean in this whole game like this fight of the e point has been epic oh my god there's so many in there how did i i only got one kill there still in there man i'm just holding down last one there come on get it get it get it yes got the kill finally are they rezzing [Applause] i just dumped like four mags of ammo there i smoked it grenade that corner yeah we did get the point though that was sick that whole fight [Applause] they're countering though look at this they're actually countering pushing back i see you with your head glitch not today mate not today no one pushing left there's a sniper out there oh god i need to get across [Applause] where's the gap we are holding on here lads we are holding on grenade grenade get out of there buddy get some cover look at this hole here as well that we're firing through that's so cool oh no you're just prone there with a pistol okay yes gunplay and team played this game it's just superior really isn't it it's just so good it's actual teamwork you know you need to rely on your teammates [Music] i don't know how there was an angle there this dude's a great squad mate keeps stopping me up with health back on that corner what the hell was that explosion the top fire down more stay down buddy no risk for you what the hell is that why is there a purple light there no i need to investigate that can i get across here without dying is it just the laser from the stationary rocket launcher that's unlucky go go jumbo i don't know what's going on here i think they've just put an aps up right there's one is that it was just one guy there maybe that's what the light was it was just coming from that aps thing but there was a claymore in the crater how did i not see that that i mean that was practically invisible right i swear if i watch that back on the youtube video now it's just going to be so obvious we've almost okay we've almost all capped him here you telling me there could be a chance i mean this would be the most epic comeback ever we'll keep trying we'll keep pushing oh i thought it was a gunner there this is where i need that bigger scope again nice rock here though i can use let's move up while they're suppressed okay lots of cover here look at them all look at them all what the hell i swear to god if we managed to actually come back and win this that would be so damn cool it's not going to be enough is it we couldn't make the comeback no one epic match though wow gg great game cheeky bit of zavod m416 oh it feels good the gun play in this game like i said man it's superior guys thank you for watching if you enjoyed the vid leave a like subscribe if you're new i'll see you next time bye
