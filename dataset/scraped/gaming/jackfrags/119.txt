warzone is about to get a lot harder there's some massive changes just being announced and i think this paves the way for war zone 2 which is supposed to be coming out next year and i feel like these announced updates are really going to shake up the game change the meta this stuff will have a massive impact on the game and unbelievably they're adding a bomber an actual bomber plane to war zone i never thought that i would see the day as well as ai soldiers that will fight you and in transport vehicles in multiple locations but let's get stuck in let's take a look at the first thing here nebula five and this is like a weird yellow substance a gas that they showed in the trailer for season two i think it's linked to zombies in some way it probably is i don't really know my zombie's history that well but it says that nebula five is meant for large-scale armaments but can be used for small arms ammunition and bombs both found in extremely small quantities around caldera and this is found on the ground as a field upgrade like stopping power or dead silence in war zone and whilst it's no stronger than regular bullet so if you put it in it isn't going to be like stopping power where it does double damage or whatever it was but it does have one major exception if you get down by nebula 5 ammo in that one magazine you will start emitting a poisonous gas cloud from your body and then anyone that attempts to revive you or anyone standing nearby you within a few feet will face similar complications to the circle collapse exposure which means that your character will start to cough you'll get blood vision and a slight amount of damage over time and that can apply to your health or it can actually reduce your gas mass duration so if you're in the proximity of nebula gas it will start eating away your gas mask too so that's a way to counter it but it's not for free and then it goes on nebula 5 ammo takes up only a single clip of ammunition but for some weapons that may be enough to turn the tide of a team fight especially within interior spaces so it's going to be really difficult i think if you don't have a gas mask to go and revive a teammate you're going to have to take that into account now in team fights not a big deal in solo matches but anything else huge on top of the nebula 5 ammo we've also got nebula 5 bombs these are one of the rarest items in warzone and it's a locked briefcase full of deadly gas with an explosive charge once activated and set down in front of an operator it will detonate after a fixed countdown and cannot be disarmed or destroyed so you can't counter this before it explodes its initial explosion deals a high amount of damage in a small radius before the gas starts to spread outwards where it will hurt any operator without a gas mask the gas lingers for two minutes before ultimately dispersing or feeding into the oncoming circle collapse operators can potentially outrun this explosive aftermath just as they would the circle collapse but in terms of an area denial tool the nebula 5 bomb is a powerful force if you can find it so i think that will be quite useful if you're in a building or something and you want to create a choke point between you and an enemy squad so you can make an escape or get a bigger tactical advantage so they can't push through that unless they're wearing gas masks and then next there's new field equipment this is the portable decontamination station the pds and it says despite its toxicity nebula 5 can also be temporarily dispersed the pds is a portable device that filtrates air for several seconds protecting anyone inside from the circle collapse or nebula 5 gas you heard me say that correctly you can actually put a pds station up by the sounds of it and not only will it protect you from the new nebula gas but also the circle collapse this seems very similar to the things that they have in apex where you can make a bubble inside the gas and be safe for a few moments to get your health back loot whatever you were going to do that's coming to warzone now so i think this will be a great survival tool and it will also make for some epic clutch plays towards endgame in the gas these devices impact all operator attack maps so that's the minimap allowing everyone to see where they're currently activated and they can be destroyed by explosives or ballistics and next is the armored transport look at that thing looks absolutely mental the axis deployed multiple vehicles to carry nebula 5 and its derivatives around caldera these unstoppable steel behemoths remotely roll on a set looping path attacking those within its immediate vicinity with its two machine gun turrets operators also need to avoid the mines it drops behind it as well as the aerial support that it calls in should it drop to low health upon destruction the armored transport trucks will drop incredibly valuable items including in the rarest cases an intact nebula 5 bomb so this seems like a surefire way to get yourself some nebula 5 bombs or ammo and this is just ai essentially that will go around the level shooting at players there's a similar thing in one of the pub g maps but i've not really played that that much so i can't comment on how it is but it's definitely going to be an interesting distraction in warzone and it'll add another layer to the combat this is not just pvp anymore this is pvp v e now and then we've got the bomber kind of looks like a b17 doesn't it the second aerial vehicle in vanguard mode in warzone the bomber is a formidable air-to-ground striker capable of leveling infantry and vehicles so it's only going to be in the vanguard battle rail modes so if you want to play without planes and without that bad boy just stick to normal br that's fine bombers can also destroy loadout drops which can fundamentally change how operators approach these powerful sources of weapons while this new aircraft can shatter anti-air guns and destroy ground level threats it may meet its match when confronting the fighter plane which continues to be available in vanguard royale alternatively drop into a stationary or truck mounted a gun and bring down these airborne behemoths with them and vigor i expect it's going to be quite tanky then because if you can just bully it with planes it might go down really easily so i imagine that's going to be quite strong furthermore players can expect to see health decreases to both planes as part of this update making them easier to shoot down should they pose a threat to you or your squad it doesn't say how many people can actually go in this there are rumors that it's four in that case the full squad could get in fly around rain down some pain from above cod starts to become a bit more like battlefield again we'll see how it is and then there's this which we've also seen in pubg the redeploy balloon shown on the tacmap as a blimp icon the redeploy balloon is a ticket back to the skies to reposition thousands of meters away from your set location operators can ascend to the top of the balloon via a zip line tethered to the balloon and then leap off at the top and deploy their parachute to cover great distances so it's very similar again to the one that's in apex attach go all the way up to the top redeploy go wherever you want planes or weaponry can destroy the redeployed balloons though and once the balloon is deflated operators can spend a few hundred bucks to reinflate it that's really interesting because the fact that it can be destroyed people will just shoot at it for the sake of it and if it was permanently destroyed then what's the point of it being in the game right so having the option to spend some money to get it back up and running that's cool there are some new points of interest being added to the map to the chemical factory the refinery between the mines and the docks that once produced phosphate has been repurposed and is now a newly constructed plant spewing out nebula 5. this newly named chemical factory has a similar layout to the location it replaced but with several notable differences including enemy soldiers who protect the facility that's ai guys again more ai ppve and a trap that can be sprung in the central building there are several more interior spaces to explore from the main factory floor to watchtowers with impressive sight lines over the facility and its surroundings the river runs green with nebula fires byproduct but it is completely harmless squads who infiltrate this highly lethal area will walk away with more valuable loot on average which may help in the ensuing fight against both the circle collapse and nebula 5 bombs this is huge for warzone ai soldiers roaming certain areas of the map that you can fight they drop loot maybe they'll be part of quests in the future this is really going to give people something new to do bring players together when there's a bit of down time and if you remember they did have ai soldiers that shot at you in the nakatomi plaza update but the difference here is that back then it was all under the ground and they weren't much of a big deal not many people actually went and did that but these are going to be out in the open actually on the map doing things they are at other locations too it's a big deal next new location is the underground chemical weapon research labs according to current intel the axis operated seven research laboratories around the island hiding them underground and guarding them with small squads of soldiers expert trackers may have already found these lab locations around caldera but the average operator may find them thanks to several hand-drawn yellow circles on their attack map with only one way into these facilities your squad better have an escape plan before the circle collapse or enemy squads threaten your chance at walking away with phenomenal loadout items which may include gas masks and nebula 5 ammo so these will be a hot spot for that new good stuff in a way kind of sounds like a bit of a call back to the bunkers on the dansk and a big change is coming to rebirth as well as caldera's secrets come to light something lurks within rebirth island shadows expect substantial changes to the prison island during the mid-season update expect more intel about the reinforcements to come mid-season as well as other important updates from lee's studio raven software via patch notes season 2 will include a number of quality of life changes including having the gas mask animation no longer interrupting operators who are aiming down the sites thank you very much so look out for everything coming with this update over the next week in the big image they release of everything in season two as well we can see that rebirth is changing new look to the map rebirth reinforced they're calling it and there's gonna be two new weapons the kg m40 and the whitley and that's about it there's some more stuff about vanguard season two that looks like it's got a new game mode with tanks and different vehicles in so maybe the vanguard version of groundwater could be coming would love to try that and that's all it's pretty big update for warzone on the surface from that blog looks like it's going to be playing quite differently lots of interesting new things to do we'll have to wait and see if you guys can let me know your thoughts down in the comments below that would great and also leave a like if you enjoyed the video thank you as always guys if any of you do get the season pass next week or get any blueprints or whatever do consider using my code in the cod store jackfrags and caps and i'll get a bit of kickback from that that's all guys cheers for watching again i'll see you next time
