okay today i'm going to do something in battlefield that i've never done before i'm not going to shoot anyone i'm not firing a gun i don't have a primary weapon i'm just going to be a medic that goes around and revise people i'm going to use smoke grenades smokes bandages and i've also got the field medic trait which means that i get more squad points and also i run faster when i spot people that are down so my goal with this is to get to the top of the scoreboard without killing anyone but if i accidentally throw a grenade back in the wrong direction and it kills someone i can't possibly be held accountable for that so here we go then right who needs who needs medics okay you you need i almost immediately died you need medics there we go first points in the bag you need medics yes yes i'm coming don't worry about it i got you i am gonna be the best medic this game the server has ever seen okay medics medics medics wait wait i can help these people that's i put that smoke grenade in the wrong place but you know what if i want to get those points i've got to go for broke here lads i've got it i've really got to go for broke i've completely lost all sense of direction i nearly died you need meds hey wait no no you're underneath me there you go there's some meds okay that's good also i've got to rely on these support players in my team in my squad to keep supplying me with ammo bags or just learn where all the ammo stations are so i can keep getting smoke grenades back wait is this health or ammo oh god wait no no no oh that's my first death i'm going to try yes i was about to say i'm going to try and not die as much as possible but that death does not count seeing as my friendly you let go as soon as my friendly teammate's here revive me yes we can build this can't we did it it was medic stuff right um you i can help i can help wait wait don't you wait wait wait wait wait wait don't you dare give up how am i doing okay not bad not bad 1501 so far uh these guys need meds mate you're in trouble you can't you can't be doing that there's like a tank out there and stuff right i think this is tank i've got to kind of stay where the action is too if i want to keep on getting points if i request an order maybe if i'm squad leader i can like can i get more points to squad leader if they make an order guys what's going on here okay dead guy there that's a bit suss
