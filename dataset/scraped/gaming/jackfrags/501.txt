have you ever wanted to use telekinesis in a battlefield game well now you can with the magic of the m1 garand check this out some seriously cool animations there for this easter egg so what's going on here well after the latest battlefield 5 patch two books were discovered by players in the game one here on el marge encampment and one here on provence more books could be hidden in the game too waiting to be discovered now if we take a look at the book it says on it m1 garand the magic that won the war written by ow interesting so if you want to obtain this power for yourself it's quite simple however doing this in a live game could prove difficult as it takes a few seconds and a bit of organization so you need to get a full squad or at least four people to gather around the book and at least one of these players must have the m1 garand equipped it's on the assault class if you've done that an interact prompt will appear so interact hold the button down and do this strange sounds start to play and everyone's hands raise up and levitate the book into the air and once it disappears you will now have the magic and every time you reload your m1 garand those awesome animations will play it even has one for the grenade attachment too and anyone who has an m1 equipped and was part of the interaction will get the animations however if you die and respawn you won't have the animations anymore for that round of the game you only get one life with this we did check too if there are any third person animations with this one but there's not it's a great easter egg though and obviously a lot of work has gone into this so who made it who is ow well it turns out it's oscar vettenbrand and he is a gameplay animator at ea dice who create the game so all credits and thanks to him for making this happen and that's all do go and check this out for yourself and experience it in game if you enjoyed the video leave a like subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
