today i'll be sharing gameplay details on modern warfare 2 and war zone 2. i was invited to a 90-minute behind-the-scenes presentation with developers at infinity ward where they showed us real gameplay and took a deep dive into both of these titles so let's get stuck in and i'll let you know everything that they showed us there's no campaign spoilers here and i've focused on the cool new stuff for multiplayer bear in mind that all of this information applies to modern warfare 2 and warzone 2 apart from certain specific mw2 game modes mw2 will release on old gen and current gen featuring single player multiplayer and co-op it will also be available on steam for pc players this time around as well as battle net movement has had a big overhaul and there are now a lot more movement options you can now ledge hang meaning that you can peek up over walls and windows while aiming with a pistol you could do this in modern warfare 19 on ladders but now it also applies to ledges so rather than always instantly mantling up and over into gunfire you've got another option another fun example of this would be to let you hang on to the side of a helicopter that was flying by jump onto the landing skid take out the pilot with your pistol climb in and hijack it ledgehang will also offer hoisting or jumping up to higher levels giving players more interesting exploration opportunities in maps you can now legend grab edges and mantle out of a parachute too they showed us a new mechanic too where you can rappel down the side of a building with freedom of movement and toe up or toe down positions sliding is still in this game but diving to the ground is a new movement mechanic allowing the player to dive onto their belly to quickly get into cover or dive through a window to a lower floor swimming is now a huge part of the gameplay loop players can swim through and underwater whilst under the water you can use your pistol or melee weapon to shoot in it or out of it players above you can also shoot down into the water bullets have different ballistics and damage values when traveling through water though they will do less damage as they're moving slower and swimming is said to offer new gameplay opportunities such as escape exploring shipwrecks and stealth the deeper you are in the water the harder that you are to see the developers also created several advanced mechanics for water simulation these include server-side waves mesh deformation with automatic object and scene collision so these waves shouldn't clip through any objects caustics light refraction colour loss as you go deeper underwater reflections on the surface above you and foam simulation on boats and beaches the gunsmith system which was pioneered in modern warfare 19 is back but now with 10 attachment slots that they say they want to keep grounded in real military technology the options were muzzle underbarrel laser ammunition optic rear grip barrel magazine receiver and stock the new system is said to offer more depth with a broader range on functionality among attachments and a new feature within gunsmith is weapon platforms so let's say that you start playing with a specific assault rifle or smg and then you gain xp with it you will then unlock more guns further down that family tree that live within that trio platform and this means that guns now have unique and shared weapon attachments so if you unlock something new you're not going to start from scratch and you will have attachments to put on there if you've already unlocked them in that family tree it's a nice feature going further into this gunsmith now features attachment tuning for those people that really want to dive into optimizing their loadouts and they showed us an example where a barrel attachment could be tweaked for positives and negatives really pushing their gun into what they're looking for the barrel on the mp5 example offered a slider with weight distribution for heavy equaling more recoil control or lighter for faster ads speed it also let you change the length of it with longer meaning a better aim walking speed and shorter meaning better aiming stability so there's really an insane level of customization on the guns here vehicles are a much bigger part of this game for modern warfare 2 and war zone 2 ground war is back but this time on bigger battle maps which we'll go into soon there's plenty of new mechanics for vehicles too players can now lean out of cars and vehicles with windows and shoot 360 degrees from their position they can also climb on top of vehicles whilst they're moving we were shown gameplay with this mechanic in action the player was jumping from moving car to car and another example was mentioned of jumping from a moving player controlled vehicle onto a moving train the game has advanced vehicle damage now that means that doors can be blown off disabling the ability to lean out of them tyres can be blown out which will affect the handling of the vehicle or force it to come to a complete stop if you take out a certain number of tyres busted tires can be repaired and vehicles can be repaired by taking them to gas stations vehicles now have husks which means that vehicles will remain on the map as physics objects if a car ends up in the water it will float for a little while and then move with the waves before listing and sinking there are plenty of new vehicles too including rib boats armored patrol boats with manned turrets on the front and the back the wilson and the apc are now amphibious meaning that they can continue operating on land or water there are new weapon transport platforms like armored trucks and also a big controllable troop carrier helicopter that's got two side doors and a back door for firing out of this also has a feature where the driver can hop out jump in the back and the chopper will park and auto hover if you want it to and this can be used as a spawn vehicle in ground wall it appears that there's a much bigger focus on large scale battle maps this time around with day one large-scale combat featuring large exploratory maps with a mix of infantry and vehicles the maps will feature several different game modes too and they showed us two examples saeed that's got intense urban combat with the option to climb on top of every building or go inside every building with lots of exploration parkour and platforming it's a reef bay this is a tourist fishing village more of a water playground with lots of swimming rib boats and water gameplay opportunities i felt like those were part of the war zone 2 map as well of course there are core 6v6 maps 2 for mw2 and these will be more globetrotting all over the world in more special force type locations the maps in mw2 are said to be a bit smaller and tighter than the mw19 maps with less climbing they showed us museum which is set in spain grand prix which is a racetrack in asia at night and the race is going on in the background while you're playing farm 18 which is an undisclosed training facility in an old cement factory on one side there's an apartment building which is a classic map high rise and a shoot house in the middle as i mentioned we did see glimpses of the new warzone map in certain slides and presentations to me it looked like a sandy desert style location with multiple built-up points of interest including shipwrecks fishing villages a castle compounds there was an atc in the background so i'm assuming there'll be an airport there was an observatory type building on top of a mountain docks downtown areas big broken bridges football grounds and roads connecting most of these areas the developers also gave us a look at the improvements that they made to ai and it sounds like ai will feature heavily in certain game modes potentially in war zone 2 as well at the moment they're testing 100 players with 300 ai at the same time and striving to make it the highest quality level that they can achieve across all game modes commanding player respect and creating interesting engagement experiences rather than just being cannon fodder to shoot at i'm guessing this means that ai will be a big feature of the battle modes and warzone 2 assuming something like quest systems or strongholds they demonstrated new ai features with self-preservation behavior so they had alert body language environment and room detection coordination checking angles and stuff like that and they've also looked at what these bots lives are like outside of combat so let's say if a player was just observing them in a multiplayer environment and not engaging what are they going to be doing and they said that this has been created with a new systemic system that didn't have any scripting so the ai has got these behaviors and it's just doing these things itself and finding its way around the environments we saw a few new pieces of equipment and field upgrades tactical cameras these can be thrown onto a wall you can then hop into the feed and look around mark players other players in your squad can throw them too and they create a network so if you wanted to you could check all their cameras too and play that camera operator role they can be set up with motion sensors too beeping when motion is detected next up is the drill charge this is similar to the huge cluster charge from rainbow six siege so you throw this onto a wall or a vehicle and it will drill through and shoot a grenade through so it's a nice softener for room campers it can also be used on vehicles to force exits from them so you could chuck it on a vehicle the team have to jump out you kill them and then you take over the vehicle because if you're in the vehicle when the grenade goes off it will kill you the ddos this is an emp device that will store vehicles and equipment so it's a good combo to use before the drill charge interestingly if you're hit by this and driving a vehicle you'll get a button prompt to attempt to restart the vehicle's engine the inflatable decoy this is a kevlar blow up dummy decoy that can be manually deployed remotely or proximity deployed where it will pop up startle and auto orient to whoever set it off so it's a nice distraction mechanic really it can also be used in water where it will strike a swimming pose or if you deploy it in a lower environment it might crouch down or if you put it near a window it might peak over the window for example so it's really dependent on the location that you set it off in so it will look like a real player and not be obvious equipment also has different interactions with water now that that's a big part of the gameplay for example flashbangs and smoke have buoyancy and they'll deploy on the surface or if you throw a proximity mine into the water it will deploy little floaties and become a mine that floats and moves along with the waves on the surface of the water so that turns into an anti-personnel device if someone's swimming or even some form of deterrent against boats what about new gamers for mw2 well they showed us two knockout mode this is gunfight meets core multiplayer and it's essentially the last one holding the package wins you've got one life with revives and it's supposed to be based on a kids game called steal the bacon i don't know that one but the bag can spawn in three positions so you can either kill everybody or hold back when the timer runs out and it's only a one minute timer per round so it's a really fast game mode and then the other one they showed us is called prisoner rescue and this is breaching and sieging type game play where you have to save prisoners or eliminate the enemy attempting to save them so you got one team defending and setting up and then another team further away who are tasked with going in eliminating the enemies all grabbing the prisoners and getting them to an extraction point and in play testing they said that this is fun and it feels kind of more real than your typical cod experience i did see many different guns in the gameplay and it's all the usual suspects that you would expect to be there some of them were renamed though which i thought was weird but some examples were the mp7 m14 m4 bison mp5 acr m16 bernarli m4 shotgun ak-47 vector score and p90 we did see several single-player levels too again no story spoilers but graphically it looked incredible and the sound engine has definitely taken a big upgrade although it was already pretty good in the single player in mw19 the animations in particular i thought were excellent as expected also the night vision goggles in our blue instead of green and finally a couple of little tidbits that they mentioned they see warzone 2 and mw2 as cod 2.0 turning a page for the franchise on a new unified engine ricochet anti-cheap will release on day one for both of these products and warzone is also releasing on mobile soon too and i know that you guys are gonna ask but they didn't mention anything about fov slider on next-gen consoles and that's all really that's what they showed us do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you enjoyed the video leave a like that's a great way to help support me thank you if you didn't like it dislike it subscribe for more modern warfare 2 and warzone 2 news and information and i'll see you next time bye
