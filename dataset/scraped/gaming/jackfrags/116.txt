oh man have i got a video for you today yesterday i was on a call with the game director creative direct and call of duty franchise director talking all about this year's call of duty game a sequel to modern warfare and call of duty war zone 2. they spilled the beans on a lot of stuff with the game and there was a qa session afterwards where we could talk about the current state of war zone and also a ton of upcoming features and info for war zone 2. so we're going to get stuck into it now here's all the important stuff that you need to know so call of duty 2022 this year is a sequel to modern warfare 2019 i'm sure that many of you have already heard those rumors but that's confirmed to be true now it'll probably end up being called modern warfare tip so they're working on this new call of duty game together and at the same time a new warzone game designed together from the ground up and with the new warzone they've innovated in significant ways and they mentioned gun builders modes and perks this new war zone will be a massive evolution of battle royale with an all-new play space and new sandbox mode and pat kelly who is the call of duty franchise director elaborated on this a bit he said that they're trying some significant innovations in this endeavoring to achieve the same kind of innovation that they made in war zone 1. they felt like they really missed on the ability to give players some freedom and agency on how they play so they want to make sure that with this game no two matches play the same and to let players define what winning looks like now that was very vague and ambiguous but the way that i took it was that there might be extraction opportunities throughout the match but that's just my personal interpretation of what pat said he also mentioned that they've got massively cool stuff in the works for the game and it will be disruptive and innovative and by disruptive he clarified that it meant it's not going to be the same old same old where they just like release new guns operators etc and it's going to be far more meta-changing than that but they're not thinking about boost jumping and those kind of things they didn't talk at all about the new sandbox mode so lots of question marks about what that is the new game and the new version of warzone will be made on a new engine and going forward from this game and the new warzone there will be one engine powering all the cod games they said that this engine is massively better than what they've got at the moment and it means that engineers and developers can now work on a single entity and they've got no intent to homogenize things either and each game integration in the future will still have a unique feel and they appreciate and value that because they think that it keeps things fresh that right there pretty much confirms to me that warzone as we know it on the current iteration will probably cease development when this new version comes out i reckon they're going to wipe the slate clean and we're just going to have like the new modern warfare 2 guns in there to start with there was some hinting that modern warfare 2 and the new warzone will have a massive upgrade for the gunsmith system so let's imagine that you could make a custom bake of your favorite guns and essentially create your own blueprints and whilst they didn't show us anything then they didn't go into a great amount of detail it's obvious that they've got this new engine and they're trying to innovate again within the br genre now moving on they also told us about some fixes and big gameplay changes coming to warzone in the future season 2.5 to season three down the line there may be some ability to let's say check some boxes with respect to matchmaking and preferences so again no specifics were mentioned but i think it was alluding to hey i only want to play with pc players or i only want to play with console players i only want to play against mouse and keyboard for example in terms of rank play rank play is a priority for the team but the challenge for them at the moment is timing it's a big lift critically important for them and for the game and it's not locked in on the calendar just yet they want to make sure that they do it right first and do it well and give those long-term players an end game we talked about aim assist as well they're potentially looking at scaling that with distance but nothing confirmed they're working on visibility for players overall being able to see people better they're working on world traversal issues if you played caldera you'll know that you get stuck on a lot of stuff and that's going to be coming in season three roughly april and also in season three improved directional footstep audio that's a massive deal for me hopefully they come through on that one they elaborated on the field of view slider for console i know a lot of people request this but they say that it's a really difficult one and last generation consoles are the challenge because they can't maintain frame rate while offering people a bigger field of view and frame rate if you've played the card games on console it's always been the top priority so they said that if you give people an fov slider on old gem you essentially give them the option to slide their frame rate down at the same time and then they mentioned if they did it on next gen but not last gen all they're gonna do is further increase the skill gap they said that the largest player base by far is on the old generation consoles so the xbox one and playstation 4 and they feel that if they put an fov slider onto nexgen only and it's already on pc it would only contribute to more toxicity and the game would become further on balance so they're not going to go after it in war zone 1 because of the frame rate and the skill gap they didn't talk about warzone 2 in regards to field of view and last gen they said is still today a large huge portion of their player base next-gen consoles still harder to get hold of because the chip shortages accessibility cost the pandemic next-gen numbers are still really small relatively speaking and they said that they wouldn't love anything more to just focus on two next-gen consoles and only pc but it's just such a big pain in the ass to balance this with all the old hardware there 120 hertz on xbox series x i didn't realize this but they haven't had that since caldera they said that that's a software issue with the package that xbox have recently switched to and they're trying to push on that but it requires work from microsoft and call of duty more fixes and changes for the game season two so we've got traversal improvements which means increased mantle height and collision fixes the gas mask the animation will not interrupt the player in aim down the site armor plates will refill full plates of armor before filling damage plates that's a big change and it's going to mean that there's a lot more armor in the game so i think it means that imagine if you've got a tiny little bit of armor to fill in one of the chunks you use a plate and it only fills a little bit that's how it is at the moment but i think with this patch it's going to fill one entire plate so it will fill that little bit and almost the whole of the next chunk if you get what i'm saying vehicles handling and a reduction in collision of world geometry there will be parachute improvements that means being able to deploy them at a lower vertical height restrictions dead silence and stun grenades will be removed from vanguard royale they'll be stunned fixes that means the aim assist will now scale properly when stunned and it won't increase aim assist strength i know that's a big advantage of playing on controller if you get stunned the aim assist just seems to work for you but that won't be the case anymore there'll be nerfs to fighter planes and gas canisters the final circle will be less likely to end on peak and then finally there's more to come mid-season 2.5 when you're down you'll be able to control whether you get resurrected in the prone or crouched state i think that'll be a new option in the menu you'll be able to drop gas masks and you'll be able to pick up armor from another satchel if you've already got a satchel so that's it i know this was a lot of stuff to take in especially the stuff about modern warfare 2 and warzone 2. they really went hard on the innovation and how it's gonna change the game but i think it's really difficult to actually try and come up with something that this would be i can imagine that it's a really fun but also stressful and difficult job for the designers and the developers based on what they said the only thing that i could think of was like some kind of extraction mechanic mid game a massive overhaul of the gunsmith system gun customization just gets incredibly advanced maybe a deeper look into parkour mechanics getting around the level that kind of stuff but ultimately i don't want to dwell on this and go into it any further make it what you will that's what they told us let me know what you think warzone 2 is going to be like down in the comments below guys thank you so much for watching would love to hear your thoughts if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe
