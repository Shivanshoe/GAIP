hi guys hope you're all well today a massive patch went out for war zone on pc xbox and playstation and with it it added a few things broke a few things and changed some other stuff now after the patch i hopped on with my usual squad and our first game ended like this it was just us and one of the squad left in the game unfortunately they were nowhere to be seen now if you know about warzone and its history so far there's been a glitch with stims and tacticals sometimes helicopters where you could abuse a bug and make it so you could survive in the gas infinitely and then when the game's about to end no one can find you and you just win because everyone else will die in the gas really frustrating it's reappeared several times before and i don't know if this one is specifically related to the stim again it could be related to the helicopters with guns that they just put back in the game but regardless this has happened again this was our first match as a full squad after the patch not a very good first impression is it and as you can see the other players were just over in boneyard miles away from us so they must be abusing some kind of bug or it's just happened accidentally so some kind of exploit with that is back in the game again this is a big problem and i just can't believe that it's happened again but here we are as you may know the zombies have been having their pub crawl around the dance and they've made it to downtown they've been there about a week now if you complete the zombie challenge it drops a key card then you take that to the zombie crate and out will pop a purple key card if you pick that up and then you go down to one of the bunkers where the weird five percent zombie machines are you can access that and spend the key card at the top for this bombardment when you do that it sends a massive artillery strike that lasts like a minute onto the zombies area and if any players are there on the roofs or in the streets they're gonna get killed by this in this case i think i actually managed to get two kills so it's a little thing you can do i don't really understand it at the moment because i don't think it adds anything to the gameplay so perhaps this will come into effect further down the line when the zombie problem escalates and then just put it in there for now but one other thing that they've added you may have noticed at these zombie machines you can now buy things and you don't need the zombie key card to buy any of the things that cost dollar values you can just go to one of these and get anything the bottom option is foresight the foresight perk lets you see every single zone in the game all the way down to where it bounces after it closes for the last time and this only costs twenty thousand dollars you can get that amount of money in about two to three minutes if you know what you're doing if you're efficient with scavs dropping in places that have orange boxes legendary crates and as a squad especially in quads it's quite easy to get that amount of money so you come to this machine you buy the foresight and then you know where the final zone is this is awful and i think it's a bad design choice if they're going to keep this in the game it has to cost at least double if not triple what it is at the moment the problem with this is that it's essentially giving the players that do this an easy win there's no suspense the game is boring you could choose to just go to the final zone get your loadout stay there and most likely set up win the match i think the intent behind this was probably give the people that don't play this game as regularly more of a chance to try and win the game and know where the zone ends but in reality people who play this game a lot the competent players will just get 20 grand fight straight away head to that final zone so there's no tension there's no skill it's boring for the other players in the game and it's boring for the people that will go and do this before this foresight was in the game but it was a incredibly rare drop that you could find on the ground if you went and did certain easter eggs or occasionally you might find it in a bunker but it was really rare you wouldn't often see it but now that you can buy it i'm not a fan i don't think it should be here in terms of weapon balance they did actually do a little bit of a nerf to the ffar the org and the m16 and when i say little i mean that i played the game today using these guns and they were still incredibly effective definitely the top choices for me personally i was out shooting people with smgs with the ffar i don't think they've done enough here so they touched them a bit but it's nowhere near enough i think the meta is going to stay the same the problem with this for me is that the time skill is way too quick and it just creates a horrible passive gameplay style that's boring it's been like this for weeks and the balance of the game isn't addressed quickly enough there's no communication regarding it and you just left in this awful if you can't beat them join them situation they also added the rcxd the remote control carbon to warzone but for some reason they put it at the bottom of the buystation list so the first time that i accessed the buy station today and i went to buy a loadout i just accidentally bought the rcxd because that's usually where the loadout is that's my muscle memory it's built in like that so it's down the bottom when it should be closer to the top with all the other killstreaks i don't know why it's down the bottom also the rcxd doesn't really go upstairs i tried it you can kind of jump up them sometimes but it just gets stuck on the stairs so it's almost like they haven't really tested the rcxd on the dance yeah you can use it on rebirth and it's in cold war obviously that's a different version of it but it doesn't really go upstairs so kind of useless also it's the gas version of the rcxd massively underwhelming and no one is going to really buy that or use it effectively i also had a glitch where i couldn't drop my money that's been in the game for a while star had a glitch where he couldn't use kill streaks or equipment that's been in the game for ages they didn't make any changes to dead silence stopping power they didn't adjust the rose skin at all the helicopter miniguns are like 50 field of view for some reason so they're really uncomfortable to use feels very jarring when you get into them now i know that sounds really bad and honestly i was expecting this patch to be a bit of a turning point for war zone in season two i wanted a massive shake-up with the meta i wanted some more bug fixes but really it's just a bad patch i don't know how this has happened it's happened before and it keeps happening again and again and again another fan of warzone someone who has played hundreds of hours of this game when it works i love it i think it's absolutely the best battle royale right now this kind of stuff is just really disheartening and frustrating i don't know exactly what the reasons for this are obviously i don't work at activision i don't work at raven software or infinity ward or treyarch whatever but as an outsider this has happened multiple times now so it's obvious that whenever there's a new patch or an update whatever it is the quality control isn't good enough the communication still isn't good enough there's no detailed patch notes thank you to people like jay god true game day to exclusive ace who are willing to put the time in and actually test this stuff without those the fan base of this game just wouldn't know what the changes were when there's actually a ton of changes in here some of them good that they're not talking about and they're not explaining have someone dedicated to communicating this stuff with the player base and letting them know all of the changes that way there's no guessing there's no spreading of false information it's just from the horse's mouth this is what we changed and this is why we did it now i'm sorry if i'm coming across a bit ranty i don't usually do videos like this i like to focus on the positive but it's been brewing up for a while and as i said i'm a fan i love this game it's just a shame that this keeps happening again and again i've only ever really done one video like this in the past and that was july last year when the cheating was just absolutely awful and to their credit i do think that that has got better recently but ultimately generally speaking about the game and the way it's updated something needs to change here because if it doesn't history will repeat itself it'll happen again the player base is just going to get annoyed and the core gamers will leave and go on to something else and all this new content that you're adding like the zombie stuff like the room and new map that's coming up it would all be overshadowed if whenever there's a patch or a new piece of content things just don't work they break there's no communication and warzone is here for the long term activision have said that it will act as a disney world of sorts for cod games and every time there's a new card game they can tie into warzone release a ton of new content skins game modes whatever it might be and inject warzone with a load of new stuff every year so the plan is for it to be around for a long time but at the moment the patches the updates the communication is just ineffective it's not working so i think something has to change there get the foundation of warzone right first don't rush things give the developers more time more resources communicate with your player base more regularly and in detail and it could be that long term fun money maker that you want it to be but if it continues down this trajectory it doesn't have a bright future ahead of it and with that said that is all for today guys do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below i for one will still continue to play warzone i just hope that they can get their act together a bit and be more responsive with everything if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
