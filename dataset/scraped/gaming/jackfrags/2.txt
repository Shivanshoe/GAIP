recently warzone introduced a brand new skin to the game called the night terror purchasable in the violet stealth pro pack but many players are complaining that the skin is pay to win as it's too dark and difficult to see in game some comparing it to the original infamous rose skin that blended in well before it was nerfed so i decided to do an experiment with this i bought the skin equipped it and my goal was to test how overpowered it is my plan was to hide in plain sight in dark areas too and just see if people notice me it wasn't my goal to win just to see how many examples i could get and i have to admit that i wasn't expecting any crazy results but what happened really surprised me i recorded a few see it to believe it clips in only four matches you're about to see some mad stuff here if you enjoy the video leave a like comment below let's see how it turned out right now this map i definitely want to be indoors because look i mean it's so bright and green outside there's so much white and sand color as well but i think in the keep i think this is the spot where people will be least likely to see me because there's so many little nooks and crannies and so much noise yeah right here i'm just gonna do it i'm just gonna prone here let's see what happens behind me they just came in and ran away enemy uav active they just ran up the stairs look right through this door and up the stairs and they didn't notice me okay they're there enemy uav active right there these stranger things vector no not the clock my loadout's in it's above me on one floor though i'm gonna grab this just heard a guy slide that's a good spot there in front of the cannonballs maybe i'm just gonna go here one of these cannons right will anyone see me this is so dumb this probably seems so dumb watching it from this perspective when i just looked at this from over there it was really dark so maybe okay on the floor above me to the right there's still people in the cape oh my god no there's no way okay i'm i'm lost for words this is not a setup this is a real match of warzone that just happened what the hell yeah there's definitely something to this skin then i think it's the contrast maybe i want to see if that happens again with a different player though okay i'm all right i feel like if they burst out that door there and look towards me maybe they'd see me but maybe because that guy just ran straight you know down here and past me i just didn't stand out or anything all right someone right behind me on the same level as me come on please run pass gas is closing in i'm gonna have to move for the zone we'll see because this is good everyone's gonna be panicking and as they run by they might not see me i mean that guy obviously didn't see me so i've already got some stealthy qualities here but when the zone is pushing them maybe they're not going to notice even more that's the same skin that i'm wearing i can't believe it i cannot believe that's happened again that guy's movement seemed pretty good too i'm just gonna stay still someone else in that corner all right mate i'm just inspecting this hallway here [Applause] they've not seen me there's no way they literally just slid right next to me and they hit me once that's kind of ridiculous isn't it what okay they've gone i mean that's insane i don't believe it's working how did i not get spied then okay we got resurgence oh man if i could win a match by just hiding how good would that be oh that's so funny that is ridiculous but i need somewhere dark then don't i i don't have my perks anymore though that's pretty dark there bit of shadow here did you see me [Applause] obviously didn't see me have a little fight oh he's got in the car oh someone else has got them this is so much fun i've never played warzone like this go here i think there'd be less contrast there though wouldn't that hey also i don't have my perks here so i'm going to be on heartbeat censor still driving around that jeep buddy yep oh he's chasing him all you got to do is look left oh it's coming this way no driver at the wheel i think there's another one on the right isn't there what if i just go here like pro next to it it's a really dark vehicle so i should kind of blend in [Applause] guys how i think they're right behind me they've not even seen me i didn't move yes they saw me natural oh my god right they finally noticed me they weren't expecting that were they that's so funny oh my goodness i think i heard him laugh as well all right there's a guy there three left i want to get into those crates did you see me i don't think so yeah this might be okay let's have a look that's an airstrike right in front of me in this little crate maybe [Applause] okay i'm gonna fight yeah i'm not too happy with this spot to be honest what if i just go here like this two left there's one on my left one in front of me i think i hear them yep they saw me i was sticking out like a sore thumb there wasn't i only five remained victory i'm not so bad actually we got a little bit a little bit of a look at it there but we'll settle under the map well i mean there were some clear examples there weren't there where people just didn't see me they just ran straight past it might be even more effective on the other map though okay caldera all right we were above mines go in a building and just hide in a corner i'm just going to kill this dude here i think there is someone below there's a guy there engaging shooter let's see i just crouched here let's see if they come in can hear them coming over there's someone above me as well i'm gonna try not to move that guy just slid right past enemy uav active enemy uav might be the guy outside need to get the loadout so don't get kicked gamma right behind me you just throw a rocket at me then what was that okay well obviously i'm sticking out like a sore thumb there aren't i black skin on a white and beach oh there was two people shooting at me there is this gonna be advantageous in the gulag ah there's not really that many dark areas is there so i don't think so i'll try i'll try and hide somewhere is it anywhere dark and your fight is over no not really so just go for a kill and get back in the game i'm good to go okay right so my loadout's there is it gonna be camp though it's in a really bad spot in it ah man i need it though because it's got ghosts come on bike here okay there it is all right somewhere to hide where should we go okay there's a guy here there's another guy back there there's so many people here what the hell there's a guy there i just stay here and watch i don't really want to move you know oh my god you can slide all the way down that's sick i'm just gonna stand here see what happens look creep in it really oh he had the speed boost didn't he that's why he was running so fast could be a good spot actually dude running across down there this is kind of fun you know just trying to hide in plain sight go on the hill as well one here one up here look at this that bloody door flashing come on is he gonna see me see this guy here look enemy recon drone in your area okay that's going to spot me isn't it although i've i think i've got cold-blooded and ghosts so yep okay i think they spotted me there with the drone return yeah the drone gave me away that wasn't that great a hiding spot to be honest i'm stuck out there try another one i think peak maybe because there's a lot of indoor dark areas there that could lead to some interesting situations like down there there's a load of dark spots obviously in the cave in here it's not really that dark though is it very flat as well not much detail here oh well that didn't work let's watch [Applause] i mean from the kill cam i wasn't really that easy to see but that guy just nailed me so fair play just gonna hide here see if they notice me okay they've not seen me you're still not seeing me [Music] right maybe it's working loadout's just dropped we'll go for that okay so there is another load out there i'm just gonna stand here can i see the loadout yeah it's just there isn't it so i'm gonna stand here and see if they go for the loadout and if they do do they spot me is the guy there going for the loadout no where are you going flash behind me don't think that guy spotted me over there that's someone new look like they've got a metal load out there i've just thought as well if i'm looking at someone because i've got cold-blooded and ghost does that still trigger high alert that's the loadout guy i reckon they've just run right past going up the hill you gonna see me nope didn't see me scanned over here as well interesting okay this is getting a bit spicy now isn't it i think a lot of being seen in this game depends on who you're playing against as well because if you're playing against a really good player that's on pc for example and they've put all their graphic settings on low and their saturation ramped up they're probably gonna see you really easily no matter if you're in a dark area with a dark skin anyway so that's something that you have to take into account as well i think okay that guy's over there having a fight now i wonder how close i could get without them noticing me did you spot me wait did you not see me then surely that guy spotted me maybe not the slide cancel pro right there okay guy parachute in here sights on target i'm just gonna prone here let's see if they spot me jump down the hill gone that way now i just saw a little pixel there the problem with ghosts is they changed it didn't they so if someone pops a uav and i'm not moving i'll still come up on it see those birds that went up there i know a lot of people think that they're triggered by players like when a player comes nearby if they're sprinting it will spawn the flock of birds like it does in something like hunt showdown and i think apex has that as well but i think it's just environmental detail in warzone i don't think it's a trigger or anything i've got my knife out as well i feel like that's going to be sneakier than having my gun out profile of a gun is much more noticeable than a knife isn't it see those birds they move there there's no players there just random i hear footsteps it just run right past who was it right in front of me i didn't see where they were though i just saw the traces there they are look see don't want to move though you can just see the pixels moving at the top there okay they've jumped down let's see i reckon they're going to come over here you know and hear him creeping up to me right there gas is closing in they've not seen me yet i'm not gonna move just want to see what happens here right in front of me i don't think i should appear on heartbeat sensor right only 10 are left going up the hill now look can you see me they're looking right at me literally looking right at me that play is actively scanning as well trying to find people i'm gonna have to move though because the gas is almost here i can't believe they've not seen me okay i've got to go hey i was there the whole time oh that's too funny i'm dead now though unless i can get on the quality no you leave me alone oh that's funny i wish i could have seen that from their perspective before so there we go then in conclusion i could have played a few more matches and recorded some further good examples of being almost invisible to players looking directly at me but i think there's enough here in this video to show that it's a bit too good to start with it's an incredibly slender skin there's barely any tactical gear on it so it's a smaller visual footprint it's very black of course so it doesn't stand out in those darker areas and most importantly the helmet or visor is completely blacked out and as humans our brains are trained to easily identify features of faces contours skin colors etc and the contrast difference between somebody with their face exposed even if they were wearing a military style helmet versus no face at all which is what the skin is that difference is massive in terms of rapidly identifying that there's a person there yes there are other dark skins in the game that you can use to blend in well but because this is a paid for skin and because of how effective it is it should be brightened up and changed in my opinion and that's all for today thank you for watching and i hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like and a comment below subscribe for more and i'll see you next time bye
