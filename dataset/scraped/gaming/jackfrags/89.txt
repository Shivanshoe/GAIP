[Music] guys we are back on war zone today thank you for tuning in appreciate your being here big thanks to call of duty for sponsoring this one as well today we're going to be playing the new warzone update for a couple hours they've added a completely new version of rebirth island change the map around there's all sorts of new areas pieces of cover that kind of stuff [Music] also there's been some big changes to the amount of health in the game it increased the time to kill i think they've added an extra 50 hp across the board there's a new gun as well which i spent ages unlocking in vanguard this bad boy the armaguara 43 i've only got it to level four it took me about two hours to unlock it in vanguard it was pretty tricky but we did get there we did get there and there's also some new stuff on rebirth island which are like buy stations that you can call in i think uav stations weapon trade stations they've changed some things with like the gas mask you cannot drop them they change the satchels so if you've already got a satchel i think you can use a satchel on the ground and take as many plates as you need up to eight from that and that's going to change the way the plate and meta economy of that works so yeah it's gonna be a really interesting one i did play some war zone last week we did a stupid challenge where we tried to win using swords and shields only which was a good laugh it was really fun it took us four attempts in total but we did actually manage to win a game of warzone just using swords and shields so that was fun just running around like absolute mad lads but today i'm playing with study tactical brit and mr perot westy and also i do have some cod points to give away we'll be dropping those in the chat i've managed to get some pc codes some xbox codes and playstation codes a big thanks to activision again for hooking me up with that and it'll just be first come first serve i'll drop those in the chat and uh yeah if you get

resupply uh the redeploy balloons you have to pay for them how they're there on this map or on cardboard yeah look look if you look at the big map look all of them are like destroyed with the big x on them so you have to invite you got to buy them we have to spend money in this economy there's a new easter egg on this map as well [Music] one else is i'm getting quite a lot of stuttering i wonder if i'm on full screen might be um you might be uh oh i found the i found the new whoa if you blow the horn it drops a special care packaging apparently [Applause] [Applause] uh [Music] [Laughter] how many layers are to this ship quite a few i'm just putting myself in full screen there we go that's better it's not it's not uh yeah is it oh god there's two guys above us shooting down on me oh by the way where's the button right here guys right here [Applause] i think does it make you feel a certain type of way it makes my insides feel special that's good wow i knew a man like that once you did [Laughter] oh god on the roof i'm down i'm down there's a man can i get you up uh yeah okay i can sell press if you want to just wait oh please he's coming i'm ruined jack you're a god manage yourself push it in front of me pushing i'm coming around now oh he's got different do you feel different no he's not i'm with it roof man roof position in a second the new lighting is confusing me it's very nice i must say it is it's quite pleasant isn't it apart from the ominous green cloud of the guy on our bike here somewhere okay yeah that'd be lovely anyone need body armor anyone need body armor thank you up on the roof no i'm missing do not like can we get going i don't like this anymore can we do this area uh what have i just picked up beams an egg what have you got like a giant egg a what

your thumbnail images just stand back from it a bit maybe give it a go we're already live oh now has a uh the sten has a drop an animation on it they've added animations to the guns have they done it what inspect oh yeah yeah you can inspect vanguard guns now wow guys it's like it's a game i've actually forgotten what they expect um [Music] [Applause] um [Applause] yeah i'm not saying we can't beat anybody i'm just saying that the people we're playing they're demons we're the demons in this lobby i'd like to see that there's a care package here becky come i don't have any ammo for anything but you know he's backing i'm backing oh you got the shotgun there cam it what happened yeah the gallow why no you haven't disconnected you know having fun lucky i don't understand so i ran and crouched slide and i glitched through the floor and then i i think i lagged maybe and then right we now must get into the zone boys yeah the lighting is insane don't [Applause] [Applause] it's above us [Applause] why can't i i can hear his gun but it's not showing off my mini map so that makes no sense suppressed there's people at the bye down here start as well he's not suppressed though he's right there oh you go up there oh dear you got to redeploy balloons everywhere really slowly on their side may well be about glasses you're putting your trust into somebody who absolutely hates this map this is your favorite mask come on i despise it you've got the controller that key yeah i know you've got 50 extra hp so let's die on site that was a close one guys that was a good first game we go again we go again um basically uh if you're in and around the docks don't crouch slide or you will fall through the map that seems like it's been uh very well uh tested because that's exactly what happened to me and there's no other way i can describe what happened except for i fell through the map you just died as well didn't you you fell off lucky you literally found my screen i was walking even though i was crouching so like i had the perspective of somebody who was crouched sliding but i was sprinting at full speed and then i just died instantly um so you know it's don't forget your double xp guys double weapon xp token there we go but i don't i don't need it jack because i haven't unlocked the new gun just put it's all over the ground cam yeah i know but i haven't unlocked it yeah but if you get it from the ground you can then get kills with it wow i've now how have i got 13 one hour double xp tokens that's insane i had one i used all of those i had like 20. yeah i i think it's got something to do with the white list i actually have i currently have 33 15 minute tokens 1730s and 245s that's a lot of tokens that's a lot of damage i never use them and i never ever no nobody not me not you uh b squared two thank you for the turn what's up expert pond hey davey what's up genius take this time to ready up he is so quiet he i mean he doesn't sound quiet to me would be

those away so i'm going to put two pc codes in the chat for 2400 points enemy soldier nearby oh i couldn't quite get the finish got a lot of horizontal recoil on this although i don't have any attachments for it so [Applause] enemy dropping into the ao [Applause] i'm sure when i get the attachments it'll be a lot better the rate of fire is just nuts on it though it's crazy crazy training's over no jack plays with keyboard and mouse yes john i do uh gabby there's new parts of the map where they've added cover changed a few things on the inside i mean we didn't really get to see much of

here in the building i can hear them okay well we can clear them out if you like oh if you're offering they've changed some of the text where it says loadout drop the text is thicker thicker now different isn't it and it disappears when you get close there's more men down here let's go kill them boys has it aimed neck for that headshot my necky no no it's a man and i'm dead oh god oh okay well hang on let's get together yeah yeah yeah yeah there's no way we're never gonna win fights ever yeah yeah hold on i don't know how they didn't finish here yeah i'm not sure why they didn't just

haven't seen the ui for uh satchels let's have a look well that's cool six out of eight it's not like it's yeah the icons not changed but you can see the let's go let me go over to the satchie mindset so it's enough that you know what you need to know this is just as mental as rebirth before sorry had a few people in my chat saying they're gonna ruin rebirth like the dance to caldera it's basically the same map which is exactly what people do it's not that huge a change they've just made some more some of the pois more interesting where's that like walkway with all the cover they've added i'm

the end there i don't think we did i don't think we did no don't get the opportunity to do that nice my cdl skin didn't start glowing gold updating playlists updating playlists what's that about right updating playlists i'll cue us back in again because otherwise it'll get broken rebirth resurgence solos yeah it basically to unlock the new blueprint you have to complete all four challenges and it does say in the bottom right corner when you go on the rebirth reinforced tab it says week one of three well so oh wait there's more challenges there's community challenges what's that so if you go into the rebirth reinforce tab then on the left hand side click see all challenges um operators must get a combined 20 billion kills and then it will activate the weapon trade stations and then operators must trade a combined 190 million weapons at the trade station so that's the next one then the communication towers come out and then operators must secure a combined hundred and thirty million payloads on rebirth island armoured truck deployment oh god yeah and then fourth one operators must gather a combined 40 trillion dollars in blood money on rebirth island and it will unlock the golden vault mystery i mean it's quite cool but at the same time it's like all of these features they include in the patch notes they're just not coming out until like a week or two from how quickly it gets done though doesn't it it's kind of the same as like as weapon unlocks though like they're in the game but you have to unlock them first so it's the same sort of thing for deployment take this time donation alert of study saying master [Applause] oh it was the guy that it was the guy on in the crossbow man oh yeah mine crosby being crosstalk for free i'll let you use it for free absolutely i mean i don't have donations [Applause] you just killed wang on my screen jack because i've got streamer mode you kill the wang your mate's a wagger mysterious black a huge wank oh god i

guy not that guy jack thank you [Applause] beanbean all right last guys over here in there [Applause] oh good yeah it's very very good pretty unfair i mean isn't it the fastest firing in the game

card for it really yeah i thought i found one already yeah lucky found it as well does that get you into there or what these these won't activate until we finish all of those missions you want to get

this smg is [Applause] 150 hp i don't think he'll be all that good oh yeah he'll definitely be less effective for the 300 hp you get finished anyway this guy blow me oh yeah i'm pushing you now oh no dear i thought he was above me uh yeah okay yeah he's fine you got him he's chasing him [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] well this is fun [Applause] i'm coming down lads i'm coming down so many loadouts here lots of people are going to drop here where is it where's the new gun where's the is there a new gun is it new is it here is it here nobody's going to kill me nobody's going to get there he's going to kill stud he's got a massive stun [Applause] i just wanted the new gun that's all i wanted you can get it if you really want if you really need it if you really want pain another player on the roof on the loadouts right now maybe you missed it he missed the roof he missed the roof am i in the door right here we dropped down back to normal horatio it uses smg the new board isn't it yeah of course it oh it's cobble underneath are you asking me if the smg uses smg sorry i didn't it doesn't it uses smg it doesn't look like one contract it's over loads underneath us [Music] [Applause] guess what i just got killed by grenade oh no it's fine it's fine you just have to accept it except that this mode has different stuff in it well all the motor stands now i love that joke that is let me say that's insane as well yeah my guns are inside that small building yeah we can possibly make it in there and get back up here before we die never mind i screwed up and lost everything yeah can you pull get a quick wet uh rusty press 4k cam yes it's 2k i think it might be 2k oh no it's not five seconds oh he's got the uh vargo which i've yet to use thanks thank you i'm going to grab their gear with their trousers down this yeah this is the new gun isn't it [Music] very thick triple pepperoni is it on right here [Applause] because that fargo feels like a railgun uh he's gonna be in here in there probably yeah my name is buzz pennington lord of the pennington lord of the pen no i'm just having a guess oh no he's here he's on purple i'm perps yeah is he inside right on your tail cool he's in the gas yep dying i mean oh no i didn't get 10 kills i only got nine hit fire girls god damn hey damn mission failed buster you're getting next time i'll have to play the next game hey i like the map updates these they're nice they actually feel pretty decent yeah i still think it's a shame that they didn't increase the 50 hp i don't understand why they wouldn't do it because why do you think all the people that would complain really really hard would play on this map but i just got an error and i got you game lobby closed it's fine there was another playlist update another playlist update again banning sir bannington there was a new whitelist update like it was a whitelist update i would have thought people who played rebirth would have wanted the extra 50 health because of how ridiculously fast you die in rebar no because those people are absolute demons and they want to kill people really quick and they don't want to get killed by babs but with lower ttk you do get killed by babs yeah but my point being they can't go on massive streaks as much as they can with 250 health and they also know them all the muscle memory and i think rebirth's probably their uh their most popular mode anyway i don't know yeah i think no yeah it's broken uh so invite uh invite oh hi you're all in my lobby still by the way i never get any of your invites i just joined and hope for the best see i can't leave the party but there are four people in it i can't join you we restart our game you've all left you've all left there you go you can now you should all now be able to join me i'm joining but it's like lagging and it's good it doesn't like it um cancel it and rejoin now stop it yeah there you go there we go there we go it's installed i'm invisible well i'm inside i'm gonna drop another code in the chat here guys this is pc cod points 2400 first come first serve and then next batch i think we'll do playstation and then we've also got xbox later on thank you for coming guys there's another decent win there in the bag that smg is crazy what's up thingy mob hello tim don yeah don there is a vault door it's part of these missions apparently it's a community event operators must gather a combined 40 trillion dollars in blood money on rebirth island golden vaults mystery so i think when that has been met that's gonna update and then we also need to do this operators must get a combined 20 billion kills on rebirth island to unlock the weapon trade station and then there's the communication style which i think is the uav that we talked about like you just enable that and then you get a permanent uav at that location and then there's an armored truck on rebirth which i mean is rebirth even big enough for an armored truck i don't know hey val good to see you [Music] what's up liam osama hey chris bartek mr dandelion you should try the cold war aka cold war aka is probably really good with this time to kill andrew hey rin what's up bradley hope you've all had a

it's not connected to the golden bunker then it's too far away it must be so let's see what if the golden bunker opens and it's a doorway like narnia back to the dansk well yeah i see this screenshot the key card geeky posted yeah vickers key card yeah it looks i don't know what it opens though i don't know what it opens hmm dude i wonder i wonder i was a nice guy i mean you know gg hey i tried i

to the discord thank you man appreciate that we can okay thank you so much k it was really good fun [Applause] eyes on 420 is that actually i mean if that if that's true that's genius [Applause] for real that's so funny totally makes sense as well [Applause] wow [Applause] i played a couple melee shield matches on reboot yesterday i named the loadout jack please excuse yes [Applause] you can get stunned by that [Applause] very good yeah you get discord access if you become a member we uh we chat in there sometimes we play games together sometimes i ask them which thumbnail title do they prefer you know we share memes it's good it's a good time all right let's get the dub we've got two so far i'll try and get another one that's a pector how do you get the cod points i just dropped him in the chat m3 and then whoever gets them first gets him all right big winner boys yeah yeah yeah so apparently the red room is that we can go and get the blueprint because i've never done it are we going i'm going to get the blueprint i'm going to go get the blueprint yeah just you know for fun and you're chaos knowledge for a while and i need the key card as well sorry yeah but it's like op in rebirth because everyone's closed okay so i've got the key card but what does it do do we know what it does yet no i don't i just apparently my game crashed as soon as i started he's just disappeared though yeah i'll disappear all right do we want to just hip fire someone with his pants first chance [Music] i need a willing participant first i cannot believe the game that was a hard crash by the way no no error code nothing come on in there all right so it's just hip scan then it's not his scan it's just like it's just it's just you can hit fire it and you don't have to aim it and it's just really accurate my local westie has disappeared dude i can't believe that i literally just get the blueprint that i've wanted and the key card and then the game was like that's two down i mean that does seem quite efficient i have to be okay i'm gonna i'm gonna hit by the guy on the boat if i can [Music] [Applause] oh let's see if i can hit for everybody oh keycard goes into the stronghold tower gives you a free loadout and money no it's good apparently apparently if you want to leave and come back we can try it yeah yeah should we leave come on yeah yeah yeah there's leaving come back together yeah yeah yeah i'll just kill this guy that killed us no of course i must i mean the as44 is looking quite quite powerful the as44 it's a good gun a rebirth i think it could be amazing if you did a gung-ho load out bloody hell didn't um true game say it's like the best gun in the game if you can master it yeah it's one of it because it's got such high fire rate and it's got the assault rifle damage profile on it come with me a world of sweaty rebirth island you should be able to join on me now yeah i'm joining thank you oh wait i thought i joined on you didn't let me pain you should be able to now i my game is frozen so that must mean somebody is joining and you've all joined all at once let's go that's good so if we go to the red room you can get the milano blueprint i don't even know if that's going to work for me because that round hasn't ended yet so i don't even know if i'm going to add that blueprint yeah it should do i got the bluetooth one let's have a look milano silent real trick master red room there you go i actually do have it yeah nice actually when are they going to start adding missions to this game the war zone see like i really liked it on the dance when you would do all those things like do you remember the stadium one where you got the a max blueprint hmm that was a really good one i enjoyed that and they've just done none of that for cal there maybe they're not doing any of it because they're like we're just using caldera to chive you through to modern warfare 2. between the bare minimum dude i've absolutely no idea how to spec this gun but we'll give it a go hmm we ride we tried to play warzone elden bunner yes indeed um give me the class for that gun jack i mean i don't know i'm just i'm just freestyling it at the moment because i'm like i haven't unlocked everything for it so [Applause] yeah i'm just i've just put like fire rate attachments on it for now it seems pretty insane i mean i think that's going to be enough pretty soon to be honest look at the time to kill nearby it's absolutely nuts honestly there's a lot of horizontal recall on it but you could tidy that up with some attachments easily [Music] [Applause] stupid [Music] preparations done time to deploy to the war zone enemy dropping into the air some say jack frags wasn't born but actually a product of the frostbite engine what's up sanjay big fan thank you man new method definitely i think for close range definitely on rebirth epic guy darrian cooper build um i do have one say it i'll i'll have a look afterwards the gas is closing on your position going to the headquarters i'm sorry apparently i just got a commando oh yeah that's very commando bro there's another one on the stairs i'm coming back out now boys did you get it cam i haven't got the key card so you can grab it if you want to come back there's a guy coming it's pain i'm afraid i'm dead i just got that statue and then we can go to the tower yeah there's a guy in the building with us [Music] [Applause] yeah i just got that static you guys were talking about yeah it's also slow with this gun no one is do we have to go to stronghold we have to get a stronghold now okay let's move away so we have to go to stronghold [Music] [Applause] there's another team coming up as well [Applause] oh on me it's one of the portable buy stations it's got it's it's a shopping trolley look he's here yeah it's a little basket so we have to go into the tower at stronghold this one here yeah i think so apparently that's what someone was telling me or someone was telling [Music] below you jay i don't know how to get out there there's a ladder here oh there's a zip line i've got something i think you might with this machine i don't know i'm right up on the reef coming down try that here this one standby no that's not it and no one came here any of these no something downstairs though mission failed next time nearby maybe we've been we've been swindled here maybe the fountain of knowledge of knowledge it all looks a bit oh how about in here jack how about in here oh oh wait you can open unlock with perseus key card um i've got that one i've got i've gotten key access granted hey hey we're going to go somewhere we can get it so there's the forgotten key card over here unlock with the forgotten key card and then there's perseus kicker yeah there's three there's three key cards oh no what oh we can just about get it okay [Music] i mean i should probably get my load out really should i be able to i'll be whoever you want me to be perfect i will be your badge baby okay yeah sure

that [Music] and that red mark on the edge on the jacks left there's a guy over there really yeah there's a guy over there yeah i was just shooting at him hang on and then i got sniped silly warzone okay so the loadout drop markers now have like a weird red glow around them when you pick them up so you can easily distinguish them between loadout markers and smoker nodes because they're all the same asset yeah that was pretty decent very many of them [Music] do you not know what a war zone athlete is jack just um cdl skin runs around very fast always slide cancels maybe a welcome calls in a heartbeat should we do a a regular we could do a battle royale yeah about right i mean i've gotta get milano build built here because uh what i was different okay well then let's do that everyone build a quick a quickie loadout that they want to use what a large loadout um i'm gone it's gotta be a milano show is it gonna be vanguard guns no you can give me anything no you can do it it's battle royale so you do whatever you want now oh yeah that red room blueprint is actually pretty poggers on the milan it's pretty decent um let me just edit it so i can put the nice yeah marathon stock what does that do i feel like i need a sniper but at the same time no no no no no no no no no no sniper jack have you unlocked the vargo have you unlocked the vargo have you got it ranked or not no okay i'm gonna say because if you have it's actually really good but they have now nerfed it so it could be terrible good could be a giant egg it could be good it could be now now it's terrible uh there we go so i've got a vargo mac 10. that'll that'll be nice for vr it's gonna be interesting to see what this plays like now boys because you know 300 hp but um all one playlist so no place to hide from the sweats there's never a place to hide from the sweats now ain't vanguard royale vanguard right now i'm gonna stick with this uh armaguara and just level it up a bit more [Music] anyone can get a jack anyone can get it yeah [Music] all right we're going to drop a couple more playstation codes here uh raphael thank you so much for the ten dollars man that's very kind you keep up the good work your streaming videos are always entertaining appreciate that buddy thank you spaz 12 not on caldera val come on come on maybe another day joshua you gotta jump back into warzone again yeah it's pretty big uh okay they changed a lot of the the balance of the game as well with this too increased time to kill feeling pretty good i mean we've only done rebirth so far do you wonder if there's some new like hidden stuff on this map maybe [Applause] but there's all sorts of easter eggs so we could uh attempt to take a look out on this map [Applause] they always seem to update them when they do a big mid-season event [Applause] solos is very campy feels odd on rebirth oh yeah they've added solo rebirth as well haven't they gotta try that you can't see the number of players in the lobby anymore which is weird play time's over deployment to the war zone why is it so laggy it's not laggy for me blob am i into motorsports i kind of keep up with f1 but i don't religiously watch it or anything hey belfair joe what's up man how you doing victor do you remember when you were talking about terry's chocolate orange yeah kerry's chocolate orange isn't incredible when's the next bf4

restarting like it uh because my frame rate's gone instantly there you go and hold on hold on start just you know great [Music] maybe it's because i wasn't holding it and i put it down oh they changed it so it doesn't kill you snatch oh my god right start i'll just pull this out yeah i'm uh my game is sort of connecting to online services now you can't die start i'm sorry he's simply not allowed to die stud once i get my fps back then we can have fun again i can't wait to die now i'm not afraid of death at all myself anything happens in war zone anyone can go us too never forget that are you back online lucky fetching online profile i'm going to fetch you into the into the why have they made this a bug i think they made something a bug they were making something i can't believe they purposely broke their eyes they developed this bug it's a launching and border in like windowed mode now regularly oh do i have that set a set oh no i'm good is that is the store updated you know a new blueprint oh the new blueprints in there jack yeah yeah it's called black ice black i don't see it um it's for me uh war zone vanguard black ice it's the first one on there you've played western everyone who's code west no i don't know oh yeah i got it as well yeah maybe you have to restart your client 72 round mag snoop dogg uh let's have a look chad was saying he releases on 420 which would be hilarious i'm sorry but what in the chalkington is that oh that skin is pretty tight well i mean that skin is cursed come on that's it all right hang on a minute hang on a minute hang on a minute oh it's polina skin is extremely good my character just isn't here yeah you have to change your operator and then change it back again and it'll appear it's a lovely new bug vanish oxy action where's the fargo where is it i wonder if the ferrofluid blueprint is working yet i don't want to try it it is it is okay in my character i'm running the uh caldera cdl skin uh jack you wanted to see this uh where is it what's that's favorite bye there you go i should be holding it in my hat my operator is not there switch it back there you go hey guys i'm holding it now 72 round mag that sounds so chore i can't see you the stupid challenges are in front of you oh no i'll i'll come over to you in the lob this guy's a lot about i can kind of see it now yeah it looks like a world war two ump 45 that's what this gun looks like looks a bit like that i like being able to have my operators again yeah that is nice and stud loves his nick though loves it he loves the nectar yeah you see you see me all the time like what the hell is going on he doesn't need a career he's already in the game if we're gonna go to an event one day and is going to turn up as nicktoe and then in game there's going to be a stod it's just going to flip around i'll say stop operator where are you jackie i come to you i'm not going to make it to the roof oh i went from 60 fps to 200. right here we go ready i can't i can't they go i'm animating that's the worst animation i've ever seen the gun the gun is off the screen why is that even a thing why are they it looks nice there you go i'm coming down [Applause] dude that's the worst animation ever it's off the scenes lagging as well drop it to me and then look at my character i can't drop it my game is laggy because it's in the the lobby i can't drop it yeah again very laggle yeah the blueprint works the vargo blueprint works [Applause] so you'll be fine it'll be fine it'll be fine it's going to be fun just need to wait for a few people to die and then there's several normalized have they yeah it's not there for me maybe they're like look please we know the lobby is only half full don't say anything eisen what's up man thank you for coming to the stream welcome are you using nvidia geforce experience graphic enhancers no i'm not r2 what are my graphic settings 40p everything's the lowest it can be a safe zone apart from texture resolution and anisotropic on normal and particle quality on high and then i use one times anti-aliasing yeah oh i stick it's not okay the brain needs to go it's time to stop i think you're on your own there actually didn't see anyone else with you good oh there's people no never mind it's not perfect it still feels a little bit sluggish but i've written one of them now with my helicopter [Applause] i hate the iron sighs the new gun coming over let's go completely chalked myself unlucky sorry about me i mean there's people to our right as well if i got down i would have been five [Music] [Applause] [Applause] within shot two more over there statics coming down cool they're in over here [Music] little rosie teammates on the map when you kill them oh god i got stuck on a tree back yeah over here please why am i waiting around [Applause] the goo lag the coolest area there's a team appearance you can get to me uh someone just broke that night these 2v1 it's pain it's very much pain the the god squads are here guys i think uh i think the days of babari are over backland [Applause] it is indeed 5 p.m i think it's i think it's terrible i can see lackey making the loose the noose on his life turning around um it's those high ceilings are right let me just watch this kill cam like jeez yep yep okay [Applause] i mean if you could you could get [Applause] is three and a half minutes away but i mean i might have to just run to jack and hopefully that's the truck it's daddy it's called uh it's called a war zone okay there's a helicopter there starts you can nick that's only another 200 meters [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh look at that the pink truck love it a giant tag [Music] yeah right on the edge and then get that you can then drive to the heli if you want loadout will come in in now now the loadout doesn't come into the end of circle one what well it's not vanguard royale anymore is it it's normal br oh no and lucky's continuing to realize it's just i can't like without the extra 50 hp regular warzone is awful and that's has this got the 50 this has the 50 right yeah it's 1050 which is great yeah ground loot fights i do feel like i'm not dying instantly like there's a chance with rebirth is it's just like somebody sees you and you're dead and that's it like you don't have any chance lucky have you ever played with a mouse and keyboard let me tell you how inside feels i gotta tell you stop this is the only game i play controller with everything else mouse and keyboard haven't they also quote unquote fixed aim assist with the yeah apparently they're they're making gamers just even more um because they're strong basically yeah lucky can explain i'll explain the uh bushes trees and other objects that shouldn't have been including aim assist were including a recess surely that's right though um no if there's an object in the way why should you get aim assist well it's it wasn't working as intended allegedly okay um yeah you're supposed to just die jack the intended operation was terrible it's cash he needs babstee babster needs to come back in he's got that so there's no they've returned it to the state of which they intend it to be yeah which is yeah stop not dying oh my god but just remember guys they're not forgetting more zone two that's fine xander thank you for the five man that's very kind finally caught a stream and just wanted to say thank you for the amazing content you got this one i hope so xander maybe we can get it are we winning we're doing okay though what's up jose hey chuck supply box yeah yeah fighting between relocating are they they're crowd standing and they're cracked they're cracked he's inside the tracking he's cracked one these boys got their look on the roof yeah they probably do it's crackers [Music] you're gonna have to watch it with me it's fine yeah oh is it yeah it's supposed to be the worst location for the lady could ever be on the edge of the zone but you know it's vital michael please michael please no no thank god thank god it's in the open where have we they've taken the ai out there's no ai in the bunkers they've removed them oh there's a guy pushing us rusty is it up there this is a motorized where's stud i'm not gonna be able to get that i'm not gonna get that all right is that the same guy because [Applause] okay apparently something how are you not dead it has to do with the fact that the aim assist cannot discern between an enemy and a teammate what that's bad what i get aim assist on you guys when i shouldn't [Music] i mean that hardly sounds like a big problem well if a teammate runs in front of an enemy is this just a one one developer's excuse to make aim assist even stronger so they can win the more matches well i didn't say it you did yeah wireless are they in the orange building uh the one that you might purple there's no no no no footsteps on me running away running away running away help please wait where are [Music] head shots and it's just um breaking armor that shouldn't be the case chicken nugget he's going up the zippy off this guy's lived so many times you can't shoot you that way yeah you can't pen that green stuff oh god jeez are we sure this is 300 hp are we sure headshot did not one shot twice in a row what um and once again i've been jesus still there over by green on green yeah i've got 20 bullets in a dream there's a guy on the hill that's shooting at him around here watch out he's going to sit down he's going to try to push me coming just default where is he [Applause] see if he pushes nice there's a guy on the hill that's shooting us all right now uh he doesn't throw you as far he's here that's where the sniper is yeah you're sending it well i've got i haven't even got my loadout so not in the back [Applause] down nice has anyone got any assault rifle ammo we buy a loadout uh i can give you some stuff yeah oh thank you yeah we need to buy a loadout up here i've got full okay i've got full ai if you need some he was running m4 car 98 i need his sniper armor if he's got it uh i can give you yeah i'll do i'll do that i'll do that i'll do drop the cash on by coming over and then we'll have to use we need to use the balloon we need to go that quick or we're good oh we can get the balloon after then come on we don't have the rush i'll get a uav and i'll hold on to it for a sec you drop to toxic rounds come ah you can have them if you want them rusty loves being toxic right it's a new gun a new gun for a new day [Music] yeah well this was a weird start oh look guys there's only 50 players left circle two nice have they yeah yeah yeah well they won't have cranked it it's just early memes yeah yeah it'll be it'll be really hot and it's like it's too crowded you bannering it's like six o'clock as well so i think they have nerf the snipers guys i mean i don't think they've done it intentionally well i'm pretty sure they're kind of i i shot something very fun i just one shot that guy yeah it's fine then he's just one shot me back i've done one of them easy easy push them down close there i'm safe oh my god please dice what i'm going for lucky oh god no i'm gonna i'm gonna jump up here immediately some of the edge media yeah i've been sniped [Music] is this the fight we want to take not really it's probably best we rotate away now yeah now jack sniping people enemy soldiers i don't think it was stopped i don't think there was anything about it in the past it might it might be unintentional it might be that they do something i've headshot to you guys and there were pretty clear headshots and i was like damn how do they survive that and then someone in my chat saying that's the same as well yeah there's people in my chat saying they kind of they don't think they buff their headshot damage for modern warfare and uh cold war snipers they might increase health it's kind of not worth it it's really not worth typing in that case because i'm getting breaks and that's the problem like they've changed it and forgotten yeah they forgot it'll get picked up pretty quick i'm sure yeah literally all around what if it needs to be a bachelor it'll be a playlist update yeah that's what i mean you'll get picked up pretty quick [Applause] what are they gone gone where are they going yeah well that's nice isn't it because yeah it's a big sniper map isn't it yeah they and that's what they'll have to fix it pretty quickly like it's cl it's purely unintentional because let's face it the vanguard snipers are there's this just it's good yeah they're just they're just not very fun are they they just don't feel great they rest here i think she's saying it's actually the truth as in like this is the way they wanted it to be no according to you no no because according to a release from activision this is just is this just twitch no no no that's that's for vanguard vanguard's different oh yeah that was vanguard maybe but we'll see yeah because then there's no way they would do that because then there'd be no reason to use any of the modern warfare wars i'm just never bothered again yeah you'd never bother like you just and that that would be terrible it would be completely completely nullifying a game type a play type for no reason here [Applause] i haven't got any clear head shots yet i've got a couple that were cracks zoom in in the edit [Applause] [Music] by the way they haven't fixed the modern warfare operator jump height if you run modern warfare uh operators you can't get access to the new jumping height which makes it even not having this many games in the battle royale's bad idea i've got no plates at all by the way yep the headshots are chalked and i've now had a class to put on me that was a clear as day headshot now i didn't get the warning for that one that's fun yep didn't get the warning for that stud you may want to come inside gas is closed okay maybe it would this guy down on this tree jack i don't know if he's selfish taking shots guys down again someone else shooting at me yeah from no no no no no no basically you're all tickling each other with snipers adjusted them as well it did work before at least oh it did uh i don't know jack it just seems like maybe one of those things that they forgot about yeah i feel like they forgot about it i don't think they did it intentionally because they did say they said that they want the get your ankles broken jesus christ um yeah i was reading a little blog post about it saying that they wanted the br to be like the ultimate battle royale experience they don't want to have two modes anymore so with that line of thinking there's no reason that they would keep two sets of snipers that people definitely definitely prefer those snipers as well there's no reason for them to do that i've got seven lucky coming [Applause] there you go yeah there's no reason for them to do that oh hello there one further back on the left running across i'm just going to dive for green building there's people shooting there and there's people in it there's people in it are we pushing this oh god that is horrendous i would get just are you good there cam do you want help well you know you can

been beaten from behind now we're stuck in a bad spot here come to me you could double back to jack you've got that house on the corner there is he pushing or something no he's not pushing i just i guess we just use vanguard snipers oh yeah great i can't wait i can't wait i gotta come on here it's a good game guys yeah it is enemy uav that might be a good gun i'm just i'm just i just don't like them i just don't like the vanguard guns much prefer to use modern warfare in cold war now for the mobility i don't use any modern warfare ones you still don't have enough cash oh jack give me your cash can't give me a cash oh i can't go out i can't go out and get lucky it's too far damn listen to the ruins you've got one bike station [Applause] nice one study running [Applause] but i was on health so maybe the swiss isn't broken this building here cam we could take okay i'm wavy i'm coming here i am it doesn't even look like a world war two weapon at all this new shape or form ah it doesn't does it there we're good i did get sniped out someone above you you sure 100 yeah 100 yep wait wait cam i'll come with you are you sure lackey i i felt fairly confident i had footsteps to win yours that i think we're going on it's solos we've got solos [Applause] but where are they get points where are the solos we can't get one kill sniped yeah just hold your hands and you'll be fine one of them's probably in that he shot you for down here didn't they somewhere he shot me from down it's really difficult to say so much foliage man are you running anti-aliasing jack yeah one x which one um smae you guys just called hands just hold hands and you won't get double peaked depth of field on disgusting could be one in the river there's another building down yeah surely they just find a shop i don't think so guess it's close again we got the height we've got the height onto that of the building you just need to make sure there's nobody in this building stick together i checked i checked that there was no one in here oh there you go that's right he's striked himself he was in the building he's worried this one he's air striked himself so he's the only one in that building so the other hand the other guy has a sniper and he gets this guy's down orange yeah there he is left side that's how he wrench you deal with him let's get to the safe zone where's he gone it's right you're right pretty much close to the mountain hugging the mountain i'm pretty sure i just heard him plugging the mountain close to the right oh no there he [Applause] is this gun doesn't have a damage range bloody hell pushing me now 150 below me some texture [Applause] this other guy might be pushing now and you won't be careful um gas mask as well uh you can just about stay in yeah yeah we can stand just wait for the zone bounce i guess there's no need to rush him airspace too crowded [Music] he's moved yeah he's moved he's gone down the hill oh weird play by this guy broken [Music] throne frag [Music] but he should have pushed you guys whilst you were fighting yeah it was yeah i felt safe i think right now to put my car nea vanguard edition back on yeah we'll see if it works be if it works ggs boys good game man see if the other snipers work and then xm4 feels really nice for mid-range so yeah yeah cold war aka is also a banger at the minute all right vanguard khan and the ak 660 i think there must be yeah it's going to be in here isn't it yeah quick some deep breath so what is the blueprint for this armageira then so it's the strife compensator guild the body 315 mill barrel the body barrel yeah the body of the barrel the body barrel oh yeah this is this is not built to be what i was hoping it would be this is not built properly i'm sure they did right last update yeah yeah yeah last update it's still very good though i've decked our car 98 so we'll find out if it's busted or not fuji's chat yeah we almost quit at the start of that game as well yeah you know it's the classic el clasico yeah that armagera is a good gun but i feel like the build for the blueprint is not it's not what it's supposed to be no it's not it's not brilliant i don't even know how i'm supposed to use it i think it's got the lower rate of fire magazine as well it's using it the different caliber let's have a look it's got the eight millimeter kurz 72 round mag i don't even know what that yeah what the other mag options i can't see because i haven't unlocked the gun i can only look at what i can broken happy birthday my man thank you for tuning in appreciate you we're gonna drop some i think we've got one maybe two whatever's left of the playstation cod points then after that we'll do xbox after next match [Music] yeah the ui could do their update i think savage day and i agree with you war zone is pain i still enjoy it yeah i think a lot of people would prefer if caldera was back and i reckon many people are on rebirth now just because it's got that og mw vibe still you know [Music] i know that the like the audience has dropped off for it there's less people playing it fewer people playing it sorry um but i reckon like mw2 and warzone 2 that's going to be massive that's going to pop off warzone mobile as well that's going to be interesting alexander cheers for the two thank you broken clockwork yeah it's cool man we uh i think we played five games on it one three it was good [Music] uh con points codes ruger lieutenant squeaked the melee only video a couple days ago was the best thing i've seen in a while thank you man you need more hell let loose videos i want kid i'm sure we'll do some more i'm sure we will do some more buddy hey john practice while you can love all your content thanks for being a legend cheers john hey they got rid of the timer and the countdown in this number of players as well jack i hopped on 2042 yesterday to check out this past 12. yes mod frags if there's any playstation codes left can you drop them now please i hopped on 2042 yesterday and everyone was using this bus 12. yeah of course they fixed it now though punched it [Applause] emerson i just use the quickest settings that's all [Applause] [Music] the swiss is broken so they've increased the time to kill they've added health mark but they haven't adjusted the sniper rifle so it's still a one-hit kill headshot so kind of makes snipers irrelevant but we're going to try with the vanguard snipers this match and see if they work for wanna kill their choice hey sean thanks jack for live streaming today i needed a good escape from things no problem sure gas is approaching your position get to the safe side yeah it's useful to know gabi isn't it the player count i don't know why they removed it maybe it caused people to leave lobbies or something i think a lot of people would have to go long where are we going beach head i'm putting my head we're gonna put our heads in the sand [Applause] let's go that's a rose skin kill it kill it with fire focus fire on the rose skin they're all going beach yet as well i wonder jack you were talking about the different key cards on the rebirth yeah i wonder if there's a different key card for each week of the um event because there's three weeks of the event one key card per uh per week because the perseus is black ops cold war one of them gives you juggernaut really yeah i think i read that somewhere well it gives you a juggernaut suit yeah imagine that the amount of smashing dude i can see the video writing itself have you ever had a juggie on rebirth i don't think so it's coming in trying to kill me i think lucky one of those uh one of those key cards three different guys jimmy are they seeing each other no i beat them start to feel good okay there's more than one there isn't here here this guy will be low [Applause] now he's in the heli oh it's t-tv i'm going to get the rezzy yeah these guys uh they know what they're doing they take their time flat no they don't take their time he's gonna maybe jump out we've got time tried and cried come on then come on let's go yeah damn it's lucky lovely lovely there are people still uh i'm there [Applause] oh [Applause] couldn't quite get close enough yeah by the way operators are still broken so if you're using a modern warfare black ops cold war operator they don't allow you to get a parachute jump it's time soldier [Applause] on the ground [Music] i mean the cracked teenagers are home from school and they're here to hunt this right oh god big time yeah we don't want to go where was the guy uh he was south in the trench line we have enough money nearly [Applause] down on the red mark is no he called an air strike and i didn't get the notification and he's just self-respect nice there's one more one more on that on your left deck just just to your left just your left now push on the push moving left [Applause] don't see the other guy i'm sorry adam and he was he was running left i don't know where he went you might just

you were outside the bunker and he was standing in the corner i nearly shot my pants give me your cash cash cash grab the contract let's take it let's go so yeah i mean if they have actually made it so that snipers don't do a one-hit kill that will be an absolute travesty to the head at least a lot of people complain though if it's yeah on purpose i did see iceman i i did see iceman eisen complaining the other way the other day saying like oh i wish snipers weren't one hit kill to the head i wish skill wasn't a thing uh we're about to get tv probably where are they they're coming right over towards you oh yeah yeah yeah that's full jim just broke him well why are you thirsting me you dirty wet wide down [Applause] who do these guys think they are man i don't know they're just yeah no there's no one more so basically this type is definitely a headshot yeah it's confirmed they're they're chopped at the moment starred can't play any games i'm using one now i'll see what happens the van guardians tested well i i nailed somebody in the head with the time 99 but it could have been a neck shot yeah it could have been it wasn't a clear headshot i mean you know well there's one of them running around on green somewhere deployed they broke warzone again he's back in you're doing a recap on the way oh should i get self could we get still prisons or uavs or what i don't even think i've got a loadout [Applause] none of that's been transferred over westy restock resurgence they have an update here okay right i'm running a vanguard car 98 right now all right so i'm gonna run that with the new gun need a clean chair yeah we just need to we need a bab a volunteer bab i need some bangers i had some actually bangers last round i was like um excuse me my god in the window michael

sorry yeah there's a guy got an enemy there's a guy right here as well i know i got a break from hitting a head shot there i got a break from it uh people were all in this forest but yeah there's a guy literally straight in front of me no i only getting armor breaks from headshots okay that's full headshot right there i'm gonna double check three guys yeah i just headshot someone and only got uh dropping my sniper there and i'm like what's the point just headshots [Applause] so they broke snipers in war zone yeah they'll probably playlist up there if it's an accident if not um oh they're on

hit him once he ran out of bullets another car coming in behind did you see that ultimate one more there now i got another one coming in oh god i got two coming in oh my god what's going on over here there's so many people all right lucky what's going on there's two there like a lot of people are now saying that technically the marksman rifles like could actually be better because you could get two headshots really quick is there one one another one somewhere i'm watching the left side of the tents [Applause] he wasn't paying attention when they pushed me no they thought they thought someone's getting the load out of here over here yeah i need to i need to quickly remove myself myself oh my god the aim assistant um coming i'm going i don't know i was just contemplating life thank you very much come to playing your career oh i mean what career it's okay my [Music] uh there are men on the beach balloon [Music] that you're right i can't get my gear because that man is there and there's that man there that man there he's down get to the new safe zone that's a flashlight michael broke head shot we're just gonna have to hold hands if we want to snipe people headshot headshot that guy on the rock give me plates give me place oh dad there's a guy on that road no not really it there's people sniping at me off the hill above it oh snipers [Music] [Music] [Music] that was hotter than i was expecting that was fun uh yeah get beach head get yeah yeah yeah man right right close there's a place yeah there's people on the hills thank you well our long range option is completely chalked so we can't even do anything about it there's a whole team in this building guys there's a whole team in red marker can we get to you yeah yeah yeah you just shoot the guys in the window i'm about to be run over oh no you're fine right in that on that red marker yeah i just got a clear break of the armor instead of getting a hit a headshot i'm gonna need a res in the next 15 seconds i'm gonna need no i got nothing down to one blue one got no spare plates i've got i'm good for plates it's just beamed multiple ones there's one in every single window though we don't need to move we don't need to move we can stay here we need to watch our rear though because people are coming in off that hill oh yeah yeah yeah that's fine we'll be okay though we'll be all right yeah we'll be fine it's just a demon lobby yeah i think it's a demon lobby because no one can snipe even lobby [Applause] i hope they don't mistake for the fact that you know caldera's chalked on console for people wanted no one shot hill kill snipers like screw mouse and keyboard is this update well the aim is just keep going right amos's fix hasn't been applied yet there is a team over this hill still on orange yeah i can see that i can see them shooting i think they're still quite far away i think they're still here if you really want to oh player in the sky above the over there he's behind the tower and bloody hell it's going up well if you thought snipers were bad before [Music] they've moved away i've tried a flashbang though here all right where are we going i think we're going to end that landing on the team though if we take the balloon we've got to be careful about this why don't we go all the way over here or something or to the right yeah go to the right yeah well the plan this man we might even be able to snipe that guy or if we land behind him there's a guy in the tower see me i'm trying to yes it's moving well now we have the zone though yeah yeah yeah okay where are we going shot from from the town he's on the satellite district yeah sorry this is there they're they're cycling around us maybe mini towers that's where they shot from moving here yeah but one of them just parachuted off right to the south they're going for the valley station location here live station location let's see him they're down there somewhere i know he's gone further than that uh where are those shots oh yeah this guy [Applause] okay that might not have been a head shot that might have been a neck shot but i only got i only got i think it's safe to say we've confirmed it is broken yeah but like a headshot wesley it's just it's nuts definitely been breaking people instantly but not getting the head shot are they still in that green or they moved uh don't know there's people up there there's traces i can see them they're yeah yeah i can see them actually there was people here they they rotated around here all right i feel like they might [Music] ah [Applause] [Applause] whether they got killed or not is another question another one [Music] [Applause] there's a whole team coming in he's in the gas got him i need ammo i've got nothing what do you need this is like attrition warzone right now [Applause] i need to hit that low down well see one lucky's north on there red ping having a look another team as well north west you're on that rock lackey he's on the rock here yeah i've just sniped one of the guys north west they've got dark matter weapons okay maybe we should find a better position yeah it's not sniping 13 players left so there's nine enemies nine enemies wow what [Applause] miles away from the cluster i'm being shot by like four different teams [Applause] they're being shot by someone else as well they've smoked that was me i don't know where he is he's on this rock right here jack tucked it in [Applause] he's got an aps as well so sweet i don't know where the um i'm being killed by these guys pushed over inside you [Applause] guys call back flash cannot place here yeah we're dead we're dead yeah there's a guy over here as well yeah we just got pushed by the team that's got dark matter guns yeah i could tell diamond dark matter um now you could do that i didn't know you could do that [Applause] his movements uh his cluster strike game but i mean that was true they had good movement they're not cheating but you can you get dark matter look this guy the blue guy blue guy look at his xm4 it's diamond and purple yeah you can do that oh it's plague diamond okay so is it a zombies camo then hey these guys must be just cracked out of their minds he's trying to crouch slide up a hill i don't think that works does it they just picked us off then one by one still got really unlucky with the cluster and then that was it and then it was a 43. are you from the um i still died he's taking a sniper though which i you know not advisable ah right play diamond one more time do one more yeah oh do you want to go back to rebirth first yeah there we go go on them at least your headshot people on rebirth what's pain like hate showing people just go oh no oh no oh no oh dear oh no i'll do the call of duty caldera resurgence league has to be streamed on youtube gaming so no twitch partners can be played what caldera resurgence league yeah they're doing like an official cod caldera resurgence league thing right and it's a youtube gaming official youtube gaming exclusive well that makes sense because sam they got a cdl partnership with youtube gaming they do don't they yes they do so that means all of the twitch rival lads no no no we could enter guys we could yeah we could literally no twitch twitch rival player can play it because it's against their contract isn't it check your gear and weapons we go soon [Applause] i think i really like the new rebirth now i just wish they'd done more with caldera i'm not going to are they west they're just going to wait for the next stale there they'll do more pois and stuff absolutely but we'll just have to see how it goes [Applause] yeah for the call of duty league rebirth reinforced tournament the cdr website says players have to stream to their perspective youtube no other streaming platforms listed must stream on youtube to participate so yeah that's pain then isn't it boys oh yeah so why me now are we all switching to it that's hilarious though because all these cod players they all stream on twitch well no they all switch to twitch most of the time so that they could play um twitch yeah but dude that was exclusive to youtube yeah exactly and that's going to be like that for a while i think so guys we're going to step in beam team team beam i mean [Music] straight up the left nostril let's go i'm going to drop three points codes in chat right now for xbox 2400 points going to chat right now then after this match we'll wrap up and i'll drop another two i don't know the best setup yet unleashed i'm trying to figure it out i haven't unlocked everything through it so soon let's go buy weapons resurgence will ban snipers anyway [Applause] you did something that inspired skills [Music] [Music] tomlinson will be there come on yeah he might be yeah that's fine yeah oh he's something he's wrong please i'm i'm a little bit addicted i gotta admit i want to go back it's really fun it's basically just easier to understand talk of that's it that's good that's what people want really i think easy to understand performance and not necessarily better gun play but it's alright but it's fine it's two yeah but you can't understand the gun plane tarkov it's like oh he's got he's using nine mil not seven six two so he lives yeah yeah oh you have a body armor that's too bad [Applause] yes doesn't it feel good it just feels right doesn't it baby it just feels right it's lovely weapons over that red mark great day they actually have to invite people on orange [Music] [Applause] chilling [Applause] he's got me the
