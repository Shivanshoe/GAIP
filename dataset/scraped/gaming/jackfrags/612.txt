are you ready to see the quickest solo call of duty war zone win ever in existence of ever in the whole of history ever here we go he's dead are you dead are you there why'd you put the turret up [Music] down ruined ask us here buried good night and there it is that was the fastest solo win ever in existence and that's a world record guinness book of world records just contacted me and they said jack we'll put you in for that so that's good it's a good start to the day anyway i hope you enjoyed the video guys if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe i'm just kidding it's only the start you've not gone mad it's just the start of the video it's okay so today i've got a cod warzone gameplay for you where i was playing with randoms i don't do this very often if at all so it was an interesting experience to say the least also don't know if you saw the teaser for season five yesterday they showed us some of the new operatives the shadow company guys but more exciting than that two new guns on the way confirmed and 94 i reckon that might be a strong contender with that double burst and this little smg here the apc-9 not sure where that's going to fit in warzone but could be great we will see before we get into the random match though i have to say a big thanks to today's sponsor displate a displate is a one of a kind metal poster designed to capture your unique passions or i say in my case and probably yours nerdy stuff they've got over 1.4 million designs on their website ranging from gaming to movies pop culture and more there's quite a few warzone and battlefield inspired designs on there too but these are some of my favorites that i picked out attaching them to a wall is nice and simple if you're terrible at diy like i am no worries you don't need a drill these are magnet mounted so you can rearrange and switch them out easy peasy even get them with a frame too if you're a bit fancy and if you're interested in checking out display for yourself my link is down in the description below and if you use that you'll get a cheeky 30 discount right then queueing up for a match of warzone with two randoms i haven't edited this one as much because i did see a lot of people in the comments asking if they could see longer games where there weren't as many cuts so that's what i've done for this video if you do like that style let me know in the comments below and leave a like i think it's a really entertaining match and i hope you guys enjoy this well i don't know if these guys have got microphones and i don't want to be the first one to talk so let's see how this goes where should we drop it's going to be a westerly circle i feel like a weatherman it's going to end up around here or boneyard maybe i reckon shall we go where's that where are you more yeah that's cool i'm going to go down all right cool you guys got mics [Music] i don't think they have mics hey this is gonna be fun it's like one of the first times that i'm playing with randoms i don't do it that often but we're gonna have a good time aren't we we've got the clermonator 70 200 and blade phantom zero eight oh no blade fountain did you just what happened you didn't pop your [ __ ] okay right so clemente is on their own for a second i think they just forgot about their parachute maybe it's all right uh this is not the start that i envisioned or wanted but i'm okay with it there's a bit of cash here what is that chopper doing don't die guys i'm i'm not there i'm coming oh this helicopter is uh having a good meme i'll come over here and i'll throw a semtex on you got him get the finish come here oh we'll play clementer good it's okay it's a great start it's a brilliant start is this still enemy here they just uh drop down off the dam i think i'm out of ammo oh they're hunting ghosts i say can you even get up around here well i'm screwed i may be up here and the ladder i need some ar ammo i've got nothing there any more enemies i don't see anyone all right give me that did you kill everyone [Laughter] i'm in a weird mood i've got no armor plates either ow oh got a guy over there to the west helicopter's gone up to the right you're gonna push in well i am screwed now but it is what it is and enemy dropping in one guy getting a bit closer here i've just got a bank on the fact that they run past and i kill him one of the guys is left he's right up there i don't know what he's firing at let's have a look i can't see him anymore i don't know but clementer he's dropped him teammate has failed they're returning to base multiple people here hopefully they don't have a heartbeat sensor i think they do is that stun a grenade maybe they're just losing let's have a look and that my friends is a team wife but there's another squad was that some other guy oh man i orchestrated that so perfectly but there was another squad lemonade dude if i win this gulag i'll get some cash i'll get you back in the game i promise i can't let him down now i've got to win i've got to get this stub uh if i had armor plates then i could have got in cover and beat that guy i think here we go get ready who's gonna win this one oh right what do we have dragon off oh i hate this thing so facing this way so they might just run this way no there i'll chill here for a sec yes got the head shot oh right clemente that's step one now i've just got to get money get you back in the game i just unlocked the 15 round max for the dragon off what a great day this is oh dude i mean i could do the bi thing there's not really many scouts there's one to the north but i don't fancy that let's have a go at this time pb19 that's a nice bruin really 500 years someone dropped in apparently what why would you how i don't think i can finish this guy off can i unless he drops down i don't know whatever you stay up there mate have a great time okay let's go i think oh was that was that your teammate coming back to revive you what is going on i need a grenade [Applause] oh come on dude this guy's a ghost i'm going to reload inside yo that guy just slid away like a slug what the hell was that time is up oh i've run out of time i'm sorry oh that was my that was my shot right i need uh something's going down here there's one there oh it's gonna take me so far away though isn't it could you salute this location let's move there's a load out there oh people were just fighting there that is literally right in the middle of that circle could be luke yeah there's a lot here and plates guys remember plates they're fun aren't they i like that he stuck around though i appreciate the fact that you've stayed there but i appreciate the fact that you've stayed in the game i will try and get you back this guy's probably not even there just like to turn off his tv going downstairs to make a coffee or something i don't know if i let him down i don't know if i'll be able to live with myself i do wonder why people who queue up by themselves in uh like trios and quads or duos don't really use mics i get it maybe if you're playing on your own you could be a bit shy or perhaps you don't even have a mic but i mean i have done it a couple times before playing with randoms and there's only one occasion i can remember where the other people had microphones and were willing to talk but it's weird i just have a lot of friends who whenever we play together we we talk all the time we communicate we call out things but when you play on your own like this in random squads it's a completely different experience really anyways if i die now i'm gonna be so angry please not like this terminator you're back in the game my friend do you want to drop on the loadout yeah i've got time uh rummage still there we go good job right we're back in the game i can drop you a couple of plates come in here if you want come here dude come here plates hey dude got plates here if you wanna clem no okay right i don't even know if he's probably not even got voice comes turned on i'm just talking to myself at this point arno it is what it is i wish that you could see how many plates other people in your team have surely that should be a thing right just a little plate symbol and then a number above their name on the bottom left like here just a little cute little plate with the number like x0 or x5 whatever it might be also if i could see if they had a satchel and a gas mask they could just do like really tiny symbols couldn't they that'd be fine i'm just gonna follow clementer see where they go at the moment it looks like they're just playing the gas which i'm totally fine with i didn't see what loadout they've got he's got a heartbeat sensor rpg where is that from on top of a train did he kill that guy down pick that up afterwards right he marked that so this is what's weird about this to me if i was playing with the with friends the comms would be popping off right now there's a guy here there's a guy there you can push have you seen another one i'm gonna assume that's enough he's moving up sir we'll follow clemente is now the clan leader [Applause] you want to go through no he wants to go around playing it safe just one dude could do with a couple of spare plates although i think he's quite low on plates as well you know i'm going to take the semtex kind of prefer in squads in solos i like c4 i can get shot in the back on i buy this dude on the roof could swing to the shop and here's where i should have kept the c4 [Music] oh nice shot that's probably the guy from before do you want to go to the shop over here and get some plates oh oh he's down he's dead that's not good oh all right i'm dipping i got a nice shot on him damn it multiple hostiles here i think all right one more maybe ah fair play we've got the foul rest yeah the foul is so broken it's gonna get nerfed next week watch okay well there it is guys we didn't win with randoms but i think we definitely had foot that's the most important thing if you liked it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
