guys it's the weekend and you know what that means it's bf4 sniper time baby that's not a thing i literally just made that up i wanted to get you excited for the video right it's the intro hook so i can get you involved but we're playing some bf4 today and i wanted to do a bit of sniping on hardcore mode and i'm using the srr now i've got the srr because it should be a one-hit kill to the chest in hardcore mode and this is a pretty full server right now so i'm looking to put some numbers on the board and also look at it i think the srr is based off the chaitak which is also the intervention in modern warfare 2. please correct me if i'm wrong i might be wrong i'm probably wrong seeing as this year's call of duty is supposed to be a remake or a successor to modern warfare 2. i thought you know what let's whack this bad boy out and see if we can get some shots now this is operation firestorm in it i'm the squad leader wait wait wait wait wait i didn't even i'm in a squad on my own guys pain i'll join charlie with rainbow dash syndicate then why though and doom 009 let's go babies let's go right i feel like a true battlefield veteran now i'm gonna put a cheeky spawn beaker down here and i want to try and get up that tower look there's already a man doing it and get right to the top i've got a squad mate up there i can become the ultimate sniper i've not even fired a bullet yet i'm gone i can't dice i wanted to jump i wanted to jump on that did i see some movement do you there i do have ranging on this i'll do 200 meters little guy there a bit too high there got him headshot as well nice right here popping out the you cap i don't think so buddy hello goodbye goodbye oh man it's so satisfying just domi people in one hit okay dice please i just can't believe you can't fall over those and i'm stuck okay we'll go this way look at these squad mates up here they're the true the true bf4 snipers right there look at that insane hello i'm not gonna miss that one hello i think i've got behind him here another one there oh god where's that from does that come from the top of the crane the crane's coming down isn't it oh man let's move oh i see him i see him here ah good shot look where i'm at right now kind of behind everyone hello i think maybe if i climb up there that could be a really good spot they wouldn't expect me here would they how is it just a yeah it's just a big ladder that goes all the way up okay here we go the climb hopefully no one sees me i don't think there's anyone looking at me now because there's no kill cam in hardcore mode i should be pretty safe up here right who can we see i hear someone i climbing there's someone coming you coming up oh he's destroying my spawn beacon whoa where'd the body go he just flew out into space enemy spotted 200 meters missed tagged him that's not always a one-shot kill is it maybe the m98 b's to play i don't know but this looks so cool i just have to keep using it what's this guy doing what are we doing here what are you shooting at what is it what do you see [Music] yes i do have c4 be quite difficult to get close to it unless i was coming over here go get him tank yes kill oh no i'm being suppressed please dice please think about the children okay good good helicopter oh just got taken out what's that that's the attacking someone parachuted out of that didn't they are they dead maybe they're dead no it was you wasn't it i know your game suddenly i saw you parachuting out that helicopter try and get this running shot tagged [Applause] did a warthog just flying to me what just happened then was it a jade um who knows okay we'll try again let's have a look towards d 300 meters a little bit higher else gone there two engineers one down there's another one about there right i think get a quick reload in see if we can take them out there's always snipers at d look guaranteed right there a little bit lower i think you saw me come on let's go snipe off i'm gonna move get a different angle still looking at me he's gonna expect me to go down there i'm gonna peek here i think i've got one chance of this let's see got him oh twickerson enjoyed that we're losing see might be more here no just the one just the one cz 75 battle pack is someone that's a ucav isn't it that's mine for again i wonder if that's the same guy is it no hold basher what a name oh god someone's shooting at me nope we're in i'm safe i'm suppressed now can't shoot when you suppress really what the that's an enemy engineer they just tried to come at us on a quad bike really can i finally go up here i'll probably get instantly sniped the second to get to the top but it's worth a shot isn't it i'm definitely gonna get sniped now though also look at me hey it's me climbing please don't shoot thank you love you oh that jet is that an enemy sniper up there isn't it that one yes see our zero to 500 accidentally there so i had to aim a bit lower than i'd actually compensated for that makes sense oh no wow that was lucky i believe they didn't see me maybe they were just aiming again with their scope you see me yeah you did i'm getting so lucky around these rocks there i'm going to try and push into b [Music] who's that spawn beacon well i was trying to push to be but we're losing c now there's people here somewhere but this point is such a maze it's really difficult to find anyone they're all friendlies on the right i guess they can just be hiding can't they here somewhere i see someone then i'm not sure here's boom beacon maybe let's see dude why didn't you react to me is that the squad dead that may have been them it might just have been those two okay okay we'll try b again we won't happen but we're losing it again get up on the roof we're good i think we're looking good and i can count from here as well apparently i'm surprised i've not been team killed yet which is really good i think a lot of the trolls have just left the hardcore game modes now bf4 is quite an old game now of course so i've just moved on to other things cheeky little flank here love this let's get involved i did see someone run in there have they realized that their teammate died though and that sounds like an enemy tank there's the teammate i could get behind this come on it's embarrassing pick it up pick it up pick it up god one two three that'll do it i think sayonara [Laughter] oh that never gets old man destroying attack gun chip there's a gun chip on this what i want that okie dokie that controls looking good that isn't looking good though not while we're on the objective here i'd like to have a go in the gun ship on hardcore mode it might be good someone just blew the hell out of that tower it's a friendly movie could never ride those in this game you could do that in bf3 you could have a friend put a mav down well no you can actually do it yourself you just put an mav down on the floor and then jump on top of it and then you could fly up on the mavs little elevator i'm pretty sure battlefield friends did an episode about it where'd you go it's two there oh goodbye oh that was a good one i enjoyed that one they're just trying to clear out all these recons up here oh there is someone there look how far away that's the guy that's been launching the ucas okay here we go let's dial this one in 200 aim a bit high got him one here same spot got him third guy yes stand still i should have waited until he stood still before i fired that first shot oh my god i'm flying hello what are we doing here team what are we doing that's a tank god oh i just ran out [Music] you seriously just ditched that tank well i'll take it then fine yeah you can't do third person in hardcore mode can you got 810 going down there that's sick okay where was that guy i was sniping i've been shot in the back cool all right lots of dip on it there probably gonna die here but try and get the tank away at least hello enemies here keep your head down son oh god he's not going to kill me i think he's soft on me there man these tanks are awesome aren't they bf4 so good i'm going down but i don't care it is what it is i still run there the you calves i think that's a friendly one is any you can't really friendly at the end of the day i'm not sure i think i've killed most people at this d point haven't i in this match okay around heavily suppressed they're gonna move god yeah dmr's are really strong and hardcore oh that was lucky i was suppressed then i didn't think i was gonna get the kill to be honest there is a shot there thank you damn it's good it is real good isn't it okay i know i'm still awaiting really bad here okay i'm gonna get off then yep they're not happy with me being there you're not happy with me being there either i just fell over almost [Applause] okay time to move what did they say i'd like to talk to you about your extended car warranty that's the name isn't it come on come on i know you're there but you know this time two three it's worth it for the tank kill totally worth it you're flying again oh my god i think you overshot that one buddy they're out straight away they're dead i think someone nope not today [Applause] all snipers here give me the tags thank you very much don't do it from the front because you might get counter knifed and that sucks good job boys we got it that dog tag was like a oh he's teabagging there's some kind of score that's been settled there let me tell you rainbow dash settled the score on top of the hill gg right there it is good game man i mean hardcore it's a bit punishing but once you get those snipes stalled in so much fun but thank you for watching guys i hope you enjoyed this if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see
