hey guys hope you're all doing well today i've got a bit of a live commentary for you and we're going to be talking about cheating on console or when using a controller on various multiplayer pvp games like call of duty warzone rainbow six siege apex and pubg i thought this was a really interesting topic and i think that prior to today when i've actually done a bit of research into this i was quite ignorant to exactly what's going on here and i've seen people mention it in comments before on reddit on twitter every now and again it always crops up about these devices that you can get the plug into your controller on your xbox or your playstation and what they do is they can be configured in such a way that you apply anti-recall scripts or you can have enhanced aim assist for example you can have rapid fire you can just hold a button hold the trigger and it will fire as fast as it possibly can so i did a bit of looking into this today and i found a few things that i wanted to discuss so these devices you can buy them in superstores electronic stores you can get them on amazon although from what i discovered today there's like a big back order for some of these so obviously there's a big demand for them and i don't know whether the lack of product is because the companies selling them just don't have enough production power and they just take a while to make these things or is it just that that many people want to buy them and use them they can't keep up with the demand and in the past i've kind of brushed this off as oh not many people use these and that still might be the case but i pondered the question can something like this ever be detected now on console you're never going to get like a full-on snappy aimbot you know like you see how pc plays through a war zone where they will just snap to targets dead dead dead 360s aiming in the sky aiming in the ground kills left right and center right like rage hackers is what they're typically known as and also you're not gonna ever get wall hacks on a console because you can't get access to the game code in the same way that you can when it's running on a pc it's all locked down on the consoles but what you can do using these devices is essentially build macros up for your controller that are applied to your controller and then sent as instructions to your console so you can have things like this this is a video that i found by a guy called ek1 gaming and he'd done a demonstration here of i think this is the division or the division two where he's showing what the game looks like without the anti-recoil script on this device and as you can see looks like there's a lot of recoil there and then he turns it on and it's just headshot after head shot after headshot and my understanding is what's happening here is you've loaded in a profile into this device and it's simulating the perfect anti-recoil control to what the game is doing so you can go into this device you can load a profile that people have made on the internet where it has certain values in because it knows the recall of x weapon in this case it's an ak or something they know the recall roughly where it goes it may have some randomness to it but let's say it has a recoil pattern that it follows a lot of fps games third-person shooters do that and then it perfectly instructs the controller to counter that in a way that you couldn't humanly do it so you get this kind of effect here where all the bullets are just going in the same place and looking at that i found this today that's pretty extreme imagine that on warzone or apex or siege pubg games where there's typically a lot of recoil in warzone on some of the guns yeah like the amax like the org for example and you can imagine a world where that is incredibly unfair and i'm not talking about pc versus console here it's nothing to do with that at all let's say you're just playing a console game that doesn't have cross-play whatever and you're coming up against someone who's doing this obviously there's a massive advantage there it doesn't seem fair now does it and i have seen other videos today on modern warfare where the aim assist appears to be greater it almost looks like it extends the bubble in which it can lock on and yeah it's not altering the game code it's doing something with the sensitivity of the controller and it looks to me like it's giving the effect of having enhanced aim assist whether that's by slowing down the sensitivity at certain moments or increasing at certain moments and obviously rapid fire stuff like that's pretty dodgy as well because humans can only click so fast right or the average human can anyway and this brings me around to detection and i tweeted this out earlier i tweeted out that little clip that i was showing you of the division from that ek one gaming guy and i asked the question to developers other people chimed in of course as well because there'll be loads of people out there who just have more knowledge on this subject than i do and i asked the question is it possible to detect these kind of devices for xbox and playstation and for the most part the answer was no but apparently some game companies have acknowledged the existence of these things and said they're looking into ways to detect them respawn who make apex they're one of those companies but from the replies that i read the issue here is that what this device is doing is simply mimicking a human using the controller so when that is sent to the console that's all the console reads console just reads there's a person using a controller here and doesn't see anything strange about it i don't know if that's 100 true and from my knowledge of programming and development there could be some form of encryption that you could put on the controller so when that signal gets sent through the console knows okay this isn't legit and doesn't allow you to use that controller that could be a possibility if people like sony microsoft cared enough about this stuff if it was a big enough deal but another problem with this is that there's a lot of people out there who can't use a normal controller whether that's for a disability or accessibility reasons whatever it might be and they need that open source platform i suppose to be able to play games and that's a good thing right i did wonder if the console manufacturers or the game developers could form some kind of statistics based analysis on people using controller and by looking at that data they could see okay well this guy is definitely using one of these things with no recall because they've just fired four magazines from a p90 and this is the bullet spread that they got obviously that's not humanly possible to do that maybe flag their account review it potentially something like that but that would be a ton of effort and there's potential that you could get some false flags with it too ultimately in terms of detection though i think the responsibility lies with the hardware manufacturers and there's got to be people out there way way way smarter than i am who've got a solution and maybe it's just not yet been implemented so this kind of thing could be devastating in a game like warzone where if you're playing on controller let's say you've turned off crossplay you're just against other console players you've already got aim assist on the controller and now you've got no recall as well you're going to win 99 of those gun fights if you're not playing stupid right because especially if you're already a good player on controller you get this too and that advantage starts to increase exponentially so there it is if you've got any knowledge on the subject or you know any other developers that have actually acknowledged this and said hey we're trying to stop this or looking at ways to detect it let me know down below because i'd like to learn more about this because when i sent out that tweet there was so many people who were convinced that in their games of apex and warzone and pubg people are using these things and in some circumstances that could be true right i mean they're sold out they're on back order for months and months so people are using these it looks like they're easy to set up as well with an app and you can have all sorts of different profiles on them i watched a video tutorial where a guy was like okay so you can set which loadout you want for warzone so let's say i have a loadout where i've got an m4 but earlier in the game i'm looting up i pick up a ground loop growl or something so i can just click a button on the device or the app and say okay switch this to no recall for the growl and it will go to that profile then you get your loadout you pick up your m4 switch the m4 profile it's that advanced that it can do that kind of stuff and a lot of people on that tweet were really vocal about this how widespread the problem is i don't know for sure i don't know anyone that knows for sure probably the people that sell these devices because they can look at the numbers and go okay but we've sold this many so at least that many people are using them but perhaps the console manufacturers could look into this a bit further for the sake of fair play right because at the end of the day most people we just want to play an online game whether it's pvp pvp whatever it is and we want it to be a fair experience and that's it let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this if you did leave a like
