but once in my life i am speechless yesterday modern warfare and warzone released a new pistol called the psycho look at it it's crazy i don't know what's going on here apparently this has been in the game for months and months and months you just couldn't use it in multiplayer or warzone and you can unlock and then kimbop for it the time to kill when you've got two of them if you hit just body shots is about 210 milliseconds that is half of the ffar uh i just look guys why i don't understand apparently jay god true game data exclusive ace they looked at the stats for this months ago they broke it all down they went yeah this is broken this is gonna be overpowered you don't even need overkill because it's a pistol right so you can take it in your pistol slot you get your ghost class straight away look at the time to kill what this is not what this game needs i feel like infinity ward and raven they've just probably an apt word to be honest they've gone nuclear right a war zone is changing next week new map revamp whatever it is so at the moment there's nukes in the sky every round there's rockets flying everywhere there's zombies there's these weird contamination areas where if you dine them you turn into zombies like a halloween event so i think they've just gone you know what for this last week just screw it we're gonna put this ridiculous gun in the game because it is ridiculous i don't understand like i don't think any one has looked at the stats on paper before releasing this and gone yeah that seems fair and balanced yeah yeah we'll go with that it's i don't understand it runs smg ammo so you do kind of burn through your ammo a lot but you can get smg ammo really easily i mean when you run into a house now on the dance or on rebirth this is all you're gonna this is it you're instantly dead you can't push buildings so all the game is gonna be is chaos some people enjoy that that's fine or in like really competitive sweaty lobbies it's going to be people just camping on roofs avoiding fights in buildings that are close range like this it's worse than the doof doof that's how fast this will kill you i never thought i never thought this was come on fight look it's insane absolute madness i don't believe it now in my opinion the right thing to do is you address this today not next week not in a couple weeks when the new maps out and this is still a problem you address this today and tweak the stats do a hotfix just something because this gun is not difficult to unlock it's not difficult to level up and get the akimbo perk you can make the meta build for it pretty quickly already in the games that i played this morning everyone's running it and it's painful yes it's fun to use obviously i've enjoyed my time this morning running around destroying everyone with these things but it isn't conducive to a fair and balanced gameplay experience is it when you've got a gun like this that everyone will just take and can just instantly delete people and instantly delete you it's gonna cause way more frustration than fun isn't it let's be real you're gonna be sick of it within a day i guarantee if you play warzone still play it regularly you're gonna be sick of this within a day that's how it's going down and this has happened way too many times with warzone way way way way way too many times i've said this in the past but please be more careful when introducing new weapons and balancing things you could argue well it's useless at long range but look at the map design look at how easy it is to push people with stun grenades and air strikes something like this just doesn't make sense to me but there it is raven please fix hope you enjoyed the video guys let me know your thoughts down below if you liked it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one you
