hi guys hope you're all well today we are playing warzone with the an-94 i bet you didn't expect to see this one did you so when the air 94 released it wasn't very good in warzone it was really good in multiplayer but it didn't quite cut it for battle royale but since then there's been a few balance changes things have been tweaked knobs have been dialed up and dialed down and with the nerf of the dmr the a94 is really competitive in the current meta so i thought that i'd make a build this is the one that i'm using today worked out really well for me and the recoil is super easy to control because you get that slower rate of fire in the fully automatic mode i'm not really sure that the two burst will work very well in warzone unless i can figure out some kind of trick to it but the fully auto mode is brilliant i was pairing it with the cold war ak-74u as my smg as a secondary so when i'm pushing up close i'm going to switch to that get that extra mobility pretty good for that kind of thing i probably will do a separate video on the ak74 because i really like this gun and i think it has a place in warzone right now but that's something that's coming up in the future with that said today we've got two matches for you both really high kills and some difficult situations that we got into plenty of great teamwork though plenty of movement and in the second match right at the end the train is involved and that doesn't usually happen in warzone but because of where the circle was the train ended up coming into play and it made for a really exciting finale no spoilers though so playing here today with study and westy go check them out great teammates and they both make excellent content with that said if you enjoyed the video guys leave a like and as always thank you to all these guys using my creator code in the cod store if you use it tweet me a pic and i'll put you in a video like this one so i think you'll find these matches really entertaining let's get
