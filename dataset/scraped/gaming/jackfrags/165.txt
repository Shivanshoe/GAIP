okay we're with you high ground entry team high ground has eyes on armed suspects on the second floor side one guest rooms okay so i should have options for this breach shotgun flashbang shotgun bang and clear all right copy that so i just want to put this out there guys i'm going lethal here we're not doing any less than lethal not taking any prisoners be advised let me see those ants [ __ ] i

you creep just chill you guys look like you want to go in there sir hands up drop your knees down on the ground sir please hands up okay get down civilian is doa you guys already dead are those handcuffs i'm gonna try and clear this entire floor first now this is very reminiscent of swap so there could be traps on these doors and luckily i've got a little mirror camera i can use to check for traps i don't see any there so we're going to open this up another door here a bit risky that but i thought seeing as there was no trap on that one we'd be okay there get my squad to fall in on me cover this area all right copy that and we'll get them to check the door mirror for contact copy there this looks like a construction area or something mirror gun is ready boss check it out what do you say it's clean boss i don't see a thing let's open up there we go another door on the left hey hands up do it down down on your knees i just want to go he'll be out home in a second buddy got another door here i'll check it mirror blocked why is it blocked i don't like that okay well we'll breach it then c2 blow that door clear it copy that i don't like the fact that it's blocked that could mean there's a trap there one person unarmed fire in the hole what's up now [Music] get down and show me your hands get down and put your hands up hey hands up over here this is protocol looks like a dead end behind me as well which is good let go of me just let go civilian cuffed and ready for trailers that section is clear got another door here hands up above your head this is talk copy that entry team you did your best proceed with mission i don't like this i'm over here hands up above your head there's some stairs there put your hands up stay still i don't want to go the stairs just yet i'm going to make sure the floor is clear first civilians standing by for trailers in these games let me go stay on me i think i hear someone through there there's definitely some movement

control my mom has a mexican maid you might know her that's fake breach shotgun flashbang use a shotgun on the door knock him down [Music] one suspicious store here should we check it open the door

mission god this is getting more suspicious move in and clear it i think that's just an alternative route yep good okay so this section i think is clear now moving up [Music] so i'm gonna head back out into the main hallway and we'll just check the other side mirror for contacts come on guys i hear footsteps again on me your gun ready i just canceled that didn't i mirror for contacts affirmative i have a feeling there's a trap there i don't know why looks safe to me nobody inside oh it's locked definitely someone on the right in that room there's a corridor here oh man this is a maze what right we'll go do this door first okay there's someone in here for sure i'm gonna breach this c2 stinging clear roger that i think a stinger is a stun grenade hopefully there's not an explosive here i want to get my whole team killed fire in the hole do it oh my god that dude just rushed me i've been hitting the right arm oh no we've got a dead suspect here talk to him drop yourself you did your

before we go oh my god what is this place let's stick out oh thank you good idea breach again c2 judge the door i think clear was stopped on and now just gonna check oh there's a civilian in there let's knock this door down hopefully this connects through oh god i should have checked that one officer down notified trailers oh no roger entry team notifying medical it's just me the suspect is
