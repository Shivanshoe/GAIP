hi everyone and welcome back to battlefield 2042 today we're going to be playing some rush in portal really big fan of brush in 2042 i'm glad that they decided to put that game mode in the game so we'll be hopping on playing that for maybe an hour or two and then switching over to some breakthrough after that potentially i thank you very much guys for coming along to the stream if you're watching this as a video welcome as well if you enjoyed the stream or the video do hit that like button below thank you that's a great way to help support me and also have to say a big thanks to the epic game store for sponsoring this stream and video today they've still got their holiday sale going on right now got some big discounts on various games on the store and also if you buy any game that's over 14.99 you can get a 10 coupon and save yourself some cash so if there's any games that you haven't picked up yet do consider heading over there link is down in the description below and if you do pick anything up use my code jackfrags in the checkout process and i'll get a bit of kickback from that so with that said before we get started today i wanted to take a look at this so this image here is what dice and battlefield released for the season pass or the battle pass as they've called it here for 2042 now we still don't know believe it or not we still don't know any more information officially then what is on this image i think maybe they mentioned new locations somewhere else but i think this raises a few interesting questions because the fact that they've put this out there already this was part of the pre-order bonus i think for the ultimate edition please correct me if i'm wrong but we know that the year one pass for the game will have four new specialists it will have four battle passes and that's like that's all that we know and new locations as i just mentioned um so with it being four battle passes i think it's logical to assume that each season will last for three months right four passes four new specialists no idea what they will be you guys got any ideas how they'll actually implement new specialists into the game what will their abilities be what new guns will they add but the reason i'm talking about this is because i think maybe maybe this will change slightly so legally they have to deliver what's in this image right but based on the reaction to the game obviously when it launched it was quite buggy been a couple patches since then but a few people have changed as well at daisemier and uh i do wonder what will happen like will they actually well they have to stick to this plan to some extent but will they add more content than this will they just stick to the plan and just do the first year and then that's it for the game will they do a complete 180 and flip things around i don't know it's really interesting dice i think have been on holiday as well obviously over christmas everyone's on their holiday break but i think next week they might be back so there might be some kind of announcement in the next couple weeks about the future of the game what's going on here i'll keep an eye on it anyway i'll keep you guys in the loop um looking at it and we'll see what happens with it let me know your thoughts in the chat and in the comments below what do you guys think is going to happen i hope you've all had a great weekend happy new year again it's the second today isn't it i think we can still say happy new year on the second right that counts i've had a busy day i've been out and about today went to see my uh my mom my dad my grandma lots of driving so i'm a little bit tired but uh i'm looking forward to playing some brush as i said and yeah i hope you guys are doing well brock thank you very much for the 10. morgan speak thank you for becoming a member morgan you're the best thank you rambi i wouldn't be surprised if they delivered this quite early and then come up with some extra content for the second half of the year that's interesting randby hey nico you're level 22 congrats performance update tactical tricks i think that would be welcomed wouldn't it i think a performance update or a patch would be really big deal for the game frozen tv dinner i need your help i'm hungry and i don't know what to eat well i wouldn't advise a frozen tv dinner just get yourself um get yourself a nice take out you know treat yourself why not start of the year start off strong with some decent food get your favorite take out captain darkness no i haven't tried the gv2 yet get a repair tool kill please that's that must be really difficult that must be really really difficult hey stormy what's up chudara liam hello manish from australia william mcgee what's up hey putin samir what's up nathan hey val get ramen good suggestion what's up from nairobi rodney how you doing happy happening here at circ does my granny watch my vids no i don't think she does brendan she doesn't really watch youtube at all so i think she'd be quite confused about what's going on she knows what i do but no she doesn't really watch she's a legend hello king james what's up good luck finding a server i never have any problems finding a server called azmoo hey marco what's up guillaume pizza cane repair tool kill you'll have to remind me i'll try i don't think i played rush that much on renewal oh i have actually it's quite difficult isn't it when you get to this bit over the wall because the points are like here and here and they just camp what should i play tonight guys shall i play smg assault rifle lmg i've you know i've never really used the dmrs but they're kind of bad so i could do some sniping shotgun did i ever get the decent shells for this now i still need a few more kills for that uh gilliam thank you for becoming a member and oliver thank you for the four months granny's a legend yes they are and they also knit shreddies if you live in the k in the in the cave do do you live in the cave if you live in the uk you probably know what shreddies are apparently granny's knit them auto shotty i saw that stud did a video where he used the the 12m this bad boy here and i think he put the was it that scope the tv2x oh gg good game i guess i didn't even get to the match svk yeah it's still a two-shot kill isn't it these moments when they come that's it i'm ready for run too okay what's next i can't hear what he said i'm out of 10 great what a game guys can we just get some ggs in the chat please for that game wow what a match incredible toby jack can we have another verse of the venom song you're rising no toby that was just for tomographic you're currently playing hell let loose and using the shotty you know i've not used the shotgun they just added it didn't they tell that loose start was swapping between scopes i see lots of nice ggs there guys you're the best i think it was this one he had then he would switch it like that short barrel rate of fire effective range i wonder how much that nerfs the range because this suppressor actually works so is it gonna be just devastating let's pour on this hovercraft oh my god [Music] maybe not the best idea i'm on fire what the hell is the objective really up here that's not a great spot for it is it oh we got it maybe i should play someone apart from sundance today seeing as i always play sundance whoa the shotgun is nuts in hell let loose i gotta try it like last two times that i played i was sniping is it playable on a 1070 in a 7700k yeah slim you can play this game on that kind of system i don't think you'll get a good frame rate though you've got to kind of brute force it if you want good frames in this game oh no we didn't get the kill love your views with tomographic it's clear you're both having a ball yeah me and me and thomas have a laugh you know i think our personalities just work really well together i don't know what it is i mean we're from like a similar part of the world as well i'm defending aren't i i actually increases the vertical recoil quite a lot you know having that suppressor on it feels like it does at least i've not played any games today so if i'm a bit rusty i do apologize first game is always hitting this where did it come from they're over there man you know the range on it's really good isn't it guys the range is nuts on this and i've used it before but not really with a long scope like that that guy is really angry in the chat i think he was chasing me there ps5 only failed let loose it's on pc as well i i love hella loose i think it's a great game uh fabrizo i get 1790 fps on mid graphics with a 9 600 kf and a 16 1660 s thanks for the key oh fabrizio did you get one of the keys in chat over the last few weeks say hello mohammed let's go jack rack them up i feel like they've got us really pinned in here this is an auto dmr the range is nuts i've noticed there's a lot of people that are actually over level 100 now what level am i 76 i still got 24 levels to go man i'm slacking i love this area the canada dry hands canada dries ginger beer isn't it i had a doubt in my mind never had a doubt in my mind enjoy these moments when they come animus love your new hundred thank you man have i seen clownfield yeah i have yeah the hunt vid i had a lot of fun making that i want to attack i don't want to defend i think it's more fun to watch as well isn't it attacking than defending unless you're sniping and just getting some crazy headshots or something yeah the hunt showdown bid was good a lot of people reached out to me and said they enjoyed it you know in the comments and also on twitter email i tried to take a more educational approach as i mentioned a couple videos back i'm going to be doing more of that okay we're attacking now i think yeah there you go eat my grenade pushing the enemy back hey you can't spawn the tanks in rush can you you bought hunt after my vid a few people actually said that you know i think because it's like it's quite a complicated game isn't it really like when you break it all down it is quite complex and i think when a lot of people see it and they watch it on youtube on twitch and they just go okay cool yeah that looks interesting graphics are nice but they don't really understand it they don't really get what you actually have to do and how it works and the fact that it's like permadeath you know so hopefully me um you know explaining in that video how it works is useful what about sundance girl i'm just trying to be a nuisance with this tank here i don't see anything not what i expected i'll shoot all the time girls don't you worry difficult to see in this thing didn't it be great if i had a engineer repairing me happy new year thingy you stream rpg games are you not into that it depends quick beam i do like rpgs but like is it i mean there isn't really a good one recently right like i did stream cyberpunk when that came out but that was like really buggy so we finished it though i think we did four parts right get some standards in there oh it's quite good isn't it oh where were you well i had teammates there repair tool uses a kinda rare jacob yeah that's because you get to pick between a repair tool or a rocket launcher or some c5 repair tools should just be default on support class specialists or they're not really classes are they but you know support specialists should just get it by default you know how like in bf5 all of the medics have syringes don't they by default you don't need to equip it why is my location been revealed is there a um [Music] there's a peak around somewhere oh my god clean up on all five please oh no i didn't get it i love running around with the repair tool i think you're you're one of few though you know not many people like doing that because it's a support role right and you're sacrificing one of those cool gadgets so that's the problem i miss classes me too crow me too and i've said it many times but i think the game you know it lost some of its identity didn't it that grenade's got to get some kills in there surely i think i got one kill but did it count who knows isaac thank you very much for the five buddy kept up with your vids over the last five years one of the best gaming youtubers i know keep up the good work more hunt showdown please of course isaac yeah i'm planning on doing more uh walter thank you for the fire why haven't you and study been playing together i think stud just prefers to play on his own especially with battlefield i don't want to i don't want to speak for him but i feel like stud's always been that way with bf and i know he's not he's not playing warzone at all so outside that area you know there'd be no chance of us playing that together me and stuff will play again at some point maybe when there's new content thank you for the 400 happy new year cheers buddy hey little cuckoo chicken what's up how you doing man you're not gonna get me without one real todd howard i will say it though spell eye cup you guys can do that for yourselves see what comes out hey see what are you doing under the stairs boris um does the stream look good by the way i i changed a few settings on my capture card should be like actual contrast now and colors don't understand why they got rid of the damage points don't i need to go up you have to like i have to redeploy and then spawn at the top rush is not the best that's cool jam and that's your opinion isn't it video games are subjective so some people like rush some people like other game modes that's fine the stream looks really lovely that's good to hear quickly no i hate fish sticks i don't really like fish in general the only fish that i like is like a a nice fresh salmon or some tuna i did actually have a swordfish steak once many many years ago i had a swordfish steak and that was really nice i enjoyed that but i only i've only ever had one oh it was a giant window hopefully i haven't been crashing anymore walter um so last stream i crashed once right and i tested a few things in my graphics card ran a few benchmarks and then there's a member in my community on discord called bsod gaming and they recommended under vaulting slightly and making a custom curve for the clocks which i've actually reduced by 500 and they explained very well how to do that um it only really happens on warzone and battlefield um so i've done that with msi afterburner i've down clocked i've undervolted so today is the first test of that and we'll see how it goes thingy cheers for the 20 man that's very kind uh drew thanks for the five what changes would i recommend for hazard zone oh i think it needs a complete overhaul i think it needs a much more interesting meta game you know where the the perks are more robust and in depth i think it needs to double the play account it needs a custom map or custom maps there needs to be less data drives so when you actually fight over them they mean something there's a there's a lot of stuff that i would change with it should be able to hear if they start diffusing oh god where'd you come from dude the crap oh no that just blew up my c5 didn't it the roof disappeared and we got it that's a nice little flank i enjoyed that uh shane if you play rush the xp is the same rush is an official game mode it's a featured game mode so you get maximum xp it's just like playing the main game [Music] it's just if you play a custom game mode that you won't get the full xp it's capped i mean i put the scope on but i'm not using it do i need do i even need to use it probably not austin what's my main game right now i don't really have one austin to be honest with you i play all sorts of games luciano cheers for the five brazil thanks from brazil man i think maybe they should make hatterstone freeze to play as well just give it you know it could be like a little drip feed into the main game once they've done an overhaul of it because if they made it free to play in its current state i don't think anyone would care it would just be like whatever okay how did you not die hey oliver avery finally found you live oliver thank you for coming what about gun ranking yeah it's the same i think mobos have i tried tdm yeah it's not great i i don't think the maps work that great for tdm there's only a few man how are we going to get this we don't have any tickets do we four tickets there's nowhere unless three tickets what's up sam hey albert lots of love all the way from africa thank you albert what's up gabby good to see you again i really like the hunt showdown bid from yesterday it finally makes sense to me yeah i mean that was my intent with the video you know now people can watch that and understand it you know it can be a beginner's guide for people who don't watch my channel they might stumble across the video and be like okay cool i get it now or people who watch my hunt videos sorry if they see that they might understand a bit better now have more context this is just how it works don't be sad this is just how it works sometimes sometimes out sometimes works out sometimes you know uh your boy's sad yeah that's the way i use it dude that's the way i've got the m5 built do i have any plans on joining the audiobook business you got the voice for it now i don't think so robin it's not for me it's not for me ar guns are op a guns op what do we in this game like the wildcat jesus raised dr disrespect watches your videos on stream he wants to dial you by the flip phone hey jesus he's welcome to do that you know i mean if he wants to follow me on twitter and send me a dm i'd happily enter the stadium play some rounds of hunt warzone battlefield whatever he wanted any future games coming i was looking at this earlier death bruce like january february march um there's a few i mean god of war pcs coming out uncharted pcs coming out horizon is it forbidden west or something it's called that's coming out um elden ring in february dying light two stalker two there's a couple others that i just missed i just can't think of them so there's quite a few games coming out in june to march first quarter of the year looking forward to strictly gaming thank you for the 20. one day i would love to chat with you about 2042 in direction community feedback etc love the game not perfect but cool gameplay is great in my opinion but sure strictly yeah thank you uh shelby cheers for the tent from colorado dennis stonehouse what's up nasha have you watched the dr disrespect video last week calling you out no i haven't what did he do why would he call me out did he watch uh was it ready or not is that what he was we have to destroy watching objectives we can control the sectors and keep pushing the enemy back is can you do a video on ef2 like you did yesterday with hunts honestly i don't i don't know enough about escape from tarkov at the moment i haven't played it in a very long time so i don't think i could actually what the hell man the range on this i don't think i could actually make a video like that to be honest with you it wouldn't it wouldn't have good information in it triple that that's a cheeky triple there look at that if that guy wasn't there i was in that stadium up those stairs cragging out that's good yeah honey is good it's just uh it's not that accessible that's the main problem that hunt has but if you can get over that hurdle like it's got some of the best pvp in gaming in my opinion so you're just using like bolt action rifles mainly so the aim the movement it's so important i think we're gonna need smoke to get in here because these guys have got a nice setup unless someone just starts sniping them they're going to reach that's a bad idea where's the vehicle that's it that's what we need oh they actually armed it let's go do they work oh my god they work okay they they worked a lot better than i expected you guys see that objective what was that man that was insane that was rocket so i need to test those mad hey belfair joe what's up buddy they name more breakaway and less kaleidoscope yeah breakaway is a good map i like very quick yes they work what's up in john good sea man hey hakeem lots of cool people in discord yeah that's right if you guys become members you can join the discord go it's one of those delayed reaction vehicles i think a cryptic crow hey jack can't wait to get my channel like yours aiming for 5 000 subs this year for 2022. have a good day thank you man dude you got it you know like if you if you really put time and effort in and you're dedicated to it you can make it happen i believe in you you can do it it'll be difficult but you can do it man hello from russia what's up kitgov say something in russian the only russian words i know are naughty words so i don't i don't think i should why not divide have i how's that has it got that kind of range not really hey come on come here i want to have a word with you i run out of ammo oh god [Music] man i ran out of ammo quick then exactly valerie that's correct do you think we'll get bf4 maps in hardline oh i see do you think we'll get bf4 maps or hardline maps on portal i think bf4 maybe hardline no i can't see it happening potato skins any chance of a world war three live stream i think if i do world war three it'll be a video rather than a live stream i'd want to learn the game first before streaming it because i'd probably just get absolutely ruined the whole time and it wouldn't we wouldn't be great to watch the video afterwards i've been here from poland thank you mom this game needs a much more dark and serious tone i think that would work yeah i think there's a lot of uh contrasting things in the game that don't really work together what the hell man it's a shotgun this is going to be one of the first things that gets nerfed when they come back in the new year and do a balancing patch this will be one of the first things hear that noise it's made again that sounds like i'm just going it does doesn't it it kind of sounds like that and you run around trying to knife people knifing's kind of broken in this game it doesn't work great world war three feels a lot like home front to me dude home front man what a call back oh no he's at the top uh yvonne thank you for the five hey jack there's a battle royale called babble royale where are you dropping on a scrabble board and have to kill each other players by moving to zone what it's basically scrabble battle royale evon that's what you're saying that's insane um excellent thank you for becoming a member do you feel that the ac42 single fire is nerfable material um i don't know because you have to have a really really quick trigger finger for it to be good you have to be like stalled level of i can click this fast for it to be good so i think if dice looked at the stats maybe there's only a few people you know actually doing that on pc i don't know how usable it is on console though right like can you even do that on a trigger you do it that fast i mean i admire the dedication there what the condor a gg yeah good game though very dedicated there from that pilot jumping out and trying to diffuse the m-com it's impressive you often see that level of tenacity in the public game of battlefield yeah angel does it again that was something right no angel please do you think the first patch they're gonna have redone all the voice lines i tried super people earlier so yeah i've done a video on it the game is nuts so basically you kill people by dropping like knowledge bombs of words so like onomatopoeia is that a triple kill quad kill what are we looking at ivonne you can do that on triggers really you can pull the trigger that fast i'm just doing it with my finger now don't take that out of context i'm imagining pulling a trigger that fast i don't know maybe my fingers just aren't what they used to be you know maybe that's it just take them out i'll give people the option to turn them off jack you need to do the voice lines no i'm not i'm not a voice actor drew cheers for the 10. i think you're correct about hazard zone i wanted it to be talk of light with some investment from dice and making it harder and two new maps or something could make a comeback needs a lot of work though i think with something like that like hazard zone and they have to weigh up the options right like this goes back to what i was talking about earlier on the stream what's the plan for 2042 because if it's a complete overhaul the amount of money and time that they'd have to spend completely changing as a zone would it be worth it unless they made it a standalone thing and completely overhauled it i don't think it would no what the hell you have to consider all that like making games is expensive and it takes a very long time is no i'm going to come and defuse this [Music] shotgun that's so funny i find that hilarious i don't know why oh no it blew my c4 i find that so funny a wing suit off this not quite hey bill good evening man thank you for coming i'm dead i'm dead wee serpentine why don't the shotguns have hit markers half the time i mean the hit markers seem to work for me can hear someone here a bit too far away i think wonder boy oh you gotta cover me you gotta cover me from there come on what's going on a campaign would actually be pretty cool with this game setting a law maybe but campaigns are so expensive as well you know i i think i should focus on multiplayer for battlefield like that's what the people want like most people play the battlefield single player once and it lasts like four hours and that's it and it's like 50 of the game's budget i'm not kidding and it's a lot of developers working on single-player content that they'll play for four hours and never again when the majority of the player base is on multiplayer uh indro soto thank you for becoming a member what is the secret of your power catchy reloading you know what's fun buddy get down on some call of duty with your kid i don't have a kid catch you reloaded are you playing some card with your kid is that what you're saying we need to get the cars in don't we brennan i think the was it the creative director worked on candy crush but they also worked on battlefront and bf5 so [Music] where's the rest of my team on my squad is there even anyone else on this server oh my god this what that doesn't that's not fair it's like five people on my team team balance nice you should at least try and put us in the same squad right maybe everyone just left come and get me i don't know if i could win this one on my own it's pretty much just me and this other guy by the looks of it what graphic settings do i plan mostly lower doll um i just have texture detail and filtering on high there you go 1440p don't have dlss on either um well i mean i'm just going to leave this because i don't think we're just going to keep dying there aren't we yeah my kid he's cracked been teaching me quick scoping good for you man i'm glad that you're enjoying that let's even get a better server where's johnny he's probably looking after his kid and joe cheers for the eight months that would be cool wouldn't it hourglass we just played this improved your sniping this is a full server ovp recon drone uh someone's putting c5 on the drone yeah yeah the 12 900k is giving me like 60 70 more frames per second it's sick oh my god that didn't work so i've got no right being here and being alive right now i don't know how i was alive was it beyond next-gen gaming i miss uncle's mom me too can you show how to practice flying versus bots um well you just go into a solo game and then you spawn a helicopter and then you can just drive around fly around as much as you want i wouldn't i wouldn't advise driving around a helicopter or that's not a good idea okay take this to the objective let's go go go go getting on that objective go go oh no i'm impressed that the uh machine gun was actually working then usually it doesn't oh it just goes f off scott thanks for becoming a member hello audi um matt this gun looks like what is it sega yeah it kind of is but it's called the 12m auto in this game this one here 12m auto i've got a suppressor on it god wonder boy that tank's alive yeah it did [Music] stop screaming sundance i'm being scammed constantly by something god god nice [Music] please stop trying to kill me give me a break dudes that's horrible have i ever played ghost runner yeah i have king slayer it's cool it's cool game guys i didn't complete it though i shot guns good yeah they're really good hey albert what's up hello edward she tried the game inscription what's it about don't know i've not heard of that yeah i mean the graphics aren't very good on on low i think they're good on ultra but if you play on ultra like it you get worse fps so i don't really want that some maps look a lot better than others though like hourglass this map is the worst looking map there's barely any detail in it breakaway looks quite nice on ultra discarded renewal kaleidoscope is quite bare and barren orbital can look quite nice because there's a lot of foliage but yeah the game i mean the game doesn't look very good on on low i think some maps as well like bf5 actually look better like i think there is some maps on bfi that look a lot better than this map for example or even like sinai desert from bf1 right like that had more detail in it than this i'm so dead okay didn't kill me [Applause] have i tried the pkp b sud yeah yeah he can't be he's really good it's a bit easy though to use like i don't just want to use the easiest guns you know i'd rather have a bit of a challenge you see what i did then really basic but i just baited that guy to think that i was continuing to run so when he jumped down he was looking around here i hadn't actually moved just a little tactic you can use in fps games so he saw me here and i made i made sure that i ran like this and then i stopped so the last thing that he thought of me was my forward momentum going this way and it's such a basic thing but it catches so many people off just a little tip hopefully that makes sense to you guys uh scott thanks again uh joshua thank you for the 4.99 love the disposition you have while playing games just a great guy streaming conte great i love your stuff thank you joshua it's very kind here what are the genres of video games so i like besides fps um i like action adventure games stuff like god of war uncharted last of us jedi fallen order zelda you know resident evil um i like rpg games like mass effect i played love the original trilogy um i occasionally play games like uh dota league of legends although nowhere near as much as i used to i used to be obsessed with those kind of games mobas i don't really have time anymore though to play them because like i think if you're gonna play a moba you have to play it all the time to learn it and get good at it becoming a member would you recommend hunt showdown as a good purchase yeah i think it's a great game a dave thank you for becoming a member adam opinions on the 4570 reminds me of the martini henry is that the lever action thing [Music] i might try sniping next game i don't want to stay on this server though because it's a rotation that i've already done did i get a ps5 yeah hello victor i did i've done a few videos on ps5 games spider-man dark souls remake i still think the dark souls remake is one of the best looking games out there monster hunter i've never played that map happy new year dustin it's hard to get back into mobas because they've changed so much ah man that's a four five seventy isn't it yeah you have to play them consistently or you just forget don't you you're just like well i don't remember how to play this because there's so many heroes and they constantly add new items and abilities and they change the matter it's difficult to stay on top of it if you don't actually play it regularly i've had some great experiences on dota 2. wow that was a bad time to go up that rappel hey james what's up sean don demar welcome do i mean demon souls yeah sorry not dark souls demon souls remake got dark souls on my brain for some reason did i play a little big planet yeah back in the day not played it for ages though i didn't really play any of the sequels either just the first one [Applause] again mariah boris you must throw it away i'm sorry no i don't want to die like this please what would boris do how is the optimization not very good on this game thomas i mean you have to buy a sick pc basically if you want to get good friends in 2042. you just got to brute force it for now they're still on that crane oh well we're not doing a great job of defending are we i'm not crashed yet though which is good i think i just hit the mail there didn't i oh no no no no good boris bulldozer i'm missing a lot of shots here what's up mate you miss 99 of the shots you don't take in my case uh dice [Music] i think we need a different angle here don't we we oh that was strange do not come to me oh no enemy attack are they above they're probably above but i've got to try and defuse this [Music] if i die i die we got it stay away that's better this map is doodoo like every other map you don't like this one yogi have you watched book of boba fett yes i have i watched the first episode nothing happened really oh you know it's first episode so hopefully things start happening in the second episode fingers crossed these guys are really making it hard for me we have a tank i have a cave troll come on boys no one's using the mav [Music] oh where did that shot go now we got crushed there mp28 is good yeah it is really good side on what screen recorder do i use i use obs to record locally but at the moment i'm sending my video signal to a streaming pc with a capture card which is the elgato 4k60 pro mark ii it would be cool if you could collapse the boat you can collapse part of the boat sizer part of the boat can be collapsed did you fix the crashing issue i mean it's not crashed yet beaver not crashed yet which is good oh someone wanted to ask um if you want to play single player you just go here all out warfare come on you click change mode you click solo and co-op and then you pick a game mode and you can change if you press f you can pick what map you want and you can set how difficult the ai are the bots and then you just say conquest and click play and then it will start a server obviously i'm not going to do that but that's how you do it if you wanted to know hey scott what's happening we're good man we're just chilling what's up from denmark hips don't speak how you doing gg thomas uh dammit jared maybe maybe halo infinite stream this week as in monday to friday i'll try and fit it in somewhere there creamy i think we're good i think we're good for crashes it's gonna crash straight away isn't it so this is the same map but we're getting to play from the beginning hold and defend i wonder if it's good to snipe with a suppressor on so they don't see you on the mini map [Music] oh come on if you're interacting with it it should let you disarm it like old school multiplayer halo no a trees uh single player i need to play the campaign i haven't got a chance yet i love halo but i just haven't i haven't had an opportunity yet to do the campaign i know the guy that was coming to resume just got ruined thoughts on the v card dmr david i don't think i have a single kill with it buddy i honestly don't think i've got a single kill what's up aaron d how are you doing it's that wing dance just you passed me there [Music] sayonara stay away stay away i could hear someone's footsteps man not really the best idea is it playing that close with the sniper wing dance did i actually say wing dance i mean that's basically what that character is right a wing dance [Music] you can tell that i'm going a bit crazy do i still play sea of thieves no i haven't played it in a while last time i played it was when the pirates of the caribbean dlc came out that was pretty good i enjoyed that stay away i'm in medical aid stay away when did you get the catchphrase dice please it's a community thing it's not my catchphrase mr grievous i think dice please started back in bf3 probably and it was just from like bugs basically like there's a lot of bugs in battlefield games and people just started like saying dice please whenever there's a bug [Laughter] i mean you have to again you have to admire the tenacity you know they came in there with that that v4 jumped out and died instantly it happens to the best of us i am the terminator i'm going to dominate you with the minigun i know you're there somewhere i think they've got barely any people on their team oh no they've got a few they're missing four though come on frosty where you taking me we're going somewhere good are we staying what's going on look at all these chickens oh no technically we shouldn't have that v should we favorite battlefield of all time i think i've got the best experiences of bf2 and bf3 i mean i played 1942 a lot and then desert combat and there was nothing else like that at the time but i think bf2 really did things that no other game was doing at the time and then bf3 just the experiences with friends and messing about and all the crazy stuff you could do you know bf3's got so many iconic levels and weapons that are just good body defuse more warzone content please mate alright jamie warzone is um like i still enjoy it i think i've enjoyed playing solos the most i have to be in the mood [Music] do it elf an elf horror movie what you mean like the ones from war zone that giggles what about 1943 i didn't play it much lewin because it was only on console i've always been pc my my mine mine mine mine yeah 2142 had some good stuff as well titan mode was really good the mechs were awesome the little drones that you could have flying around with the squad leaders sup jack hi how are you interesting response coming up see what they say so fleming love your videos would love to see you play some gtfo yeah i've seen that game not played it myself though i have some friends that have played it do not allow them to succeed what do you think of the ue5 matrix demo yeah it's sick i love it i mean i don't think it's much of a game you know guys i don't mind you playing with me but if you're just gonna like jump up and down in front of me and block my views kind of there in the jeep when that bullet is literally it looks like it's going through them to be honest is there just no bullet drop on this i think i'm actually overcompensating i am i'm over compensating you literally just have to click on them and maybe not when they're running killer jamie thank you for the two how are you i'm very good man yeah i'm doing good it's interesting that if you die and get rest you can actually pick up your own ammo pouch wait isn't it yeah you literally just point and click with this thing it's pretty nuts it's probably a drop of that distance [Music] yes i love this oh you debated me mckay come on bro you're better than that oh i'm trying to kill that one because they keep rezzing each other use eight times scope that's a good idea actually maybe i should do is that the sixth time scope that i've got on there it is isn't it let's have a look yeah it is probably eight times then what's up boys it's me again are we even flanked good job hey sharks what's up milan looks like the drop is exponential rather than linear nice headshot thank you matt i kind of want them to get these i like this map 20 tickets not a headshot have i played squad yeah i have jack done a few squad videos in the past i haven't played it for a while though apparently squad hasn't had any new content for ages so it's you know maybe on a bit of a downward trend right now i don't know i presume that they're still making updates on it right they're still updating squad i just haven't seen anything new for ages with it i was sure that was a headshot then [Music] angel does it again hey david i am live for reals yes are you using anti-armor around i think i was because i switched because i ran out of ammo are you into buddhism no i'm not he's tiger 10 times slaps on this map squad is still updating but it's a special game so it's rough to get into yeah squad is um it's so hardcore and tactical you have to play it with a team and if you're a squad leader you really have to be talking to the other squad leaders and the commander and also your squad so you have to play it a lot to get used to it some of the questions that get asked in streams really always amaze me there's all sorts of questions ship i'm happy to answer you know i mean a lot of the same questions get answered when i stream i'll get asked when i stream it's fine you know not everyone can be here for every stream so many games with no crashes yes indeed b-side thank you thank you david hizzle i've not played gtfo jeez war not played it zero i was cool i couldn't say i played it um with tommo and aculi stone mountain we did a video on it super cool game i think it's quite cheap as well i don't know what their intention is on updating it i think maybe ready or not is a better version of that game though at the moment but i've not played zero hour for a while so i don't know how much they've updated it but yeah mechanically it's pretty good fun game what time do i go to sleep usually like two or three a.m something like that hot dog or burger burger every time star fox i think you've got more variety with the burger you know it's quite there's like no sun at all here is there on this map quite an ugly version ugly area of the map i'm sorry that was a dice please moment right there for sure trying to get this tank they've got other ideas for me it seems what time do i get up like 9 10 usually oh my god i'm gonna be run over marvelous since freeman's not here you have to ask a serious question bourbon or custard cream oh i'm going custard cream i think i think i'm going custard cream they call them smart grenades you're right throwing grenades wow okay i know the m5 is good is it that good maybe it is i'm trying to get around on that flank here but i'm gonna push up that was strange wasn't it there's no hit markers but we've got both kills is this is how you defend on rush play from the front yeah he had a good build on the m5 mcdonald's or burger king mcdonald's yeah it does it takes off a lot of damage dave um i think i just have the suppressor on at the moment because i was testing no i wanted a nice thumbnail that's the only reason i had it on suppressors look cool in thumbnails would i rather have a private yacht or a private jet private jet because you could go way further away quicker right my private jet might be quite expensive to run how am i how am i alive and i'm dead as i go around the corner hey matt you'd rather see a specialist wrecker yeah we talked about this before they could put some of the bad company two characters in as well if they decide that the battlefield universe is connected in that respect you could have sweet water wrecker you could have hannah from bf4 though the cannon endings that iris survives right now so it doesn't really make sense that hannah would be there but you didn't see her die technically so and now i'm on the minimap for five seconds well they've got all sorts of crazy ideas specialists [Music] i'd like to open the door please i think they're gonna have difficulty pushing this now sniped gonna chill here in this staircase it's cool that we've actually got people playing the objective here though what a treat people playing the objective in a battlefield game who'd have thought in 2021 this pbx is sick man very good are they on this level yeah yeah they are i was being beamed outside there work do i use lmgs no but i can marvel man if you'd like me to i can switch to an lmg pkp maybe milad jack i'm really enjoying your latest youtube videos thanks for the great content thank you man i'm glad that you're watching yeah i'm really happy with the the channel at the moment all the variety it is 20 22. it's been a long day i keep messing things up today i've called sundance wing dance i still think it's 2021 what am i gonna say next who knows we win too easy do i prefer battlefield shooting mechanics or warzone uh if you talk about 2042 versus warzone i prefer warzone try the lcng with normal bullets but shorter barrel such a beast try the pkp for this round i think i've got the right build on it well that bad boy the cake is a lie you're right tony it is don't let anyone tell you it's not the cake has always been a lie you can't get a suppressor for the pkp for some reason i think it'd be too there was an good specialist named delta in the bf 2042 trailer i think like well dave if you look at the old trailers and if you look at the names they've all got code names like there's like alpha beta charlie delta i just don't think they were they were ready so they just had code names so i don't think there's an actual specialists called that they were just temporary names and there's already an aaa launcher in the game right so i think it would be cool if they had a specialist that had like um a super powerful rocket launcher or something or maybe like a super powerful aaa launcher so you could just delete the air vehicles maybe someone's got here and this is horrible to defend really horrible happy new year down from denmark what's up been with you since bf3 days thank you i think like some of the best gunplay in an fps game in recent years has been modern warfare 2019 and a lot of those guns were in warzone you know oh my god a foul just literally ran over me there didn't resume thank you oh now i have become the head glitch [Music] you can't really burst that kind of distance [Music] you can just go full also there though there's more enemies in here i'm just going to check just in case we're good there's someone over here remember guys every time you shoot a weapon unless you've got those two suppressors on you're on the minimap for five seconds don't forget that i'm reloading nothing look at that and it's back run it out not for long sure i saw him okay yeah i did well also the pkp has no recall after the first 17 bullets i need to test this any new merch to you yeah robert we've got a poster limited edition poster coming up that guy that's his favorite position on that glitch [Applause] actually hate him yeah we've got a poster coming out seeing robert i've not revealed what it is i'm not shown anyone yet but it's do you remember the warzone post that we did last year similar kind of style to that but i think it's better and it'll just be a limited edition run out of combat i can't spawn they can let's try this end so when it gets down to what is it so it's 183 reload this we're going to test if it has no recoil when it gets down to 183 and it still has recoil it's probably quite easy to control that though because it looks like it's mainly vertical boom let's see five is it me posing in swimwear i can't say it is uh ginger can you raise me please ginger please okay that works [ __ ] you call that recall have i ever played a realistic chooser yeah i played quite a few to get to be no [Music] diffuse defuse what even happened then that was so weird it's been destroyed poor guys yeah i wrecked him with that c5 didn't i do i like the snipers in this game yeah yeah the snipers are sick okay just giving me compliments left right and center i like this guy i climbed everest it was all downhill from there oh i mean the pkp's nuts isn't it like that i think along with the saiga it's going to be one of the first things that gets snuffed what do i need to do to get recall control just practice you just learn the recall of the gun and you counter it i'm just going to go check i might die running over here but i just want to check if they're actually there still no they go quick reload it's much easier to control recall on a mouse though i will say that grenade this is where i want to be [Applause] ginger pam does that pan from the office oh yeah of course i was on the mini map there forgot about that i'm an idiot hey edgar what's up edward edward d's on i'm good man how are you you're telling me you can fire a pkp in standing position with recall like that in real life no you can't it's a video game isn't it so it's not supposed to simulate real life it's supposed to be fun i mean would you see people running around with the pkp as well like sprinting like this holding it up in the air no it's ridiculous isn't it but the point is it's a video game there are plenty of video games that will do like realistic gun simulation though battlefield's always been an arcade shooter it's a casual game you're moving off the map you're moving off the map so josh building your pc and hopefully it will run this game okay what did you go for josh that's cool that you're building it yourself as well i always love building pcs enemy myself are coming for us give no ground yeah i mean oh it does have quite it does actually have quite a bit of vertical recoil on it all you do is that you just pull down you can just put it all in one place i don't know why there's no decals there it's weird it's set in the future as well does that mean does that mean the recoil's gone i wasn't expecting that i thought that i was going slow enough there it's all for entertainment come on [Music] excuse me i'm trying to get back hey what the dog doing no one knows caleb what the dog's doing dog does what it wants you know let's go [Music] we've disabled not today sundance can you explain how ping works in this do you mean like the pink that you have look in the top right look up here press scoreboard 9ms there you go that's my ping yanni thank you k30 stupid in this game yeah okay thank you very good the chris spector can i go over here oh no look at that sundance if i go after him this is where i just spy doesn't it that was close how was that uh what you guys seen this is that the terminator i think that's a t2000 i didn't realize they'd already put the new specialist in the game now that is the proper dice moment right there i think what happened there was there was an invisible shield i think there was an invisible irish shield oh i don't know i mean all the guys just got infinite health is she in what what happened please guys dice i've never seen that before i think that was an invisible shield no okay is he still there i want to see if the man's still here it was this one wasn't it i think it was this one we've disabled it was krampus undercover type 4 and pb heavy suppressors work why are you looking there george you made me really really sad today george really sad witchcraft i love that this uh fat hawk has just been flying around the whole time oh they're planting it i should have stayed up there didn't need to drop now what do i think on dice adding first person takedowns again i think it should have its support class i think it should have first person takedown i don't mind both you know if there was an option just let me have both first person kind of like it keeps you in the game third person takes you out of the immersion a bit it's not as visceral enjoy these moments when they come maybe it was a dog yeah maybe there was an invisible dog in there hey what the dog doing i think i only play sundance in this game it might as well be sundance 2042 sundance does it again what map is next oh breakaway tricky duck savage what a what a name what a great name yo jack how's it going dude hope you had a good christmas and new year thank you tricky yeah i did just uh seeing family eating some good food a little bit of work in between he's a dry angel jack he's pretty good he is but he's really annoying as well david now angel's the best character in the game apart from sundance you can give yourself armor and ammo at the same time and then you can have a health kit and you can change your loadout whenever you want and get all your ammo back have i know you've still seen any cheaters so far santiago no i haven't come across a single cheetah in this game and i'm mostly matched against pc players because it's got impulse input based matchmaking i think the anti-cheat is working you know i've got to give dice credit for that george again i don't want to rule it out completely though because i've seen videos of cheats in this game [Music] what oh my god gaben what was that risk also i may have played against cheetahs and not realized it because i've not interacted with them but i can't check because i can't see the enemy scoreboard so that was that was actually a really good use of the previous scoreboard in bf5 and four and one and three if there was a cheater on the opposite team usually you could press tab when you join the game and quickly see does someone on the opposite team have 130 kills and two deaths if so they're probably cheating let's leave and find another server that was a you know a good feature of the scoreboard that we've lost molotov [Music] jump up here oh there we go oh you're on the roof i need heals oh good job busted down no trying to focus on that maybe i think it's sniper time maybe the anti-tank rifle oh the uh ntw i've not used that any just fire's really slow though boom cronus max is the cheats apparently some developers have been working with sony in xbox though to make sure those things can't work anymore that guy just appeared i don't know that's cool yeah um i remember in the beta of 2042 not many people talked about it because it was like on the download but there was some forums where people were trying to get the cronus and the zim to work on battlefield and it wouldn't work so i think they're doing something to stop that now which is good i haven't come across a cheater in war zone either you know since the vanguard integration with ricochet you know props to the developers i try my thing again okay go go oh come on let me have some lost both fun yeah i was i was pulling down a lot there though gibbs oh my god there's no way i'm getting a rest there i've got those enemies oh that would have been a good spawn i go over here a little flanky over here try not to get sniped in head wow they got there really fast i didn't expect that what's my favorite american food is there really any american food i mean would you do you say burgers hot dogs pizza pizza's italian isn't it but new york is synonymous with pizza new york's in america so fast i want things to fly off i can't get high enough it's revenge against george steak steak no you can't say steaks american i should have stayed by and good beefchu i hate beef jerky i don't like it at all i just there's something about the the texture of it and the taste no it's not for me barbecue is american yeah barbecue is good of course ruined ruined all right no i'm gonna be ruined ruined ruined i'ma get me some texas barbecue i'ma give me some steak [Music] apple pie oh dude apple pie is legit man surely did the americans invent apple pie who knows man are there food credits anywhere [Music] what's up sammy hello arthur dr pepper yeah dr pepper is definitely american isn't it so misunderstood though such a shame chicago deep dish yeah but yeah i suppose that is that is an american i've never had that though never been to chicago dice oh no we've lost this i always find that so funny like because it must have happened right at some point with every food literally every food right someone like picked up a banana or an apple or some corn i went you know what i'm gonna eat that and you think about it at the time it would have been a big risk because she wouldn't know she wouldn't know if i put this in my mouth and eat it it might kill me at some point someone did that also at some point someone decided to milk a cow imagine that although that was probably because you know humans kind of do the same thing this cow's also got things like humans have do they produce milk and then milk cow milk was was there why have they not destroyed this spawn beacon am i just being farmed am i doing the farming makes you wonder about haggis yeah what level do you have to be to not the ntw 50 you have to be level 50 i think come on angel do it again and res me is it still there the spawn beacon no surely it's gone now no it's still there [Applause] angel you can do it again angel do it again joshy boy just joined wtf are you talking about one day someone decided to milk a cow is it that difficult to understand angel do it again oh that's okay it's the end level 60. there you go it was around there i was in the right ball bar minus 10. is it still there look that falc is just trying to farm i'm not going to give it to i'm not going to give it your fault i'm sorry it hurts you don't res me get the kill first don't you dare i'm gonna get revenge so hard on that guy i can't stand that well played cocktails were invented to distinguish oh i see that's interesting deathclaw that makes sense though doesn't it cocktails were invented to master disgusting low quality alcohol yeah because you wouldn't be able to tell it was low quality if it's mixed with coke or lemonade that totally makes sense i've never thought of it that way before to make fire makes sense one of these bullets is gonna hit and it didn't look at that stupid point there oh man that's so annoying that's so annoying i was just running up there there's a good attacking team we're playing against here it's a bit of a challenge i like it a bit of a challenge it's better than just walking over them nice the enemy has their explosives our final objectives are under enemy attacks you know you can go down there as well that's cool i didn't know about that oysters are like who the hell thought that was safe to eat yeah that's a good one as well so uh someone had to go down the bottom of the ocean and get an oyster and open it and then you're presented with this slimy goop which looks poisonous definitely looks poisonous and they just went oh i just ate it is that normal someone had to do that someone nearly took the l and i'm sure that people did take the out with poisonous stuff diffusing diffusing diffusing lobsters yeah that's another good one no how far can i go here i'm spotted of course i hate the spotting in this game you can be on the mini map actually sucks the amount of ways that you can put yourself on the minimal and for how long as well are we gonna see squad up in ready or not i don't think so robert i don't know if it's like i think maybe matt would play it maybe level i don't think brandon would play it [Music] maybe he would if we were going to do squad up maybe he would play it i've barely been revived this game sucks there's angel doing the breakdance again i've seen him do that before they're planting okay whoa didn't even see you nice try gavin coca plant is where the name comes from as well as the cola plant didn't coke used to actually be like hallucinogenic okay please don't just stand there please revive i got it gg the enemy has won today return to base hello infinite fun fatal dragon it just needs more maps i'd like more guns as well to keep up ain't because it's done to brag enjoy these moments when they come we've got 27 kills then not bad your gun game ever come back it might be back next week marvel man i don't know they haven't told me there was cocaine in it yeah and they had to change it right that was something right when there was cocaine in the coca-cola coca-cola does it again have i played all the maps now in rush i have haven't i i think i played them all okay we're gonna do we're gonna do a cheeky bit of uh shaky breaky bit of breakthrough give me a break for a you know what i've never i have never enjoyed diet coke pepsi max diet pepsi coke zero it all tastes like crap to me i just don't enjoy it it's just not as good but i know people who swear by it like i have a friend bong adam two angry gamers he i don't know if he does at the moment but he in the past religiously drank coke zero it just does it just tastes disgusting to me like it's not i mean i don't really drink coke that often like i don't really have it at home the only time i drink coke is if i'm out at a restaurant and they have it on tap but diet coke nah it's not for me joe thank you for the five i won't annoy you by asking you to use the lever action however i will say just find once with the wraps of pressure and enjoy the snap okay joey i'm a diabetic so i don't have the choice well yeah that means kind of made the decision for you there right isn't it real jackfrags in the area but today it's more than that today you are holding the sovereign territory against an aggressive enemy what you can do as we speak you must defend the site and bleed out there what's this weird like we're counting on you sound i can hear like a weird like whinging sound you guys hear that diet coke is fine coke zero is nasty oh emma i recommend bars bubblegum or cream sodas yeah cream soda's not bad okay i feel like the chat's getting quite toxic there so i'm just gonna hide that i have a fridge half currently half full of pepsi max paul i i'm sorry i think it's wrong i mean why did they have so many vehicles hey i mean slow down by the rockets let's go it's so much fun okay well i don't really want to be involved with that anymore being honest with you i feel like i should evacuate the dance floor all this stupid antifreeze bro who thought that was a good idea like that is objectively bad isn't it this stuff who wants this nobody wants that what purpose does it solve it doesn't do anything it just annoys you look hold on i need um a proper grenade right there i think that's a few kills right there and that instead i'm just gonna leave it all blind by leaving it all behind nice knowing you guys thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one just kidding just wanted to get away for a second i'm on the roof already okay okay okay all sodas will kill you interesting i think everything's okay in moderation i have one coke it's not going to kill me the bolt delivery's here that's funny nice [Music] capture points huge like to see the baby on the roof again is there an enemy in this it was as well oh no you closed it straight away is that hang on this isn't my c4 one of our objectives is under attack okay they're down there aren't they those grenades even work like that what's going on i was just getting like a thousand hit markers then and no kills i must have been hitting a using the pkp patrick yeah yeah someone suggested that i used it uh b sod game and said check it out it's really good who loves orange soda kale loves orange soda not too slow ultiboy look at the wheel look how stupid that looks yes i agree with you no problem my friend my friend [Music] you're not real i'm stuck it's fine this is fine how did i not get killed then someone there what is it what the matrix is collapsing right before my eyes i mean is this real can anyone in the chat confirm if this is real or not are we just in a simulation would you honestly you wouldn't know [Music] i'm sick of that now we'll never find right now oh the pubs are all closed on there bank holiday tomorrow sunday today it's like isn't it midnight or something now it's just them i knew it hit me hit me 230 degrees 60 meters from my position come here like to see the baby that's right it just ruined my moment buddy i'm just gonna awkwardly pick these up all you have to do is drive over to me it's simple it's a video game from the famous video game programmer thomas anderson all right jump in come on taylor let's go let's go he's one i'm going wait wait wait wait wait i need to make explosives okay okay don't draw attention to us taylor do not draw attention to us i missed i thought that i could just like ghost ghosts ride the whip there into the mav none of this is real careless k do i have editors or do i edit videos myself i do all myself i don't want editors i've had lots of offers from people but i don't want them um i can do it myself i feel like i'm too much of a uh perfectionist and if someone made something for me that i had to post on my channel i'd be just saying you know i can do i can do it differently or better than that or i don't like it so yeah no i don't i don't think i'll ever have an editor unless i went full-time live stream i don't think i'd do it i need more oh bullets how are you doing i thought it was a ranger maria you're crazy damn it i don't have any alternative ammo no no mr anderson it appears you've been living two lives in one life your sundance on battlefield 2042. yay yay this is a bit crazy isn't it michael thank you for the ten happy new years mate hope santa was generous for you grab a few callings thank you michael i got lots of chocolate and socks and i'm happy with that it's the smell i haven't seen the new matrix movie yet i don't know if i want to you know i don't know if it's a good idea i like to pretend that the only matrix movie was the first one and the rest was just a fever dream the rest was just fortnite what the balti what this is fun i've never played this map on breakthrough all the way through it gets a bit crazy like doesn't it especially with 128 nice where's the hit wrench snipes ah i mean the first matrix is one of the best movies of all time there's no like it's it's it is one of the best movies of all time oh i think i could watch that movie an infinite amount of times and never get bored of it it's got action it's got romance it's got social commentary it's got theology philosophy even the visual effects still look pretty good you know came out in 1999 some of the best fight scenes still in movies is that a ranger what is that it's kind of fun to just like focus i don't really play breakthrough enough [Music] i think it's a fun thing to stream as well just because it's crazy like all sorts of crazy stuff happens i mean that's a bad idea but i did it anyway is it number one in uganda i don't know i beyond is western cinema popular in africa how about the new kingsman movie i'm not seeing it nordic i watched june the other day i thought that was great love that very good oh my god oh that was sick i really really wish that guy hadn't turned around alright maybe like another three kills there that was awesome i love that let me get behind them please let me shoot dice oh come on is that the actual shape of bits that's awesome new kingsman movie is really good yeah i have to check it out i'm sure it's got some excellent action sequences in it schafer bates does some really really funny uh impressions and short videos very creative go check him out if you haven't one of the best gordon ramsay impressions in the world i would say nice this is just madness look at this what is going on i think my gpu is actually fixed as well it's underclocked though so i'm not getting as much fps but i'd rather have less fps than crashing that's a fair trade-off i mean this is just insanity you even have six ranges in this what i want to get that flank again oh can i get that c4 back where is it it's gone it was there dammit ranger kill ranger kill that's a boris turret i'm dead it's actually the most fun i've had defending on this game playing this i really like the first kingsman movie i thought it was good and michael cheers for the five hopefully a new splinter cell game coming out isn't there rumors they're doing a remake or is that confirmed no problem shaffer i hope you're all right buddy okay b side yeah yeah i'd like to uh push it a bit further hey squire is that squire from is that the squire that i think it is better action movie star sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger i've gotta go with schwarzenegger i think he's just got more iconic rolls oh my god okay i'm outside my welcome now i wish battlefield 2042 was like this all the time i suppose i could just play breakthrough all the time you only get to see a small portion of the map though mr zeno nice game earlier yeah if you're in one of the games gg so world war three up in there what the hell oh my god i don't like being repeatedly murdered by helicopters okay they're retreating good work you've proven yourself to me today good game i mean they didn't push the first two objectives though a good day's work hey fizzle remember siphon filter yeah dude siphon filter was sick it was on the playstation wasn't it come on hey nick so easy any chance of you reviving if i see a good opportunity i will sincere sarah king yeah there's a new movie coming out called the northern yeah the northmen yeah it's not by the guy that did the witch in the lighthouse robert eggers i've seen the trailer it's going to be a good good movie though did i see free guy yeah i did andrew gg gabby plan on playing hunt showdown again soon i did a video on it yesterday ginger oh that's a cool skin is that boris yeah it is that's neat i like that come on let's get out there do you guys remember the mission impossible game that came out on the playstation and nintendo 64. did you play that the one that was a time for the movie with tom cruise i love that game okay i'm not playing kaleidoscope again we are securing objective charlie well they got to the end what's happened nice guys think about the children why is she not considering the children i can't do anything did battlefield make a mistake by not having a br i don't think so i think if they do a br it's got to be standalone can't be tied to battlefield just frost my engine i don't think dice are big enough though to make a battlefield game and the battle royale game at the same time as much as i think the frostbite engine is probably a really awesome engine for a vr game pain literally can't do anything yeah i'd love to see a frostbite battle royale i don't think it should be connected to battlefield though how do i do anyone how to fix this [Music] if i just slap random buttons on my keyboard we'll eventually maybe something will happen nothing's happening go to options i can't i press escape and nothing happens very insightful chat message there i'm just gonna paint you actually have to quit is there a way to go to the main menu without quitting the game list not much cereal isn't it turn off your screen and back on again why would you take his name well i like his videos but i like to troll as well i bagged his account when he changed his name so he could reverse boost i don't think he knows yet that's creepy yeah i know i am a creepy guy see where this goes how much would you pay the account name gave it our best but their defenses are too strong spectacular two million yeah angel does it again absolutely nothing did i go too far two pence two pence no deal nothing at all well i will put it on ebay and see how much it goes for you can't say anything schumacher thief dude i'm no thief i just oh okay it's over didn't have to alt f4 so guys if you get that bug all you've got to do is troll and chat let's go and eventually the round ends and then you can click play again tricky duck savage thank you for the five michael norton thank you for becoming a member that's very kindly say you're gonna nft it oh god i'm going to nfc this account on origin it's worth fifty thousand dollars because i say so what should i do defending i mean i feel like i've had my filler pkp you know like i've beamed everyone i mean what do i do someone wanted me to try the dmr so you know seeing as i've not really used it i'm gonna and i'm gonna entertain the possibility that it could be good but in the past when i've used it i've picked it up and instantly thrown on the floor and gone pathetic so i don't know how i don't know how this is gonna go but i'll do it for you guys okay what kind of site do i want on it i'm not really unlocked any it's just [ __ ] pain isn't it really i'm gonna give it like five deaths excuse me oh they got that point over there i say oh my god look at all those enemies i mean it's just a bit boring isn't it really you know what i mean is it a one-hit kill headshot you gotta wait a little while as well for that second shot you can't just spam over and over again oh oh no immediately look at mr 30 over there that would have been perfect for a v1 yeah did they fix the performance and stuttering i don't have any performance or stuttering issues caroline but i've recently upgraded my system i've got a pretty sick pc now so um yeah i think it runs pretty bad still on older systems i would guess i don't know for certain but i would guess that's still the case see you later squire thank you for coming along appreciate you buddy how many kills we get then three and on this map you can get farmed by the night bird really good map for night bird unless you counter it with a soft thumb there is a sanitator in the squad yeah here's me about to get formed by a night bird quite high damage though against that ranger i'm going to get killed by honor ow i was reading chat a lot of kick on it nice shot hey from costa rica set up video coming yeah for sure so in january i'm gonna do three i think it's three sponsored live streams um on the new pc with like some sponsored messaging um and i'll have a little video to share with you guys [Applause] i feel like i'd just be much better off with a sniper here wouldn't i [Applause] is under attack i just killed myself with the c4 okay give it three more deaths why can't you clap and tam arrange a robot i don't know what that means for nordic sorry 24 jack i think bf1 is still better than this that's cool man if you think that that's fine it's your opinion you're entitled to it you don't have to be sorry for an opinion yes indeed not a headshot i'm not feeling it guys i feel like the five bullet magazine is just too much of a detriment jack thank you for the 449. say hi to tyler g for me he will be so happy hello tyler g how you doing man do i have input delay no i mean it's it doesn't feel as nice as something like valerian or counter strike definitely but it's a lot better now i've got good fps moving in ac42 single fire [Music] feeling the pain [Applause] i'm feeling the pain here guys it hurts it really hurts i'm not feeling the demo one good switch what scope should i put on the ac 42 if i do single fire shall i go for a long range scope on it um i still really don't like this point two six three two swap those put an rds on it most people saying two try it out why did i see that player then how how was that killed me that's so stupid i was barely moving then there's a long way to go i think it's because i hit the rock two three and six i can help with this [Music] head back oh no the storm is controlling me objective taken by hostile sure there's a turret here sniper over here that's me spotted objective captured and secured i'll just make friends with this turret like oh my god you can destroy two melee hits what i thought they'd get the flinch that was like the perfect position as well that was cool that was some great assists all right our control of bravo one has been lost i think i've got this set up correctly oh no just when it was about to get good thanks can't get him from mind is that someone using a repair tool what [Music] okay that's kind of ridiculous what's good fernando how's it going man i had an anatomy teacher who looked like that green dinosaur on the left of your gun he had very petite arms good man and an awesome teacher sorry you know someone that looks like a dinosaur is that what you're implying that's what you're saying need to get a quicker trigger finger like dinosaur chicken nugget does that mean lol how did i win that what now can't hit fire it though doesn't work very well there exactly like a dinosaur okay i think you should get in touch with the police maybe the scientific community and tell them that you know a t-rex because that could be the key to saving humanity or we could build jurassic park arguably more fun you choose if only this had splash damage like the original blackhawk in battlefield 2. [Applause] okay well then didn't it move oh my can you irish please you literally perfectly mirrored my movements when i was trying to shoot the guy oh god [Music] oh i see i see how it is where the hell was that dozer [Music] screw you look at this why didn't it explode why didn't it explode why didn't it explode and it only killed me [Music] the grinch is here oh man this is good i'm enjoying

who's got armor it really frustrates me don't kill me ranger that was sick that actually looks sick i'm enjoying this it's good it's a good gun especially single fire i'm sure there's an enemy down there somewhere [Music] destined to be blocked by objects that really hurts me you know on a deep and emotional level feel the pain there's one more up here i think are you listening are you dead are

the thing is you want that you want that perfect flag though don't you that's the yes did i get it okay this could be good if i don't mess it up wait for my rockets to come back hopefully i don't catch a random rocket we have lost control of an objective [Music] maybe it was the range our security objective charlie 1. yeah this is a really good map for this because you can hide behind these

insane dude thank you oh no that's not the spawn i wanted you know i think this is a bit of a weird map on 128 player breakthrough nothing really happens and this guy really wants to kill me and they're just on the roof here see you later killer jamie jeremy no this isn't a private server this is just a public server not really getting anywhere are we guys not really getting anywhere well i'm gonna run okay i'll do k30 with the drum mag and the suppressor and that way if i go on a flank i can actually keep off the mini-map unless i get spotted there's people up here though isn't it this roof cleaner i think so go over here didn't see anyone underneath there there's a lot of people over here though oh lots of recall there i didn't really manage that very well did i happen to you emily thank you for coming chloe i hate the dentist yeah as i said like some people really enjoy the experience of like having their teeth cleaned and checked and everything a lot of people just hate it you know it's a lot of anxiety around going to the dentist give me the wings give me the wingsuit yes okay okay you're dead i missed shots i did have an opportunity there to get two headshots but ruined hey john moyer what's up hey luke what's the best gun i mean there's a lot of options i think all around the best gun at the moment is the pkp has to be the pkp um i would put the ac 42 and the m5 next to that mp9 is also very good vectors very good it's a bit of a toss-up at the moment i think do i still play cs go occasionally yeah come on black ghost yes maria twitch tv by the way oh they sacrificed their life for me i got you baby don't worry probably i feel like it's in nerf territory sometimes they just line up for you i am not overconfident i'm just better than everyone else yeah angel does it again angel does it again 14th pathetic mp9 is also very good yeah ak even the scar the scars like puts out a lot of damage jamie likes the dentist jamie likes the dentist jamie is the dentist the dentist is jamie should we finish with some conquest 64. how about that are you going to do another war zone video with tommo sometime soon definitely luke i know he wanted to play her showdown take cod fermented liver oil you won't need a dentist modern warfare 2 lobbies are alive by the way [Music] see you later james ball goodbye jamie quad what's the best sniper sws i think so is this oh that whole container area is gone you don't need a dentist if you don't have teeth think about it raphael good point is do i prefer twitch or youtube youtube rayman for my content anyway yeah it makes way more sense to do on youtube i'm sorry where are the enemies i don't think they will remove the specialist chris i think they could change them and kind of shoehorn some actual classes in but i don't know i don't think they're going away okay someone blew that tank wow this off ghost ranger let that ranger hey chris vince zampella saves battlefield we'll see what he does see what he to does a lot of the top people that worked on this game have gone now so we'll see where they take it it's gonna be really interesting few months oh [Music] hey actually killed a helicopter with a sundance grenade would you believe it see you later chloe happy new year do i prefer apple juice or orange juice orange juice [Music] i'm quite partial to an apple juice every now and again in a hotel lobby in the morning good name bit too ambitious there with that throw geez tank just came out of nowhere again you like cranberry juice i've had it in the past daniel i wouldn't drink it regularly though it's quite tart isn't it if you drink too much of it just it's almost like your mouth gets pickled cranberry and vodka is quite nice i haven't had that in years though makes you pay multiboy good for the kidneys supposedly it's supposed to like flush out your urinary tract system isn't it something like that i don't know i'm sorry i'm sorry plastic bag do you ever feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind won't blow from caving in one ah works for pets too yeah i've not crashed once luke i think down clocking my gpu and under volting it a bit has actually worked which is good we look at this a helicopter doing a killer killer serial killer you are assaulting charlie too sounds like elena an mcu there's a lot of people underneath me but where are they i don't see them hello i can hear them but i don't see them maybe they're gone black black did you finish hawkeye yeah his idea sir here's our dear and the frag gone it's funny oh you go in boy you've got my

armor have i watched ted lasso no i haven't i've heard it's really good though some people told me it's like as good as the american office which i really enjoyed so i need to watch it it's on apple
