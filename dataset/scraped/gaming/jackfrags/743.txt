before we get started today and I show you what really scares me in battlefield 5 I wanted to show you this this was discovered by a player called hollow carrot and it will allow you to get one use out of a katana on the devastation map so if you spawning two around are devastating head over to the cathedral and shoot these Supply Drop if you do it first and no one else has done it before the katana will actually drop out and then you can pick it up it's a cool easter egg and I think it was only just added in the latest patch otherwise it would have been discovered already but remember this does not respawn so once it's been done or you're eliminated and aren't revived you won't be able to get this back just a cool little trick now this is what scares me the most at the moment in battlefield 5 this is the CH 29 and this was already a pretty good gun in the previous patch and even when 5.2 drops but let's just listen to how it sounds all that's good so if you've been paying attention earlier this week the 6.2 patch for battlefield 5 released and it kind of reverted a lot of the weapon damage values in the game some not so much but others mostly the same the bolt-action rifles also got a buff but the zah in particular I think is quickly becoming my new favorite weapon in the game so let's take a look at why first up the damage on this is insane so it's a maximum of 54 down to a minimum of 52.1 this means it's always a two-shot kill for an enemy who's on 100 HP so if you take the three times or six times scope and play it like medium to longer ranges you can dominate with this gun now remember this isn't a full health one hit kill head job because the headshot multiplier on SLRs which this is classed as is only one point seven so a headshot will typically deal around 88 to 89 damage but of course not everyone that you'll come up against is always on 100 HP you know you only get 5 bullets in the magazine as standard but if you do a reload after you've reloaded you can get that ex a bullet in the chamber to make 6 so theoretically with those six bullets you can kill three full HP opponents very quickly at any range and here's a real in-game example of this I was on the bridge on twisted steel and I only had five bullets here but because one of these guys was on less than full HP I was able to kill three people in five shots and that is an insane amount of damage output to have in battlefield five when you consider the rate of fire and the bullet velocity so what are the other specs of this gun then well the bullet velocity by default is 760 meters a second and that's not bad to be honest I mean it's quicker than the type Arisaka it's quicker than the Ross Mach 3 even the Lee Enfield which I know is a big favorite so if we're talking about just recon guns in general it's bullet fires quite fast and then you can actually upgrade that to 860 meters a second with the first specialization which is the high-velocity bullets now in terms of how I've set this so the TL DW is I went left-right right-left the first choice high-velocity bullets or quick game I think that is really dependent on your playstyle but I went for the high-velocity bullets just because I'm a bit lazy you definitely want the detachable magazines because this thing has got a really long reload on it and that can help with that next the barrel bedding will give you improved accuracy when you're aiming I think everyone wants that and then finally the left hand side less vertical recoil to be honest I've never tried it with a bipod and I don't think I ever would so with all that in mind and knowing how good this gun can be what sort of playstyle should you adopt if you want to give it a go and take advantage of everything that this weapon has to offer well the clips that you've been seeing on the screen I recorded all this this morning on Sunday and there's about three or four rounds altogether what I found is that if you can find a position like this that's kind of medium to long range you get that three-time scope on just pose yourself up you are going to delete people with those two bullets and hopefully if you've positioned yourself correctly you've got time and cover to reload so those five to six shots at your disposal shouldn't be too much of a problem but look at this just look how accurate this thing is and then consider the damage that you're putting out always a two shot kill now the next two clips I think show how versatile this weapon is so this first one harks back to what i was just talking about where you've got a firing position with a bit of cover and you're pushing forward gradually scanning and taking out targets as you'd go so I'm just trying to capture this D point pretty much by myself I'm scanning the environment listening for footsteps and I can hear people all around me so I'm gonna use the rock here guys gone into bullets I hear more footsteps locate hit them twice and that's it they're down and then you can get you reload on behind cover and continue to fire up more targets now this clips from a bit earlier in the game and we're trying to take the B point back on the bridge and this is where the rifle really excels moving from cover to cover going from long range to short range having that versatility being able to accurately shoot grenade so you can explode people who are behind cover and then when you're actually up on the bridge and you need to go to more extreme ranges this gun can do that for you no problem and it was getting towards the end of the game here so I'm just using my squad points but look at the distances here but this guy over here got accurate and fast the bullet fires keep mad and you can use that accuracy in other ways as well there's a bit of a skirmish here with this guy on the bridge edge show him miss the follow-ups but there's literally just a pixel there underneath and because you've got that three time scope and how accurate is you can do shots like that I suppose it's kind of like a DMR like it feels like a DMR anyway when you stationed up like this and it makes that awesome noise and you just plinking targets at ranges it feels like a DMR even though it's a world war 2 game now what about that 6 times scope though this is where the fun begins out hip-fire not so great if you're in a pinch maybe but I went on the regime afore this and this guy over here I reckon that's about 450 460 meters away blinked in the face goodbye so even if you don't hit that first shot because of how quickly you can follow up and look where it goes you can readjust and make sure that you've hit the next shot this kind of range here is where it starts to get a bit messy with the sixth time scope it's too close I think I'd definitely prefer to be on three times here or maybe just not attacking that objective with that current set up but the rate of fire on this is a bit strange and it takes some getting used to when you start using the gun you try and spam it quicker than you actually should but if you slow things down and really think about where you're aiming and picking your targets because it's so easy in this game to get confused when there are so many enemies in front of you and you don't know which one to pick but if you just make a conscious decision right I'm going to kill you it will take two bullets and that's it and then I can move on to the next target that's how you efficiently use this weapon just slow things down and really think about every song you're pulling that trigger on the controller or clicking the mouse on PC I mean here I'm being really aggressive aren't I like I'm pushing towards the flag and trying to take out as many of these enemies as I can so we can capture the point it's a bit risky saying as you only have five or six bullets like we talked about earlier in the video and I missed a few shots there because on I was trying to aim for the head like naturally when I play games I just try and go for the head shot because you know it's going to do more damage but with the gun like this you don't you don't really need to to be honest because it's two shots regardless one thing that I didn't really try with this gun in the latest patch is playing really close range with the iron sights because you think well if it's a two shot kill couldn't you play this as a close-quarters gun I'm not so sure because obviously the rate of fire is so low and now a lot of the damage values have been perverted and certain assault rifles and SM we'll kill you so quickly I don't know if using a gun like this up close would actually be that beneficial but I'd love to be proven wrong and maybe that's the video that I'll do in the future like can you actually use a gun like this in a close-range scenario where you're on something like operation underground at every single gunfight that you're taking is a closer swing fight but hopefully you've seen in this video and in this footage how strong this gun is now I don't know if it's like this on console but I'm definitely seeing a lot more people on PC using this and I'm seeing a lot more people using the bolt-action rifles again because they've increased a lot of the bullet velocities on them they're a lot easier to hit targets with now especially if people are moving distance away from you so more people are using those bolt-action rifles and I'm seeing there's a taking the kill feed a lot more and I'm being killed by it more often so in conclusion this gun is scary if you go up against a good player using this especially if you're on medium to long ranges if you've got the same aim most of the guns in the game won't compete obviously if someone shoots you in the head with a bolt-action rifle you're going to lose that fight but if they've got an AR or an SMG or even most of the support gums this thing will beat them but there it is give it a shot let me know what you think maybe the Zed H is a gun that you've not used before because you thought it was a bit naff or maybe too difficult to use now everything is kind of back to how it was before try this one again and I think you could be pleasantly surprised with that said thank you so much for watching guys I hope you enjoyed this one I've got some great content coming up next week so look out for that if you liked this video leave a like that really helps me out thank you if you didn't like it dislike it not a problem subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
