put a bf1 today guys get some drama in your life using the howl here weird gun this is the iron sight is off to the side strange gunner i think the service for i had in my head that you can like go full auto with this gun apparently not just clicks high damage though i don't know how much i've used this to be honest it seems all right doesn't it i'm trying to take this e point what are you doing there mate oh there's another one down there oh that was lucky get my head down for a second yeah i'm walking into the wall stand here [Music] oh man there's a lot of spread on that i'm not sure how well this is gonna work long range but close range it seems to be doing all right i ran out of ammo guys i only had three bullets left that's not a bad start right there i'm trying to help push him back what's the map looking like all right so we are actually down on flags at the moment school's about equal though spawn here on c this area's nate fighting over these ruins here could i even hit that oh yeah i can't hit that man the sniper back there it's very strange trying to aim this well trying to i am aiming it's just you know maybe not as effectively as i could be there's a tank there no i can't do anything about that we're about to get pushed hard on this point so think about what i'm doing here horseback there that tank is gonna mess us up though we don't have any assault players nearby come on assault players you know what why didn't i use this gun more when i was playing the game actively it seems it seems really good ow let's move down here how'd you shoot me from oh my goodness like the damage is so high there's a lot of players there friendly tanks here now trying to take out the enemy tanks kill that medic quick reload are you dead yeah you're dead get around the back here all right we're taking it very nice we cleared everyone but there's another tank over there and there was a sniper there looking at me oh nasty people right outside there too all right falling back on fire you've got a prone in this game don't you put the fire out look at me i've been turning into a a pile of ashes that's awful oh i was about to say we did a right holding on to that point but they're overrunning it now go here instead mortars they're not aiming at me they're over this time consent they're gonna run inside though sniper at the back there tagged me i don't really want to be involved with that i'm stuck on certain guys please the one running down here wasn't there i saw a movement then oh no the rocket gun hey those are for vehicles not for humans right but to be fair if you hit someone with that it is a one-hit girl so can't blame the lad oh my god is that a rapid rapid deployment tank right there what the that was going so fast am i dead if i spawn on this hey stop that not dead if i spawn on it no no everyone was looking at the tank oh the savoyer the old automatico oh that thing is dirty it was so broken that was at one point in this game it was like the k10 in hardline do you remember that k10 was a joke absolute joke 84 damage hey oh what's great about that is those grenades they have a random fuse on them that's why you really need a scope isn't it just bounces around so much have some health no that's the wrong button don't need that right now i need to get out of this here push around the side instead got some cover there apparently it's still here oh i thought they were dead that's a body isn't it no obviously what are you doing there my friend i just want some cover please medic oobis no don't run away from me movies come on come on there we go you're the best thank you very much what's my oh i've got a grenade does that even what the hell flying lewis gun is that even going to explode over there maybe he went too far there's a lot in there looking at me got the old rainbow flare i mean we've turned this around really nicely here i might outsmart that sniper now you're moving i mean i hit him again and he's medics mr crocodile coco i thought it was crocodile you know often see a crocodile in world war one dear do you think there's a real photograph of a crocodile in world war one i've just noticed you can see
