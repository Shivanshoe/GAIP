today we're going to be talking about how streamers in call of duty warzone and other first-person shooter games seem to have no recall and how the field of view affects that because if i had a dollar for every time that someone's left a comment in the last 10 years saying jack how do you have no recall or the recall in my game isn't like that or what cheat are you using what macro are you using then i would be a billionaire well maybe not a billionaire but i definitely have a lot more money than i do at the moment so we're gonna go over everything now and explain some things that you might not know and there's some settings in the field of view options that apply to warzone and other games like bf2042 bf5 that actually affect how the recall look and feel and i think that's got a big impact on what you're seeing here so i've got the game set up at the moment with how it is on console so that's an 80 field of view the majority of warzone players play on console and on pc we can change this from 60 all the way up to 120 and we can also change this here ads field of view independent or effect it and this is one of the big reasons that the recall looks how it does when you're playing on pc or you're watching a stream of play it doesn't actually change the recoil but it affects how it looks and feels and i think that's making the biggest impact on people saying hey there's no recall here so we're going to start off with some basics recall control so i've got the sdg here in the training i'm just going to fire at the wall here i'm going to line up with that brick and i'm not going to do any recall control i'm just gonna hold mouse one and we'll look at the recoil pattern see what happens we've actually almost gone up to the window there and you can see that we've got a pretty standard deviation a little bit of side to side recall and it's majorly going up and to the right so it starts here and then up and to the right scg doesn't really have that much recall at all to be honest so it's quite easy to control and how do we counter this well quite simply when we're shooting when we're holding mouse 1 we just pull down into the left and that will counter what we've got here so i'm going to line up i'm going to do a little bit of recall control here holding down into the left and obviously we've got a much tighter spread here instead of this we've got this if there was a target there they'd be dropped almost instantly and on pc that's very easy to do you can do it on controller as well especially with that rotational aim assist kicking in just pull down the stick a tiny little bit and to the left and you'll feel that with the aim assist it'll help even more now if you play on pc with controller you've got all the advantages of pc plus the aim assist you've got higher frame rate lower input lag quicker response time and that all adds up now we're going to talk about field of view and how that makes the recall look and feel so we know that this is 80 field of view at the moment with an independent value so when i zoom in it goes around 60 fov tightens up a bit so you can see targets a bit closer to you now we're going to go into the options we're going to go and change some of these settings so we're going to whack the fov up we're going to go to 110 which is what i play it and we're going to change the ads field of view from independent to affected and i can show what the difference is in game but there's a little graphic here so this is independent and that's a fixed value so if i was playing on pc and i use the max fov if i had independent it would always go to the same zoom level that console has which is about 60. but because i've changed it to affected it will actually as it says here be a lot closer to the actual field of view setting and that means that when i aim in i can still see a big part of the screen so you remember what it was like before when i aimed in quite tight punched in i'm going to show you a side by side here so this is 110 field of view we're going to aim in so just bear in mind here everything that you can see on the screen what's on the left and right corners i'm going to change it here we're going to go and put it on independent click apply and i mean that's a massive difference can't really see anywhere near as much but the advantage of this is that if the target was further away you get a much clearer picture of them it'd be more zoomed in so you could see them a bit easier however i think in warzone most of your engagements are at closer ranges so really on pc you want to have affected most of the time because you're going to end up with that instead while you're zoomed in so how does this affect how the gun looks and feels well i want you to pay attention to when i fire how much movement is on the screen so we're going to go back here we're going to go to 80 field of view console setting i'm going to put that back on independent console setting and just focus on how much the middle of the screen is bouncing around watch there's a lot of movement there and now i'm going to just shift over again same distance i'm going to go in options we're going to put this back on 110 we're going to change this to affected apply and then we're going to do the same again again focus on the movement in the screen didn't look anywhere near as violent it didn't look like there was as much movement there but as you can see the recall is the same there's no difference there in the stats of your gun it's not affecting the recoil values it's just the movement and how it looks and feels and the simple explanation is because you're more zoomed in every movement every shot every bounce of recall that movement is bigger it looks bigger so therefore it feels bigger so if you're watching a streamer and you think um looks like they've got no recall that's because it does look like they've got no recoil because that fov setting would affect how it looks doesn't change the stats it just affects how it looks and feels i would say that it's just a bit more comfortable to play like that because you're not feeling the movement as much and it's easier to just zone in and focus on the target and just control that recall and it's that simple some people refer to that as visual recall as well by the way if you hear that now i wanted to show you a direct comparison of how this looks versus each setting so just to prove again with 80 independent console settings i'm going to aim in here with a nikita mouse one so that movement looks like click reload i'm gonna go into the settings we're gonna go quality 110 change this to effective apply same again and then i'm going to put those side by side maybe i'll do a bit slow down as well and just see the difference just feel how much less movement it looks like with the higher field of view and the affected setting [Music] so hopefully you could see the difference there so when you put that all together recall control big fov affected fov when you aim down the site it can give the impression that there is just no recall doesn't change the stats like i said it's just control bigger field of view less visual recall while maintaining your special awareness and then on top of this i play mouse and keyboard but if you've got a good player on controller and they've got aim assist as well then yeah recall is going to be very minimal and it's going to look very minimal and when you're building your guns as well if you're using something that's got a lot of horizontal recall make sure you take attachments that negate that because horizontal recoil side to side almost impossible to control if you think about it if a gun is just shooting up like the nikita does you literally just pull down and with this you'd pull down on a little to the right but side to side when you're trying to keep track of the target at the same time it's a lot more difficult so build your guns think about negating that side to side recall and that's how you reduce it overall also you should note that the ads field of view setting only applies to sites that are less than 3.25 value so if you've got bigger site than that it won't make a difference sniper scopes that kind of thing but a lot of people run sites that are lower than 3.25 so this is a big deal i wanted to throw this in here at the end as well because a lot of people still think that you run faster with a bigger field of view but that's not true so it's just the perception of it it's a similar thing to visual recoil which we just covered this is 80 field of view and if i just sprint forward it looks so slow doesn't it it just looks and feels really slow but that's just because the screen is more zoomed in and you can see less and this is the same thing that we just did but with 110 fov and it looks and feels faster not actually faster though same running speed well there it is guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this one if you learned something new do let me know down in the comments below and i hope you found this educational and insightful is it fair that pc players get all these extra things and play against console players no it's not and i've done several videos talking about this before but they've decided to stick with cosplay if you want to play warzone in the optimum fashion play on pc higher fov affected fov use a controller play on low settings max out your fps play on a high frequency monitor give yourself all the advantages that you can right i'm off leave me a like subscribe if you're new i'll see you next time bye
