you know did that video yesterday on the shotgun that can one hit kill within 40 meters if you use the flechette rounds and you hit all the shots well apparently this is a thing now as well after the recent patch the gbt can actually one hit kill every sector below 20 meters it's this thing now i've not really used this that much to be honest it's the mayor's leg looking thing and i haven't really unlocked much but this is the build that i've got here ideally you'd want a suppressor here and the hipfire laser but i think this is the important part here the high power rounds and the scope you can kind of choose whatever you want but we're going to test this out today here on orbital and see what it's all about see if we can have a good game and a bit of fun hope you guys enjoy the vid if you do leave a like let's get into it i think it can take out a jet nah probably not three guys here that's a one-hit kill that's real that's a head shot dozer come back hey okay someone else got him i nearly killed myself there because of that electric stuff how did they get over here it's like right at the start of the round maybe they took that car there or something there's a really interesting discussion about this game today on social media about cross play i just want to know if you play this game on console and you're playing against pc players sometimes do you feel like you're at a massive disadvantage do you notice it much not notice it let me know in the comments below oh no that seemed better days did you see the delorean by the way delorean just announced a new version of the classic delorean back to the future but it's an ev an electric vehicle and it can do naught to 60 in i think it was 2.5 or 2.6 seconds but they also put the stat that it could do north 88 in 4.35 or something like that i just think it's funny that they actually put that on there where'd you come from okay so that's not quite one hit kill range though so i need to see if i can get a bit closer really don't i surprised i survived there though when you get those one-hit kills that reminds me of their defeat an old mod that i used to play on half-life one world war ii mod oh and you could get the car 98 and it was a one-hit kill it was so much fun oh there's a lot of infantry down here i wonder if i can switch to my two times so that won't be a one-hit kill there obviously 100 meters but i think i can to tap at this distance if i actually hit my shots to name well which i'm trying to do aren't we all moving a bit oh there's the one here kill ow who the hell was shooting at me then i couldn't see anyone i think there's a tank though in the tunnel here and i've got c4 or c5 i don't like calling it c5 it feels wrong i think someone actually killed the tank dude they are on that roof and camping it hard there i'm gonna try and do it one oh i didn't really have enough time no that was my moment in the sun damn it you shouldn't have spawned on me dude this is not this is not ideal all these guys on the radar trying to hit those shots i do like this side though it's cool see you up there oh it's a damn satisfying gun to use this though yeah even if you don't get that one hit kill still feels good okay we captured that point nice are they jumping off look at this 270 degrees sundance please one more ow no i'm trying to get my mid-air sundown skills why was that marked is there like an angle there or something i think there might be an angle there oh that's a lot of enemies right let's move in again they're trying to retake that point aren't they oh hello that's armor there's a teammate right there deep on is you're gonna raise me legend thank you headquarters that guy's dead still one guy here but where there i see him look at that that's cheeky ow no not the wild cat yes another rest come on do it conscientious squad mate so i like that a lot see i don't feel like this is as bad as the shotgun because it requires a bit more skill you know it's definitely still a bit too good it shouldn't be one shot really at that kind of distance should it that's okay though if it's a headshot i think it totally makes sense just because it's a skill shot oh man like i was just saying though when you get those headshots feels good i'm gonna go for those someone behind me is that yeah i'll get the one-hit kill someone else shooting at me this guy's not full hp though two there oh they're parachuting down lovely i kind of want to go there see what it's like alright mate cheeky little sniper rude boy i think there's a teammate there as well got a friendly there boy you're gonna notice me charge is sick i think they were going for a melee kill maybe it's an explosive end for the rude boy there on the roof two people here somewhere you can hear them where are they there's one see if we're on the body i know you go for a res and there's one more guy here apparently is it you yeah it was you i saw one hit kill there very good and we can capture this now cool whoa what the excuse me why why was that body just launched into the air look out for the rogue jeep that's gonna roadkill oh that was close that was really close there's this stupid bunny hop thing you can do with mckay as well if you grapple and then just spam jump don't press any direction just spam jump you go super quick i feel like they nerfed that a bit though but it used to be able to go a lot further than that just a little trick though if you need to quickly cross over somewhere who was that sayonara right here there it is there's the one here sorry dude you just don't have a chance to react to it oh what the helicopter trying to approach this point from a different angle here i'm not even been to this point yet this much delta under allied control that's the sniper on the top isn't it it was two snipers on the top actually use the plus system effectively there don't often bother with it but how do you think it helped me out there i just robbed that man's roadkill i'm very sorry i'm missing that like i mentioned though i don't think it's as bad as that shotgun because it takes a bit of skill like you actually have to aim not like i'm doing right now which is not aiming or not hitting the target but you know what i mean i do think it will be nerfed but it's all right for now pretty fun please what was the rocket doing then it just went hi bye and now it's opening up interesting cool well there it is guys that's the gbt 2042 mare's leg give it a go as i mentioned put the suppressor on it and you want that hip fire lasers too i think that'll be a better build for you guys if you enjoyed the vid leave a like subscribe for more i'll see you next time bye-bye they're all inside each other that is most unusual what does that look like without the hood most unusual right bye [Applause] [Music] you
