i'm going to be honest with you guys i'm just going to completely live commentary this one because i didn't plan to do a video today i've been out all day i just got back and i decided to play a quick round of war zones i've not played for three days but i picked a pumpkin today for the first ever time in my life i went pumpkin picking bit of a tongue twister that one but i hadn't realized it didn't occur to me how much of a difficult decision this would be because i don't know if any of you guys have been pumpkin picking but the place i went to just a massive field with rows and rows of pumpkins all sorts of different shapes and sizes and i had a bit of knowledge dropped on me today pumpkins aren't just orange no no no no they're not just round either you can get round ones of course everyone knows the classic pumpkin shape you can get small flat ones you get ones which are kind of like an egg but then squeezed at the top and there's white ones gray ones green ones there's all sorts of pumpkins so actually deciding which pumpkin to get quite challenging traumatic experience for me but you know we got there in the end and i picked a classic decent sized orange pumpkin that's what i did but warzone so it's uh it's in a pretty good place right now i mean there's not much content you know as i said in my last video it's a bit stale but with the upcoming halloween event that might be pretty cool i queued in here phil on quads i didn't realize this there was a playlist update on thursday i think thursday evening in the uk and they put iron trials back in but it's for trios now and they took normal trails out you can't play normal trails right now it's just solo duos quads and then iron trials and trios and i haven't had a chance to play ein trials trios yet worked really well in jurors when i tried it i never got around to doing quads when they had that so i think trio's might be the the sweet spot for it but i queued up for just fill quads i don't do this ever usually i'm playing with a full groove where i'm just playing solos and this was it was really cool it was a great game and i got matched up with this clan here i see i want to go with and they're all french and they were speaking french on the microphone all the time i can't speak french very basic knowledge of french and i don't remember much of it to be honest from when i was 12 to 16. i studied it for four years and in england we have these things called gcses which are like the exams that you take when you're 16. and i just got a pass and honestly i've forgotten almost everything and these guys were speaking in french but every time i would get a kill they would go like oh my god what a player jack franks i think they thought that it wasn't me i think they thought it was a cheater or just someone spoofing because i didn't say anything on the microphone the whole time i stuck with the team i tried to be a team player revived them a few times dropped the money dropped them plates all that stuff so i wasn't being a bad teammate or anything it's just i wasn't communicating and then right at the end i did actually speak on the mic and say hi to him just gg you know good game all that stuff but it's nice man like they were just nice and chill enjoying a bit of war zone on a saturday evening and having a good time and i went for meta by the way i don't know if you've noticed and i did actually try really hard this match too true game data posted a video a few days back about the the meta loadouts in season six because as you know if you play warzone regularly the meta changes all the time with the introduction of new guns new perks balance changes when they start tweaking the attachments and something that you used last week might not actually be better anymore but i went with the em-2 in the cold war mp5 and i just followed two game days builds for them and yeah they're really good i mean there's essentially no recall on the cold war mp5 you get a nice bit of damage range on it too and the mobility is just insane and the em-2 probably not a great gun for controller i would say because it's got quite a bit of vertical recall on there but on mouse it's just an absolute it's a doddle to control i mean here like for example when you're mounted up like this dude running across the valley as long as your tracking's good it's easy kills you're gonna have a good time with it and the damage on it too oh really high damage profile but we had to try and get across the gap here we did make it there was a squad up ahead of us here locking us down and upon costco got the kill there and that dude just fell off i'll take that one i was prepared to put the airstrike on it got a bit ropey here though you'll see what unfolds in just a second but i do miss bf 2042 you know i didn't really play much of the beta just what i streamed really and a couple hours recording and yeah it's got some problems but i just thought it was really fun like inherently the gun play the movement it's got all those sandbox moments back as well and apparently next week we're getting to see the five remaining specialists that they haven't revealed yet and i hope they've got a few more team play abilities in because i felt like that was missing with the first four so there'll be some gameplay i imagine next week and hopefully we'll take a look at you know the state of the game right now if they polished it up i mean they said that the build that we played in the beta was a couple months old i'd love to see what it actually looks like at the moment hazard zone that was revealed this week did a video on that covering everything again looking forward to trying it out i'm not sure it's got enough depth though on the surface based on what they've said to keep people coming back and it kind of feels like it's in the in between spot between let's say escape from tarkov and hunt showdown on one side and then battlefield on the other and it's in the middle and it's taking components from all of those games however i don't know if there's enough of a pull either way in enough complexity but we'll have to wait and see i feel like you need an extra hook you need an extra layer to the meta game rather than just oh the metagame is your extraction streak and that makes things cheaper for you on your loadout like i don't i don't feel like that's enough it could scratch the itch though for those players who like br games and tarkov and just want to try it with the bf gunplay destruction vehicles artificial intelligence too could be pretty interesting but for me i mean the main thing about 2042 is just all that warfare and portal thinking about all the things that you could do with portal creating your own servers you could just do like a bf3 server if you wanted to get the original classes back you could do a proper world war two mode it's got so many possibilities there that could be awesome to experience so when 2042 is out i'm going to be playing it loads just be nice to have a new modern battlefield again that's the most important thing for me the last guy here in the warzone match and we won it and the teammates just went crazy they found it hilarious i think it was a good game anyways you know what guys i think i'm gonna leave it there let me know what you got up to this weekend has it been good so far we still got sunday or one day
