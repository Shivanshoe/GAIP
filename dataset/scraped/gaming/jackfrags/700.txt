hi everyone hope you're doing well today we are playing some more Call of Duty warzone and in this one I'm going to be using a gun that I basically never see in anyone's custom loadout it's just so rare to actually pick this thing up and I think it's a lot better than people think so we all know that everyone at the moment is on the height for the mp7 the emptor team game for the growl but everyone forgets about scar from The Lion King look at this bad boy the FN SCAR 17 I just never see it in-game no one runs this on a custom loadout and I looked at the stats this does 35 maximum damage per shot which is actually quite high it's not as good as let's say the Odin for example but as far as most other assault rifles in the game that's not bad would I run this in trios or quads maybe not but in solos I think it could be quite competitive so this is how I've got it built I've got the mono suppressor the forged TAC 20-inch barrel I do have an optic on this one because I can't stand the iron sight so I've got the xrk obelisk Pro stock and then of course the commando foregrip now as for the ammunition I'm a Max's yet but I think that's a 30 round mag I do have the 25 round mag unlocked but I thought as I'm playing solos 20 might be enough if I'm just engaging one person at a time and I don't really want to make the sacrifices that adding that would bring so we're going in with the 20 round mag and let's see if we can make some magic happen if you guys like this leave a like and subscribe if you want to see more let's get into the game enjoy I found myself a little p90 just trying to get the scavengers over here shelter it yeah the only time I've seen someone use a shield turret was when they put it on top of their team there and it killed them so on the m4 yeah let's stick with the RPG sure that I heard someone over there somewhere oh yeah a roof right okay yeah I'm gonna go for the sky because I am the I'm the ante roof police let's go with that I'm not gonna stand for it all right I think that guy wanted to die just children sound like a rabbit that's nice thank you tell you what though this p90 shreds like I feel like I should just do a p90 video now instead make a sick custom build I don't know if it's competitive with the mp7 or the mp5 though oh it was just so fixated on the Jeep then aldra what was he doing I'm gonna get this scavenger it doesn't all open here I don't see anyone it's a Halo companies big deep thing kills cells plentiful yesterday I've lost it it's gone dude up ahead PMI UAV is being off you on our TV for resupply and one over here by the by and one of they're gonna go for that dude I don't really want to attack the others right now because and probably just in buildings and I'm not about that life but if I can just roll up on this guy how here in the middle of nowhere there will be no cover [Applause] are they still going to be here either an attack rather sniper behind me oh okay we can talk the guys old car squish them oh no that's got it that's got to feel bad man I didn't even mean for that to happen that's for fall dominoes right there anyways I'm gonna go for this little guy movie it's gonna be a high high-octane game I've got my loadout now so we can actually test this bad boy out see if I was right or wrong I feel like I'm gonna have to keep my distance though cuz if people have like mp7 they're just gonna destroy me this is what I hear it's hot okay right so obviously didn't see my car Paula well that TCK was really faster like he just dropped Wow we go hunting again another dude over here at the buy there's always someone at the buys but I'm a bit worried than they hide in one of these buildings and I count these buildings that one's blocked by a sofa okay get the heartbeat out oh there we go I think he's actually right there behind that door not really want to run through it though so we're gonna see we can do a cheeky little flank here Crouch if someone's looking at me right now I'm so dead I must be in there he's gotta be in there wonder if you can hear this maybe in here running around in there Oh he'd barely touch me then there's someone right above me okay always someone camping these build is land right on the roof you know I'm just gonna just even get this guy by got the other side and neverending staircases he's still on the other side nice coming over here now right I've seen the clip of someone throwing a c4 up there so I need to I'm like I could do that but I don't want to give myself away right above me now he's running off okay we have an opportunity here to get further up there's no way this guy knows I'm here here on the other side be very quiet still we're just behind this concrete thing alright mate oh he was facing to the work I get the takedown yeah I'm just gonna show him there we go that is a really fast easy case now don't become just a shotgun skaar just melts people how to take the sniper dude have no idea I was there probably jump-scare think I heard someone else not sure yeah there is someone okay that guy nearly had me then what gun did here and for of course yeah but yeah it looks like a nice m4 skal just out DPS them I think I wasn't really going for headshots then maybe I should try name for the head more with this it's gonna massively decrease that time to kill I don't want to be on this roof much longer because it just bores me so I'm gonna go to the shop we're gonna buy another UAV no one's around yeah we good pop it straight right Sarris go right here you trying to steal my Jeep yeah no he's running away okay yeah just move it away from me thought might be able to seem them but if it should be an easy kill no one else is around I mean that's pretty good that I missed a few shots at the start there but as soon as we got on target the damage just might with chipped away at that deuce help Oh [Applause] oh my behind me can I take this guy out Wow okay that was a nice shot look there where our self res should be all right she's running cold-blooded as well gonna heal better no clothes now we're gonna fall back don't like that spot can't see him anymore that's a different guy thing was that not a head shot so what else just parachute down right he's are gonna fight one of them is dead so I should have a little advantage here if I rush this dude okay right sniper still up there he got me damn it it was at the same tragic from the for our i'm i'm shin straightaway there's olga 1911 spray on the wall sit there fall for it don't hear them something [Music] and actually they're okay here we go oh okay look about house that was so close that was so close [Applause] anyways we're fine there's no lowdown scrape oh where should I go not really any contracts either a coffin that recon which I just don't fancy doing because the second I get on that point it's gonna throw a gold star up in the air and everyone's gonna rush me god damn maybe there was a vine close to that as well if I get a bit of cash or if I can kill some of this rock - I was definitely gonna be people around me again there we go green and for us it's not bad you should go check the roof okay all right we're good just thinking that there might be someone camping this by that I could try and kill their cash was a loan out coming no it's right behind me so we're gonna go for that there's another one over there but that's not mine mmm is it gonna be risky look at all these buildings about all these windows need to get my scar man that's the machinery okay do this as quick as I can back off hit a bit of cover he was over there somewhere I think like in it 28 minutes clear mm-hmm now get in a fight yeah come okay - just chill here for a second okay no I'm oh so hopefully this dude here I'm play that's right okay I'm gonna just chill here he'll I think I got some ammo back still in that building fire 78 right here enemy UAV overhead this dude knows I'm here as well she's kind of hoping that they get eight years right I don't think that guy had all my [ __ ] house that was just way too perfect I think we're clear now but I'm gonna move I'm gonna go around the back I might be the safest play my eight other people left but this is where it starts to get really sweating solos nobody shoots nobody makes any noise and my heart starts to pump really fast because I want to try and win this game I know that if I lose I'm gonna let all you guys sounded I don't want to do that here footsteps okay right what I actually had to go very austere otherwise doesn't help that dude would have got me with the house in this building to be me just gonna try and just not make any noise here I've gone upstairs think yeah okay no I'm just gonna leave that dude get his own control first hopefully I don't get shot in the back can't believe I won that one I thought I was dead there for sure literally just gritting my teeth as I tried to hit that guy all right I'm gonna wait for a clear shot here I tell you what man if you get those headshots the scar a bit of a beast thank you for the gas masks I really needed that like three people left was a guy named Jean located in the bus this is your last chance they pushed up to me that sounded like it was behind me though that was weird two people left think I'm clear at this angle here might need that frag okay fine yes yes okay we got it now feels good man that feels so good I don't think there's anything more the main thing is winning at the moment because it's it's really difficult I don't know if you guys have tried this but it is it's it's tough it's frustrating at times but really rewarding when you can pull it off anyways that was the scar man I feel like I'm gonna level it up now I'll get the other attachments and just see if I can make like a really sick build for it but worked really well there like it did he just drop people I was taking people on one-on-one fights and more often than not out damaging them so did the job without said guys thank you for watching if you liked it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one
