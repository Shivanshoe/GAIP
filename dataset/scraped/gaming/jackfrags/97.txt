i would like to introduce you to my new best friend sven look at him majestic that's a reindeer isn't it i think pretty sure it's around it anyway welcome to the new assassin's creed valhalla expansion dawn of ragnarok big thanks to ubisoft for sponsoring this one today i have to be honest with you guys we're just gonna have a bit of an adventure today i've played through the story a little bit i'm gonna head over here to find a murderer sven you'll be all right there were you yeah he's fine yeah i'm a big fan of frozen i'm not afraid to say that i promise i'm going to try and play this one like an assassin's creed game and what i mean by that is stealth i'm going to start off by turning into a bird because you can do that now i'm going to go find a roof somewhere that i'll kill you put my ass down there land there and then kill that dude i was a lady goodbye can i carry you so i'm off the edge i was a guy there assassin's creed so we'll go full stealth oh double assassination here goodbye we're fine yeah no saurus all right into the long grass we've got to get in here there are three inserts three inserts key was split into three pieces do you have a piece i didn't kill them they didn't notice okay i can also disguise myself as one of these muscles here it's one of the new powers and they're just okay with me doing this can i get both yes of course that lady over there nothing to say no we got one piece of the key there i think she's got the second one climb up here didn't even see that one try and put this bow and arrow to good use bye-bye and one on the edge this will be the third third key yep looks as though it may be complete hmm all right here we go hi search the workshop okay gotta look for some clues well well whoever held the ritual at the ball this one's here last one i'll be up here i never look up in video games i was missing i just get lost the vault is marked here along with a second location another original site perhaps i'm gonna go to the ritual side but first i want to see if i can jump into this hey i become hey why was it like jelly that doesn't make any sense lady out of the way oh that's embarrassing oh how dare you you could have been dangerous nobody endangers them he's my favorite reindeer i'm gonna leave him alone look how glorious he is shimmering in the cold light of day can he swim though i know that some of the horses could swim in ranges swim maybe not not in this game at least so you're just gonna leave me like that dude okay that was a whole group there okay i've been practicing my combat watch this i've got all these arrows do it again and actually lock onto five or six i'll see if i can do this as well you can like catch the things that they throw at you like that you just press parry at the right time what playing too much elder ring i'm a master of parries now we'll stomp kinky execution one left smash goodbye well that felt good the viking john wick basically isn't it this is the ritual site here this roof should give me a clear view god i've got to land on that roof there and see what's going lord down with your permission we will now return to asa soon i have need for you looks like batista asus warriors where do they fit into all this you are one of our captains yes a duty i share with two others here i thought i saw something in you stout resolute step over here the block from the guardians of the galaxy goldstein were two of the most revered sons of evil if such prestige is a requirement for these rituals then calder is surely luring that must spell to his death i wonder if there's a way i can observe the ritual up close i need to approach calder without him taking notice okay perhaps the best ways was deception i think i can just disguise myself it shall soon begin again you can walk on lava as well with this stuff come join me chosen ones together we will in that what's up ah didn't work you like anthony hopkins batista he's gone chasing after him he can't have made it far escape no i'm gonna kill everyone here i think that's a better idea i love that attack that was really good as well because you just hit him with it stomp there's a load of damage i've got this site as well i started with an axe but i had a load of gear in my inventory so just switched it up to this giant that's not scythe time is this the last one oh my god wave goodbye to your head chased off the kelvin like a rabbit hound he is no helpless rabbit besides what i find of this pursuit so i think they came here and i've got to investigate there's a couple of bodies around how hard was he knocked into this rock most likely dead upon impact she ruined him i'm here several wounds this one put up a fight briefly i suspect no other bodies in this war path he was the last to die last one ace are caught up to calder his warriors moved in while he pushed on but acer tore through them like a whirlwind the trail of the dead reveals a direction hold those two and most importantly the southern cars they are headed west where the snow knocks then you like this thing i think this is where they went i'm gonna drop off in there i'm going right simple disguise i love that i just don't care just because i look like them you didn't see anything nothing hi guys yeah it wasn't me that did that and that's it that disguise is so overpowered bit of a fight here i think she was like taken away or something there's a card here and drag marks sven we're off again i don't have any carrots for him poor little guy perhaps boulder headed up here somewhere if the cruelty must perform on his behalf he and acer they're young pure of heart but lacking in logic one day they will grow up and see life as i see it well she's right there they must rely on me to ensure they live long enough to achieve that wisdom is that you again mad one come to tempt fate i see i do not die this day can you say the same ah yes you've proven once already how you like to strut around unencumbered by fear perhaps the salah did not give you an adequate taste of it enough of this blithering hand over what is now mine or shall i just take it to no fear we must be subjected to it so he looks more like anthony hopkins now soon after the summer car will wow here we go where you going oh fire on the ground quite easy what happened you get the timing right there you can do the slow motion dodge how far in this case yes right to the face put him down is sutra collecting hookahs what does he mean to do with the salah tell me why do you aim to finish my work ask yourself how much you care to suffer in these final moments do your worst you are wasting your breath he will not tell you and he won't have to his secrets are known to me now oh she's got the ball you want them move aside you need it only look inward oh no he's going to kill the weird anthony hopkins batista hybrid down he goes well i think i'm going to leave it there guys that was a quest complete blazing betrayal before we end up i just want to go and see what's up this mountain because it looks like a really high point so we'll go do that sven just had a great day out he's lived the dream oh sven
