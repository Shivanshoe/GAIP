least i've got this crossbow which is like an explosive thing well it's a massive revolver that deals a lot of damage and also another giant rocket launcher which also has the big boy rocket on the bottom that's going to be good what's up nicholas hey wilbur is there more emphasis on melee combat in this game compared to previous borderlands games i think so well but yeah i mean i'm like a strength character and uh i think my class ability let's say it's called enrage and it enables when i do an ability but i think it also builds up when i attack things with melee you'll see like a red thing on the side of the screen jack i asked a bunch of people at work if they knew what i dk meant no one knew it's because tdk what's up blip bop hey val the tooth fairy why is the tooth fairy down

just made us slam him off that stupid thing up there excalibur soon i shall wield the mightiest weapon in all the land then no one will make fun of me unless they suffer my wrath that didn't go very well i can't pick it up what sorcery is this can i get it oh wait i remember another part of the legend only a hand of noble birth may feel the blade of kingly worth we need the king luckily i prepared for this squire take this pre-recorded summons and bring him to me forthwith a summons for claptrap find king archer is he on the map he's up here cool we'll go see him i just want to check if i got any good stuff there two three three don't think so no guns i want to change there yet i just unlocked that slot there as well i'm feeling pretty good about this hey baja what's up man is this game open world or similar to borderlands it is very similar to borderlands it's not as open world though i would say it's as it's a bit more linear than typical borderlands games stupid things with their stupid butts explode as well bye so king arch is going to be over here it's like the knights of the round table isn't it shroomlet i kind of wish this had more ammo in it though doesn't have much goblins i don't think that was supposed to happen okay he's just sliding along the floor in animation baby interesting might i mention that after i cut the grail i got like hey dead meat what's up marriage proposals from princesses and they're all my king i humbly beseech you grant me audience that i may deliver your royal personage this summers you dare to enter my court and issue a summons to me king archer master of this realm and lord of these wooded halls yes very well whatsoever your quest may be i accept but we are in court so here your summons before departure we must observe the formalities here okay first of his dumb name for though his weak noodly arms pale in comparison to mine arms of steel i need him to get off his pampered butt to pull extra caliber out of this rock so he can give it to me and summons oh dear i've heard enough he's tiny oh no they're the worst i could go on a great length about all the ways that was easy i will you reason everything personally wait is this thing still on ah probably not anyway like i was saying kings are always a bunch of big skinned whiners who can't take criticism a big blue helper i don't know how to get rid of that is it like fire maybe to get rid of the blue bar next time you're around him he's getting back up i'm trying to concentrate here does so much damage i didn't check that melee weapon did i what are we 106. it is actually a lot better that one try that out blue is usually electricity in borderlands games really he looked like a frosty guy what frames i just locked it at 120. devlin what's up tactical scottish how are you doing hey choka yeah kino i don't know what was going on with that goblin bring up that back so we can get this dog sword all ready to go all the way back around i guess i could just go down here instead 15 rockets there where's the psv to release handy and i don't think they make games for the ps4 anymore buddy hey hunter what's up now squire fasten your gross severed hand round extra caliber hey louise from brazil what's up oh please let me use it i can feel the power [Music] he's gone hey i found marvin's gate squire come to me our quest continues mud it's it's marvin it's not merlin guys okay copyright a blue egg what's it from bangladesh chef how you doing he's dead finally okay now to open the ancient and storied gates of bourbon's domain let's see these elvish symbols say speak friend and and tur ooh ooh idea squire what's the elvish word for friends i usually just point to myself and say friend and they seem to get the idea elves don't like me very much yeah fine mervin his eyes sir claptrap mightiest of heroes i come bearing extra caliber so open up enter that worked good now that's more like that's easy finally the respect i deserve another seeking the holy spell nade eh if you can best my apprentices you will prove you are deserving of its power bring it on badass goblin bombast not down oh my god he's a big guy okay look at this guy the badass troll he's really not that tough oh my just threw a sword at me that one's got a shotgun knocks them over as well marvin if you would hold destruction in thy hand you must see through trickery to tell friend from a foe approach the real mervyn and the holy spell made is yours oh easy i know this one pick that one standing over there just look at him standing all smug he's definitely hiding something how can i tell the power of extra caliber even saving my totally helpless squire is a triviality time to extra calibrate a way out of there one two three there was another three wasn't that i think what most tenacious no matter i suppose if you can get it right on the second try that's not so terrible and i'll still let you have the holy spell made but no cheating of course what i meant was that guy over there he's the one i can feel it in my chassis okay that's not good you never know when you need to escape a personal help and open unreal engine look at this uh are are you buying this look i'm i'm getting you out of this wire hold tight no i want to stay in here uh don't look at anything too closely here you're not supposed to leave me in the game engine please [Applause] [Music] [Applause] antares thank you for the 100. seriously i even gave you two chances and you still got it wrong it's clear you're not fit to wield the awesome power of the holy spell made now you must pay the price for your failure i wasn't nearly dead got him oh he's got skellies as well oh they explode oh no that was close he doesn't enjoy the direct hits does he have a bit of that merlin [Music] oh yeah recharge he's running turn tail and run pathetic flow but in the end the mighty prevailed now grab that smell so we can get us the heck out of here yes sir i will watch the bottom like this video can i sleep flip flop you can do whatever you like buddy thank you for being here oh look at this like a modern looking pistol with a suppressor on it that's cool get the over here squire i would have it worth it with these yes you've proven your merit through valor cunning and fortitude therefore i can think of no one more student to wield the holy spell made than you squire also that one's got garbage stats it doesn't really go with my build so i'm just gonna kill merman a bunch later until i get a good one okay but you have fun with that that was a good quest oh my goodness look at this godzuka of order what is that about what's up louise hey gaming fire where's tommo i think he's out edgar i think he's out at the moment and stod's busy as well so busy busy busy some people were saying that the servers are down anyway so i don't know if we'd have been able to play together 30 times five oh my god the cheap shot i kind of want to try that swap it for that rocket launcher he's out out kino i think outrage i'm bummed that you never did any elder ring streams um i mean i did one big alden ring video you know i was content with that i did the preview video and then when the game was out you know i spent like a week working on a video um i did actually do an elderly stream on twitch but that was just like a couple hours i think that was godric that we beat any more quests in here magic bean i'll go back to the start area and see i doubt that i can just jump off there hey jack do you know anything about bf2042 patches or content no idea i mean i haven't really said much i just jump across that apparently sir yeah i'm really happy with that elder ring video it's something a bit different from my channel you know but um i think people liked it i hope so views have been good on it i think it's 650k now or something like that i did well i don't know what this is over here i feel like i shouldn't be here any plans on doing more star citizen yeah of course ruins yeah i think it's just a waiting game with 2042 like we'll see what happens just the waiting game they said new content in summer so june july i guess whatever it is oh that goes about that way it's weird sanguia there's a hub area here hello shall i slay evil with today have i met you before what what are these guys wearing very flamboyant jelly ting you watched the elder

different apocalypse and you've probably heard of us we're like legendarily metal but like let the skeletons kill them i helped those loser sellouts in talons of bone yeah maybe i should have done but look i can show them up with some real dark magic i stole this page out of my mops out of this powerful witch's grimoire it's a spell called the hell hammer i just need you to gather the magical reagents here take it thank you a spell recipe i'm gonna like guess that i don't need to explain any of this stuff to an adventurer of your caliber even though i totally definitely know the actual reagents i'll go and collect some stuff there's one over here and two there well that's the closest one isn't it so we'll go there some clever first at home but oh dude was overcooked he's on the phone as well pastry your dude sounds like the same guy that voices thor from what if maybe i think this is the king that i've got to kill i'm gonna waste a rocket on that what is this shotgun what's the brain thoughts of a tyrant made a tyrant's literal brain yeah of course i knew that's what it meant i tried and then up around there on the left passive aggressive sticky note my mom left me hey fallen angel talk about tyrant i hate her so much cosmetics i think it's around here bye but that's the measure of you isn't it huh here we go hello okay this thing is way too strong i feel like i shouldn't have this gun it just ruins everything i kind of feel bad killing them you know is that going to turn into something i hope not of course this literal eye rubber it's um i mean the gameplay is fun like i'm not really into the story that much but i like the gameplay it's not as open world as uh borderlands 3 was though and then there's one more thing isn't there all the way back there can i fast travel there i don't think so let's travel here yeah all right i'll get me a bit closer hey michael playing borderlands when did this happen i mean i have played borderlands games in the past like i've done a couple of videos on borderlands 3. i think maybe borderlands 2 as well one video back in the day this obelisk will summon a mushroom a ferocious [Applause] ow he's a bit chunky mage i got some spells on my own buddy that's me as well though [Music] dammit i need discount i'm dead [Music] those mushrooms are a pet of one of the classes in the game yeah start out a mushroom pet i can't remember i think stud was like the archer class i can just pick it up a king's literal heart that makes sense yeah the heart is where cowards lives dude so get back here already i need to show those tools how metal playground apocalypse really is okay bro around this way yeah i think so playing golden ring while watching this got the game yesterday cool i was lucky is this by the same devs as borderlands yeah it is jwm so the cauldron it's a standalone game as well it's not an magic expansion to be 20 hours long as well okay so like stand back okay because i don't think you're ready for the face meltingly this one starts with a totally sick as hell solo you guys just come in after it yeah demonic lords are you seeing this do you see how freaking metal i am [Music] oh my god [Music] i saw that coming we'll be happy to hear it though they just set themselves on fire and died hey so uh what just happened over there they're all dead they meddled with dark magic then they died do you know what this means guys we are actually the most metal band in the world we are so metal super metal there's only one thing left to do the most metal thing of all let me give you your reward yes give it to me for your services to the most model band in the world we give you the ultimate reward to be a human sacrifice to our dark demonic lord zagoxes this band comes at you with a demonic frenzy in there whoa are you the way you are without a body to possess you must be psychosis he's belly button i'm not sorry self defense horrible you're right i suppose this isn't on you and well i guess you were only trying to help come thank you outreach i will reward your efforts but there's something i'd like you to do for me in return all right here's the deal i need a new body and helping me out is really the least you could do to make amends my attempt to aid them was met with an attempt to sacrifice me i did what i had to do yeah that'll happen around here now the first thing we have to do is find the shape or grimoire so you can recite my true name meet wait ziggy wits he's already gone boo but why doesn't he just tell us his true name uh cause that's not how demons work french back me up girl that is indeed not how demons work see no g-dummy why i would like that to be how demons work yeah make it easy for me come on cheers outrage very kindly appreciate that do i have any better rings here what's the gear score on this 130 1.9 percent spell critical hit chance the purple one's got so many more perks though you know this was interesting i'll switch that out for that

one who killed my host so you're gonna help me find a new one now here's the deal there's a coven which meets in the catacombs beneath the city to call them witches would be uh generous they are mostly bored house husbands and housewives with too much time on their hands basically they're always trying and failing to summon demons but they have somehow managed to acquire the shade-borne grimoire you will need to get it back very well what is the plan as you may have noticed there's a big piss-off gate in the way yes go get it open it's locked oh you tricked me [Laughter] yeah yeah i did so listen i can get this thing open but i'll need to channel my powers through a host namely you but you're a little too goody-goody for that right now i couldn't possess you even if i wanted to which i don't good people are so icky inside how about we rub a little shine off that soul of yours huh go do some bad stuff bunch of stuff i'll stop by scamming some town folk rubes out of the money that'll be fun okay that sounds kind of icky what if we did something slightly less evil like um cutting in line like access ponder is your real dumb suggestion ah fine i suppose that's choose a sin just so i'm clear we're doing bad stuff at the behest of a demon this feels out of character for us come on i'm gonna go live a little i'm gonna steal some money i'm afraid i can't come to the door

earlier but now that i know what you can do i think you can handle it if you're interested in the big box you could uh acquire something a little more he's gonna give me an exotic is he okay exotic you say well i say challenge accepted that's a pizza and let [Music] investigate the smell i don't yeah i'm gonna guess goblins gonna be playing any more escape from tarkov soon yeah yeah for sure i would say i might wait till they do another big update or another wipe and then give it a go again [Music] teeth it's a very specific list of teeth pretty suspicious is all i'm saying i'm questioning fine sorry for being engaged in the narrative smack him in the kisser the more the nice [Music] or was it lawful over chaotic so many can i not just like collect them all in one go i suppose if it's for an exotic though i mean that could be good i don't even have a single exotic weapon yet oh it's really annoying you have to look at them directly to pick them up well you have to be on it what what's the music sounds like x-files remember whenever the little grey aliens are on the screen did you guys in chat even watch exiles i know some of you did the older ones but maybe the younger ones watching didn't oh god [Applause] [Applause] i mean i think so i've oh you can actually collect them on mass that's cool i didn't realize chad okay oh excellent and you know what i think you're ready for the big leagues so often happen the animal with the most teeth is also you're one of the most trivia vicious it has the mostest teeth in all the lands oh oh i know the freshman playing sky raptors of alpha 3 wrong a dragon sea wolves okay i don't know what that is no nope absolutely not yeah whenever the little grey aliens came on the screen on the x-files it would play music like that i have journeyed i'm finding teeth for the tooth fairy king it's obvious isn't it the sea work teeth though would have really kicked things up on that what do you think if 2042 gets cross-platform when he comes free to play will that bring the game back i mean it's got pros black it's got cross platform already love cricket you know i think the only thing that would um you know get more people playing the game is good content and changing some of the fundamental design of it you'll see for yourself okay oh that chest i was going for these my bad we're about to be rich i can feel it so now children for the magic well if you're ready for your reward reopen the chest and discover what treasures lie in waiting is a mimic is it going to turn into something you fell for the classic dark wizard protecting a tooth fairy who really just wanted [Laughter] do you too fairy you deserve to die now we've got a little exploding look at this what the tooth decay step into your brain die too fairy i wanted to do this since i was four years old they're kind of adorable though magical [Music] [Music] save it for a rainy day so you're playing the long game huh yep picked it up from a guy i know pretended he was a tooth fairy to duke money hungry adventurers into a trap of their own making yeah at least now we know where the mimics come from i like you guys you're fun please action rifle i don't think i even got an exotic did i the game just constantly bait you why [Music] okay two-thirds dead guys i'm sorry well that would hardly be sporting would it what is that big sniper rifle i don't really have a better spell i really like that spell 4.2 companion critical chance four point two percent max health i will read that gun sounds serious jack can you try and play rust again it's completely changed since the last time you made a video on it d the guy when was the last time that i made a video on rust like five years ago maybe more than that i don't know it's been a while hasn't it it's another reason to own my age okay we'll do that one help that influencer out where is she over here not trouble there no okay i want to get to level 17. i'm nearly there and then we can go do the main quest i've done a lot of the side missions in this area now let's start this sniper rifle semi-auto i can cast no more before the lights [Music] have you thought about playing war thunder harvin i did play war thunder in the past get done i don't know just like fast travel to that yeah let me do it before we're gonna drop a code in the chat guys for this game on the epic game store first come first serve i think it's for like the top version of the game as well if you're interested we can just go either way felt kind of buggy like in borderlands 3 clicking on the map doesn't always work okay thank you for the tip what's my favorite game currently uh i don't really have a favorite game at the moment to be honest what would i pick elder ring probably is what i've been playing the most i like the new warzone update um need to play it more though i haven't really done a video on it yet i did a live stream on it i might do a solo video yeah there's not um there's not many like insane multiplayer games out at the moment like battlefield obviously i'm just waiting for new content so hot come on back good you can jump down [Music] [Music] a long time since you made a cs go video yeah csgo videos don't really do very well like no one really wants to watch them like unless you're a cs channel and i'm not a cs channel one of my fans so now you can look gorge in front of yours if you have any nearly level 17. [Music] maybe i could just go there and say see how i do against the enemies [Music] these little camps here [Music] that's a combat encounter i hope you're ready to fight villainy because i've got a bone to pick with evil 16. same as me there to return so weird that it's got the salt they reload strange it's gonna blow a little bit of aim assist as well [Music] i think it's a timed exclusive for epic games this one oh boy i sure am lucky you came along hero i thought i was a gonover i just picked up a magic bean let's find somewhere nice for me to uh germinate god man wants to germinate where's that place the magic bean oh it's right here he just wants to grow that sound over there looks like a lovely spot it's a bit it does say [Music] okay this whole damn town's been lifted into the sky by a giant beanstalk now normally i'd say hell yeah it's marcus phoenix right so we just made a town by picking up a bean putting it down and then hitting it here must ensure the innocent townsfolk are safe who knows what dangers this beanstalk may have brought upon them yes indeed fair hero everything was not fine up atop the beanstalk for the magic beans [Music] new adventures away to the newly uh renovated town of driftwood i didn't i didn't want that to happen i didn't mean for that to happen i didn't know it was going to happen guys i'm very sorry that's a dead end what just want to see that amulet thing that i picked up was it a ring yeah the menu is a bit finicky you have to be very precise with what you click on ah purple one's still better i think i'm gonna go up there flick the bean yes indeed all right how are we gonna get up there then around this way no bad flight don't make me get more hedge clubbers i fear no shrubbery did that just break maybe that guy should have i feel like that's true we got evil plants up in here just a little something tina's been cooking up the sounds of battle don't mind if i do who's there you better be here to help whoever you are [Music] hero damn in my glasses to you you got my message right so you know about as much as i do about what's going down up here but whatever it is we gotta save these people meet me up ahead that's right it's your old friend the fairy punch father and together what shall punch evil right and it's evil press on fate makers yeah i don't remember that guy from the other borderlands games obviously he was though ow okay these guys are a bit tough i kind of just left into that without really thinking like many things in life that's how i approach them you know too spontaneous yes i leveled up we got 17 that's where i wanted to be brick is his name okay was he in borderlands 3. i bet he was i just don't remember him i'm stupid get over here he just looks like marcus phoenix to me you ready just call me the bush i feel like they just got marcus phoenix's model and just cell shaded it oh dear god that's the spirit now follow me i'm sensing some real evil vibes this way i can feel it in my very whiskers are invisible by the way because yes carl this game's got so much dialogue it must have taken ages for all the actors to record it oh damn that's a fiend bloom and it's giving off some evil mojo these must be the source of the parasite strip hell no give me a second to do my very thing and purge the evil it's like jack and the beanstalk yeah i guess it is [Music] i could have just shot it for you man hey listen we gotta cleanse the rest of these things if we're gonna reach the parasite and save the beanstalk pick me up a few quid god damn right come here marcus and phoenix i can feel three more of those things in my fairy whistles the closest one is at the lighthouse let's go let's go baby you good he's in every borderlands game bar the pre-sequel that's how memorable the character is or maybe i just don't pay attention remember this but not like cool i mean like sick you know what i mean you're talking in circles wow that did so much damage to me then how's this code you're taking me away from my css homework i already did post the code okay we'll do some more though we've got some more don't worry don't you worry your little cotton socks it's fine i just went through the barrel impressively [Music] i presume this is the lighthouse i can cast again we gotta go up there oh he was a playable character in the first one okay it's interesting that bean balloon's gotta be around here somewhere find it a nightly gentleman of the highest steve is in search of a squire high atop the beanstalk go there and eat him in his most illustrious quest it's there isn't it every single one of these is indispensable clear the area smash i do do more damage when that effects on the screen you see like on the right and the left it's gone red and icy now that means like almost every one of my shots is going to be a critical or do more damage yeah i think i could go to that main mission area now i feel like i'm doing enough damage [Music] impact will sticky what should i go for and the punch father does his fairy magic testicle the thing and the [Music] oh god not like this i think this is only the second time that i thought dragons the whole game i have to defend him that shotgun's good though because it has a little dot on it see they burn right weird music again oh did you die as always good try silver or was it lawful over chaos [Music] you can actually use your spells as well when you're in that down state hit him in the butt how many more is that enough defending game come on please surely are you finished yet marcus come on marcus please hurry up that was a big bad just winding a bunch of look at this [Music] son that's quite a bit what's that jeez nothing i mean that was a bit of a slug wasn't it chat i'll save your fairy punch father and there's a boss [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you kind of i suppose i could move down right i'm not stuck here but it's telling me to defend that guy so maybe the other spell would be better here the necro one jesus just when you think it's over i'm hey chance how you doing css is a programming language yeah there's all sorts of different programming languages i'm taking some wicked energy from the cathedral that must be where the next thing it's almost like learning a different language as well you know french german latin if you so choose i don't know why at my school i was actually taught latin it's a dead language though isn't it so who knows why i don't remember any of it it's all gone it's quite difficult for me as well i remember that i got the hunger bee in the end i hate that nefarious abomination oh hello even though i'm totally like that one with nature and all that then how do you justify killing all those shrooms well yeah even though the town got all messed up at least the residents have higher property values step into your grave it stuns them as well when you do a headshot with that it's cool you have been judged and found wanting is this free to play no oh fig it's not i think it's full price cathedral's all the way up there okay these little sheep god i nearly fell off john wallace yeah you keep doing you buddy go up there yes advice there'll be more star citizen i know people really enjoyed that video just take a look at my gun see if i've got any better options now i mean that's doing like 20 210 isn't it maybe that one isn't cutting it anymore it was 86 damage it's got that fire effect on it as well where are my exotics at i'll change that nope nope hey steph yeah i'm good thanks how are you how is this compared to boardlands it's very similar dusty mender but i would say it's not as open world it is out now dominic yeah lots of chance you're my favorite content creator thank you man meatless you learned a bit of python what's the most difficult coding language i'm terrible [Music] i have to go in oh i'm stuck you'll never win heroes miss the opportunity oh i need to kill myself cool my spell is ready this world is not for you oh it's you you're the one doing the damage to me him out of the way he was carrying for his life buddy [Music] you're not welcome here wicked weed hell no not even a little bit what guns from mw2 and mw3 would like to return i'd like see i mean i know the scar is already like in warzone and nw but like it was just not very good in warzone so i'd like to see a bus scar uh is it the acr as well that's like one of the most iconic mwt weapons i would say the vector as well but again that's you know that's already in the again a lot of the iconic guns from ww2 are in intervention like we never got the intervention in mw and warzone is i think i am a little bit under level for this but i've got enough damage output army next feather my conscience is clear villain looks like a pissed off some bad dudes you take care of them while i scope out the next theme blue what was i literally just doing [Music] ow ow [Music] [Music] ah a fine collection look at that barrel there yeah cool that was a fun little fire i enjoyed that did you enjoy playing world war three yeah i did stuff it was good it was really good we need the scar l with like 45 or 60 round mags yeah that'd be good he's out on pc lewis but only on epic games so it's not on steam yet one mad gamer i love working in c and c plus plus it just gives you more freedom with your code but you can't you can step outside of array bounds which could lead to compile errors don't know what that means but that sounds really important [Music] c c plus plus is the most difficult i do python for gcse and it's very easy why is your fov in war zone low my five war zones 110 i think it's just 10 off the maximum there's a group of people on my discord playing this right now yeah i think are you playing it chris like val said she was playing i think right you can watch halo with a vpn i'd have to buy it though like how would i buy it i don't want to you know i don't want to pirate again and get out of there this way opened up a little door hello how was the performance i'm just getting 120 cameron no thanks yeah i mean look at the game like it's it looks cell shaded right like it's not like things aren't really high polygon or anything i don't think it's a really demanding game getting 120 jack just found my 120. i feel magical you've got fast trouble there now can be a boss here isn't it hmm yes i'll take it no try that out here's another reason to hone my age oh my stash is so big now valenciano playing it that's cool so we are drawn together money is no object take this money at once um oh my god the falcon of splintering that looks cool is that an exotic as well yes damage is actually less by four but it's got higher attack speed crit chance and crit damage let's do it this is going to be a boss here i'll keep keep i don't know bella i don't know how long it's a time to exclusive for even if it is i presume it is timed [Music] do me my bony okay chris thank you elemental smgs are very strong in this game okay i'll see if i can find one truly this world is a wonderful [Music] how swift they fall oh hello this is the new one isn't it it's a double barrel now that's more like oh

not sure about this shotgun doesn't seem to be really doing that much damage come on this parasite thing is feeding on the like energy of the beanstalk and i ain't having that this big beautiful beanstalk must be i don't know what that is i saw a game called crows that i'm interested in which kind of looks like battlefield you guys seen that look it up on youtube crows c-r-o-w-zedd i don't know like how real it is though but the trailer looked all right had good sound on it like a hardcore battlefield milsim a game club i need a little range guys they're so annoying he nearly died is he actually fighting now i think he is look at him that's it you get in there buddy show marcus phoenix show me his boss it's like your namesake poor soul swipes to kill a mushroom mushroom demon oh no

it's a looter shooter with some rpg elements [Applause] quests skills character classes choices that kind of thing borderlands with spells and a medieval dungeons dragon saying there you go [Music] where is the boy he's up here borderlands has always been that though rng you know the guns can be lots of things that make sense all sorts of modifiers and variations of guns well there doesn't seem to be as many in this game as there was in borderlands 3 yes sir i'll get you out of there when it's over i'm going to go kill the magic bean little mushroom monster awaits he's tough he's a tough cookie i think it's just gonna keep spawning die bean are you ready snipe it in the head how about that i'm just so slow with this yes i lack the ability to do that bring him down to my level [Music]

them out ollie what's up uh samia how you doing just a mighty pirate do you remember killer tomatoes apparently in the 80s and 90s though they made cartoons just to sell toys like they'd come up with the idea for the toy and then they'd make the cartoon to try and sell the toys rather than the other way around which is what i assumed it was when i was a kid but we can't go dry or the songs why that be me first the hero wants to fight why is that funny it wouldn't be a fair fight for ye see ah got plot armor plus me grog yeah i played cyberpunk ben played it all the way through when it came

exactly what we do just in space space pirates whoa i think we lost him the more the dice the better the loot very impressed by the idea of space pirates there wasn't he [Music] i got i've just now realized that the dice actually gives you better loot because she said that like that i can't believe it's taking me this long i'm so dumb that's probably why i'm not getting very good loot because i just don't find the dice that's probably why i'm not getting an exotic oh that's just now you can smell the thieves smell it your fleshy nostrils oh my god oh glory already funky whaler what that's very strange as much as i would love to i have already taken a position in bones three woods cruise this is nice pirate rule 81 d if a balloon be popped the popper must be dropped it and that's andy

the overworld you have traveled far earning yourself a shortcut back to the previous area this shrine is dedicated to throtus hunches the patron god of critical hits the mortal coil who star i can barely see a thing you look fuzzy margraven seller the meanest debit cards player in trying to cross the ravine are ya i know there's an invisible bridge over it but i can't see it without my magical eyeglasses i lost them to some coiled and i just know they cheated can you go get them back i'll do my best so i have to do this progress i think that dungeon over there mayhaps contains a shrine piece [Music] what's that yonder that is a poetry page baby it's off ghost hey pavel i'm doing well thanks yeah i'm doing good i'm enjoying this that pirate mission was really good like that that whole section was a lot better than the first bit of the game in my opinion not as much uh cringy toilet that's humor coiled clutch it is snakes is this game i like finding these fun energy sucks shield [Music] there we go there it is thank you all hello damage is nice [Music] inconsistent aim with it though that's fine for glory freeze effect on okay ugh you know we'll do another code right now another one why not i don't like that shield you've got there lately [Music] another one just one more so we should have access across there now i believe locked i don't know what to do with that my glasses i can see again of course i only need the one lens to read can't see without the blast held on oh crap the other into a monocular telescope for you there that will let you see the coils invisible bridges built for things all over the place okay keep your eyes open there's more to be found all over guess my broke college house will never play this one only in the various wisps of sunlight oh i've got four now that's why okay okay okay yes love that god please just let me click on things gabe i'll try a different spell then yeah why not i'm just constantly talking all of the time i just talk talk talk it's kind of like me isn't it you're gonna meet one of my favorite characters i remember when i was your favorite see how that turned out 240 watch your back fade maker you might find something it's in it i buy that i feel like i should buy that or something goodbye spell goodbye sniper rifle i think that's an american doing a scottish accent what arcane substance could possibly never mind i don't want an oh i need a thousand okay i'll get that easy i mean there's rumors that there's new nvidia gpus coming soon vault so maybe hold off on that it's usually like august september that they release in it so if you can wait that long maybe they'll be out by then that's my new spell just drops a meteor on my head turn that down hot girls and boys video chat why just go away no one ever clicks on those ever stupid a coiled priestess named kasara stands before you she seems to wish you no harm what are you doing down here smooth skin whoa whoa whoa there's a little salt on the way she said smooth skin i'm offended i think honestly i don't even see what the big deal is about having skin sometimes skin's too dry sometimes skin's too wet yeah no thanks yeah you wouldn't get it it's a skin thing okay the next person to save skin is spontaneously combusting she said it first watch your tomb with me i am a squire of the realm on an important quest i might add i am sorry it has been a very long time since i spoke i don't know why they can't bottom people of course you seek passage i can aid you here take this cipher now gaze upon the shrine and let the words flow through your only the coiled may be granted passage through the drowned abyss this cipher grants you our speech there are three more shrouds you must intone their words hey crew before the doors to the temple of sacrifices this was once a sacred place to me light that will grant us passage i like that whoa it's a big area okay she's creeping me out a little was it me it wasn't right because she used the s word yeah she's got too many proper nouns going on chains drowning sacrifice what no she's great i really want you to like her you guys trusted the skeleton man just fine uh yeah he was a pirate okay well with your detect intensibility you can tell that she's a real sweetheart who's honest and trustworthy and you love her yeah but the priestess class has the conceal intent ability that's just to drop an enemy's head something so i just messed that up it wasn't it was me it wasn't me the step she's making us read sounds super evil what you don't know it could be like a recipe or something yeah a recipe for people on the anabolism k we're keeping it rated t for tina here why do you hide sir [Music] you're immune okay fine i can't resist lore what's the deal with the drowning this city was once a beacon of civilization a symbol of the united coiled people but some craved power and allied themselves with the dread void god known as drill when he was cast down to the deaths by other gods so too was the city dragged with him god sounds like a real bomber i was there in the hour of splitting when our elders cast their love with drill against my warnings since then i have stayed as the caretaker of this place hello oh it's a big lady [Music] what are you doing is she like buffing the other enemies down or something that's weird stop that a fine collection but what to choose that looked good she's so big like the big lady from resident evil village i like her a lot she's cool you may enter the temple of sacrifices [Applause] damn it second time i've died liam you just made lasagna today tasty well would you recommend 1440p 444 hertz or 4k 144 hertz depends on your gpu if you've got a 390 or 38 maybe 4k but anything less than that like go for it i'd go 14 42 40 here why not i don't think that's a shortcut you're gonna get really good frames like 4k it depends on the game you can still get good frames but 440p is the sweet spot if you've got a good gpu like that that's what i play on that's what i go for i do have a 4k monitor because sometimes i do 4k videos and streams but most of the time i feel like 40p is the best in terms of performance clarity responsiveness being a competitive player we will need to light a fire why would there be a fire pit in an underwater temple hey jimmy [Music] surprise ambush shall we level 20 has just done something to that ability it's your grand ass what's that sure this is no ordinary fire seeker still don't have that though in the bottom left whatever that is it's another ring slot i wonder why [Music] oh i had another one didn't i i like that one though the closer you are the more damage you do but all the fish died when we blew up the ocean then there's one in a chest right in front of you and there's one dead fish can it still light a fire wow valentine i didn't know we had a fishologist in the house it's a magic fire fish it's got tons of magic fire juice still all up in it okay i'm done perfect now complete the sacrifice all right newbie time to give up all your blood the fish itself is the sacrifice oh huh okay interesting light the fire like the spark the temple has accepted your sacrifice follow that light it will take you to the final step of your passage see she didn't want to sacrifice you after all let's go fire spirit i don't know something about her just makes my skin i'm sorry what was that it makes my let's go nope just using a completely normal phrase that everyone else uses makes my skull across normal [Music] that's it even those other idiots at the table can see through it ready to pass catastrophe at my command my dice [Music] just told me again just remind me that i'm an idiot is that sword still there oh it's gone smg isn't it what incredible technique should i learn next i did a fair amount of damage now even though these guys are like two levels above me can actually hurt them a bit oh hello purple sword what was that yes please boy pistol zip rockets that's new wait how did she get here first pretty suspicious uh please you guys will really like her if you just talk to her a little more i am afraid i haven't been completely honest with you oh no i knew it there is one last sacrifice to you here it comes and i make it gladly i will go with you what when my sisters fell to the temptations of drill i blamed myself i vow to remain in solitude for my sins but you have shown me that passage through hardship can only be accomplished alongside friends i will join your party and age you on your quest no what no there has to be a twist she's lying the priest is his maddened sister's attack drawn by her nefarious spells sisters i defy you now is it rockets are cool i like that yeah just full auto then that's mad are you really so eager [Music] they're really good how much damage does it do as a pistol though oh no sorry i already had it on pistol mode i thought it switched it [Music] okay so that's the zip rocket so that's a lot they hold on as well like did they lock on i don't think so [Music] thank you seeker of passage you have given me hope i will repay you in kind with friendship yeah not buying it no dude she really needs it may i have a hug god it has been so long since i felt the warmth of another on my skin don't buy me uh not no no she didn't she's super thin and you said i know what i said [Music] here let's all just go talk to the evil what i was expecting joey that sounds like fun you did your best fate maker but you can't save everyone not with a bunker master like her [Music] got so much crap the gods well i'll just do this okay yeah i mean i'm gonna do more star citizen for sure because you made me and now i have to throw out this whole story i had ready and you know she had a trouble fast and a yearning for friendship spawn ice spikes that bounce between targets i knew you couldn't stay away for long take a laugh of the mess [Music] get rid of my blue try that bad boy out oh my god it's chunky [Music] fine you know what you wanted to fight i'll give you a fight i should get all these models from this guy just called big gigantic muscles okay literally takes up the entire screen i mean [Music] magic time [Music] [Music] how much room to move here which is a shame oh please please let me kill something no oh his fist was in the way big big boy elder ring vibes yeah in a way i'll try that again with a different gun this one this is the boy look how much more damage that is that's insane i'm gonna just use this gun in the first too place can't shove america down our throat and force us to love her [Music] oh no it's not the end throwing ice spears at me there you go where you going where you going oh god [Music] i'm dead now surely you're dead now we're
