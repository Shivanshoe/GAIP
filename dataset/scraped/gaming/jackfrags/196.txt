hi everyone and welcome to battlefield 2042 so the game is live now in early access i was thinking about streaming it yesterday when it released but they had some server problems so i didn't want to go live and it'd be really stop start so i just held off yesterday and we are good to go today apparently battlefield have done some fiddling on the back end and increase the server capacity or something like that and it's supposed to be a lot more consistent now so i'm looking forward to this it's going to be good i have played a couple hours yesterday on pc just to get my settings right explore the game a little bit the loadouts the unlocks that kind of thing i played for around six hours in the capture event earlier in the week but we were on different accounts then we couldn't use our own account so i've only got like a basic progression so far on my main account so i've got a ton of stuff to unlock lots of stuff to see and do stuff to learn ins and outs of the game we'll be playing it giving some feedback just getting stuck into the mix and i think tonight we're going to be playing all-out warfare and then we'll be doing portal maybe tomorrow day after we might try hazard zone just a bit of a mix you know this is going to be the first of many battlefield 2042 streams appreciate you guys all being here thank you very much for coming along if you're enjoying the stream or if you're watching this as a video hit the like button thank you it's a great way to help support me and also i have to say a big thanks to epic game store for sponsoring this one battlefield 2042 is available in the epic game store and if you buy it or use or get any other game on there consider using my creative code jack frags and i'll just get a bit of kickback from that so with that said we are going to get stuck in we'll do multiplayer you can play it solo and co-op and we'll start with conquest see what map it puts us on kaleidoscope is the map set in south korea hopefully it puts us into a new game what's up intron how you doing hey hazoka zomp alex thank you for the 25. zandro thank you for becoming a member it's very kind everyone's got the same icon apart from this dude here i like how his voice is muffled because he's wearing a mask like a bane up in here [Music] michael how's the lambo i don't have a lambo i would never buy a lamborghini you don't want to know what's on those servers i would love to know what's on the servers right so should we just spawn in on foot to start with you need to coordinate efforts and secure the targets get ready to move what's up luke hey scorpion please how you doing yo dude you're getting stable frame so as straight as yesterday i tested my frame rate and it was pretty pretty rough like 70 80 fps like my expectations are a lot higher for that especially with my hardware setup but i went in this morning and i overclocked my cpu and memory and i've got like 30 more fps now so frames are a bit better but still below my expectations i love how i picked dozer as well and they temporarily disabled the shield so i don't have a specialist ability right now someone just redeployed straight away um i'll show you what settings i'm running as well [Music] so we're 1440p 240hz i'm not getting that frame rate though motion blur off so i have texture quality and filtering on high most stuff medium post processing a on low ambient occlusion i could turn that down but like i like to have it on because if you turn ambient occlusion off then the game just looks really flat and yeah that's about it i call in i need to get used to all the systems in the game just remembering to do things right ranger come back to me like i think i don't know if everyone in the game could have a ranger oh that's my skin by the way i think that's part of the ultimate edition or something it's black and it's slightly different geometry on the body as well yeah i really should have picked a different specialist as soon as dozer doesn't have his shield right now when i die i'll just change yeah i don't think there's a nvidia driver yet for it either i'm not sure if amd have released one but hopefully there's something coming out soon like i haven't updated my driver since the beta maybe i've got the latest driver but i don't know which is the latest one for battlefield i can put my frame right on if you want yeah hopefully this should work um there you go it's quite inconsistent the frame rate i found i don't know these levels at all like what where even am i these are just random adverts helicopter looks like everyone just went to g and the ranger shoot at the helicopter infantry down there that's interesting we've got quite a long range on it he's moving come on ranger let's go i don't know if the doggo can keep up with me in the hovercraft probably not can you spin this minigun up it doesn't look like it yeah these hovercrafts can also climb up buildings i i don't know if you guys have seen a few clips of that i was watching uh geeky pastimes yesterday and he was streaming the game and you can climb up walls with the hovercrafts it's uh it's kind of crazy and those guys have all got 80 over there there you go first kill i send the dog over there oh look at that yo the dog saved my ass then that was awesome hey what the dog doing come on dog let's go go go go we should move there cancel that they have checked their delta i see so i think this is out now if you've got is it ea play or game pass or something you can play on console and pc now but the full release is november 19th dude you just shut that in my face that's rude can i call in a hovercraft i need a vehicle set to my position request receive vehicle drop incoming well that was close i'm getting this ranger get in damn it maybe i can show you guys this thing where you can uh climb up the buildings with the hovercraft if i can find an appropriate building to do it on it's it's so silly i think it's completely unintentional but it is quite funny so i hope they don't change it if we don't stop them they'll take every sector oh hovercraft you can't go in the building okay we'll do a run up we'll try and do a run up come on come on oh i'm feeling it i'm feeling oh yes look at this away we go only in battlefield but they never expected this did they enemy this is so dumb i love it though i love the fact that you can do this geeky was like jumping from building to building as well what what's up any enemies up here nope oh man it's a shame i wish there was enemies up there everything is blowing up what the hell nice dice please oh all right building jump let's go come on we can suck on let's go yes spider hovercraft everyone everyone's going to be doing this trust me trust me what are you doing what are you doing i'm a hovercraft dude just let me let me live let me be me man come on okay we need to be on that building that goes up to the objective hold on hold on it's so difficult to control oh oh do you think my range is down there like bro what are you doing yes right up to the objective let's go baby imagine if i had a gunner with me as well my gunner could be shooting people it's so dumb do a flip i mean you can't do flips dude oh no that's an attack helicopter think about the children come on start securing sectors come on we're going to capture this objective oh on the line on the line yes what's up boys whoa we made it okay let's beam nobody expects the hovercraft on the roof instead coming did you die attack helicopter no this hovercraft is precious oh we made it all the way unbelievable seats that's so that's so funny i love that you can do that absolutely insane it's a feature it's not a bug it's a feature wind thank you for becoming a member so i need to pick a specialist who's actually got abilities downed what does that mean why did it just come up with downed oh it's totally worth it chad yeah what are you firing up bro i don't see any enemies oh there's one is someone else then truly next-gen yeah exactly next generation game right here was i don't like that like that where we go oh god has that fallen off the roof that's new i think that fell off the roof i'm sure that was up there before we've lost control of an objective our force is now controlled ranger must have been taken out oh enemy hovercraft i was testing out these grenades yesterday they're insane they just lock on look at this bang second one can i get a lift is it dead i think someone killed it no yeah the grenades are insane so sundance has got um three different grenades and they replenish over time you don't need to i'm sorry we gender with ammo or anything they just regen by themselves so yeah let me show you so you've got scatter oh sorry i'm guys i'm trying to i'm trying to demonstrate to the chat and you're just taking me out like that what the hell it's like a little museum here or something yeah so here we go that's anti-infantry that's anti-armor and that's emp and the anti-armor grenades are pretty insane there's an irish putting down shields i can hear a lot of footsteps who says are really loud on the roof oh look at this oh baby this is how we win you want to get in lads it's not very fast if we don't stop them they'll take every second there you go you know you want to get in [Music] uber i have a five star rating dudes no instantly got out didn't believe me when i said five star rating [Music] oh it's rapid look at this is it fitting uh joshua thank you what the hell our troops have taken sector will fit oh there's an open one there come on i think it's a bit too big to get in there come on come on dice please oh it's too big on look at that we're nearly we're nearly there damn it screw you right we're going to switch to scatter they're down a half oh this is the roof that i was on with the hovercraft i think we zip across allied force is now holding sector delta someone on the radar here but i think they're downstairs what this mad lad you have to unlock that as well little bird you can't get that straight away [Music] whoa okay that's a bit buggy okay there's like four people there oh hang on i think my ranger nearly landed on me there alandis thank you for becoming a member what does tour creator mode offer i don't know what that means time sorry oh doesn't i didn't even realize look at this there's a tornado it's just suddenly appeared there's another little hook took there that's what they're called isn't it chat is it tucked up i think so oh wow shiny [Music] sorry why why was i getting hit markers then no one's here that's really confusing that's like crow damage as well that was freezing me uh maze do thank you for the two it's very kind i feel like the mini map needs height as well you see that red dot on the minimap there i don't think there's any way of telling which height that player is on i'll throw those up there see if they get that helicopter it's too far away maybe no no it's locked on locked onto something see you just throw those grenades anywhere and they lock on to stuff i even i don't know if i can even attack that with a normal gun where's it gone is it friendly now oh that looks so awesome i love that don't do much damage to you with ars from that distance i kind of want to go into it hopefully i don't die if they don't do a sharknado easter egg i'm going to be really sad by the way so i'm gonna let this guy run into it it's fine i don't have to kill him live your dream live your dream jimmy jimmy just go leave your dream live your dream jimmy jimmy please just go leave your dream you get hit marcus from destroyable stuff okay uh joneston you can see my frame rate in the top left you can see the fps that i've got no i'm back incoming i think it's already here sundance don't you i get hit by lightning and die [Music] what the hell oh my god okay it's got control of my character now i can't turn no storm please i forgive you now storm do you plan on making a 2042 best settings video yeah i could do i mean i'm going to give it a bit of time you know i don't just want to rush into anything because there'll be things that people discover we're back in the osprey again condor sorry not osprey this is quite disorientating i see any enemies down there both sectors are now under our control this is yes not emp this then i know it's gone now someone destroyed it that lightning though wow my troops have lost an objective and put anti armor on should lock onto it i think nothing too far away good work come on boy i need a name for my ranger anyone got any good dog names i shouldn't have asked that question there's gonna be so the chat's gonna go crazy now quiet [Applause] oh sorry if i see a good one in chat i'll use it come on do they still have the flare effects on they'll take every sector he's a chunky lad big helicopter boy rex rex is a great dog named yeah there's so many dogs called rexxar aren't they did you kill this guy i mean the footsteps like i'm not sure if it's friendly or enemy to be honest it's kind of hard to tell sometimes because they're so loud cheddar cheddar's a good name i like the idea of cheddar didn't expect that did you this fit ready yes [Music] mr roboto oh no it's enemy tank got to start securing sectors leave me alone taco taco could be a good one rusty for the dog okay [Music] we lost by 75. we can't win this one all right not bad but we still got work to do that was something right he's still far too happy come on this is too easy time to go to work i don't like mckay rufus rufus i mean there's several great options here guys several great options and by several i mean thousands um asani thank you for the donation solanum cheers for becoming a member dave thank you for the two no campaign what do you think i don't really care about campaigns in battlefield games dave to be honest so it doesn't bother me i know some people really like the battlefield campaigns though so five dollars from straight dope thank you have i gotten into any custom portal matches yet i've tried the classic one straight dope i've not tried any custom ones my friends two angry gamers were doing a zombie mode the other night and that looked really fun at rusty for the dog thank you mustpad mitchell cheers for the 50 name him jack fangs okay dogs do have fangs don't they but do robot dogs have fangs don't know uh dave thank you the two rambo for the dog you had one that was named that's adorable what's up sergio benjamin michael hello eat chad is good yeah chubby i am chappy i like chappie oh that movie wasn't anywhere near as good as district nine i have to say bunker oh clunk is good y'all have clunker that's a good one big fan of that hey dj westy is the obvious name for robo dog i don't think cameron would be too happy about that uh johnny thank you for the one i promise to share the action with you guys now we've got tactical grandma in our squad this game tactical grandma [Music] american forces are preparing to strike at our antarctic oil production oh this map is awesome i love this international law but they only want the oil for themselves name him dog and say the letters every time and it becomes a name marcel you're a genius how do you how can how are you so small i mean what even his life you know um do i i mean i got like no guns i've got one smg two ars one lmg one dmr sniper and utility now guys let me tell you in the review event earlier in the week we had everything unlocked and then the second dmr i can't remember what it's called svk i think it's a two-shot kill guys so yeah i'm not looking forward to when everyone has that unlocked two shot kill dmr i'm not talking about headshots two chest shots we tested it it was insane this is ridiculous matt the fat cat also in hazard zone the time to kill isn't different so you can two shot people in hazard zone where if you die you're at the game until your squad can revive you they might not revive you sector has been captured by hostiles ep is also pretty yeah the peep is really good do you ever miss battle log and do you think it was a great feature i think it was a great feature to have yeah not everyone used it but i personally loved it for stats and for the server browser very handy to have that i think the idea of having a server browser on a website though is a bit archaic nowadays maybe that's why it's not around anymore but it would be great to have it as an option definitely where's the i'm at the wrong side no i'm at the right side of the map i'm gonna go up there can someone just call this in it's mine now no i feel bad i'm sorry i'm sorry i was j i was legit going to just steal that then but then i thought you know they've called it in i don't want to be that guy riley from cod goes so that's already taken though isn't it charlie sector is now under us command how far away it's 1400 meters cheers kevin thanks for the five call it stan lee oh poor stan is that a tank over there doing that oh there's a little truck here and the recall is crazy there's a lot of spread on the guns as well i'm not a big fan of that we epic moment there for that sundance ruined bro i just wanna whoa i'm dead ah trying to keep him away with the sky grenades there try rocket then wingsuiting j-a-c-k jack's autonomous canine killer i love that heck uh jimmy 35 months man call it tommy he'd appreciate that thank you tommy tony bach because he's a robot you guys are you guys have come up with some great names here i'll go see the penguins yeah that's a bug with the the mini-map as well you see how that's destroyed but it's still there on the i can't use this um hovercraft i need transport i got my mr chompy as well you see the charm on the gun i've got t-rex on the gun look see him living the dream is this portal no this is main game it's all that warfare what if that tank is still there oh i've not even been here scatter anti-armor it does a lot of damage [Music] and by love i mean i absolutely hate it i was trying to get in the hovercraft and beam them those ice cliffs have a lot of snipers deathclaw i'm trying to get up there so i could get behind him get the snipers stay back uh ivy thank you for the two what do i think about the map so far i mean i like i haven't really explored everything um there's a nice amount of variety i think my least favorite map is probably the container one what's it called um discarded is the one with the water in india what's the container level called i can't remember you guys will have to tell me you can tell that like it's my least favorite because i don't remember the name of it really difficult to tell where the footsteps are i do have 3d audio on as well manifest that's it thank you see you guys are smarter than i am yeah that's probably my least favorite map it's really hard to tell i'm gonna get flanked here oh okay there's so many i thought my grenade would kill and go on the stairs obviously did not way too many enemies there aren't many squad mates here at all rage quitters thank you for the five you think paul's gonna dominate in popularity yeah i mean paul's definitely gonna be popular you know like they've got that nostalgia angle there as well i mean i'm more interested in the new stuff at the moment but portal's got so much potential and i've said this in my videos before like imagine if they keep developing portal what will it look like in two years it could have bf1 maps in it bf4 it could have zombies pirates dinosaurs battle royale all sorts of custom game modes you know okay i've just got this so i can come up here trying to turn with it it's really difficult it's not showing me the ui as well usually it has a ui when it locks onto something like this big red thing that comes up yeah portal's got massive potential i just really hope that they let you use the logic editor in conquest and breakthrough in the other game modes because at the moment you can only use it for team deathmatch and free-for-all so hopefully they had that as a feature well you'd be so dead weren't you you actually did that that's a friendly side go away you just eat these everywhere and then just lock onto things look there it is there's my grenade now he fled 200 meters away it's where i need a rocket launcher oh man something feels yeah there's something's a bit weird with the gunplay and i do i think it is the spread as well i'm sure it didn't feel like that in the baser hold on take out this wouldn't it be cool if you could target the engines so i'm going to drive it yeah drive me let's go teamwork make a dream work what the hell was that oh the wildcat's so strong really really strong uh brian thank you for the ten antonio thanks for the five am i the only one freaking out there isn't a dedicated tdm rotation you could make it in portal if you wanted to brian clayton thank you for the five you could call your dog wally but dude jimmy thank you very much for the 50 it's very generous danny call it canine medi-pack five dollars thank you last night during the persistence era i was able to get 128 play el alamein with 2042 movement was nothing short of magical that's cool i'll have to try that paul thank you for the 16 months hard scope thank you steven thank you double chin gaming thank you very much orlando's cheers for the five what's my favorite map i don't have a favorite one yet because i've not really played them enough i like this one just because it looks so good you know and the scale of it odd scope cheers for the five got those christmas vibes going now you can't put the christmas tree up until december come on grenade why are you going over there i forgot to put the rocket launcher on guys and now i'm dead mastermix pvp don't you dislike playing depth of field on do i have it on they've captured all of charlie sector i don't think you can turn it off you can turn it off in the other battlefield games i don't you can turn it off in this it's usually here can't disable it that's a shame right rocket launcher what's that smoke grenade i don't want to go back there because that's just pain fight over this for a bit oh my fps took a big hit there when you spawn in your frame rate just dips for a second oh mine does anyway um scatter grenades it's got a radio [Music] there's a bit of lag going on again rubber banding you guys can see that probably this lag yeah not just me play this head glitch as long as i can [Music] try and keep him off this point yeah they're all going crazy in the chat i just take that point there's a tank outside as well so i don't think they can open these doors from the outside so i've got a bit of a tactical advantage here i wish i could disable that like turn that transparency down it's kind of obstructing my view of it okay okay i just ruined my cover fair play okay i'm josh green thank you for becoming members don't help me liam thank you don't help me i like fighting there that was cool i'm gonna go back there well a3 over here stay back do not come over here they say that stuff when you skip the revive was out of a french there i think it was hey i'm sorry that the hovercraft has got side guns as well this thing is ridiculous no one's driving it okay i'll do it i didn't mean it's already pretty ob i didn't realize it had side guns as well look take out that shoot this condor oh it's now that's locking something 560 meters away with the grenades i just threw from here that can't be right there's no way that's one right yeah i was hiding behind cardboard boxes in that building yeah that's why they all blew up i think that's pretty fair play to be honest like i was hiding there had a nice head glitch and the guy just went you know what i've got grenades i'm gonna destroy your cover goodbye how can you not have seen that for playing that many hours i've just never been in that third and four seat on the hovercraft i've only played about seven hours as well if i can get all the way up to e i've not even been to f have i all this match and the match is almost over i've not even been there like the size of this maps insane i think this is the biggest one in the game hey we're just gonna land on the helipad there's an enemy there if you want to shoot i'm gonna i'll do it that's because you're dead my friend god if they got that shot then one for the montage much easier to control this on controller than pc nice and keyboard you got finder control with an analog stick don't get these snipers over here goodbye i bet there's all sorts of easter eggs on this map there's an available there's always an available support drop ready oh no my worst nightmare i hate those things so much can't stand them [Laughter] stay away from me a bit too strong i think so at least connor thanks for becoming a member how'd you get up there continue to fight boris what happened how did they get up there [Music] oh lag again little rubber band in there no dice dead i want to get into that canyon only you can play halo from monday right is that the rumor i saw something about that on twitter i don't know if it's true but that'd be cool yeah the server's lagging look at that little red icon on the left there other crafts are done i go into that canyon down there probably wingsuit but they would have had to get higher than that and that's the highest point on the map i nearly got road killed by that jet that you know to be to be fair if that happens oh that's an enemy tank imagine if i had c4 drop c4 on it i'm still down there grenade tracking it's locked on [Music] hopefully they don't get stabbed grandma watch my back we cannot sustain any more horses i see that 250 degrees 300. oh you dodged so you can use the numbers on the side to aim this it's quite accurate actually you just ping it and then you see the numbers on the side three so if i wanted to hit that car there difficult to hit them though when they're moving like that around 300 meters is there a sniper somewhere how does not like it we now hold charlie sector marking enemy tank at 90 degrees [Music] oh the work no playing make bodies a bad boy yeah i think that's what i think that's part of the law good day's work but i'm not one to brag to go grandma honey badger what's up thanks for the two name the dog dice so i can look at the dog when it can't get around something and go dice please uh rex thank you for the 20 season pixels what do i use to stream my gameplay obs yeah obs with a capture card on a streaming pc uh connor heady hero thank you for becoming members pop belly punch medium settings look same 100 fps what do you think jack yeah i don't really um i don't really see much difference in the settings unless i put ray tracing on ambient occlusion rtao just kills your frame rate at the moment so i wouldn't advise enabling that but every other settings like um let's go hold on every every other setting is uh doesn't really seem to have that much of a big effect on framerate a little bit but not much i found a nice balance i think with these zones but as i said at the start of the stream i did have to overclock my cpu and memory and it bumped my frames upload so i think the game is heavily dependent on cpu and memory performance because i've got a 30 90. so it's not like my gpu's been like it's not good enough it is it's just there's a level of optimization for pc that i think maybe dice should look into got that 30 60 ti struggles yeah i'd love it i'd love it if it was a bit more optimized it's um the reason that i know a lot of people say oh you're only getting 110 frames or whatever but elitist pc gamer i understand that um and for for some for some people for most people especially on consoles 60 fps is fine but my high expectation for battlefield games has come from the performance of battlefront one and two battlefield one the f5 at the start was a bit sluggish but it got really good towards the end so usually dice games are really well optimized for pc the f3 bf4 ran great so my expectations are quite high but um the performance on pcs definitely subpar i mean that's been my experience of it so far um it's quite inconsistent as well i'm sure they'll uh they'll fix it like i said i don't think there's a new nvidia driver yet the mouse can feel a bit input laggy at times as well doesn't feel great so this is a quite nice looking map this like all the water bravo has been secured i actually i don't think i've hated a vehicle more in a battlefield game and these stupid hovercrafts honestly i can't stand them [Music] i will kill it oh how did that not do any damage that's right on it our resources and troops are yeah that's so annoying really annoying they'll take every sector i've got grandma hearing me thank you grandma that's the tank take this sector bravo is ours frame rate's quite low here like look at that top left gives you a lot of like micro stuttering and inconsistency in the mouse movement went down to about 70 there as i said i'm sure they'll optimize it i hope so anyway it should be a priority i think because this game is going to have a lot of pc players it was a top seller on steam can i get over here without being seen i just want to test this thing out you can pull that thing off the side of the ship if you go to those two things there you can actually yank it off i want to see it happen though oh i could arrest you then i think there's just too many enemies on there at the moment oh this goes all the way up what the there's a pair of legs there guys nice always a player on a crane in a battlefield game i'm so dead by the way entire team was there left in silence thank you for becoming a member death structures for the five surprised they disabled dozer shield it was broken apparently there was a bug with dozers shield where you could become invincible so they vaulted it i appreciate that what the hell i don't appreciate that yeah the fact that they actually managed to vault his shield so quickly they haven't been able to do that in previous battlefield games so i think they've built some tech there that enables them to do that so i you know i appreciate the rapid response to that they also change some up with the portal servers as well [Applause] i need my other teammates though to actually attack the things for you so you now know where the tank is we don't stop and we'll check every sector talking no smoking all this graffiti loco look i just it's great you just throw them out honestly if you guys play sundance just get the anti-armor grenades and just just throw them just go like this there you go target it's going to hit something do a bit of damage unless they flare it just run around eating them everywhere i need a ranger delivered at this locker i thought a 420 meters damn sniper boys there they're shooting at me they're shooting at me i don't like it i don't know if it would hit that i think that's too high hovercraft i think i'll fix myself i need to be able to see teammates and medics in this screen as well get him doggo get him stay back i'll fix myself yeah like i've got no i don't know if i should hold on to my revive here or not stay back okay there we go you need to be able to see how far away your teammates are [Music] just disables the hood see sometimes the gunplay just clicks like that and then other times you just get so much spread that it feels weird [Music] see what that is they hurt bad oh we are beaming right now do it again [Music] oh i've got no ammo save me dog best guess we're halfway home is that an enemy there definitely outside my welcome then must have been quite annoyed stay back stay awake get back french yeah yeah i think sundance is a french character our voice lines are annoying at times i think you can turn all the voice lines off if you don't like the voice lines from any of the specialists you can just disable them do we own is that the big ship yeah that's the big ship okay oh missed the money shot got killed by a butcher if we don't stop them they'll take every sector aps mama zander is this released it's released in early access brian brian don't talk to me it's out properly next week on the 19th spawn me on the ship not going to make it oh sick flip bro sick flip oh my game crashed no the screen went black i can go down the level thank you they're gonna drop c4 on me aren't they what i think they're up there again definitely people up there it's fine enemy tank oh i can't aim down though can i he can hit me though maybe i don't know come on let me destroy that oh to be fair you probably couldn't destroy that really there's no hit reg then okay quick reload crazy ready to go [Music] [Music] unexpected tank did you make a huh i want to get through here i'm too chunky two chunks get there you know what i'm just going to eat myself off the edge let's go baby the character knew what i was doing then that's interesting no i'm so dead i'm dead i'm dead i gotta go down with the ship richard you you can't really drive up there bro it's you get stuck on everything i'm sorry i mean i haven't even sniped anyone i changed the sniper i haven't sniped anyone they're over there weren't they yeah frame rate on this map is not not ideal [Music] the aim is buggy at the moment but there's a fix okay baron knox i'll check it out are they thank you left in silence thank you for becoming a new member adam could you do a tutorial for portal builder i could but there'll be people who'd do a lot better than i would chopin thanks to the 20 mr j cheers for the three months name the dog bob dog interesting hamatsu thank you for the five forces we can't win this one played for a while i use sundance from the ammo crate and spam the anti-tank grenades at helicopters yeah that's that's the strat man emma cheers for the fight what settings am i running can't seem to hit a consistent 60 for life in there i'll show i'll show you again i did show earlier but maybe you weren't here so it's not just my pc that no real gangster that pc performance is not good for this game yet not good [Music] who's your go-to specialist um i mean i quite like playing sundance i might change now though just you know give a bit of variety to the stream [Music] oh jack you're a geek yeah i am love it we're all geeks aren't we i mean if you're watching this right now you're probably a massive nerd like i am let's go matt thank you for the 13. thank you very much man wilding with the tank on the ship yeah sean get amanda meth jacksepticeye in the chat that's crazy killed any penguins yet i did try sean no i i didn't i don't think you can i couldn't bring myself to do it they're so adorable how are you actually loading in the matches i just click play and then it puts me in a game i've already played clyde let's go and play that good performance but for expensive top tier pcs yeah you need um you need a pretty high spec system very cpu heavy reaper i mean i've got my uh cpu clocked to five gigahertz i gave it a little boost earlier it gave me about 20 to 30 more frames but i've done i just skewed into it and i canceled and then i didn't even look i was looking at the chat teabag did a tutorial to kill the penguins vladimir no that's unacceptable vibes thank you for come on are the helicopter controls still combined like the jets i'm not sure um emma wanted to see my video settings i think so here we go 1440p 240 hertz turn all this fancy effect stuff off high high medium medium medium all the way down anti-aliasing on low have the off the lss off that one ruins your frame rate at the moment so i would not recommend turning that on that's it you are also streaming at the same time yes siddhant but i'm streaming from a different pc i have a streaming pc so my gaming pc isn't doing anything it's just feeding the video to a capture card so this is how the game plays i'm not trying to trick you or anything this is it kaleidoscope again no i don't want that stop night hunter thank you for the two turn ambient occlusion off chris if you turn it off though it looks awful i really think you need ambient occlusion otherwise it's so flat renewal [Music] right we're not playing renault shadow blast you literally wouldn't even be able to tell the frame rate past 60 without a counter oh you can shadow blast it's a massive difference between 60 to 120 for example the feel of the game how smooth it is how smooth it looks how your mouse feels you can pick up on all of that the big difference from 60 to 120 i'll be happy with 120 consistently but when it starts dropping to like 60 70 for me as a pc player that feels really horrible the mouse sensitivity is all inconsistent and sluggish you start to get more input lag you can tell above and thank you for the 40 from india what's up man thank you this allied agricultural research facility in egypt is vital to global food production i've played a little bit hazard yeah navalized infantry forces andrew to the facility you must stop the americans from claiming it dlss isn't working at the moment i saw a tweet earlier it works with the studio driver but not with the main driver and i don't know what the studio driver is so i don't really want to risk messing around with that kind of stuff i've not i'm not mckay yet mckay and paker locked have i maybe i have what level am i 13. i think 15 is mckay i want to be able to do that that guy yeah i'll try a bit whoa bit of sniping on this map targeted for capture beginning attack it's the x12 on i don't know it's not an option harry unless you can do it in a config file i'd say look at all these butterflies the very future it's future then let me get a tank shell in my face honor well they can be at the top there as well this is cool man like i'm just exploring all the maps you know like learning where people can go banking routes all that kind of stuff interesting you guys are dead that wall goes does that go all the way across the level what the wall goes all the way across uh ross macintosh thank you night hunter cheers santo 35 months very kindly man which gpu do i have rtx 3090 what yeah the frame rate's much better on the portal maps i found and i think that's just because there's less players and the maps aren't as big the wall jon snow the night's watch the night is dark and full of terror as jon snow you know nothing have a bit of that sun go on grandma i'm sorry [Music] sorry what east i put a robodog it's not working grandma i can hear so many people up here i think i could easily kill myself with that all right i'm gonna go up here chat and i think there's about 10 people what are you doing nano gamer cheers so i can't tell i think they i think these are enemies this is why you need a ui for this bit like i know that's an enemy because of the red but i'd love to know if i've got teammates up on the roof as well whether to skip the revival or not get back nano tears becoming a member becoming a member for becoming a member status reporter those grenades are so good so good um right we're on the other side here that hit marker was really delayed wasn't it did you guys see that first shot that i fired you can throw most sectors on the battlefield you just throw grenade at me yeah it's a cool map evan don't talk to me don't come to me where do i buy much sean we don't have any merch at the moment buddy if you see any merch online it's unofficial oh no yeah hovercraft instantly dead i'm getting sick of those already i'm so annoyed stay back uh unknown planet thank you for the five zero one thanks for the two what's up how you doing hey ray j tom connell hello adele appreciate you guys being here thank you is there a way to have it so whenever i spawn it's already got the anti-armor grenade selected because i'd love that mckay you're dead very dangerous there's a door here does that go to some stairs or just the other side of the wall other side of the wall look at this life death stop the u.s forces from conquering every sector what's up there like is there's two points over there apparently the land is ours drop strength diminished for drawing reinforcements grenade sorry grandma us forces holding together but they're burning resources that casper's gonna look at me we've got that point i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead kobe ah didn't mean to shoot nice i'm gonna kill myself think about the children dice think about the children you can throw most sectors on the battlefield i'd hear i'll go running past i'll do a takedown now joshua we're playing at 1440p [Applause] i'm giving away my position now nice little shield here huh how long can i stay here you hear the footsteps i was saying to jacksepticeye it's like they've all got clogs on or something ah they found me spawn beacons need to be a common gadget they are aren't they i just don't think anyone's unlocked them yet don't help me hey tom what's up david joshua god the footsteps sounds so weird stephen yeah hi gabby good to see you again what's up rosco what audio settings htrf 3d audio i think it's the best setting uh look at all these tanks i mean that's a lot of tanks not even use the jets yet i'll get a ranger why not there's one other person here somewhere 1v1 fair play to this guy trying to capture the objective though fair play on their own okay not a great map for sundance this because there's not much height unless you're jumping out of vehicles or something what's this green sludge here what's all that about weird it sounds like you're gonna turn the corner and find a group wearing clogs getting a river dance lesson that's a pretty good description of it paul yeah i agree with you look at the la river down here chuck maurice over there ferrari specialist good day to you sir i'm chuck morris i'll kick you in the face if you want that's his catchphrase algae farming is that what it is interesting uh a deuce stop the u.s forces from conquering every sector i guess you could take out jessica's knock sansa target i get up there oh you you there's someone up there bro don't come to me i can't believe there's someone up there already i want revenge they're gonna see me coming from a mile away unless they just died i saw a blood spot then that's how you get revenge oh my god they've got a spawn beacon here i don't need help stay away i'm sorry ignore me i mean this is a target rich environment right now and i'm not hitting toffee someone hit me though unbelievable since unbelievable alex i like that you can do that though you know if someone's high up in a position like that spawn in a helicopter wingsuit get revenge that's kind of sick what the hell ready with package call him for support if you get five straight headshots i'll ask out my crush you should do it anyway if 786 just do it man why not we've got to lose everything okay you never try you never know right what the that doesn't look good they need to be much further away and there needs to be way less of them seagulls what's going on there everywhere you look there's something going on is there a scoreboard dylan there's that it's not really your classic battlefield scoreboard though i think it should be an option just let people have the classic one that's but that's default and there's an option to turn the classic scoreboard on that's fine why not how can they still up there wait what too far i go for a shot might as well fully secured not a headshot headshot where is that guy oh down below it's that butcher guy again don't come to me okay brandon thanks for the two objectives santos don't give them life it's their in-game chat you can talk to your team and your squad but you can't talk to the other team stay back i'll fix myself it's never i just want the attack helicopter that's all i want i want to mess around with it for a bit it's never available a tornado is it let's see i mean what the insecure osprey please what one of our objectives is no longer secure why did that wall just explode that sound is completely busted as well see the sound plays see the sound still plays after you finish shooting weird attacking take a bite die medical assistance so what's this then this is a a1 i assume this this is their gimme flag attack helicopter's gonna kill me they're capturing a2 stay see if i can find them we'll see if they find me i'll just be in the building if i was trying to take that point they put smoke up you were the guy killing me weren't you that's a tank come on squad mates let's go take it out dice yeah that's really broken that sound what the hell so weird we have taken control of an objective we can throw most [Music] let's go i don't think about any rez's no squad mate please is that a medic i think that's a medic thank you very much i'm in a bug like that it's probably fixed really easily i wonder if it's on the other pistols [Music] it's wearing armor i give up they got a quad bike up there how did they do that look at this guy closing in on target control echo sector neither of those hit stop the u.s forces for some reason it went after the tank that was like 300 meters away rather than the jeep that was right there why don't they have voice chats at launch i don't know i mean they should really right especially for console players like playing on your own if you're not in a group like voiceover ip i think you can use the can you use like playstation chat or whatever the party chat or whatever it's called i guess you could use that but yeah they need to have a voiceover ip that's the wrong type of grenade isn't it again when i spawn in let me pick a default i'm dead now i think dice said they're working on that though i remember reading a blog about it a couple weeks ago so hopefully that comes soon i'm sure there'll be a patch tornadoes just going ham right now how about this point i don't even know if you can shoot people out of that i'll play that point now too many people there i wonder if the emp grenades lock on i don't know this would be a great game to do a myth to start videos captured by us forces [Music] i'm just trying to be a nuisance right keep them busy or they're trying to capture that flag send the ranger over here that was rude you got yourself killed there didn't you mate [Music] that's obviously the sniper spot isn't it tracking [Music] [Music] hey josh what's up jared that's good yeah that's the first one we want isn't it victory is ours [Music] what's the spotting like there's not really you can spot vehicles and you can spot positions but you don't really spot players i'm ready for a run too that guy's level 24 spectacular afro cheers for the five uh santos i use the 39ers [Music] yeah this sounds busted on it brandon let's make some trouble who should i play us i want to play someone different now i'm still not level 15. i mean please let me get to level 15 hold on cancel this unlock the ak i've not even used the lmg once i want that dmr that's the one that's ridiculously op got some things for the sniper now no different ammo types yet barrels shortened barrel long barrel that's what you want isn't it more velocity jordan you're level 22 already that's crazy what is dmr oh man i like this ui needs a massive improvement like for pc there's so many clicks you have to make you should just be able to click here like if i wanted to customize that site there for example my brain says you can click this you can't you have to go site and then you can change it and then you have to go back it's a bit um difficult on pc to do this kind of wish you could just click things you know ak's difficult to control kaleidoscope no no no what map haven't we played we haven't played orb at all that was the bazer map we haven't played manifest there we go you can see here by the way what a map you're queuing into just a tip you guys didn't know that yeah fps is in the top left a bit tedious yeah that's a deathclaw oh this game's already started though um should i run i run the ak i don't even have a site for it we have lost control oh man there's a lot of recall on that geez i'm not wrong [Music] you have over 30 rounds and you still haven't played orbital i wonder why do you think because it was the beta map they're giving it a really low percentage chance at the moment just to be honest i played that map quite a lot in the beta so i reckon if it came up i'd play it maybe once or twice but i've played it so much already tank isn't it apparently you can move these i remember seeing that in a video these giant things here you can move them i don't know how though our troops are holding sector delta hostile's attacking one of our objectives both sectors are now under our control artillery there's no way i'm gonna hit that excuse me what the hell go away you can run through these that's friendly with clogs on friendly's targeting alpha one are you jumping around how do you know how does that guy not die there did they have armor on maybe i don't know i refuse medical assistance uh nincompoop thank you for the five stay awake did they fix the service she would conquest all i was able to ask not with custom servers yeah i haven't had any issues today queuing up for a game they they fixed it i think okay i'm flying this [Music] right it wasn't for me anyway you know never belonged to me in the first place so difficult to control this on pc dead broken neck jeez the recoil is insane on that might change when you've got some um attachments maybe all right lads big ladder there too charlie teammates distracting me okay grandma don't worry i feel like batman flying through this area no way that grandma went down there somewhere we shouldn't move up there friendly troops securing delta one resources are dangerously low damage is quite high sorry how did i get shot from on top of the crane oh thank you yes look at that that's like the second res i've had all night thank you they're still up there i shouldn't have given them the idea should i i've got you running oh ruined cole you're getting 130 fps good for you man that's pretty good don't help me i wish i could get 130 fps jack fov is this 80. what the [Music] fly oh lebron's over i didn't really get to play that man that much done we've lost enough troops for today sometimes they just line up for you all right casper how you doing a good day's work this was one to remember [Music] can you show us the cyber warfare guy who hacks people rao i could do yeah but i think he's kind of useless i don't know there's angel okay i'll play his own girl i'll miss not having the wingsuit though let me tell you i'm nearly on mckay one more level to go hey fat bernie what's up rome thank you for becoming a new member you made cheers for the one donation afro like i said i don't know don't know what my favorite map is so far i'd like to play that one again because i bet i basically didn't play it then so dude there you go that's my skin why is there a countdown to matchmaking what does that mean he's useful against helis what because you can just keep giving yourself anti-air missiles and rockets and stuff okay i just go no dice please come on dice we can do it hourglass oh that's the desert map isn't it we haven't played that tonight wallhack lady's still locked yeah i don't know what level she is it's pretty late i think [Music] where's the dun dun dun yeah it's not really i mean i've heard it in breakthrough the main theme conquest doesn't really have the main theme in it your kills don't count towards unlock have you had the same problem i've not had that problem yet maroon sheet no can you try the new dmr out have i unlocked it no i'll switch to rao the city of doha there's way too much time at the start of the game as well like i just want to play you know all these cutscenes and stuff just let me play we are going to retrieve them but we need you oh here we go i unlocked it okay this dmr is disgusting right you guys get ready for this this is going to be great um okay here we go now there's more cutscenes though here isn't there just let me get into the game bit too much downtime at the start i think uh south thank you for the 10 how's the game feeling so far yeah i mean it's um i'm having fun it's just the performance is really like really subpar for me makes the mouse feel kind of awful [Music] yeah this dmr is silly i've got loadout crate or ammo was that plates it's something a calf cheers for the 10. it's very kindly man good to see you in the chat cuff lock on from that distance at 20 degrees oh this is the so i thought i'd equip the stinger it's the m5 get it done why thank you for the two you can really use the hovercrafts on the buildings in this game i'm just playing on my own as well i think it would be much better if i had a squad with me like on cons communicating but i wanted to just play solo for the first stream i'll try and sit with my squad i think that guy's got the yeah they've unlocked the 30 millimeters there they're really good anti-infantry a helicopter but i wish i had the stinger instead [Music] any teammates about can't tell don't try to help me don't try to help me bravo sector has been seized by hostiles i've not unlocked hang on i've not even unlocked it yet so i can't use it anyway i know i can there it is okay well that's armor you can just dish out armor these missiles did i just kill myself with fire i think we bowel killed me thank you afron afron afro very kindly man not even had a chance to use the dmr yeah just been killed by vehicles okay so armor for you what should hit yeah it's gone so i suppose what you do with this guy is you call in the loadout you could make like a little nest i suppose put some shields up with your squad and then you could use this to get ammo back i'm here to help so if i switch now yeah i'm gonna just replenish my missiles right i could do that in theory give me an assessment an assessment it's not looking good oh you just kind of toss out the armor one second very very big support character this guy it's arranged i'm a little close to my friend come on no chicken i mean that feels really horrible when you zoom in i can tell that my frames are dropping big time there oh no i just want to an objective is under siege how to get down you go two shot dmr oh my god the sandstorms coming in all yours mate i could give myself armor as well and reload that's so there's so many tanks around what's going on we have to take that objective radio thanks for the 20. very kindly use this use this can't wait till everyone has this it's gonna be so much fun i'd like to put a different site on it though site's not great actually feels awful so bad oh my god what the hell that is awesome great effect we do not capture me what one of our objectives is being invaded hello i can actually use an attack helicopter now and i can't see anything of course it's a great time to be an attack helicopter violet let me tell you i need a gunner can you get thermals i literally can't see a thing it's probably a builder here we go here's the buildings control over come on someone spawn on me we can throw most sectors on the battlefield please give me a gunner [Music] this guy can easily kill me if he wants to have a gun hey so big look at the size of it i just had one squad mate they could spawn on me that'd be so good do it myself damn it ruin now [Music] bye one of our objectives is making a little camp look at that [Music] okay buddy keep pressing the wrong button helicopters are just falling out of the sky listen everywhere how many vehicles are there geez 100 degrees long distance look at this crazy change of plans they're fighting over there can i just oh no it's coming back yeah that gives me four that gives me four rockets back tank but the tank just hit the helicopter on the way down where's the enemy infantry i don't know i think they're over at the stadium i feel like i've just been fighting vehicles the whole match that reload at least the sandstorm's gone you have to really run over that to get it it's gonna be our range this has got message let's go we have spent half our resources an objective is under siege maybe i should go to the stadium so it's over there insane absolutely insane so broken um call in the hovercraft it's wasting transport deployment that's my location there's a hovercraft up there got stuck oh yours mate let's go take me down to the hovercraft city thank you radio demon once again we can fly ah it's not quite the same actually i might be able to get on top of this using hover spider let's go let's go come on come on come on come on oh oh periscope ruined needs to be a flat surface going vertically up for that to work this is a stadium i'm not literally not been here yet where's the capture point right at the top maybe look at this place it's huge there's a crane there as well go up again is i think there's a robo dog here somewhere definitely enemies here somewhere that's a tank flying off the roof normal ruin the map is huge yeah it is it's massive stay away from me really big map charlie sector is now under us command uh did all the squad die no i wanted to explore that a bit i haven't been in here either the city oh take this point here i really want a different site for this to get einstein armor for everyone let's go i don't think you can go in there tank you're not gonna fit me or maybe there's a chance what is this what is this recon vehicle doing you do you man it's stuck there go up again i think all the enemies are up here again [Music] i hate this cryo damage thing i'm not a big fan of that just weird capture points really small here we've taken objective alpha 3. all dead so i suppose you could climb up there as well if you wanted to u.s forces have taken all of echo sector you get someone there i'm gonna for me want some armor armor for you want armor more armor let's go everyone gets armor oh my god armor almond you got armor okay that was cool i mean we took the entire stadium then although we've lost the rest of the map so i guess i'll die you squeeze through that this goes to the main entrance oh that's sneaky i like that yeah it's just cool to explore these new places 100 degrees is that a tank up there yep we have to push back into the city now but i mean they literally when i said they've taken the rest of the map they have they've got every other point all of them people don't want to drive do they they just get in and they immediately switch to the gonna sit i haven't even seen the city good job see if we can have a look before the round ends we hope that's not a mine we need uh i'm stuck down here now okay you have to get out lads mighty tickets we could get a good look at the city i think there's a point up there and then there's two on ground level a couple of people in chat have said go over there and have a look so we're getting is that someone in the tuk-tuk it is living the dream [Music] i can't shoot through it apparently quickly oh i thought i had him do you ever get to see the other enemies [Laughter] well it's a big map i mean i've done a lot of running around as well i feel like that there hasn't been much going on this game for me like all the all the fighting's going on here look i didn't really get to explore that then either [Music] conquering every sector stop them hey that was a weird map defeat is inevitable here but we can endure this loss [Music] might be better in breakthrough that one a good day's work but i'm not one to brag some things you learn some things you're born to do this was one to remember [Music] this was one to remember not for me do panda bears just for the five the level of detail put the further away you're so it gets quite funny watching in a tank or snipers you'll see people ice skating yeah i've seen that a few times panda they're kind of like pause and do a mario thing don't they um i think angel you want to be playing in the squad let's get the party started right as a solo player i'm not sure is he's a good choice maybe for taking out helicopters i got a few though could try rao the hacking things how effective that is did i get anything for the dmr man please i need one of these on them [Music] orbital okay see what orbitals like now were you with the snow uniform in the middle of qatar yeah lucas that's just how i roll you know the snow map is amazing on breakthrough okay what's my refresh rate 240 really yeah that was the dmr's 18. my frame rate is so bad though that on that map like it just feels awful to shoot i really really really hope they optimize the game on pc because it it makes the mouse feel horrible so difficult to aim squad is ready for deployment might be all right on this oh geeky you've got two assault rifles yeah it does take there's quite a bit of a grind i wonder if the progression is quite grindy because there's only 22 guns in the game just went airborne you'll be under siege the whole time so it won't be pretty but holding this facility is vital to us interest in the space domain transfer gear up and get ready to move rocket launcher it's still not unlocked anything really i mean i haven't played long why did jack remove the fps dice instructions yeah dice just called me while i was streaming said jack can you please remove the fps i can't allow you to have it on there anymore sorry hey little cuckoo what's up chicken good to see you oh sorry dice is on the phone again one second let me turn it off oh whoops what do i do do i just look at vehicles and scan them is that all i can do sure i mean surely that's too far away hey zs what's up thank you for coming if we don't shot them what the hell when you zoom in as well the frame rate goes so low like it just feels horrible with the high power zoom scopes what am i actually getting like it drops like 10 fps ugh it needs a lot of optimization man detector echo is under our control i'm going sir accessing network i just want to test the thing come on keep away from me no no friend who's around what's up gregors how you doing um it's good day go to the roof i don't really understand this guy like what's am i missing the point i can hack players as well right but why would you hack them like you might as well just shoot them oh my goodness bulletproof grenade out grenade out i can't have that friendly it doesn't matter about your sniper i've got a two shot dmr let's try it i'll go shoot me it's illegal oh no see there like the frame rate horrible there awful that dip you zoomed in pain packing players spot some for you and your team if you kill them while they're hacked it highlights the guy's squads okay that's an enemy isn't it there's some medics over there but i don't think they're gonna come over here row is handy for disabling the vertibirds oh the ospreys right yeah yeah because it makes sense that they'd be flying a bit lower right because that's all they seem to do there were some enemies here situation smoothly sir oh i wanted to get a tank there that would have been cool i've not managed to hack anything yet really oh that didn't kill him dead that guy just got violated by something surely there's a sniper hang on can i hack i just want to test it hacking i mean it takes so long don't try to help me echo objective secure sector under control there's a tank here can we hack the time sectors are now under our control be far away accessing terminal got it oh wow [Music] are you in a resume please please one of our objectives is under attack please resume please resume you're right there please please there's so many grandmas not one of them resume what the hell why hack a door what's the point of hacking a door oh 60 fps pain okay no by the time you've done something you just get objectives is under shot please spending serious resources to stay in this got some that our forces control so much fun though there's a lot of enemies there like that just feels awful man i don't want to come i don't want to complain too much because i don't want the uh the stream to become like you know really negative but the frame rate like i need to fix this i'm trying to hack something every time i hack something it just go like i either get shot or it just doesn't work objective i don't sell you okay okay i'll get hacked so what did that do it didn't disable it or anything so what's the point does it does it actually do anything does it actually i don't i really don't know what's it supposed to do [Applause] sector outfit is ours they've acknowledged the frame rate issues up there okay i've been looking at twitter while i was streaming if i get a rest there i mean that's a grandma there she could resume allies are engaging at delta one objective lost we need to retake what the hell that go down our resources and troop strength bye the problem i have with this guy is that i understand like hacking vehicles could be effective if it like because it happened to me didn't it actually in one of the previous matches i was driving a tank and my screen went black for a second but i felt like my pc had crashed or something so i think it was a mixture of my pc actually crashing for a second and the game ui but in terms of hacking soldiers i don't really see the point because it takes so long you might as well just shoot them because it they're gonna shoot you if you don't even if you're behind them you hack them you kill them it reveals people nearby but it isn't like a massive area right like i remember seeing it in the trailer and thinking well that just seems a bit pointless it's still dangerous accessing network this is it looks like they're staying over there the control sector charlie got that jet maybe hostiles are trying to seize one of our objectives this is really confusing what's it actually doing what is he doing oh my god i swear okay i'm done playing this guy i don't i just don't understand the appeal of playing that guy it doesn't seem useful at all okay i'm sorry ralph you're just not ready you need you need some you need a better passive you need a better active ability something you need something because right now that ain't it if you compare it that character to take as well the wall hack lady i know no one's really unlocked her yet but when people do why would you play israel it hacks and the hell he can't shoot but still like it just doesn't seem that not good why is webster blocked one of our objectives because he's not unlocked yet i need to be level 15 i'm not level 15. 50 fps oh my god please the armor [Laughter] sick helicopter i can't believe you're away from me i can't believe you've done this i'm playing at 1440p robert with you i wonder if you could shoot through that little crack there see the other and the enemy team revive each other literally just seeing it with my own eyes wait i am rao i'm gone i thought i switched one of our objectives i literally switched to falc did it not it didn't work i'm sure okay fair enough i thought that i'd switched wesley says you have to restart the game every few rounds to keep fps up memory league maybe i do feel like it's got progressively worth worse actually [Music] both sectors [Music] above i see someone i can revive i'll try and go for it ladder got one south hills a lot quicker now lagging it was lagging okay so there's a ladder here look at you moving [Music] have i unlocked him yet no nearly i think i'm nearly 15 right 14. we've lost control of an objective we've spent half our resources by now and what if i just put everything on low will that even make a difference i think it will no it didn't really make a difference did it look a little bit metallic is not required one back here yeah perhaps i should restart i won't restart during the stream though i'll do it later and check a lot of people here man it actually feels so awful i'm sorry i know it probably sounds like i'm throwing excuses out but aiming is just horrible the lss doesn't do anything let me show you i'll show you guys i'll show you that it doesn't do anything watch okay let me go over here 87 86 the lss performance we don't stop them they'll take every sector oh look the fps is the same look at the top left it's the same that's on performance as well like it just doesn't work it doesn't do anything is that gonna take off turn off future frame rendering i mean it was off no difference i just think it's chalk like i think they need some big optimization patches on the game and there could be a memory leak as well because when i started playing earlier on the stream my fps was way higher than this i feel like it was anyway because the future is now i'm gonna get up here and there'll be some guy camping it or something charlie 170 tickets left allies are securing one what's my pc sir i mean it's pretty like pretty good [Music] well you can just live up here like that this is me now i live on this rocket hello oh damn unreloaded [Applause] i've become rocket man i'm william shatner they can't win while we hold those sectors look so silly doesn't matter about your sniper rifle mate what the hell training men [Music] i mean i pressed spacebar i just didn't pull out the shoe [Music] [Laughter] [Music] guys please [Music] no one on this point [Music] one more shotgun people down here we now control delta there's some shields down here something's been going on someone's been up to no good down there stay friendly holy sh what the hell [Music] yeah it's gotta be a vehicle all hostiles retreating you've heard your rep today no pants anyone seen a tornado yet yes everything as i expected i told you to keep up i want to play manifest does it again manifest run it at 1080p and see if it makes a difference corey i don't think it will because dlss is just downscaling the resolution and it didn't make a difference so honestly i don't think it would it would change anything dropping the resolution down oh we can actually play as mckay now restart game okay i'll restart my game see if it makes a difference quit the game play let's see if there is a memory because that's interesting [Music] i hope there's not what do you think chat is this going to work is this going to get better frames [Music] uh renting life the lesser the guns the less the grind the less the worry enjoying the game thank you renting life uh buster do you think the performance is even worse than the beta the beta somehow ran really well for me um yeah the bait did actually run quite well for me thinking back reporting shinobius thank you for the two hacking works gives enemies frame rate issues can you imagine is that why are people just hacking me is that why i'm losing my fps uh willow coyote thank you for the five hackathon and it disables its weapons and flares one bow combo see maybe that's what i was missing when i was playing as rao i don't want to play orbital again i wasn't really following up the hack with anything you know manifest perfect uh mellow thank you for the five i'm not playing at 4k try one i'm playing a 1440p all these soldiers look like they're five six yeah xavier there's something with the scale isn't there i think the character models look a bit small sometimes everyone radio very serious play with uh an smg maybe the liberty of singapore is essential to international stability today they require our protection okay here we go yeah why does it start with an acog surely you would want it to start with a red dot sight or something like that oh let's see the fps i mean it feels i feel like i'm getting a bit more than on orbital but the game doesn't feel as stuttery anymore it feels a bit more responsive but maybe that did actually help a little bit i think it feels better now the mouse actually is a bit more responsive right okay i've got i need to remember i've got a grappling hook with this guy they have secured echo sector it is all on low though now nearly 120 fps there it's gonna dip though isn't it requesting a ranger drop at this location it's a little bit better stay by my side yeah and you know what it is actually quite a lot i thought it was going to dip further but it's like up in the hundreds now seems a lot better it's a shame though you shouldn't have to like restart or mess with your settings to get a decent frame rate fingers crossed they fix it i'm gonna shut up about it now mike thank you for the 20. this map should be harder to run the normal tour yeah maybe let's fly here we go wait for an nvidia driver as well see if it improves let's try this smg pbx i think it's cool it just it just didn't work no i'm cool down up we go time to reload that's how you get inside here is that my doggo what are you doing here dogger it fires quite strong as well i mean this feels a million times better than how it just was actually aim at things now without stuttering oh lots of enemies there stay away from me get up do not come to me i have my doggo got in there it must have passed through the building and then onto the roof no doggo please not like this oh man that's nice it's just instantly like my enjoyment of the game has increased because it doesn't feel horrible to play what did i do to make it feel better simon i just restarted the game [Music] i can actually control recoil now it's great i love it i think they're below us aren't they no med kit come back just heated it off the edge i needed that i really needed that down what the hell was that grenade thing weird reloading cover me okay i had the opposite effect that's a fire hydrant call me once for holding the objective i see that angle did you echo fully secured helicopter oh grenades hello oh no no no these guys i literally pressed it several times i spam spacebar so hard then hey come here are solving one of our objectives hello nice to meet oh this uh pbx is pretty tasty oh it's moving look i i was starting to feel motion sick it's like why why am i feeling motion sick turns out this thing is moving how far would it go trying to hook on to that actually feels like a real game now i could just have this on every map that'd be great i might just always play on those things away we go we tesla truck pioneer restart game after every map no no we're drawing [Laughter] oh i did a lot of damage bye oh you can't swim under water can you they claimed stop the u.s forces from conquering every no enemies on the point requesting a ranger at the marker can i be killed by my own ranger been a myth in here stranger come to me no doesn't like it match blast actually like save my ass there [Music] and they're dead everything's coming up milhouse let's get going go down let's get going proceed according to plan i think they're above me on the top turbo ladder see that rapid speed yes robo dog getting it done wait time or ladder i love that don't shoot me don't shoot me um jack you forgot to stop at the stop sign wyatt i don't i don't abide by the rules ain't me probably a bit too far away for the old grapple hook that just stopped can i jump off and get it oh man this is awesome sorry how many bullets i have to shoot i've got four shots left guys stop the u.s forces from conquering yeah sometimes as well when you aim with the glock it unscopes you it is spider-man isn't it it's kind of cool i've never done anything like this in a battlefield game before my dog is going absolute harm on everything down there love it imagine if you had grapple hook plus wingsuit how cool would that be you go d1 i'm batman attempting to catch up i'm gonna need that ammo grandma please oh see you guys up here i drop a car on their heads invalid i need a transfer vehicle what if that will actually drop on their heads and kill them it just bounced off and exploded no oh they're back up there could you grapple hook onto a helicopter yeah you can uh winter thank you for the two months how's your day going yeah it's good i'm a lot happier now like that previous round on orbital i felt quite sad like my performance was really bad i wasn't having a good time but like now i've restarted the game i quite quite enjoying this map gunplay feels a lot better there's the mario thing there you see that like for a split second they were like like frozen skating along the ground thank you for all tuning in tonight guys i mean it's been quite an exciting first couple hours for me i didn't even here put it on semi water i mean it's raining fire bad weather it's a bloody tornado okay i mean can you really just call that bad weather i don't know oh no nice oh stuck there no destruction there's not much gabby um there's little bits here and there with certain walls and buildings the portal maps have got the most destruction on i would say like these bits here like you can blow holes in balls these used to be buildings but i mean it doesn't have the same level of destruction as like bf3 for example going but it does have tornadoes i'd like a bit more destruction maybe it's a compromise because they've got 128 players in ai and stuff i'm having a blast here i'm really enjoying this maybe mckay is my guy let me put my shoe then terrible stay back lanky thanks for the five can you tell me how breakthrough is likely i've not really played much breakthrough to be honest with you so i don't think i could give you a good impression of it now stuck again you can go all the way up are they increase the range on that what the controller they've captured objectives by what weapon is that pbx i mean there's so much spread there what the hell it's probably a stupid idea but i'm doing it anyway shh what am i doing oh i couldn't transfer quick enough stay back breakthrough is pretty crazy right pure chaos we might do breakthrough tomorrow then or we'll do we might do portal tomorrow that's the thing what i like like there's a lot of um different well there's a few different game modes and ways to like stream this and make content for me that's good you know that's great so tomorrow we could do portal and then the day after we could do hazard zone and then the day after that we could try breakthrough and then the day after that we could try like custom portal experiences that people have made if someone's done a gun game or a zombie mode or something it's a new battlefield game it's exciting for me it's at least anyway definitely some problems though i think it's inherently fun but there's there's some issues that need addressing asap you're welcome i don't have any attachments for this pbx either and it's just ripping through people no one up there is there oh sweet pie enjoy i do enjoy a sweet pie cherry pie apple pie oh a bit of custard bit of ice cream maybe living the dream robo dog help please yes thank you made supplies for you [Music] never mind robo doggy will help rubber don't kill kill destroyed rubble dog revived me alexa revive me hey google buy 24 toilet rolls alexa by dyson v7 hoover stay away from me it's not working the dog didn't revive me jayton thanks for the five yeah i mean there'll be there'll be big improvements for sure i hope so you know i think it's inherently fun it's it's a good sandbox um i'd like to play it with friends tomorrow maybe and just see what squad plays like it is team play [Music] victory is ours no pets i can't be held accountable for that fights like that keep you sharp my back balance what's up harris hey there [Music] alexa just bought 20 dyson vacuums i don't believe that i don't believe that what am i graphic saying i just put everything on low my alexa just said hey jack i don't believe you don't believe you so i think we've played all the maps there at least once no problem paul i'd happily pay we got the red dot kind of go to work time to go to work actually i love the gameplay with this guy but the character and the design i can't i can't get on board with it so it's just i don't like it oh new smg there under barrel long barrel is quite late for that pathology jack alexa actually repeating the toilet roll order did it sorry oh please well i didn't see what map it was [Music] hourglass okay i had a really bad time playing this last time so give it another shot i wonder if i'll be under the same [Music] looks like a toad is it the eyes yeah maybe it's the eyes [Music] oh man just go back and watch the go back and watch the orbital round and you know you see how i feel about it extreme conditions have caused a mass evacuation for reports say russian troops are moving into seized trucks that got caught what's my fps like you can see it okay but it's important enough to secure the area okay am i on the other team now expect plenty of resistance i love this by the way a battlefield game with cross play pc playstation xbox i think that's super cool never had that before in a battlefield game [Music] he's the rarest okay uh johannes thank you for the 449 that's very kindly man i've been following you since bf3 days you were 13. glad to see you finally back on bf over warzone well yeah i can actually stream this battlefield game because there's a lot of anti-cheat stuff going on and hopefully that stops the rage hackers following me when i'm streaming it'd be difficult to see though if there were rage hackers because the scoreboard like you can't really see what's going on what if you do this one no that doesn't show you scores does it that's a shame he's captured by using a controller no a mouse's keyboard it's been secured we could do some hovercraft jumping again no because then if i do that i'm just messing around i'm not actually playing the game i want to get a better experience of this map try and play it with a different character and see how it goes then again i could just i could just do this i know this is really what you all want to say isn't it this is what this is what you came here for this is the real battlefield now this is what you all wanted isn't it dirty perverts okay here we go building to build in what leroy jenkins yes heat gameplay pete gameplay wait what so many people in chat are confused you weren't here at the start

gotta control it gotta control it yes yes hi bro no biggie just a hovercraft on the roof don't worry about it i live here now i mean i might just try and take off [Laughter] [Music] stupid it's like

go oh you can see through the floor with that interesting can i get out of the stairs it's hovercraft just destroying everything they're attacking it's a menace to society someone needs to stop this thing honestly if it doesn't get stopped then humanity's doomed if these things take over what if it had ai come on come on yes and we go little turn little turn i know you can i know that you've got it in you hovercraft i know that you can do it you just want the hot dog from the stadium it's so busted okay if we go like this and then it doesn't turn it doesn't turn guys i'm sorry go back go back out here are you friendly no just trying to i'm just trying to live my my best life for the holographic guys so is it really that much to ask it's really that difficult for me to live my best life with a hovercraft sounds like a v1 doesn't it [Music] my frame rate's so much better now as well after that restart let's go that's it you know how to control it you got it tango on my mark 310 around 300 meters something's just flown into us i think i don't really know oh this thing's really good go here [Music] let me okay that doesn't make sense okay everything went better than expected no it didn't enemy i'd like to go over there ready to deliver supplies the guy above me i think please lock onto the one that's right in front of me grenade how about that no it doesn't want to okay hostiles are taking an objective [Music] i'm looking for snipers on roofs one batting the night who that ninja thank you for the ten never mind warzone these battlefield streams are what i really enjoy watching thank you man here we meet thank you for the five as well when you play a character who's got movement abilities this map is just way better there's a lot of infantry here oh no why did you turn around you must see me on the map a brazen gel we were playing on medium and high earlier but i put it all on low because the frame rate was terrible so yeah just a heads up we are playing on low settings now everything on slow low as it can be a jet's gonna come around for me again try and get this helicopter i have a gunner though come on doesn't it it just freezes from time to time as well it's weird that's what happened before when i thought i'd been hacked then it happened just before i got hacked oh well i'm in the tank first time i've been there tank my whole squad's in it what can i do here spot is that all i can do i've completely forgot about my quest for revenge as well it's gone oh you were ready for me weren't you why is the game not utilizing the gpu i don't know doge it just it's not maybe dice just haven't had time to optimize it yet i think that's probably what it is you know the game was delayed uh by a month maybe it wasn't enough time for you know all those optimizations that needed to take place i'm sure it'll get fixed so it's just annoying that it's launched like this not very well optimized for pc at all i was playing it yesterday on the series x a little bit it ran great on the series x like i didn't have any frame drops not really any input lag it felt responsive no stuttering no degrading performance but on pc it's just was that a wrap it's been it's been pretty um pretty rough i have to be honest okay this smg is great is that not a door you can go through hello hey please thanks [Music] did you give me some armor oh no it's not i thought it was anger [Music] oh i was about to slide saw the gluten a little too late hey doc what's up player collision knees work yeah i agree with you on that totally ultra settings gets in better frames than low i don't know i've not really tried that to be honest i mean for me didn't seem to make a difference at all one of our objectives has been lost it got sector alpha got to start securing sectors they're hiding in this golf ball see what happened then as well is very small but i ads and i have toggle ads on right so when i right click once it should stay aimed in it unzoomed me that's happened several times tonight so i think that's a bug as well happens more with the pistol allies are engaging in echo three driver tonight i've been in a tank once my driver right now zero unlocks of course that's the ostrich tactic there i call that well maybe they thought i was a dinosaur in jurassic park they've seen that recently could be i can't see us if we don't move [Music] that's a weird noise oh they sound amazing the explosions as well very good damn it i'm going too fast one [Music] ruin me [Music] our war beast legend thank you let me get revenge on irish shield i'm not seeing any of them on the other side of it right now can you air strafe when you jump like in bf4 not really beamer refuse medical assistance hey levi what's up good to see you man thank you for coming get the chunky offspring my elod's not loaded in there hey i'll 1v1 you i'm chunky than you okay you can change flight mode can't you what is it i'm pressing all the wrong buttons z if we don't stop them they'll take every sector i was really expecting more snipers on roofs there guys huh i'll have to tell you you can pick up a lot of speed can't move reloading oh these aren't you never know can hear the clogs [Music] first time using this i think it's anti-air isn't it got me with the trade kill right at the end what's up mark miller thank you very kind you to say that yeah the screams i mean everyone screams all the time in this game it's screaming the game do you want screams in your game where we put screams in your game so you can scream while you're gaming and screaming at the same time while screaming and gaming at the same time for screaming how did i even get revenge on that other guy i don't know i think i did lagging starts to get quite laggy at the end of the match let me tell you this rubber banding man horrible supplies received package all sectors retreat battles lost well that was a lot more fun that time i was playing as angel before i just like moving around the map you know a bit more entertaining for me [Music] enjoy these moments when they come that's it i'm ready for a run too [Music] i love the fact that i can stream battlefield guys by the way this is great i couldn't do this with bf15 because people would just join the server and rage hack they would just follow me so i'm really happy that i can actually stream the game now and i hope you guys enjoy watching this because it it's quite a big deal for me though the fact that i can do this is there a scoreboard no there's not there's a little scoreboard but you can only see your own stats really they should have it optional if you want the old school scoreboard you should be able to take it on you let's go can you get to that spot or does that mean sudden death you can get to most spots level 18 for the pp i'd love to have tried this dmr when i had good fps because i think it would have destroyed that sniper as well that's the last unlock in the game right that's a one-hit kill to the chest unless they've got armor so when everyone levels up to that it's going to be interesting there's some clips of it in my video that i released a couple days ago with the gameplay auto shotgun that's like an mk2 isn't it don't have a single shotgun kill yet i've got a skin for this white one oh why not put it on i haven't used the lmg yet either show skins on specialists i really like that one have to get 1200 kills with the smart explosives for that geez 1200 that's crazy dozer's got some cool skins like that one kills with 800 kills with the ballistic shield is that a joke i can't believe mckay's and i've got a woody skin missed opportunity from dicer irish i think that's the uh ultimate edition skin that i've got the one with the hat's pretty cool that's a cool boris skin casper i didn't even play casper tonight i like his ghillie suits blue yeah there's no battle pass yet no live service element no store you can't buy anything i don't know when they're going to release that let's pick you can't even see the skins until you unlock the character grandma 2 400 heals i don't think i'm ever gonna get that with that character and go cool by down bro animations on the faces are very good aren't they interesting right guys i have to leave it there for tonight thank you for watching i hope you've enjoyed this first impression of the game the main problem for me on pc is performance i think that needs addressing i have some issues with the ui as well in the menus and in the game game's fun though i mean i'm enjoying it i'll definitely enjoy certain characters more than others mckay sundance they're pretty fun this guy maybe i was just doing it wrong but i just don't really see the point support characters here obviously um i'm gonna try and play with a squad of friends tomorrow maybe when we stream i think it's a good base to start with there's a lot of bugs though a lot of glitches hopefully they get those fixed asap some lag with the servers i'm also not a big fan of the spread on the guns i don't like that because it just feels like you're putting your gun at something and you can see the bullets going left and right and it just it's a bit weird that mechanic but yeah tomorrow we'll we'll either do portal or break through tomorrow we might do a bit hazard zone if i can get a squad together we'll see yeah i can stream battlefield again guys that was good enjoyed it uh once again a big thanks to epic games as well for sponsoring this one the f2042 is available on the epic game store and if you guys pick it up or if you buy anything on the epic game store do consider using my creative code jack frogs a big thanks to them for sponsoring right we'll dig into the game a bit more tomorrow i'll be back for a stream i've got some videos in the works as well so look out for those and if you're new here do consider subscribing we do play all sorts of games but the main focus is battlefield it'll be a lot of war zone as well when
