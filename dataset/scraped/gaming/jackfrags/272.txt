warzone is still really fun when you don't run into any cheetahs it's certainly been a trying time for the game over the last couple of weeks but i really hope that soon there'll be some kind of announcement or communication about anti-cheat action but what you're about to see today is a really chill match where we didn't actually have a cheetah in the lobby great success and i was testing out the bullfrog which is quite a tasty little sng now i've used it previously for solos but never in trios or quads and to my surprise it's very good and certainly held its own here's the build that i went for if you'd like to copy and in this one i was playing with three members of my discord server we like to hop on occasionally and see how it goes there's a ton of action plenty of close fights and a spicy ending it was a top game for sure as always if you enjoyed the video leave a like and a comment below how are you feeling about the bullfrog how are you feeling about warzone in general and as with the last warzone video i've only done a few basic cuts here so you really get to see the ups and downs of the match and how we ended up where we did so let's get into it now subscribe for more sit back relax and enjoy you guys yeah you have enough yourselves oh yeah i'll buy another after right above us he's in the little room here [Applause] he'll fire a nice so strong i think he was

chicken i'm spectating you yeah oh oh the plane i'm down oh i'm so screwed better play i mean they uh flank me nicely there that was good oh we've got stoner the challenger that is just the weirdest spot for a loadout holy moly why is it here that's a little anybody else though there was a shack out there no yes only because of this reason there's no other random loadout it's like almost out of the map i thought it was out at least it'll be in circle for a bit he wants to come back not it that made it easy right yeah that made it real easy all right there you go thank you jack well i'm thinking loadout should be safe there's a door here guys red door oh hit it if you can get here afterwards yeah i'll come right there keep it safe yeah okay i've been in this place like once this church i think we dropped here once jack actually yeah it was a bloodbath yeah it usually is like you know that scene from the kingsman it was literally that oh hello one place one time jack has somebody on him he's yeah we should be moving a little quicker i'm running i got him poor little guy you ready yeah yeah we're here we're here uh we got another one on me let's go see where it puts this oh lumber i got one here oh we went through they went through the door oh go quick before it appears or it becomes a different door and you are in another land yeah i lost it no because i saw i saw them pulling on me i'm running right at the buy station there okay they just rest here let's get this guy he might have money come back [Applause] the guy in the truck is ghosted okay just heads up in the air enemy vehicle he's going here oh what's that truck oh another one oh god yeah yeah yeah i was so well there nice chicken well done you do have a guy floating maybe here right now he might be going like for this car or something out here yeah yeah uh you got it that was your closest person yeah i said goodbye yeah hit the buy you could buy both of us and then i'll meet val at the uh open cache load the loading people hit it yeah let me yeah i'll make sure that you grab it first yeah yeah because i haven't gotten it thanks easer user usually that's how i play when we buy a loadout and then there's a free one come in i get ghosts off the drop so the second one yeah yeah so i don't pick up the second one and that leaves it there for if somebody somebody dies all right let's play another load up uh where's that king how'd it go oh it's ally i've got one rocket he's probably gonna flare it but disabled oh john well done he's gone just straight down there's a recon i'm dropping in oh hello just looting a little bit on my way over i can't believe he got away with that teleport to the other side oh no i'll see if i can hit this bounce here on the wrong but it looks a bit broke down good yeah let's go yeah that gave a lot of money too yeah it did um grab me your spare cash get a selfie john to spare money for something pocket i've got a sentry gun oh okay yeah i want to see if we can i've never actually got a kill with it so damn i'd like to try i would love her to be like the fifth player but i feel like it doesn't um he tried putting it on a uh an suv or something glitches out and then we got a sniper rifle [Applause] [Laughter] that was like an automatic sniper rifle what's purple ping was there somebody there yeah there was a full team there oh right back there yeah i'm getting rid of my things they're going to be chilling up there still i think it's that's it's a bit of a bad position for us to push because they've got a lot of high ground there yeah oh somebody did parachute down okay light pink yes well this area is messy [Applause] you can hear them firing at him they make it into the building i think though i'm going up on the big roof here they stun me a cover door on the other side of this door there we go damn i gotta heal watch out come in hit okay nice there's more oh ready right here oh oh right here right here oh damn dude these hurt the there's just one left how many did we kill i killed uh i counted two dead you got any players sean uh yeah here i got eight thank you see if these guys had um any more cash and we can get both back he's a guy i'm looking right here coffee sensor my stuff is here i'm blue and i might have had some cash i had the cash when we were at the buy last okay so one of them's got girls she said though yes one of them has ghosts in front of me john nice job all done still not a teamwork that's not not a team yeah i think they're one more i heard something but nothing on heartbeat like this ah it did nothing it did nothing yeah all right let's go get them back quickly yeah this guy's gonna be riding around somewhere yeah over there it might be going to the bye coming to you john yeah he's in this building i'll find a place where we are right yeah i'm just gonna go for the rest yeah here mommy nice job oh well well done well that was a bit of a hectic fight right there yeah go get the res off thank you i'm gonna make a play for guns [Applause] you're going to uh orange chicken [Applause] oh it's gonna have to be fast we should take that side of the map yeah north side that's where we need the road far side yeah i just grabbed whatever i got to be an interesting box so if you guys need ammo i could drop you a minute oh i'm not going to make it out of the zone no it's going to i wasted it [Applause] or more oh oh they just got hammered is there another buy no oh yeah but other sided zone i wouldn't i wouldn't go for it there was a team down here so we might run into them what are you dropping there canada uh there's a car 98 here the john mcclane lines are so weird yeah they really are uh can we drop that munition going down they did their best you know with what they had they did their best they did their best it's just weird yeah like i'll find a place for pinging i mean i guess what else would they have done but yeah i was kind of hoping that they were going to uh bring them in for a couple of new lines there's no way right there jack yep you saw him [Applause] it's on the hill [Music] i'm gonna ask come by yeah right on the hill like there you go on the left side of the hill too that's my mom he ran around backside here i saw him they're fighting up there you can use the low ground here they're pushing the other side yeah fine oh nope still someone on the hill i'm on him yeah in the house i guess how many are left two on one on one okay we got this we've got this yeah yeah this is good we got position right now too so we can
