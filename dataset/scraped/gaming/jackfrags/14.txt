with modern warfare 2 releasing soon and the hype behind it building up i wanted to hop back on modern warfare 2019 as a reminder to how the new game might feel and there's no denying that one of the best elements of this game was its gun play and animations assuming that mw2 builds on the success of that it's probably a good place to practice and what better way to experience those mechanics than in gun game the classic game mode that i used to sink countless hours into on counter-strike when i was a kid it really is fun as hell in this game and there's a massive player base still so let's jump in see if we can get some wins and see what guns and setups the game throws at us leave a like and a comment below subscribe if you're new let's do this right m13 not a bad start i didn't really do that many videos on modern warfare oh that was close i mean i did some on like uh gunfight and then of course we did some ground war but not really that much to be honest can i go down there i think i can there's a guy in here oh 175 there's a point where that thing was absolutely broken wasn't there and they had to remove it what was that this is a file isn't it oh okay right i can't really peek that oh you're trying to fight me that guy had pistols right so that's same level as me now maybe kimbos you can right click and left click with this can't you no range though or that's good enough it's a growl with a bloody rifle scope on it that zoomed in a lot more than i expected it to you just stole my kill there's a guy up there i'm sure i had a footstep maybe i'll do happy dude i'll do i'll take it shotgun okay the graphics on this game are nuts aren't they i can't really challenge anyone at range though here can i they can come to me like that rpg over here somewhere it's a bad angle there [Applause] the wall bang someone there oh he was right behind me god i love gun game so much fun you got an rpg oh what was that what gun is this bison let's go i'm down by one point oh that was a head there down here those hybrids are horrible man they zoom in way too that's it shotgun origin 12. doesn't really have any range at all does it [Applause] yep dude just blasted me with the 725 there i'll take that and 82 i think should i hold the angle wait for the footsteps come on walk into it pistol don't jump that oh yeah you die don't you if you go down there though what gun did you have you can hear me can't you enemies on the last weapon it was on the last level oh they got it that was two kills off damn it i did join the game a bit late though so we'll get the next one let's see you have to do a throw knife kill don't you to winning this normal melee doesn't count what did they drop then oh this is interesting so we're actually night time now gun game no mini map get kills with each weapon to win night vision on and that's the aim down the site can't believe there's still people playing this it's a burst [Applause] behind me i'm sure i heard another one up here oh i thought you were gonna stay up there dude what steps yeah i'm trying to not aim my laser at the door so i don't give myself away unless it's doing something like shining through which it might be i mean this is giving me mw campaign vibes right here i'm not against that this is an faa doesn't it horrible scope on it though oh that was my shot i don't want to run around too much and give myself away might be someone in there remember there's all sorts of parkour routes you can do on this map got it evr i climb up here pistol okay right i need to close the gap now that works get my john wick on for a bit behind me damn it oh no that was terrible mate yes okay this is a nice sequence of weapons here apart from the rpg which i'm not really gonna love i can't make it work like that seven two five is it take the high ground again i love how you can hear people's cons occasionally that's really fun well you didn't take any damage okay in the previous fight i'm dead ram 7 i think so suppressor on it though which is nice oh i looked the wrong way here's somebody creeping this guy is four points ahead of me yes you do i already used one of my deuce oh i can't jump up there race against time now please no i missed it damn it is that going to cost me please i need to get this guy here yes okay this is too much fun around this game what are we starting with here is that an odin we're on ramazar don't really remember this map that well obviously good idea to keep the high ground 57 this guy here i think oh you're on fire no i couldn't quite make it ruin yes i love that it's a different rotation than what we just had that's cool oh be careful because every time i die that's an opportunity for someone else to advance [Applause] i wanted not that range on this pistol where's the gap oh i was not looking at the center of my screen there i need something interior to get a kill with this i think come on outside point blank shotgun that one hurts [Applause] okay that counts i was shot in the back but that counts you're dead why are you dead shotgun good nearly blew that very nice could hold this position launcher dead good i mean if they want to keep coming at me i shouldn't have said it a12 you weren't flying mate what's that thing called from the saw movies jigsaw horrible you came up with that [Applause] what are you looking at you were looking at somebody over here really good aim training this jigsaw you got me i will have revenge [Applause] gave yourself away somebody here it was hold this for a sec maybe damn it wasted some time then yes pistol again one more yes oh that sequence was sick man cardboard oh this is so good this game mode the mw engine as well the gun play the movement it just does it so well i think that's going to do it for today guys 2 out 38 bad is it if you enjoyed the vid leave a like thank you so much for watching i'll see you next time [Music] you
