hi everyone and welcome back to more battlefield 2042 today we are going to be playing something in battlefield that i've put together so back in august after that dice revealed three different game modes in the game all that warfare has its own portal they came to me and said when the game launches do you want to make a game mode in portal and we'll feature it and highlight it and people can play it for a couple weeks naturally i said yes like okay cool that sounds that sounds great and knowing what was in the game here i wanted to put together a gun game a gun game is a gamer that i've always loved in video games ever since i played it back in counter-strike like 1.3 maybe 1.5 like years and years and years ago maybe like 18 19 years ago and of course since then many games have come along and applied that same formula to their games call of duty battlefield in bf3 and 4 we did have gun master so battlefield players are used to this game mode and what i was able to do here was craft something that i've called the gun master of ages and it's essentially working your way through iconic weapons what i think are iconic weapons from 1942 bad company 2 bf3 all the way up to 2042 and then of course the person that wins the game gets the knife kill 35 in total now what's cool about this is that i was able to make a map rotation as well so it's not just on one map this is on multiple maps i put this together uh with the thank sorry with the help of ripple effect they've helped me build this i provided like a full document with what guns i wanted how i wanted it to work the only thing that they couldn't get in was i wanted there to be a 15 speed boost if you got a knife kill like before you were on the last level to incentivize people to actually go for knife kills and to demo other players because usually in gun game if you get killed by a knife halfway through whatever you'll be demoted a level that is the same in this game mode but like i said i wanted that 15 speed boost as well they couldn't get it in but it's fine i like it i think it's good it flows well it plays well we made a few tweaks as well so it should be good and if you guys want to try this for yourself i think it's going to be here for a week or two and it is full xp as well so any of the featured modes that are here or if you click battlefield portal today they've added well they've still got rush they've got conquest of ages and rush of ages but any of these game modes that's full xp so you're not going to be wasting your time as far as i'm aware playing these but if you want to try it go ahead play it for yourself see if you can get a win and if you do you know let me know tweet me a picture let me know in the comments i will be playing for a couple hours i'm looking forward to this hopefully it spills up a new server and puts us into a new game but if any of you guys want to play with me right now queue up see if we can get in a match together if you're enjoying the stream guys hit the like button thank you if you're watching this as a vod do the same it's a great way to help support me hello to everyone in the chat what's up alice quickbeam how you doing okay so i think this round has just started let's get in here so we start with the 1942 weapons to 1911 to begin and i think it's the german pistol after that so i did have the option to go with all of the guns in the game but i thought you know maybe that's a bit too long because there's a lot of guns in this game if you count all the portal ones i think there's like over 70 or something and that would take a long time that would be like 40 minutes per round uh and also it's one kill as well to advance to the next level i know in the bf3 and four iterations of gun master it was two kills but i thought if i did that like this would take so long so you know i did the math and it should take about 15 to 18 minutes on average if you've got a server full of like you know competent players and i think that's a pretty decent round it could go a lot quicker though obviously if you've got a really good player in your lobby could end up winning the game super fast if they get that knife kill i also as you just saw doing a couple of rocket launchers [Applause] so this is the last level for each era of the games rocket launcher obviously we're on 1942 i've got the bazooka man that was stolen right before the splash damage got off damn it yes so i just demoted that person there is notifications as well if you look in the top right hand corner in the bottom left you should see some updates about the game oh that's a that's a good spawn so now we're on to the bad company two era so that was the mp443 and now we're on to the spas xm8 i think you can really change some kill streaks in this game mode as well there's a guy right there you can shoot through that i need to work out my scope sensitivity because it's kind of busted what are we on to here the goal yeah i did two snipers in a row oh the noscope bb 2000 let's get it i think there's someone on the bottom floor here obviously using the mini map is super important and you are just playing against other people here you don't have a team so it's all up to you oh i saw that guy's kill i was killed in the process uh val thank you for the two hope everyone has a great christmas thank you infamous you sucks at this game mode sorry dude this is the super fast bad company to rpg isn't it okay we're on to bf3 now okay well that was an unlucky spawn for that player ended up right in front of me there i've not actually played it on this map before it's are they cool me as foul love that asphalt yeah so ripple effect gave me like my god that guy's gone flying they gave me a list of all the the guns you know and i just went through and picked my favorites i had to have the g3 in there how are we doing oh we're actually tied with alpha tier so we've got some good players in here there's a g3 m16 there's a guy right here oh no i just ran into a panzer shrek theory me oh so maybe it was the panzer shrek instead of the bazooka at the start i can't remember what i picked m98b there's a guy here somewhere are they dead stand still please yes that's quite a long range scope on that one okay no it's firing for too long there gave myself away the only thing that i'm kind of gutted about is that i wanted each of the gun stab attachments on because you know in bf3 and bf4 they had preset attachments on so that would be really cool if in a future update we could actually do that it's the only attachments are for the this guy below me the only attachment for the sniper rifles and that's just the big scopes can hear people sorry dude small oh no just a tag that's not what you want it's got a long reload time on this good damage though if you get direct hit that's a kill and now we're on to 2042 let's go burst mode for this i think there's someone up here nope underneath me goodbye pp2000 mp9 sorry not pb2000 it be above me and here's someone going up the stairs there oh that's painful oh no there was a third guy going out the corner okay we are winning now by three points so i've got five more kills and i can win the match oh svk man so powerful one shot that guy he must have been low already here we go and tw i'm not gonna miss that i'm not gonna miss that one now i've reduced the respawn time as well well then this gun's awesome man here we're going here recoil us damn it someone on my left gonna run in here oh there's no splash damage there you kidding how was there no damage there what the hell oh this guy's catching up with me ragdoll quick reload no he doesn't want to kill himself yes okay final kill gotta get a knife kill lord butter bite are you the one are you the one to get me the win yes we got it gg i was absolutely try hard in that i'm glad that we won that's fun enjoy that should cycle onto a new level now as well i think there's about eight maps in total [Music] atlas thank you for the 100 man [Music] appreciate the content no problem thank you for watching greatest ultra thank you for the 400 wish i could find a way to implement sort of a preset sites for portal weapons yeah that would be cool gigi hello pero john angie alessandro emily you what's up guys oh okay kaleidoscope yeah that was a good game it was quite tense that one it'd be sweet as well if i could have different presets so every time that you play it's a different lineup of weapons that'd be a really neat feature oh no the guy knew he was going down happy boy oh come on yes got the kill so apparently there was a patch today that changed some of the gunplay in the game um this is my first time playing today so i've not experienced it i know some people are in the chat are saying you know what are your impressions i've not actually played all that warfare or breakthrough all today or rush so i couldn't tell you we might do some later on in the stream though just to check it out they also finally nerfed the bolt as well the 30 millimeter cannon on the bolt which i'm really happy about because that thing was just stupidly over i mean the gunplay is feeling pretty good here i presume it's affected some of the portal weapons as well i don't know i definitely feels like there's less spread on the guns at least i'm dead hey i don't care i'll kill myself to reach the next level i'll do it i'll do it we're on to bad company two again uh ronnie thank you for the 20 man much support i like your spread too ken yeah we try and put on a good spread here you know ah no assist counts as kill though yeah they changed the sound as well i've read through the patch notes so i have to have a proper go of it my capture card's bugging out a little bit isn't it he's popping up with no signal how long is it staying on there for like one second or something that's weird i'll just see if it keeps doing it sorry about that guys that's uh that's a new feature for me that doesn't usually happen i can't aim well i deserve to die that was awful i don't know what was happening then yeah i'll just tweak with the uh i'll mess around with the hdmi cable could just be a loose connection there we go i just can't aim the spas apparently you name that though that's got a lot of kick on it that wow oh shot on the side awful pain jack needs a new capture card it's probably a loose connection i mean i've recently uh moved all my pc stuff there's a guy here oh get wrecked you can hear me can't you and i can hear you my friend this thing's like it's gone yeah i don't know why it's hit scan okay i've got to close the gap here but joe penguins ian i haven't been to see the penguins for ages dude oh my goodness i need to spawn on the inside that's not good kill here maybe oh shot in the side of the head [Laughter] damn it filthy no scope indeed it's gonna be tricky than i thought this what if i should put this on semi-auto maybe thank you very much sir i needed that just came running towards me there very good very good g3 one of my favorites yes m16 i'm gonna shot in the back i'm kind of sad that they uh they didn't make the m16 sound like it did in bf3 maybe they couldn't find the audio file or something the m16 has got such an iconic sound just did it again didn't it yeah i'll have a look at that after this match see if i can figure it out while it's doing it oh it's just my new transition guys that's all ah spawn on the outside again it's more yeah there are 35 in total or 34 one with the knife kill i mean first on 2042 okay okay it usually does that when it overheats i don't think it's overheating shouldn't be anywhere my room is plenty cool enough might be difficult to get a knife kill on this one unless i can get in the center ian i can't put any penguins in it i'm sorry dude i'm not allowed to put penguins in if i could have put penguins in i would have put penguins in but you know that wasn't part of the deal pkp oh my god this thing's a beamer now that feels completely different what the hell pkp's gonna be good in the base game even with the 3090 space heater yeah i'll get my new pc on monday one hit kill for this i can find it uh they just blow the ground up damn it should have got that one oh that one though and that one just just about there are no penguins bbb alice i'll um i'm gonna do a walkthrough of my uh my new pc when it arrives i'll do you know like a setup video i know that's got the range literally went through that guy oh okay i've just demoted mr small brain i kind of feel bad about that one to be honest it could be it could be that my current pc knows it's going to be replaced yeah maybe that's it it's fighting back against me oh come on predicting too much oh no come on come on come on come on come on don't turn around oh you stole it i hate you oh my god i can't believe this guy well i've got no one else to blame but myself there i'm going to be honest guys i was entitled my own fault i think this one's going to annoy people the most you know you got to go through a bit of pain though right sometimes yes okay last kill jack frank's is about to win am i though i mean i've got to get a knife kill and this guy one point behind me so this is going to be tough mr small brain come on i've knifed you once let me knife you again it's a small brain mr small brain please no god damn it mr small brain no lelu runs one kill away from me i'm dead to that guy if he hadn't hit me first time i'm gonna just rush them i'd just rush them oh cyrus is on 33 as well this guy nope come on come on come on okay that guy's got a rocket launcher no he's dead i was gonna go from ah it's so difficult weapon here a knife yeah the knife is universal right you know if i get beat here it's fair enough hey this guy this is the kill this is it no it's so frustrating so frustrating anyone could be like literally creeping up behind someone right now to get that knife kill and win the game okay this is it this is it on please stand still please don't hit me don't hit me no he hit me at least the other people are having as much difficulty as i am trying to get this knife kill oh yeah i've got knifed okay i've been demoed well i've definitely lost now to come back the comeback is real the comeback is real the comeback is real no nice please what if i just hide somewhere okay no please not like this so close troy it is stressing me as well dude uh alpha tier got it dj alpha tear well played proud of you man proud of you dude [Music] yeah i think it's full xp that's what they told me i don't think it's capped in this game mode which is good the coward's way is there no vaulting in this game there's a little bit of vaulting that you can't like pull yourself up like you can in other like bf5 for example you can't do it there i'm just going to look at my capture card one second because that sucks bear with me a second let's see what's going on here let's have a look shall we i'm going to deactivate it and activate it and i'm going to change the setting bob's your own call okay right let's try that then let's see if it does it again if it does do it again let me know what did i unlock then carbon series skin for the ntw interesting yeah so like i said guys at the start if you want to try this for yourself you can click here it's here on the main page as well front page now i'll key you up have i tried sweet talking yet no i've not tried that uh chris thank you for becoming a member i already played this map didn't i see if we see if we can do more see if we can do them all i'm playing on low settings what's the max level in this game i think it's s999 oh valparaiso let's go yeah i'm excited for the game awards fresh i think it's going to be good i mean every year it seems like the game awards just gets bigger and bigger and there's more announcements this guy's on 31 kills already let's see how much of a combat we can make then sorry dude it's going to be difficult though because everyone's well ahead of me here let's see i love this map though i think it's such a cool map i've got erica harbour in the list too i'm not going to kill that guy in this red building i think what gun do you have my friend is still okay i was lucky shortest round of gun master ever f society is that i missed the robot reference is this recorded oh it's done again it did no signal again huh why you like this why are you the way you are all that music though so good i'm gonna change something in windows we'll see about this capture card we'll see change the refresh rate there we go bob's your own call try that uh cliff thanks very much man you can hear where the enemies are coming from that's great yeah they changed something with the audio what's this map again i don't want to play this map [Music] when in doubt reboot yeah if only that worked i mean it works most the time sometimes it just doesn't decrease the spawn time pre-am the spawn time is 10 uh sorry five seconds like it's really fast oh this will be an interesting map bob is not my uncle actually bob is my dad lots of people have an uncle called bob right nice thank you mp40 this is my corner this is my little corner now guys this is where i live check now oh someone instantly removed me from my corner why why you like this that's not cool i can hear your footsteps they've definitely changed something with the footsteps i think it's way way way way clearer i've got a tricky one here enemy nice shot i like my little corner up there i'm kind of sad that it's gone now really sad sdg stg is too good one come on bro i saw you it it is a panzer shrek i couldn't decide if i wanted the panzer or the bazooka in the end panzer shred i think it's just it's a bit more iconic for world war ii for me anyway hey paul thank you for the five great stream so far pkp is pretty op after the patch almost like it's permanently bipodded damn okay i have to try it out a purple buffalo thank you for becoming a member bad company too let's get it i mean that's one bullet there xm8 i did see that guy back there but i fancied an easier kill so it's going right above me what oh in here why can't i see that guy through the wall oh lucky mate oh i was going for the slightly head shot how high is the fov 88 rocket smith 88 is what i play seems the panzer does zero slash damage yeah it's not great is it splash damage is quite low come on pick me no reg there maybe i was just missing i mean it is an smg bad spot for me here with this gun oh come on it's a weird gun that is i'm not really played much portal i need to do it some more i was thinking about doing like um an old school across the battlefield on the portal maps what's up priyam thank you man it's very kindly don't you dare steal that kill damn it oh come on that guy was trixie trixie little devil how can you tell who's winning you can press the scoreboard and look quickly or you can see at the top have i played portal 2 you mean the the val game yeah paul 2 is great great game i played in co-op really good big fan if you haven't played portal and portal 2 you should totally i want it nice come on it cocked it back i thought i'd reloaded yeah i changed the buzz pistol to single fire because i was shooting people at distance that's why i had it on semi auto i know that the 93 is a burst pistol guys should have got the head shot buddy see this is the kind of gun that i wish i'd been able to put a scope on the g3 the iron sight's not very good on the g3 following me all the way up off bran chad you've been a member for 22 months thank you what's up ronnie how you doing man i'm good thanks samantha how are you oh no poor guy was only on like one hp i need someone closer than that hey stod no i didn't know it was a burst pistol p90 stargate then i just camping on the i stairs there's someone up here up here what how did you die he just he just fell over i mean that's why it's got a ten time scope on it i think eight times would have been better in hindsight but it's fine you coming up someone's coming up i think you kidding okay yes [Music] yes oh that was lucky that was so lucky that guy was low hp solomon thank you bro this does no damage at range man this pkp is lit it's so good whatever they did to the gun player today like i'm big fan so far sorry where i couldn't even see that guy no come back thank you ntw are we playing to win here lads playing to win someone underneath me there no you stole it didn't you it was you not the recoilless my worst enemy not like this come on give me the top down kill give me the easy top down what the what the parachute bye yes don't you dare know he's demoted me he chased me all the way pavel i don't know where johnny is he's probably busy he's he's uh he's got a lot more responsibilities than i have and here's someone in here oh you guys yes one more kill now if i wanted to i could just camper spawn but that feels kind of like cheating so i'm not going to instead i'm going to run around and get killed multiple times and then someone else is going to win even though i got here first that's typically how gun game goes for me you know but don't hate the player hate the game don't hate the player hate the game don't hate the player hate the game yes he missed if that guy would have hit that shotgun shot i'm ruined it's a one-hit kill there [Music] we did it [Music] recordless is just the worst launcher in the game in any bfk um it's good for vehicles but i feel like against infantry it's it's nowhere near as good as like the rpg or the small ones in bf4 for example right [Music] idranty how do i think hazard zone can improve i've not played this level before let's go i think hazard zone it needs a much more in-depth meta game i don't think there's enough incentive to actually play that game mode right now there's no carrot at the end of the stick um it just feels like a really dumbed down version i hunt showdown right now i think they should massively reduce or completely get rid of the ai and they should double the player count so instead of 32 64. i think they should put less data drives in as well fewer data drives sorry so fighting over them actually means something there's so much spread on these pistols he got there in the end yeah like in its current state i don't see myself playing hazard zone again needs a big overhaul in my opinion i don't think that's doing anything for the recall is it crouching that's more of the range for the thompson around i wish there was a rappel here it needs like unique rewards as well like if i play hazard zone i want to be able to you both shoot you literally stood right next to each other guys is it just is it just kill jack day is that what's happening here i want to get like a um a reward right like something unique that's why i want to play hazardous something that you can only get from playing hazard zone it doesn't have that right now i think it just has like a calling card or an emblem or something like that's not enough i think if you want to get people to play it you've got to massively increase the xp gain maybe have like a a unique weapon skin or a charm you know something direct hit let's go oh i thought that guy had an smg i was about to be ruined then there is a guy bummer here oh headshot just ran into it some of the um transport vehicles as well in hazard own just don't make sense because of the weapons you can have on them that was stolen okay like the transport vehicles like the latv with the 30 millimeter so strong in that game mode nice okay we're fine it's fine i feel like you could just chill out underneath here and just get a load of kills right doing this ah nice shot right in the face yeah i don't know how i could have a quicker respawn time someone said improve the respawn time but it's literally like a couple seconds this is a good spot i didn't even know you could spawn up here although i mean i'm not really seeing many people here you going up there again it's kind of good that i've got the sniper though pain i feel like i should just go down just kill people no one on the ice there's someone here that took way longer than i'd have liked it to damn it damn it stop stealing my kills okay got it right sniper rifle there done bc2 done nearly rpg it's hit scan so just give me a shot where is it there it is guys did you know this was a burst pistol and you can change it look how cool is that there's someone just coming up the ladder there hold on awesome gun this is close pause dlc no don't close it i mean the slowest the slowest door there ever invented i mean that was like something out of a comedy movie where'd you go up here oh my goodness batman me why is it hitscan i don't know ronald that rpg from bad company too it just it just got a really fast projectile speed on it just really quick this is a terrible spawn for a shotgun though there is someone over here with a sniper i could get behind as long as i don't get seen oh they're dead that's quite painful you know stab in the back that is dude's only one level away from me the range on that's not bad yes well g3 heavy here nearly got me [Music] well played literally trying to turn battlefield into cod i mean it's cool to have different game modes isn't it i'm here to lacerate battlefield has had uh gun game gunmaster since bf3 a gun game was originally a counter-strike mod cod just kind of took the mechanics of it and made it popular or more popular i think it's good to have choices you know like if you want to level up your guns or just get that infantry fix i think this kind of game mode will do it for you oh yeah gun master was really fun in b4 and tron you're right i did quite a few videos on it actually who shot you oh ruined i'm not a fan of that animation damn it nearly killed that guy i think i fixed my capture card by the way guys i don't think it's done it again has it which is good i just never lost the game of gunmaster ever is that true thank god i got that kill oh that guy's just joined the game they're on the 1911. let's go i stay up here now i'll try to for the remainder of the game these 2042 guns are you guys working together what's going on what are you doing are you working together here you're not supposed to work together guys anyone know what happened to the youtube dislike button they disabled it publicly so the person that made the video can still see it and i think you can get plug-ins to see it but they've disabled it publicly yeah uh james this is a featured game mode at the moment this is a game that i created with the help of ripple effects i pretty much just gave them a document which is like okay this is what i want the game mode to be and then they built it really cool opportunity for me um that's a direct hit dice that's not a kill disgusting yeah it's like full xp as well no you saw me didn't you three people here here we go again first again got to get that stupid knife kill ah landed a speech too far away yeah you can actually still press the button but you just publicly can't say i'm so dead [Applause] why did that guy just turn around did they just try and run away i'll take it i mean why not pain pain indeed dustin am i gonna upgrade my monitor no tommy i'm keeping the same monitor hp omen x 27 1440p 240 hertz one of the most responsive monitors i've ever used in terms of input lag lack of ghosting responsiveness it's very good erica harbour maybe he gave it to me i don't know i mean i feel like they just missed a load of shots who gave their cat the controller oh that's funny atlas finally caught one of your live streams thank you man i already said thank you to you didn't i say it again whatever oh game crash we're back something going on with my capture card i need to i need to figure this out before the next stream so i've got another stream tomorrow i wonder what's going on it's a bit peculiar that is that just completely froze my game you can oh there's a door there i thought that guy like jumped through one of these windows can you squirm can you squirm through the window there or something wasn't gun master team based in bf3 yeah it was but originally like back in the day in countless strike gunmaster gun game was always free-for-all i think it should be a free-fall game also if you do team-based gunmaster it's kind of annoying because your teammates can like steal kills from you quite easily you just need a better pc mate yeah oh i was dead then move come on who wants some you want some [Music] why did i suddenly did i just do a rocket a rocket jump what happened then it's team fortress i'm pretty sure i didn't put team fortress in my game mode oh quake boy did a mario jump now though bowser is taking me to the the shadow realm what's going on i've slipped a few levels here i'm down two points i was kind of sick if i could like learn how to recreate that it could actually be quite a useful mechanic that couldn't it not even hit markers yeah yeah the rocket was right on them as well almost like it just like put me in the air and just removed my damage or something just went you want some damage mate don't think so quake unreal tournament now quake 3 rocket jumping was sick around i used to love doing that watch your back buddy oh one shot okay okay ah come on couple headshots there assist counselors killed was so awesome in bf4 yeah it was cool what's up jason yeah there was no smash damage on that rocket where i bounced into the air didn't do any damage oh no that did some damage where are evolution there's not really much revolution in this game to be honest with you chef i guess you could say that in a way the the weather effects like the tornado sandstorm that could be a bit levolution but yeah like the same destruction that we had in the older games it's not really in this game the most revolutiony thing is on kaleidoscope there's a tower and if you explode all four supports on it it will crumble and depending on where you blow the last one up it will fall in a different way that's that's the most revolution thing in the game but there's nothing like towers falling down although back at um was it ea play in 2020 they did show a tower collapsing so i don't know maybe we'll get that kind of thing in uh live service dlc who knows i'd like to see more destruction in this game for sure all right did you know this is a burst pistol you know [Music] i'm still torn and if i should get the game or not it's up to you robert i think if you want to try it um the cheapest way of doing that is like ea play and then i think you can play it for 10 hours or something for free like if you get that ea play i'm not sure they used to do a trial for it i don't know if that's still available though so oh mister with his rpg there oh come on you were reloading my friend i'm nearly caught up with this guy playing well it's like perfect g3 range right there oh no he's gonna die okay it's a spread off so we can get this quickly i'm getting stuck nice please rpg 10 o'clock to our front boom no no that was two splash damage hits is dlc going to be free um all right hit the bush yeah like all the all the live service stuff apart from cosmetics i think is going to be free that's what they said anyway how is that not a kill that's insane actually insane oh they've not started the live service yet and this they said that's going to kick off next year but yeah i think it's like they stuff they said stuff like maps game modes that's all gonna be free interesting to see what they go with first you know what kind of map that was an easy kill there i think they said there's going to be four new specialists as well and what do you guys think the new specialists are gonna be missed the money shot there probably that time splash damage needs a buff yeah maybe there's a really good map for gunmaster my most hated you know you gotta have some pain to get to the end i can't have it all for free annual leopard i'm i'm my i'm 50 50. i talked about this before with across the battlefield i might i might do it for 2042 but um the problem is the the game is so stop starting especially in conquest uh i don't know i don't know if it would make for a good video because the whole point of across the battlefield is that it's unedited on the knife what you get oliver you know you come into my little hole like that i'm gonna blow you up okay find a knife kill i've got to be the batman swoop down on someone these guys are gonna get in a fight over here if i can sneak a kill [Applause] nope oh no there was another player what's up quinn johnson how's it going hey chain chomsky good name damn it keep getting these open spawns going here no one more one more would have done it ah done they've caught up with me now especially as it gives you bonus movement when near vehicles that's interesting really i should be down in the town area oh they got it cynics well played good game [Music] love the content i think these first ones are the actual beta once the live service starts we should be seeing the content we're looking for i hope so man i mean the three patches that they've done so far have been uh okay like the second one was pretty rough because like for me i couldn't use my mouse i had to like delete my config and stuff but they've made a lot of fixes lots of bug fixes i think the gun plays in a good place now but like i said i haven't tried i haven't tried the gun play today after the patch apart from what i'm doing in here in portal so i don't think that's a fair representation of you know hands-on impression of it yet uh but the 2042 guns in this feel pretty good the pkp as well i feel like there's a lot less spread on it um we'll see i think there's a lot of features that they still need to add to the game i want to see persistent servers in portal as well i want to see a lot more performance my performance is good in these maps because there's only what like 20 24 players i think yeah but on the big maps like 128 players the performances is pretty bad how's the aim assist i don't know ash i don't play with the controller monster thank you for the same was there something about aim assist in the patch notes i can't remember they say the hit reg issue was solved i need to test it out i think i should take this map out of the rotation because it's hard to open like it doesn't really work does it a gun game you just kind of spawn in the middle of nowhere good if you've got a sniper though no bad if you got a pistol aim assist is fixed what's it like now matthew is it a lot better or jack dowd how can the respawn be shorter it's like three seconds i i don't stand come on just go let's go someone's gotta win there we go solved okay yeah i'm not i'm not like a very good controller player so i mean i couldn't really give you a good impression of that it's more consistent at range it didn't scale before long distances okay what's up racket how you doing man where is that guy on the roof yeah this isn't a good map for this uh diaz um i'll ask and see if they can take this out of the rotation i think all the other maps have been good so far this one is not the play though oh no nothing oh sure i could see a guy down there it's just a body i think it's too open isn't it god thank you stuart what's up straight up gamer how you doing are you guys looking forward to the game awards tonight briefly mentioned this earlier but i think there's going to be a lot of big announcements tonight seems to be carrying more weight and importance that show like i don't particularly care about like the awards being honest with you guys i don't really care who wins like game of the year or whatever award shows in general i just don't really see the point of them never have but um but i do care about are the announcements and the new trailers like it's cool that the uh the games are celebrated as well you know but in terms of like hey who wins best game of the year i couldn't go less do you think there's gonna be any big surprises what do you think's gonna

gonna be so sick on pc imagine playing that native 4k 60 fps or whatever it's going to be super cool callisto protocol that's the uh pudgy horror game isn't it that guy wasn't shooting me for some reason glenn schofield right i think what's up manuel a yeti i missed the aek yeah i'm kind of gutted that they didn't put the aek in bf3 paw should have been there nope gotta get closer didn't they

gun super cool ian thanks for the fire man stupid rpg i mean i chose it it's my fault i was considering putting c4 in as well at one point that would be funny wouldn't it and incredibly annoying

good laugh i can feel your pain buddy feel the pain right there enemy infantry damn how's it blowing me up oh nasty what are the game awards called they just called the game awards that song i wish people would blow into little pieces when rpg'd battlefield's never really had that never really had dismantlement we talked about this before as well i don't know if it suits the game as awesome as it would be to see that i mean i don't know if they'd do it i don't know what that means ally yes okay oh is that my capture card again i think my capture card's busted again my game just crashed pain yeah that map is uh is not ideal see if i can get that removed tomorrow real tournament memories chomsky i used to just um load up facing worlds and just snipe bots 24 7. you know when uh when our internet was bad when you know 56k back in the day if your mom was using the telephone just play against bots any cheaters so far i've personally not come across any ahmed but i've seen videos of them what gpu 39 rodriguez am i a coffee or tea guy i like both galang how many times has this game crashed for you quite a few times stefano yes it's crashed quite a bit oh dude look at your health come on i needed that kill where you going oh he was ready for me i wish i could get a 39 somewhere are they still hot like really hard to get hold of plus i'm 35. the dial-up days yeah 56k and then if you were lucky you got isdn and then eventually broadband came out if you could afford it it was called blue yonder in the uk [Music] you've seen glitches inside walls um yeah there's a few places you can get under the map i know that hang on i got a kill with a bar but it didn't switch me level that's weird [Applause] pain level line that one up damn he's on the same level as me you like your reticle to stay white yeah i don't mind it white white's default it was an assist i thought i got a kill maybe i'm just going crazy [Music] you still upstairs i thought they'd been killed i played have i tried to play with the 2080 ti no vince and i haven't i used to have a 2080i i'm not trying in this game though and the range on that when you hit your shots someone sniped me then my shot you had blue yonder on your first dell gaming pc i bet you're about the same age as me though right yes i spent ages on that last time a lot of recall on that leave me alone climbing up a ladder okay you're camping up here son you're dead it's going good nice little streak here four points in the lead now as well blasted through what yeah i'm really sad it doesn't have the same sound someone like on a roof here i can't see them though my sense is way too slow on that i need to fix that mess with my settings a bit increase the scope sends tasty outstanding welcome there do i think dice will change some of the base game maps i think so nameless yeah i think they should they did that on bf5 didn't they i went back and changed some of the cover some of the map flow yeah i could see him doing it again why not i roll there lads right here yes okay on the knife right damn i'm quite clear at the moment gonna get that one knife kill two players here i'm in the middle of them you could kill each other guys how about that for an idea turn the difficulty up these aren't bots these are real this guy that's it go camp in the building oh no that play is good that's the second place isn't he damn it ten points now okay give me a good spawn please no not you no no i need a spawn in the town damn it uh tricky duck savage thank you for becoming a member jackfrags.com discord if you want to join the discord make sure you've got your discord connected to youtube and you can join come on stan still stencil you're kidding me you what the takedown was there i pressed there i literally pressed it no ah literally press the button there's a guy coming in yes we got him we got him lads that's a good game i enjoyed that corbin wallace franz nice try guys pj [Music] cheers tricky it was right there literally i pressed f guys i don't know what to tell you i don't know what to tell you unbelievable okay so should we try some rush to wrap up the stream or do you want more gunmaster what do you want guys russia more gunmaster like i said you guys can play this for like the next couple weeks it's going to be there so you can try it for yourself it is full xp as well i think it was a fifth element reference under what's up mr happy hey mark hey gabby jovi head rush okay everyone's saying rush let's check it out feels like some kind of brush yeah yeah ethan thank you man oh arika harbor as well hello oh this is like the worst map to attack on might be right for sniping though i don't want to be in this it's better idea we have to push the enemy back sector so is this just classic rush yeah i can dodge your rocket no bigger waist little you have to try better than that sure there's a sniper here somewhere they've gone though [Applause] on the corner here i think i got him [Music] he does my bullet then what that was an enemy uh lock thank you appreciate that buddy [Music] well well well go and say it one of them will well well they disabled it what why aren't they doing the voice lines guys they disable the voice lines what's going on [Music] i wanted to hear the well well will what a match closer yeah got myself a dog tag rush on 1942 that sounds interesting i want to do that well well well that was fun angel does it again don't be sad sometimes it just turns out that way that was something right i won't be a three now no shall connect up the last of their reserves don't let up they're coming for our objectives hold your ground and stop it they got 12 tickets it keeps putting me in games they're nearly over max i don't really want a dollar twelve you know unless unless well well well that's triggering me so much i'm sorry fed chicks i hope they re-record some of those voice lines though for real like remember this day maybe just redesign some of the characters they just don't fit do they with the law i if you compare right if you think about remember the exodus trailer that they made with irish on the ship and pack and then iris is like he goes in the bit with the jet ski and then they get the data drive go back on the exodus they go into the storm then they get attacked by the condors and then pat gets shot you know you think his son's gonna die it's like really like dramatic and serious tone looks sick and then you compare it to like some of the end game voice lines and some of the things that they say like it's just there's a big contrast there is it doesn't work only good character i think is irish but he's from bf4 um i think casper's okay but casper doesn't really say much annual leopard i think if they want people to play hazard zone again they're gonna have to do a massive overhaul of it huge overhaul it doesn't have any staying power in its current status i don't see why people would play it are we are we defending okay do some recon sniping then why not m98b oh baby b for baby so you get shame we must defend this objective all right soldiers we must keep our objectives secure do not be forced to retreat whoa oh no there position of enemy tank identified i'm gonna get shot by there tank go away thanks for nothing e a funny joke jack franks i'm your biggest fan greeting from poland hello sir thank you oh you're on the stream now hello i even dice i should have killed that recon are they still there enemy charges have been set i was gonna say what's going on i was getting no hit reds there for a second lads and that's not a headshot dice okay enemy tanked into area i'm gonna try hard for you okay dude i appreciate that hostile explosives neutralized i think we defused it oh no i'm sorry i can't do much about the tanks can i oh well well well that was good obi ranata out another why is no one got our time we got a tank back there no one's using it hostiles have destroyed the alpha objective i swear these shots sometimes they just disappear into the nether realm they just scurry off to minecraft for a while and you still grapple the smoke i don't know gibbs i never tested that a lot of people were telling me you can do that but i never actually tested it myself they got the black hole coming in just fell to his death then they've changed the sound on that sounds kind of cool though what the hell his body's coming out of it playing warzone over here they got one of us [Music] and right on the other side this wall you've got to get b you have to shoot without moving in bf3 yeah that's right i forgot this has probably got the classical tuning on it doesn't it what how can you talk you're dead i've only got 27 tickets so [Applause] holy crap that guy's riding the tank into the battle look at that i'm balling absolutely balling out of control i got cover oh my god i can't see their heads anymore not like this get on that towel fuzzy get it done get her done somebody come get her it's a shame that they don't get the thunderbolt and bf3 on this map attack has got the thunderbolt and the defenders got the frog foot and it was sick i used to love playing frog foot and thunderbolt on this mustache you know you miss 100 shots of the percent chances you don't shot when you can't hit percent shots that you take you guys know that phrase don't you [Music] thank you for the time uh lock thank you for the 200 man that's very kind here how's it going mate good news on the update it's feeling all right bazinga i've not tried that the main game mode yeah i went a bit score i said to me let's read it where's that tank why is no one good yes you are a sheep i should stream i'm better than you i'm out well go ahead start streaming riding around in the chopper like air wolf schmidt that's my favorite phrase words to live by yeah what do i think of caldera i played it earlier in solos vanguard solos and i won a match i won my first solo match on the new map i had a good time yesterday i did not have a good time uh the i have a bug with my mouse and it's this is the same for everyone um yesterday for the whole stream two and a half hours i was playing with this bug where my mouse would just randomly aim down the sight they would just aim down sight unscope me zoom in the literally the most frustrating thing i've ever done and i thought i thought it was my mouse i tried a different mouse i tried different brand of mouse understanding software uh it still happened and then today i looked on reddit and i looked on twitter loads of people having the same problem so it's not my mouse um so yesterday was quite frustrating there was a lot of bugs as well um our lobbies were like 1.5 average kd we weren't two out of like 10 games but the the average lobby was like 1.5 we had a 1.65 at one point um so it was really sweaty and try hard um so i didn't you know i didn't really get on with it yesterday today playing solo i'm pretty good still got the problem with my mouse but i just grinned and bared it and just pushed through um i just hope they fixed it soon this guy hasn't got any eyes okay he's got eyes now we make our stand here they want to destroy you i wouldn't say raging yo the gamer i was definitely getting annoyed i was 100 annoyed yesterday with the game but yeah i played solo today uh won the match 16 kills went really well i need to play with the modern warfare weapons though i've not done that yet because they put quads in today [Music] he says tg is so sick oh my god i didn't even deserve that kill ah there's a tiger tank looking at me i've not played this before this is cool ah come on but yeah we'll be doing another warzone stream tomorrow i think so i'll play solos tomorrow i think on on stream we've been playing gun game for like an hour and 45 minutes so we're just wrapping up the stream with a last game of rush these could be like great individual videos you know like these kind of game modes i prefer to attack though i hate defending [Music] unless i'm sniping i got one good oh yeah what are the best vanguard guns automaton enemy is armed and explosive don't let it blow ppsh snake shot revolvers stg the nz is pretty good um i saw there's a guy that i know called mugs who streams on facebook and uh he you know the three-line rifle he made a build of that that was semi-automatic well just hit scan and the damage was insane it was like one to two shot kill nuts so there's obviously a lot of um busted loadouts and good loadouts that people just haven't figured out yet does nobody run medic not really the only gun you can have i think is thompson maybe not great we should be anti-tank like taking these tanks up jessica grenade yeah mugs is a really good dude he's a very good player as well excellent sniper i mean these tanks are gonna have to come in favorite type of crisps um frazzles question from adam here what's the perfect amount of buttered bread to have with a bowl of tomato soup i'd go for two two pieces of bread adam [Applause] any more than that and it's not really about the soup anymore is it it's more about the bread i suppose that depends on your outlook on life though right you prefer the bread or the soup well typically i wouldn't i wouldn't do bird bread for soup though i think like just breads better right or toast yeah the stg is done right i mean what we can't really you got to kill the tanks guys i got one you guys shoot guys you got to shoot the tanks maybe i'll shoot shall i shoot the tanks well how am i not dead by it can you kill me where are you going he'll get killed over there enemy dead right there it's like that scene in bander brothers where he just like runs up on an entire spot of germans and none of them they're like all asleep winters winters isn't it got one enemy down you gotta dip and melt the butter okay oh my god warning you are leaving the battle you guys are getting really elaborate with this how are you alive i don't know i don't really understand what's happening i'd like to be sniping i mean we push right up you're going the wrong way soldier i'm going to run out of ammo soon i've got one shot i got one i'll pick up that number four sniper hey we're dead spears is it spears no i thought it was i thought it's winter's when he was in because the episode starts and he's like running with his garand or his garand and then he just runs over a hill and he sees them all there it's like an entire unit start i'm sorry i didn't know stud spears is the one in um in the town and the like the americans and the germans just can't believe what he's done he just literally goes from one side of the town to the other with all the fighting and then he runs all the way back he has to go and inform someone that's to do something or to say that a path is clear but the radio is broke so he runs all the way through but the bit i'm talking about is winters and it's it starts like where he's like running along and then it's just like an entire platoon of german soldiers asleep that's what that felt like then maybe i was invisible idiot jeff start that comment got held for review but i'm gonna show it there you go i know that you're joking hello baptist sponsor well well will that was fun it's an amazing show about the brothers watched it recently about a year ago watched it all again so good i mean some of the um some of the cgi you know doesn't quite hold up um like the bit where they all parachute on d-day or night before d-day but i mean the rest of it's great crossroads yeah it's a whole other company grilled cheese or tuna fish with tomato soup hey we're attacking i'm taking us right this will be the last game lads and then i gotta go i want to be my gunner and get killed instantly yeah no no no no no yeah i've not played this before sandman yeah i intend to stream the halo campaign uh who do i shoot yeah you're going to get snipe gamer rocks and i feel like all my shots have been on target already but i'm just getting splash damage i'm gonna keep you moving buddy so you don't get your head blown off all right oh well well well i'm sorry does this like does not do any damage shoot everyone i'm trying bro i'm trying they've defused our explosive charges look at this truck look at this joke look at this joke oh come on landmine the dude's on dust too it's not even on the same map [Music] charge is set oh i will literally thrown on the explosive to make sure it explodes i was firing short maybe maybe there we go we got it we blew up those barrels no more good work lads i don't

that's how it works i think come on keep defending lads keep defending it yes yes yes well done we've secured the sector and destroyed both objectives [Music] um i don't think giants of corellia was a
