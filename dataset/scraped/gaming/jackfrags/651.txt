hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some beer for life gameplay commentary today we are playing on operation water I'm quite excited about this because I can never find this map but look I've got a server and there's people playing it so we're gonna have some fun today now the weapon I'm using here is the cz I was racking my brains trying to think like whenever I see this gun it just reminds me of bf4 I was thinking like what why does this gun remind me somewhat should be air for and I think I figured it out it's because in one of the very first gameplay trailers of the game that they showed whether it was single-player or whether it was the multiplayer gameplay trailer that they showed III was pointing to 13 it must have been a three 2013 they were using this gun and I think that's why it reminds me so much of before I don't know if it's good going or not because I mean I just didn't use it you know like this is one of those is there an enemy up there there is there's something going down there this is just one of those guns that I didn't really use when I was playing bf4 regularly when it was active another god I've got barely unlocked any attachments for it I don't think it's any good oh that guy fired the rocket it was you wasn't it nice position there but I wanted to use it today because whenever I go back and play these all the bf games that's one thing that I like to do use the weapons that I just didn't you know right there's definitely enemies down here I see you give me that back I want it oh that's a claim as a claymore don't run into the Claymore don't run into the Claymore it's rats at the clay it was really obvious there it was really really obvious let's go they've got the a point and they've got an attack helicopter over there now if I recall correctly f3 is the left gun I try the old field switcheroo here I get a bit closer to this rib boat here switch now yes we got him I mean I did put the helicopter in the drink oh so bad team player and everything skip this jet ski and the scoot on round sorry helicopter this bad man oh come on nope got it stuck a bye guys oh come on hang on I can take I can take their rib boat on I I'm sorry I'm really good at ruining vehicles today it sings I've only just started playing roadkill yes switch oh come on 10 HP Jack moon moon it does just keep firing as well when you're dead maybe I'd have been able to get that guy I just born on this point that they've captured it there be dragons here there's one dragon were you the only dragon it would appear that you were engineer nice place this you know would it be a nice holiday resort come Chile get some drinks at the bar for non-high Island Resort nice graphic design anyways can we get a boat what are you doing are you alive are you real you look real you real yeah I think you're real he's that an actual Jack Franks No whoa being attacked by a giant butterfly and a parrot you gonna cut me up all right let's go right now fake they're trying to capture this point should I jump off get down man that's the low-res foot I was running out of time they just didn't like my grenade did explode yeah watch out for the clip guys there's guy on the left I missed it watch out watch out watch out he's got a shotgun got him these people are dying falling over please he said sure this I always like to I always like to use this line I bought the account on eBay and just see what they say how much they'll buy it for cost me 50 euros absolute bargain we're losing do you again do you want me to get in let's go top 10 things that never happens I'm not lying I promise there and enemy there well that's a good shot hit the heel oh nice one more about there yeah this guns all right you know it's not bad okay then why would he do that why would I sell my cow on ebay oh he said you needed quick cash for a new car [Music] that's why do you think they'd believe me playin out there shooting us from above around here yep how we clear yeah we're clear I mean we've absolutely dominated this map so I didn't expect it to go so quick sorry dude I can't believe you this just doesn't make sense it's true right we've switched to wave breaker which is also a brilliant map part the same DLC somebody's hammering me pull up there I'm not a big fan of that it's still gonna use the same guns oh that was really rude I just spawned in and you start hammering me like that unbelievable scenes well this is a cool maps one of my favorites actually and therefore I think a lot of people like oh I don't think it's a underrated map or anything we good we good we good stop shooting cease firing yeah it's another great looking math isn't it I mean look at it it's nice it's a nice map these helicopters having a great time are they alright mate bill t-bag oh they're all up on this sub right now there's another one there and I get a maid over there can you even throw them that following this game I'm not sure do sir right donating me that come in for me I'd love a better cover there from teammate stupid line still one more there jump across get that med kit down really we need to be on the point I put some pressure on this please let me add ice like what's it just one let me up I did see one behind me on the mini-map yo is that the real Jack I do really good no thank you sorry where were you killed from these bids ones attack boat watch out oh no you in the other what did that guy say we will see on YouTube one day or not but you'll see later today my friend one gun is this a ninety one that fires fast smoke and a pancake over their enemies have taken this point back just be a good little fire here dude I need to use this weapon this is the wave this is the one right here the rate of fire on it is mad blue this oh that attack helicopter is going to put some pain down right now look at that just ruined all my teammates please don't ruin me if you don't move it's fine isn't it you talked about shooting on me get out of it Oh No caught me anyway jump in the little bird it's gonna be fun I'm gonna go after that Hawk helicopter put it in there should we go in roll up let's do it as long as I don't crush it and it's ruined right goes as a helicopter here now this is the last line of defense the final boss of the D point there's no enemies here though come on where the enemies are right if the other helicopter comes in it was just over here so go get it go get it oh yes you shut the door people do that okay right this is this is treacherous why would you shut the door can I even turn around okay Oh nearly nearly bend in see there I'm fine someone just trolled the hell out of me there okay we're okay we saved it well it's the other way close can I even get out of this now oh my god the other ways close as well this is joke why would you do that I'm trying to I'm just trying to live my best life as a helicopter guys I need I need to get out I need can someone open the door please right these jet skis are going somewhere you want to get in yeah all right easy listen okay they got out I think I should be able to get out now how did they get him how did they get out dude can you go and open it you need to open the door thank you I'd say that's it Ultima door open the door there we go what a legend I love that you can do this thermo what the little bit why is there a boat just waiting for me that's ridiculous I thought I was the final boss not the boat something going down here I don't know whether there's a boat over there I mean were there somewhere there's more though I said all this stuff I'm unlocking it's great behind me with a shotgun of course now they're all over this point now I'd like to take it back dude that's not taking a page out of my book I'm gonna go indoors away from the boats I mean that's the way forward boats a ridiculously I'll be in this game forgot you can't hold the grenades in this game that you can't ignore them they just come shooting out of your face there's a good flank either who's got a good use of cover there is that the shotgun yes it is right this could be useful this could actually be useful here no it's not useful [Music] come on rush this room thanks Bobby my crazy you wrote want it back oh damn it I almost killed myself hey it's good for kill assist isn't it really good at that [Music] oh there was another dude over there yeah a grenade Paul something explosive on me not sure what though nice grenade trying to force me out that position that was good this safe it doesn't feel safe I was at a double-kill oh look I just unlocked the monolithic suppressor I'm gonna hold this get the high ground this is the way forward I'm kind of starting to learn the recall a bit on it getting used to it running meds right the end of the round it's quite a close game actually that was good fun I hope you enjoyed that guys a bit of a mix there that deal say was just great though wasn't it really good fun but that said if you
