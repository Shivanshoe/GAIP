hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some call of duty war zone today we're going to be experimenting with the new sniper rifle that's just been released and also playing 200 player squads I've not tried it yet but I have spent the day unlocking the new sniper rifle and I've not maxed it but I've got like all the attachments that I want on it and this is how I'm running it at the moment the bullet travel speed is really slow but it's got explosive rounds you can do thermite explosive or your standard rounds and the explosive rounds are devastating if you hit someone one it just destroys them really powerful but this is semi-auto rifles didn't realize it was semi-auto but that's how I've got it built and we tried out the new update downloading it earlier and I'm gonna be running the first build here with the new sniper rifle and mp7 and we're just gonna see how it goes I'm playing with study tomographic and Westie got myself a little hyena as well hopefully we can test that out and get some finishing moves but without said thank you for joining the stream thank you for watching the video hopefully we can get some good games today and have some fun I guess right good to go alright oh yeah we'll try we'll try it you still using focus Todd no I took focus off so now I go so I'm just going tech laser VLK STOVL tack wrap stock explosive rounds and stipple grip under stubble hype STOVL STOVL stubble it's table yes I don't know how much it improves it bill yeah but the ad s barrel just don't even use it as a sniper just an absolute mean gun I'm just well you can new meme gun I would Jack did you know that it's a it's zeroed at 200 meters what by default yes literally attested earlier people say if you if you want to have one shot people with the explosive rounds Jack you aim for their stomach and it hits them in there well surely it depends on what range they are yeah well that's not mean D if you if you shoot someone close range the shot goes over their head I've got like five clips where the shot literally just evil if you aiming middle of their head at close range those are there do you think that's a bug or is that intentional I hope it's a bug but it's annoying it's not it's really not fun is that what the default scope so if he if you don't use explosive rounds it doesn't it seems to just have not much drop at all but it might go over there's a little bit but if you use the explosive rounds it's like you have to aim for their stomach bear them in the head at like zero to two hundred beers right it's pretty nasty trust me you'll get low you'll get loads of downs if you just aim for their bare butt or their stomach aim for that but that's how it works yeah okay I put the Cronin almost eek I think you're right like they've built it that blueprint that you can buy they've built it for that reason yeah they know it's not but the use of soccer against the ball actions the explosive can one shot down by the way it's your head but you have to aim for the tummy basically it's likely okay story yeah you're chaotic be okay you probably aim for like the upper chest because it won't be as yeah you won't feel it as much why is this taking so long fine again Todd and I were to get the memo I think our lobbies bugged we have to because it hasn't even done the thing where it says looking for ping we'll try again I like the high you know it's really cute yeah it's cool on it hmm are they much bigger in real life compared to German shepherds no oh yeah no muscle no no he does look he does look pretty pretty DV chunky Landry no I don't think they are I don't think then that big I think that they look besides the dogs hot dog and then luck and then that's why they need like five of them to kill a lion yeah of them I've done my math they're studs what staff you after bird documentaries just watch The Lion King hasn't he yeah did you see the new one the live-action one well they do a couple things differently and it's impressive in terms of the visuals like Gavin is a little bit real credible just not as iconic as the original cartoon you know it's timeless it'll be just rude Thrun down they've gone wrong I just I just think it's as good as it was like a lot of the Disney movies do you not need improving in any way did you see Aladdin there Oh blue Will Smith yeah did someone have a guns yeah Jack no yeah I mean it actually wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be it was alright I mean you don't need to remake a lot it come on come on Disney like I feel like I come on you fill my car come on yeah redo Finding Nemo put with human actors what do Finding Nemo but like real human actors it seemed like a finding Dory on ice or something anymore nice and the Dory question oh my god the eyes let's just say the eyes can be a nice place if they dried head is sticking at the top of Dory where the eyes are yeah just right here we go tuna place woods let's do this are we gonna notice a difference he's ever gonna get killed off immediately should we try and go for a relatively safe drop always know where say we're 200 players I was paying earlier like again if you just pick an edge you're probably gonna be alright just don't go come on spots right before you get ruined so I mean we could do this drop but again it's ASCAP so it's gonna be popular and it's early in the drop and they added more contract seeing as this to under players it feels like they have look at quarry town is that's good he's so busy yeah and we're all good here's our safe drop guys this is where you drop in season four if you want to be safe safety first I don't know if that's good advice safety third safety off I mean we're fine oh yeah we are fine yeah you are the weakest link goodbye was the onus don't start you seem it once he's gone if they put the right ech in the floor loot no thanks I'm come across here I'm saying yes yes yes they have I picked one up in there one of the first games I played with Staton Tama earlier it's a legendary legendary weapon blowing what is it is it a blueprint and they've got on sale yeah it's the only blueprint they've got for it at the moment but um oh I think I think I think you've you thought of a good name for a safety first is when you have to kill them just in case you know study why have they changed your color what's going on what do you mean what your colors different oh yeah look at school now oh no I don't have the green one he's got the green one it turquoise blue and me I could have tested the hyena I've wasted it no one idiot failed that was a waste of 12 quid oh there's a lot of people in superstore I'm holding myself back I see someone here at silos silence the thirst trap well ah we are the filling yeah I don't want to be the filling finish the mission you want to be the sounding right on the outside I'd rather be the bread granary bread where their goat summer I think he's gonna be in that purple building it's closed on us for sure in the puns in perps everyone breaking together come in let's go baby let's go nothing and just I like checking with my head what does that mean I said I poked my head over and if they kill me then I know they're there for it very slowly he must across the road and on that way this rock looks different what have they done to it I mean oh yeah that's different isn't it it's got a face look it's got a nose that's a new rock I swear I'm not kidding who a sir why they just thought that what does it mean is it for night Jack what what's the title gonna be new rock who wrote bad no one fix on the video on boy I found my way wait I eat it hyena oh yeah he's down he's down time I got him get the hyena out the way or others is deep emergency yeah yeah where is he rosy he needs to move but please imagine do it what what is going on pencil and fella please move for spoilsport what's he doing I didn't want that Westie oh how do they make it just run for this oh I have the common decency to just drop on a four-man squad sir maybe they discovered the rock or maybe maybe if what was he cooking time I've always wanted to know what was what was in the room what was he cooking see he didn't stand a chance speaking of new things by the way on the green marker over there there is a small Hut that used to be boarded up now it's not boarded up anymore but it's got a keypad outside the door and a crate inside it that you can't get to on the green my little shack that you marked yeah it seems to have a boarded up front door and it's not brought it up anymore right it's got a keypad next to it now isn't there a key pad in bunker 11 now yeah I heard that but no one knows the code for it so I'm guessing that they've made it less hmm less challenging so they tried one two three four probably not zero zero zero zero right we have a five we've got not many fans imagine if that's the current Tama are we yeah one two three four a zero zero five stud Oh helicopter there we go they're the people hunting goes like this and I get cook where's Leslie Creek res ones running no no one's running around much around Oh gotta reload don't know what happened there most the ground it was the SK I mean your life how many alive oh hang on to my left so I got me and they were on it we're all in the same goo like Emily's right next up oh yeah activision decided to put snipers in the gulag they that they need to be taught a lesson pushing metal now right your spawn side your spawn machine armor again [Laughter] unbelievable that's a kick w if ever saw on mu and before me online before you I don't know it's just random isn't it does not depend on the order that you die if I've I've died before someone before and they've gone in before me well I'm in my car 98 okay go that's a bit more boy I'm gonna run left is pushing hard right holding hard right pushing mid right still Summoner slid into your spawn oh I tagged damn buddy finish me but nothing left I've got mk2 let's do it I haven't seen him song still the back of thing respect come I guess he's pushed now middle also I mean melees the way forwards of it yeah dude nail is what you want I think you think you need to shoot some more stop hey always see me wait you did heli off the roof by shooting it ya know ya sick right I'm sick of it's on loan you push the end up no I'm just gonna chill there I'm never gonna see you again if they're the people around them looking yeah loadout wonder if there's any more new ropes around I'd reckon I mean these guys are gonna kill us but just watch Jack that number on it and the number was the key part thing we needed maybe box Tom I've got my family boy yeah I'm coming I can cover the loadout if you want to be quick [Music] Tom's gonna get killed that was close okay now what do we just give up well what are we gonna do you got 2,500 it's nearly enough for one yeah sorry about team bouncy game bad thing yeah do it do it why not why not why not there this could be good this could be good what's up no guts how you doing what am I thinking of the update well to be honest this is one of my first games 200 player squads it's a bit crazy haven't even managed to get the load out yet we were attacked by a squad hello Santos how you doing Darth Naidoo we just started playing this is the first game as AK deke and what are your thoughts on the Uzi this is pretty good if you get the special magazine for it you do that challenge [Music] no homo just got destroyed the stars got the new sniper there Oliver you've had to delete everything off your ps4 to download the update and it's still going yeah it's a big update it's a really big update I hope that they can reduce the size of the game because it's ridiculous isn't it every time there's a patch it's like before we gig download not everyone's got a super fast internet connection crazy I don't know why I don't know why it's so big there's more people around oh I know it's Todd he's in trouble hey Steph if I throw an ad for the truck and blown it up I could have actually got them both down there hmm Mikey was the bit CeeLo I've head not the staad plays we've come to expect no how did that gonna win the flavor no he hit the sieve oh no I missed the shot come on stoner by next time that happens we just do a quick reset completely things add a TSP now what things like that sort of 3x optic and there Cronin on the on the Barrett on the Barrett they they actually add a TSP now use the decoy sir zoom level well it gives you a D S speed based on the base scope which is a really high magnification this is how they want you to run it yeah that's the blueprint this on sale comes with a cronin optic it's quite a cool looking skin that's not bad see I'm not a fan of it someone just dipped it in red paint reminds me of like a racecar well it looks like that's what they gone for Tom I'm thinking about this right gone is the thermite sniper a good opener and then but the burn ism isn't that long it's about a second or two oh it's about a second and a half it's not a lot where was that hook Cameron what's that where was that hook you marked okay it's all the way over it's been next to TV on to the right of TV station next to the road that small little one right over there on orange that's it kinda wanna go there mr. C we can land on me if you want just to get out of the way and we can go to yeah yeah because check it out let's do it do it we'll try we'll try to a zero zero five nine five go why did you pick that number Tom I don't know just it speaks to me it speaks here yeah [Music] she's an attractive number that's all approaching your position move to the same time wasn't so the hook was there before but it's different now it's changed yeah right not that there was a keypad on the one by the gulag I don't if you ever saw that one last season yeah there was these two right yeah that's right what this particular we're checking out was building it boys these tell us about the keypad so it was gonna crate inside it as well it was a keypad on there and you can't get in but there there's like crate there's a crane line it all look like there's like a like a desk you can have a look and if you did yes you can see it can you stand on me step on me Dad step on me daddy there's also something the other side young lad here young lad you can't use the keypad not yet anyway I think you might have to have something in order to shoot one is it like the one that was on trenches yeah there's a map of a dark-skinned there oh yeah hmm there was a crate in there earlier when we landed here so you must be able to open it now then if it's spawning gamma and crates right yeah you would assume so yeah what else is it if you shoot keypad there's a red foam in our red fire yeah there's a red fire and there's a laptop you kind nuke fine that's interesting it starts like don't care about Easter eggs so they've all got guns and we ruined yeah all right in their empathy near there yeah my team there's another team right here bust in that shed maybe they'll see me they see me song you're mad lad you're on the quad a yeah it's not building [Music] yours as well are they obsess on purple yeah yeah second floor hold on here we go hyena time it makes hyena noises plus the strike fun indeed oh and that Nancy down one left one left out the back window you're on your own start for say he's a grand for blue it's got to be ready I'm stairs yeah ruined has anyone got um spare assault rifle ammo are we all ruined your plane actually you go I robbed some song thank you SMG yeah yes yeah but what see we good I'm good alright I study yeah the hyena did the laugh and everything like yeah amazing nice did you kill the guys in the building yeah we're clear lovely someone on green are still fighting it yeah a pea green the slowest abs speed on this new rifle man what the right egg yeah he's pretty low yeah it's pretty horrible it's a hench boy screw this I wanna live I'm down from the green roof okay come to you now Joe I've crawled into the garage oh yeah oh they have the low dose already yeah scavenger contract I suppose we did mess around trying to open the door for Damon yeah thank you well I got let's just say they were purple beams involved in my death I've got nothing dude sorry I've got a foul dream I'm gonna hide in here one behind the the white gonna try and grab the weapons are dropped that's right are they fighting someone else you or no they're fine Zana broke his armor in the doorway over there I need to find place from somewhere man I'm dropping dropping dropping oh thank you yes oh it's a crossbow another one have any more plates throw my plate it's the plate

got one I'm good dude okay bikal examine forget now stop it maybe carried on going I heard shots pretty close next to me one right next to me here in the tent one down smash in the other night okay sorry sorry your name wasn't popping up that's good anymore yeah there's one down here's something they might be wrestling him there's no I think they get segunda Stadium the guy wanted Stadium in just run run in teamwipe yeah that's the stadium guy Stadium man let's get in there right right on their position just be careful just how many as you see that it's one where have they gone low down down yeah yeah but get when you pee careful when you pee it's right hidden below MIT blast yeah just lay it right there no idea where the other one is round the corner pushing University okay money as well money my was that no no no it wasn't a team wife it's a munitions box here there's a plate box if you need I'm gonna buy tell me back I'm dropping this play box sorry ice community sir that's your plates over there you can grab those Katie it's alright oh that was a bit hot yeah it was you think you didn't find me start yeah by problem no I mean the idea speed on this is so slow man it's like a whole second it's literally a whole safe that build though it made a terrible build for him we still don't have already sure that scope is your only increase in 80s speed oh no wait guys we need to get away from Stadium because if it lands on the roof or ruined I'll load up get away from Stadium running gonna land on the roof I know it is you think it takes into account what distance you're facing like what direction your face might say no maybe Green Teams doesn't it yeah so we need to be away from there we go oh we got lucky if it was probably nothing downtown or okay only one great stadiums definitely gonna open at some point because the the grapple things aren't on a side that we're in a teaser image so in that picture there was something there on the top right was like red ropes and just a similar to like they'd work like the zip lines inside the elevator shafts you think they'll add zip lines so like some of the buildings in downtown as well I'd be calling that yeah maybe what black out on the outside yeah black out her grapplers in there okay oh my god oh look his head clean off is there a mic on why why are we still being hunted is it glitched again yes where's all my pain love thing Southwest High cool girls sniper you can just see how slow the bullet is in the turn down hello he's on the left here stud did you hit that guy Tom velocities terrible I hate that guy on the left hit the guy on the Left he's life threat three triple threat is that them oh great now we're never gonna hear footsteps supply choppers I was gonna fly over us I need snipers between the truck he's behind the truck well I tried to make a push for the left can you go it's a cover I'm behind boxes down dude this okay does a lot of damage to the body is just not like a sniper for headshots I'm trying I'm trying to get it started it was called Mira y'all covering from the night I'm a break okay stun is between turns oh okay this one more there's another squad yeah I mean straight into the goo like it just sound incredible doesn't it though that that sniper straight back in it's that she put me 1,300 meters away like a movie I think dams pretty should we go down she'll go down yeah let's go down go for the top one yeah okay survive I'm gonna try I'm pretty sure that those two dance I got without sniper I only hit them once oh don't know if they'd already been injured but it just hit them and then exploded and then down them yeah even if you hit them in the head Jack it does headshot damage for the right thing and then knock them down with the explosive right anyone that can one shot it was shooting down one of those choppers or not if you have time I mean I don't know if it's someone gonna go tomorrow helicopter kind of your left as well yeah oh yeah I mean he could come for you can watch out someone shooting at him okay yeah yeah salute listen as bait that is yeah I'm kind of looking for the guy that's shooting out on the I mean we've got enough to buy we've got enough to get one back yeah or should we just wait for the contract what you reckon get one back cuz then if if someone does come along and you know having a third persons not gonna know gonna hurt is it if they just bail from the chopper come I figure they bailed from the chopper there was two of a minute between the jack oh yeah I see it not much point me shooting there we're out of the zone for the next move yeah we've got a bit of a on the dam now yep different people different people from further down all did you survive why we got a minute a minute on this contract hmm Oh sniper still lives so many snipers so many small ways you bought me yeah we bought you back okay should we just get the truckers bail oh yeah might even why not it could go through the tunnel it's a beating snap you're running across that road hey let's go for the tunnel fine by me for him it just the inside guys inside and then them then you've got the King bouncy cause she was so low on place oh my god killed himself he's found himself is he just okay yeah it's just one guy's gonna jump off the edge and now being sniped no the King bouncy 16 seconds yes you're actually killing questions gonna fall send in a truck like a madman I nearly got him I'm some same time you only sniper ammo Tom I mean you're better off with it than me I've got a mk2 but I got three rounds okay yeah but in the gun the one we we're brewing then I pick up and then it might give it you it only gives it me on when I picked that gun hold on I just doesn't work in the gun they thought about this you have another King Barney here yeah the gas is coming no we gotta move I'll grab it the second king think I'm not gonna say we're ruined but we're ruined so what you just said it yeah right we're ruined then yeah someone sharing others no believe it why would they do that I'm gonna get one shot it's an HDR on a x50 isn't there an ammo supply around a track somewhere I don't know I don't want to stay to find out you go I mean could we shoot this down I don't know this is black 8 300 meters a row that's the only thing you can do take that LMG I can spray it rather than that yeah okay [Music] like that tonight so that probably were Honda that is all my semtex with who netted sent it you having a laugh [Music] and it's landing in Guam it's come to Guam is it in Guam we're gonna be right next to them fine don't worry about it there's only a massive Martin Oh he'd been Schneider yeah I think so oh great he's far all precision asteroid I mean I'm yeah having a laugh I'm going back for it did you get it Tom yeah that's big cap now takes a while Tom OH as the king pushing himself in harm's way Oh Tommy you can read em jack there's a guy on Jack oh no no he's already directing break vodka on top of me I think he stunned me he might be pushing me yeah he just fall Sam it's just I think it's just one guy son I think it's just one guy survive Tom survived 20 seconds can we just click play again here does that work you can but this splash screen up and then in the background it's just the normal lobby so you'll hear all these noises yeah make it sound like the normal lobby okay so just doesn't work well it's a very cheap way of making it look like they do what other battle Royales do like in four night when you can just queue straight away kind of thing right toy to me yes Todd did tell you about 17 times fun it's just on the loading screen now for me yeah it seems a longer doing this cuz I think all it does is in the behind the low degree it's just searching for another lobby okay and you just can't see it do something not yep counting down now there we go I know it does it again it's a sick system I say a e75 the best gun in the game it's got like an oil slick on it that's cool yeah it looks like that oceanographer yeah yeah that reminds me do you remember pogs hogs I do know I do Joe you do you're old enough yeah yeah the the ones that you turn them inside out I made this it's like a little dis oh I know what you're talking about I mean like Coco Pops at one time yeah you would have a to where you would keep all your pogs and then you'd have like male Slammers so you could try and flip the pogs and the ones that you flipped you got to keep and whoever had the most pogs would be called the pocket it's a Jack how you doing hello Stevie Ray hey Cynthia are you doing lazy cooking what's up guys thank you for coming along was up 80 it soviet orange the an karna how's it going guys thank you for coming along to the stream we're doing it alright the hottest of drops ever yes so hot I'm burning on the lay down I'm going into the atmosphere this man as the best found sleeping a never seen in my life I'll be beamed why ever got a peeler having a laugh potato peeler potato peeler have the same accent someone's due right there in the jury next yeah of course instant track hey I'm Max Payne don't even care let's go in there like eat okay eat you tell me I'm coming oh damn I didn't shoot at all well man yeah they chase the ground Lou up as well I'm in there yeah there's a team in this building here on orange by the way well that's not and very low run you still be on the rock that's two of them they're now behind the job I another theme perhaps Jesus from - available you can see my map look you get it come on Doc I've been showing the back that seems clear then but there's more to the left like northeast yeah we really like on plates I imagine right we need to run the silos gonna be clear now I don't know hmm actually I've got one two plates on me so you place on me or one plate there you go thank you did you want to go hangers I guess I'm on hangers as whole teams we can we can join in yeah we can eliminate and there's a guy on green I'm sure he'll be great this cool he's not gonna place either Dobby he's not gonna place now another lit here push pushing me start he might still have a triple threat another that broke broken purple burka by me got me in hangar in hangar yeah okay I'll get that cover the door cover the door come on a moment thank you stopping a plate for Jack there you go Oh Jen hell is it are they in this hangar I saw him in a round parcel went in okay we are s to look next Angus could be under the what's it called these tunnels are yeah it could be under tunnels then peek over I'm watching if he becomes anything but not that tight though okay no it was Donna outside you going in yeah okay I'm watching now side of the boat I bet he's at the top so up the top don't know okay let's do it Tommo still three threat yeah got no pie [Music] but there's still one here somewhere that's still close yeah just broken I don't know if it's actually broken because I'm pretty sure it's broken every single time the snipers west on the red roof what West you know I mean oh yeah over there I'm gonna keep pushing hangers because we still need all live the loot in the world a baby monitor don't see anyone around use landed on superstore who like which we had to this by hello doubt yeah I'm here for place as well yeah no no no Oh wah-wah bomb we can definitely afford plates like how that guitar isn't just client-side Tom even though you open that I could still hear that as well yeah cash plate neat oh and two stacks more by me can i explosive sniper on the go let's do more is the bad way I thought I might have thought as well because it might give you less ammo if you put the explosives in but it doesn't gives you the same amount max ammo no no come on few more hits will do it yeah I wanna cut I swear like some of these shots dusting on that here oh yeah I'm running low on sniper ammo nah yeah we we can buy more place guys might be a good idea I've got no reserves I've got 28 bullets we got an ammo on me sniper ammo here I'll buy some plates start some more ammo there sir okay courtesy of Tom oh thank you for the plates thank you no I'm not found this spotting scope yeah is it is it real I had it yeah it was a gadget it is basically a sniper without a tonight but it gives you a pretty decent 3d spot that lasts quite a while yeah it's like a recon drone right yeah all right where we headed I'm gonna get fire station but you think downtown explosive snipers is the way I think it might be downtown every game just imagine pounding people from a rooftop on a roof them who do you know this feels like a combination of the MA a.m. the m82 in battlefield 4 p.m. 32 mg/l at the same time with the explosive routes that's what it feels like why there's a guy on this roof here alright it's exploding tired it's one over there I mean you keep and get Splash Damage on it like it's pretty good somewhere hey on that rocket head marker are the three res discovered in he's there on the red mark yeah this is not the way I thought the BOK s go with your braids but on the roof yeah I think of a force my probs thanks be honest but it sounds so good it sounds amazing does a truck get the truck three of them ends up he comes towards the see what is he doing easier go away bro Kazama Seymour we built the suppressors on downstairs that yes the 140 yes that's one delivers more I'm guessing there is a team wipe the pair turns out someone else is pushing him one on the load-out so as a team dropping off the roof they've got their load outs already now from Red Roof still 85 players in this game there's a respawn here right here it's most beaming let's hammer it let's hammer it in the garage in the garage come right here two down wonderful yeah you come I get they're not gonna get in oh there we go you have to move in a minute gasps mascara guys - gasps master kanuda no this is sick I actually like this this is great fun we can buy it we can buy a Tom from here right here that's what absolutely destroyed let's start getting back in back it's gone you know scrub headshot with an anchor FC is it loadout as well but there were people on it can I go that can I go for my loadout in the building on purple there's a vehicle on the effort I don't know if it's glitched note there's a vehicle on the airfield over your of the purple trying to see if I can see I think it's driven away now yes driven away it was near the by kind of but it's moved off there's one of the Land Rovers explosive snipers everywhere we're good police and go ammo if you haven't already you probably did I'm worried phenomena oh it's so good oh they're jumping behind curran police okay all right no no no no we actually have fight in this building here the one wearing yeah they're peeking right side on police okay backside ones backs I was running out don't quite see it from here well the building will be there yep around the third front front front front door we don't have an angle Tom for the moment and understood in two seconds we are here looking in the window not got anything on harp either a guy in there yeah it's in the bathtub you kill them to bed it's my job to kill him without the explosive there was shot around the corner and managed to get splashed I must kill with two heads you get started oh I can't hit the trophy with the plan I won't trigger it but I'm trying to shoot the actual trophy and it wouldn't let me do it but it says in the description that the bullets will pass through yeah yeah I can't I can't even destroy trophy at all I mean come on hello 700 meter imagine if you hit that thermite are you it's at least 50 P on YouTube no way 100 meters smoking guys smoking you worship why is it same there so much drop on that bullet it's insane absolutely insane we are making so much noise it's like a fourth of July was that can II hear you we're going up so it's like the fourth of July Tom oh the fourth of July next week oh come on

I'm just gonna go for it can whatever I die I die okay all right now son you know we were killed by Elon Musk's son Jack they nerfed there I think right no no I think what's happened is that a attempted to nerf it but the actual data values are wrong and they're still the previous version I reckon there's been an error when you look at the recall pattern it is literally triple the amount of like the kilo the vertical recoil it's just that you can you can still counter it by pulling down so you think that it has changed yeah yeah there's like pictures of it compared to other assault rifles now and right let's have mental vertical recoil but still got zero horizontal a Draganov no foul dude I take every day of the way I believe sounds good where we goin start I'm going for this King Barney and then other than death yeah just go melee you just got a melee when you get a giving a dragon off all right I'll let you have a barricade I got shot from East at the arcade 50 Cal I'm gonna go in there I'm gonna go hide in the plane you know that's the play right there yeah another one's going if there's an entire squad in the plane I'm gonna be so sir 200 players one plane one sniper there's no gun try that right at me yes I'll die enemies over there another guy those people run X to me they're gonna push me there's gonna be people where say I wouldn't come there's no goes it this will happen to this plane jack is for the explosive sniper nation city councils were the result yeah I'm gonna hide here run I mean you are saying he's running across the road there you guys have a great time over there yeah Jack I've got two shotguns doesn't it sound like you're having a great time Cameron a slug shotgun no well this is not fair it's hide in a plane start that's all you gotta do no no I uh if I use this luck shocker and someone would yeah yeah yeah this is I'm a king bouncy oh right I'm gonna sit back take a drink yeah yeah how to win warzone in 2020 Oh Jack Jack's got any sign of planes yeah you need to get to him you know I upgraded so you can get your lowdown away my meals come in soon that was a surprise did you go for the chicken or the beef jack chicken you don't you don't read me on a plane that's gonna ruin your stomach that is right this is how I feel about this game this game good assassinate someone at some point it's back if anyone's got a heartbeat sensor I'm ruined so popping balls all they've got to do is throw a c4 in or semtex I thought that was something hitting the table right on the edge of it oh that's the sound of victory look I'm right yeah Tom's wrong I'm right edge yeah I mean your left 15 players if someone like gets in here but nine teams with the back against you you have to go for the high near assassination so you want me to go for the hyena regardless regardless enemy UAV ever look to you and he happens to be in this plane you think that I'm here with the UAV guys I'll turn the volume up I mean it's desolate isn't it no I'm just fine charlatan in there maybe they can see your bus sticking out of the plane don't say that Tom and I'll put a few pounds on a lock down there yeah are you trying to say Oh UAV there's a whole squad house fire all right putting the defaults go back on what they that I feel like I need the range even when I don't need the range I have to pay respects that's a good game I mean we had some nice explosive sniper shots there anyway certainly it we did indeed a wonder if frangible wounding does anything if that helps all on the 50 Cal yeah maybe yeah well I think we had fun that Gable disabling on crippling power April 27 so Tom you you seized thermite rounds what's the deal with then well I was using the thermite but now I'm given the explosive ones ago but the first engagement I had I hear a guy twice body and then he got around a piece of cover but then the thermite is what downed him right so he was still burning yeah but it only burns for like a second and a half you get like three or four like a mark that's with it you guys guys pool pool pool pool and then it just got cool I've wondered about the negative effects aren't quite as fighters it's the same negative effects of the explosive rounds is just not as a person I wonder if other people can set people on fire by being on fire now that would be just don't be fun I'm not playing this game anymore because it's not real can't transfer the fire and install if you up about 200 Giga harddrive space no sir that weekend will you test that in real life actually I run a few on fire and just started rubbing up against you yeah okay why do you want to do is this content is there a new video you want to do or I think regardless say yeah this wants to rub up against see whether he's on fire or not right I cover myself in you know some oil hang on dad you know you don't respawn in real life you just did a DDT on me what the hell a DDT are just quick save back to an earlier time System Restore you got quite excited you may be a point in humanity where you can back up your memory yeah but your brain is just a computer there's no like that's so you think at some point in the future you can back up your memory before you're about to die and then implant your memories into a younger human host but you're still you that's that's ridiculous that's ridiculously but but but I don't know whether it will be the same you or if you'll just be a copy of you you know hmm it's the same thing as if they invented teleport and it took every single part of your being and reproduced it somewhere else it wouldn't be you it would just be a copy of you and you'd be dead right that's what I'm afraid of you know I wanted teleportation to be real but you know it just wouldn't be you anymore it wouldn't be you know it would be you but copy but different saying the / same but different same but different but also they would think that they were fine like they would just come back be like oh yeah that was sick they leave your own so are you you know you're dead now right okay there's a guy here modern warfare oh it's not gone well over there somewhere so people on that roof that marked red marker go oh yeah but then you know it begs the question what are you are you just your brain yeah yeah do you think you're just your brain maybe a solar cell you are you you your brain driving and then is yeah is just helping our brain training so even if you can already find someone air off your brain it would you don't think that would be you started if I could what if you could copy and paste your brain you think that's that's still not you if you didn't some of it would be someone and it would be just like me and they'd have all the same memories but you I would be dead it would be staad to but you are your brain yeah but but like it's not like it's not like the camera feeds where it's like I just switch the camera to let you know you're literally like you got you know the original versions guarded you're just you're your clone has now taken over your okay I didn't think we'd be getting this deep no buts about this okay I'm thinking about this now if you take your brain completely out of the body and put it in someone else's brain it's not like you end up being someone else because you're a different body so so you're right so okay so you're saying if there was a way to take your brain and don't copy it so you just take your brain yeah and then put it in another host that's still you oh yeah yeah because because there must be something in there like some sort of soul like thing it's like a complete memory backup and it's that I FA have you have you guys watched altered carbon on Netflix yes thank you that's my brain looking through my Netflix like previously watched I couldn't think of an in a day that's the one yes a full squadron I was just trying to find that you ever need to watch old carbon yeah there's people right next to me out on this yeah the light I'm gonna get sniped by the king dude this way get down here there's one more someone to my most wanted is still in there we could get loadout now guys I'm dropping money drop your money here but also carbon is such a good show you have to watch every other season to find it bad though I'm not seeing it it's it's it's decent it's not it's not bad by any means someone was definitely season one was the best yeah I got a bit bored guys I'm watching it and I was just like now yeah it's a slow burn slow burn yeah the last few episodes it's cyberpunk it'll yeah yeah very much so I bought more planes there this discussion you're having is exactly like that yeah basically what are the consequences if it's in your neck that stores everything about you like memory wise yeah when you die as long as that ship isn't destroyed that's literally the only way you can die right you get put into another corpse so your chief would just be replaced and you'd be in a different body different face yeah well because that's I mean there must be there must be otherwise yeah otherwise Jack you know let's say they completely copied my brain and then and then put it into a new body whilst you were still alive that you know it's not possible they're gonna stop looking for you and be it's you bodies at once you know in Altered carbon if you kill the host lobby I'm it if you kill the host body you can have the chip put into anything else but you can also crush the chip and completely kill somebody yeah basically you just destroy everything about that person unless they've got a backup but the backup would only be from the moment it was backed up yes well yeah that's what they sort of go into like some of the higher-ups in our show the rich people have like bodies on demand they basically just make bodies so that's what they do but on the level do you think that will ever be actually possible yes I think you do you can definitely take those minerals if the world is still continuing in like a million years million years I think I think 500 what 500 years clean 500 the 500 be a disabled little bear dude I mean you won't be able to do that with a normal cyber I need a

sniper in the game come on explosive sniper rifle nice sweat guys nice weather yeah well fine I didn't tell you examples shot at the building I think when I down the guy that was on the roof I think I let me hey Mallory that's what I should have done let me ever like hand oh good this is decent game I guess that was the getting I realize that twelve if I want I don't want to go on its deal - yeah I guess good way it's a good name isn't it yes a good name I use the AMR for the beginning of the game then gave up and switch to HD or the grouse a better sniper than the amo [Laughter] surely but if there's any culture it's been nerfed if there's an ATV on 20 health going away you'll be right home it's a bit like us the chords ah David Mitchell at Mitchell and Webb and homeopathic hospital you know seen that no it's good one I'm not gonna go through the whole joke I'll send it to you I'm gonna change my right loader I'm gonna switch my mp5 for a growl and go just full meme I do feel like with 200 players there is there is more players alive at the end you feelin it I was gonna say that when we were pushing those final few buildings be a little bit more aware of what's going on mm-hmm managed to get a win there good work boys it's definitely a meme coming this thing meme can y'all can I got quite I got a really nice down on one of the guys on the roof and it's just you just see like him run into this explosive bullet and it slams into an instantly down zoom it's a great little yeah when it's the last person of a squad and they just die that's incredible many many Gibbs she's gonna be entertaining for about a week and then we're gonna go back to the ground making anything any more interesting I didn't touch them for did that it took them three attempts to nerf the m4 properly so now that the employees not know if at all dude it's still exactly the same it's just the ground better yeah what about the mp5 I mean I've not used it yeah it's got permanent damage at range but it's still pretty man's up here the main nerves will it work to the 10 millimeter rounds all right we're we're gonna drop well just to change things up I think we should drop here silence just right there just to make sure we've covered the entire map today I didn't get to use a spotting scope is that the one when we were in downtown yeah same game oh my god no way that was the same game we traveled so much in those last couple myself yeah we did well there's there's nothing on silos so I don't know if we want to pick somewhere else what about this pilot super what what what don't you like about my silo okay what about this yeah Oh super I found the spot listen I'm gonna go for this helicopter just ignore me okay we're gonna go for soup Eli is that where we're talking superstore y su pistola right Barney yeah let's go don't pick it up though cuz you can't drop it you can if you could pick up another tactic you're right there's someone in the front door so we're not

random building with a keypad I'm gonna go over that scout there's all the best games go I know they do like mission find a spotter scope okay I would love to I don't like why are they so rare if they're so useless I'm not - in a couple few hours when plane why would they spawn maybe on towers and the Gulag oh my god get deleted from the lobby oh yeah yeah ruined him did you I did I did do that I think there's gonna be a spotter scope on top of the the a tee time okay not even named him you aimed and that's where I made a mistake ATS only can you get that one come yeah I'm gonna go on there it is noise I've actually got a sports coat no way yeah nice I'll get this one too if you want pool so you get thermal and a zoom oh your thermal didn't see that yeah it's basically a spotting drone you know what that's kind of cool it is cool it's just not much I wish it was a gadget and not a tactical that replaces a stun or a harpy I'm gonna count the seconds one two three four five six grab that it's a six second spot that's nice if you know that use means what you must do yeah you'll get the alert the base like where is this guy you can see it's bright red like if you're not looking at it it's literally bright red oh my god I just drove this vehicle on top of the plane most hit a ramp no further do you know what sorry I don't need a rest just leave me dead that's alright

horrible Sal phrase is too much fun Tom oh no no I get play box sorry should we go play box yes new voice actual we don't need take my money not the place it's cheaper at this point for us to get a normal place right because we don't have the satchel yet I've got a satchel same yeah you both up sideshows okay you need a bit more money before I can get it you've hidden the mourners good Bonnie place right drop your place before you interact with it it's not nice to leave no case who's the only one that it would have worked with anyway I've got no place yeah have another fans right where are

want to go son oh no that we not know cuz moves actually hit anything from their meas be close why'd you wanna go up there I'm a near airport maybe this building here these buildings on blue that's the nice little central there there is people kind of close yeah he did it what's it for the no scope which was a sniper just took it on the shanks videod oh dear I was funny see fall was already on the ground as if they'd like time traveled and they knew exactly where we were gonna be it's doc and Marty that was really close I mean we almost didn't we almost had fun we almost had fun that round so close to fun yeah my fun meter was nearly there I used to have fun like you and now then I took a growl to the face ah no one wants to grab to the face nope Yoji Slav it's the new sniper the right tech 50 Cal shear how is the new sniper it's pretty fun I mean it's really good at taking out vehicles and if you hit someone dead-on with it usually a one or two hit down there I don't think it's as versatile as something like the HDR or the ex 50 like I don't see it becoming like a main sniper unless someone figures out a sick bill for it I mean really tonight we've just been memeing with the
