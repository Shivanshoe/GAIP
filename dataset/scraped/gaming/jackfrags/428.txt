mr broken okay and begin the search begin the search hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to more call of duty warzone today we are playing quads with study broken and mr pro westy and we'll be using the fastest smg build in the game today the mac 10 i'm using it here with the no stock which i've just started doing and it's just all about absolutely close quarters chunking you could remove the suppressor if you wanted and put maybe the eliminator on or go for a grip instead like airborne elastic wrap but i've been playing with this a few days now and i'm really really happy with how this build is looking so we'll be focusing on close quarters mincing today killing people as fast as we can with that mac 10 and i've got the meta gallo there as my primary weapon i'm really looking forward to this thank you for coming along to the stream if you're watching it live if you're watching it as a video make sure to like and subscribe as well it's a great way to help support me and also consider using my code in the cod store which is jack frags in all capital letters with that said let's get into this first game here i'm super excited i haven't played any war zone yet today so it's gonna be good it's gonna be a good one hey carlos herbert tactical scots what's up guys welcome to the stream awesome to see you guys here bit of an earlier one today i think we're getting there we're looking good here i dropped the m60 i think i'm happy with that my 360 is like two and a half swipes right now with this dpi 1600 dpi it's a bit different but i kind of like it i've got to get myself on target get warmed up it is a pretty pog build bin you're correct professional gamer i don't have oh god this might break everything what am i going to do shadow play don't open shut up play it's dangerous no i have to think about the clip start thinking about the clips the clips that we'll lose clips channels from the twitch vod why is it doing this now it's okay you can play the first game where you're going to get like a 25 kill win doing an update still downloading an update what geforce experience why didn't you tell me cancel it cancel it i can't is it one of those ones where it's just is it just the geforce logo on the middle of the screen with the green button rip rip come on come on come on right later late drop for start late draw yeah i guess so yeah where should we go train it's a very central zone here yeah i mean it could be it could be a port we could do a port yeah yeah you want to go to the port you want to go to the park yeah you want some bacon the maple line yeah is it is it the sound clip or is it one of us who knows who no we're never gonna know we're never gonna die [Music] yeah right just go with go window mode and then back to not window mode well he's left the game back it's trios in quads challenge let's do it let's go okay so that's our bounty over there that's our bounty pretty confident there are there he's going to prison yeah don't worry i'll get him with this ground luke pellington make sure to aim into the next server to get him jack hold on yep got him amazing apparently my uh stream has got minus three dislikes how does that i've never even seen that on youtube how does that work you've banked three three likes and put them on the live stream like a lost carriage forward or something you've got minus dislikes on your stream broken i don't think so no well there you go okay let me dislike my own stream let's see red xs keycard guys you would dislike your own stream no it just says one no how that doesn't make any sense i don't know for science broken's gonna dislike his own stream no no no no why do they even let you do that dislike your own streams i hate this i hate this content that i made uh well let us know when you're ready stardom yeah yeah i i should be ready now all right should we just let's pull off a hot pull pull us off never mind hmm it's a scuff start it's okay can you come stop can you call me it's a shadow clothes broken isn't it no it's fixed now it's just the reason why i didn't is because there was a windows update and then obviously it's now done uh through it yeah it ruined it ruined it for him windows update windows update ruined my pc a couple weeks ago it did didn't it was good that's it in your comfort stop and you come come in come in gobble go drive come on uh well i might as well just go over the weapon build again seeing as uh we had to quit that first game so here it is you run the mac 10 with no stock apparently this actually has a better ads speed as well than the 53 fast mag so that's why i'm using it i don't know whether it's busted or it's supposed to be like that at the moment but that's what the data shows that's what we're looking at you definitely want the task force barrel feed it field agent grip and like i said earlier you can take the suppressor off if you want maybe put the socom or the infantry on we'll go for the elastic wrap just for like really fast abs speed but that's the build right there and hopefully we can demonstrate what it's like doritos you just finished watching the battlefield 5 video good timing hey that was phone mad like sniping in battlefield 5 is so good so much fun click the small green dots i know this annoys people doesn't it there's a green dot oh no there's so many green dots watch out watch out yeah it bothers people apparently if you leave green dots but i mean i don't care they're all indicators there you go it doesn't work it's still there sorry guys ruined what's up joe how you doing does it still say i've got minus dislikes on the video or is it is it working now you should like the video anyway you should do that like it right now three two one like boom that's it what do i think of the m16 yeah it's good m16 is good i need to probably unlock it i haven't got around to doing that yet i picked one up the other day when i was playing i wasn't streaming it but i think it was uh westy got a build and he dropped it for me at long range not a big fan but like medium range yeah it's good you got this oh man this odin build always slaps in the warmer then you use it in the game and you're like uh it's not that good and pull down really easily just get no recall on it so the recall on the odin is pretty much just vertical [Music] easy peasy enough practice look at the execution hey we got it all right let's do this we've got a couple new members here as well thank you guys i appreciate that uh musi 679 thank you for becoming a member it's very kindly and chris b86 lucas thanks for the five you played some trios today and guess what aimbot hackers are back you see i've not actually played against a hacker that's obvious in like battle royale 13 days now i

from a different angle man yeah i don't like [Applause] where are they peeking i need some a plate jack you got one yeah i can drop you three yeah watch out there was people peeking me and i can't see where from right now i think it's right here how it's the angle there is no angle there's they're invisible watch it it's amazing play yeah because this is just like we've got several teams just shooting into our box there that's the right we do have a guy in the back like two guys in the bucket that's right they don't seem to be that pushy so they're probably not that confident i stunned them all right let's get up speaking from there okay guys okay he's on the ground next to us no no no no they pushed everybody pushed at the same time everybody pushed it at the same time yeah yeah oh he had cali sticks that's great to see i only did i didn't hear that guy's footsteps i only heard him oh just reset resetting freezer what a great game ruined by absolute sweat lords we're the sweat lords hey that was rough man everyone was in that area hamish i can't stream battlefield and every time i try and stream battlefield hackers follow me onto every single server and just rage hack the am to cheat isn't good enough for me to stream battlefield i've tried it in the past i've tried battlefield 1 battlefield 4 5 every time that i try and stream it people just they follow me and just ruin the server so i just hope fingers crossed that the next game has good anti-cheat and you know a bit of protection for streamers a decent streamer mode or something like that i'd love to stream battlefield but it's just impossible i can't do it i'm sorry i could stream it on console at the moment like if i wanted to play battlefield v i could do it but there's no i can't stream it on pc yeah it's just the way it is uh jack thank you for the five really glad to catch your stream while it's live i'm a big fan and always enjoy your content makes lockdown life easier no problem jack great first name jack frank you are the hacker smh yeah maybe i do have a discord service members only though you have to be a youtube member or a twitch stuff to get on it there's too many people on it before and it was just getting out of control so i had to change it what's up jason boy you use all the guns that i use that's cool when is the new hell let loose out map out jack when's it actually out they're doing russia aren't they like they're doing the eastern front oh hassan it's bug like the drum mag actually has quicker ads what's up cameron hello fbi fbi open up what's up legal hutch how's it going hey john yeah i'm good thanks all right that's enough [ __ ] about we do this for real [Music] use the stoner stone is all right in this metal though nah it's like you can't really use the stoner in these kind of lobbies you gotta go full meta how did you get rock skin for rose i think i just bought it straight away when the season pass came out i just i just maxed it out hey brian thanks for the five quarter stream love your team playing together any tips for someone starting in warzone oh it'd be difficult nowadays brian starting in warzone just just practice try and get a decent team to play with there's a load of guides and tutorials on youtube for weapon builds and movement positioning all that kind of stuff so that could be useful just about practice really station located let's go mad feed i don't think you can unlock the a amax without having base modern warfare so you probably have to buy modern warfare i don't know if that's 100 correct but i think that's right there's people right on it on all of this all right let's get it done you good westy you've been chased i think i'm good i found a peli i've got footsteps underneath me and it's you that's mine got the guy down low in the biker skin broke that guy on the roof are they right above us yeah yeah there's one on the top of the car park but i've just downed them it's getting a milani i got that guy nice are we clear and no more in the middle let's get him up coming over we can dominate we can dominate this is ours boys he's gone he's jumping on the broken's pushing him go to the stairs you guys go oh lord here oh people from uh storage town storage town i've got quite a bit of cash here guys and let me play right everything uh buy station to the west let's go out that way yeah what a weird fight area okay cancel that over by the train yeah yeah grab that one yeah there is a truck repositioning over there we're going for it no no they're just like right on the edge of the map driving around i don't know what they're doing there the train's going past as well we have to be careful of that what that guy's doing what there's a flag cap going on on the train right now is it the front or is it at the back it's there i don't have a shot hit one ah they got away oh i got done it's so difficult to hit people moving on that train like it doesn't seem to work yeah because you had like you if you've got a gun like the pele you have to lead targets but you shouldn't have to well you have to lead it even further because the target's moving really fast oh won it come on the scenes [Music] potatoes yeah we don't have many do we maybe i should have bought a play box it's too late kiliman plate my brain couldn't do the maths brains you guys gobble uh flaggy yes got two options here i'll get the one that's lowered down on airport side i think i can get that one [Applause] where's that going [Applause] it's going flying away i just spammed them a bit roof is looking clear good good sun god over there we should be all right here you want this recon yeah grab it move to the next area and secure the perimeter fun this looks really clear yeah i mean i think a lot of people will still have dropped like sort of superstore storage area so we've got a lot of people to come in on the zone you want to bear i don't want to get away from here oh god why did i go up let's be aggressive again i didn't want to go up please there'd be someone a bit someone's going to be there there's no another just despite thank you for becoming a member it's very kindly solid work you wavy yeah i can get one i can get us one i could drive the road skin team there please one blue yeah they just landed one came back from ghoulie okay well i can always drop in if i need to take up a position here on green let's just go to green i'm going to on the bottom yeah they're pushed they're pushing over where the hell is that plus you just stand on they push back onto the bike you need to watch out for the house yeah he's in the house already looking moving already looking broken here what the [Music] no i jumped on top of the car are you joking what the hell what i jumped on top of the car how why didn't he kill you i don't know you didn't kill me they just said oh he's beaten but yeah oh my god you got him we got well no i think what i did is i jumped at precisely the right time and i actually mantled onto the car there's one more yeah please don't use that skin come on i literally can't even peek him or do we all use it just like we did with the i started well i literally just killed an invisible player with the max i'm proud of you that's how broken it is that's why the mac 10 is the best gun in the game jack's video tonight wow the street is there any plates um i just thought i'm here i can read someone if you guys don't make it back from the ghoulie two of them were using it as well so i killed one and then the other guy just down me dude how do they know coming back like instantly yeah why don't they just disable well this skin oh wait it's because people have bought it and they're not allowed to do that i don't understand it at all i still i'm still reeling from the fact that i didn't die to that guy in the car uh there's a sniper here teammate has been cleared for reading oh i just got started keep going keep going i spotted himself you might be able to see i'm i mean i'm oh behind the rock he's invisible he's invisible behind the rock he's hit me with dmr please come on so frustrating so frustrating find people who call it like that with the stupid skin oh dude i've got no place i've got no fans no grounds oh they fight each other now maybe just for a bit of context if you're watching guys there's a skin that you can buy that makes you invisible unless you aim down the sight and look at the skin you can only see the guns moving and people are abusing it and uh for whatever reason raven haven't fixed it yet and it people have known about it for like a month now so you lose your phone right it's ridiculous that it's still in the game sort them out or capture the objective so dumb they need to be way more proactive with their patches and i actually listen to the community proof by the way so if you go for loader you will get beamed they're still there guys yeah they're still on blu-ray it's me breaking glass don't worry i'm trying to find am i is that i've got anything needs me any guns here's where are these guys are they right in front here once one's on orange we should get away from here we should get away oh down someone down someone nice i think i found the guy on the roof no no the guy on the roof is definitely not there anymore oh i killed him yeah killed him that was not that wasn't the guy on the roof he got on the roof pushed helicopters i can hear shots i can hear shots look at the guy on the roof and also did that building on blue as well i think they're still there you might be able to be alone uh jack is this your gear here is it a gala yeah galileo max 10 i'll push in left side it's not moment beaming from up here i'm moving why did i kill this guy i think we're good here whiskey i killed someone he's not on the rooster i just don't know where i killed him um yeah oh here here here i killed a guy here uh some plates there's some plates there as well uh they're fighting up the hill maybe before this has been a bit on the moon oh god yeah push that visible now where did that guy go did he just quit the game no he's blowing us down killed him broken nice same guys isn't it please just stop yeah please stop look it's this skin here it's this half wookie half i'm on a beach outfit might start doing my solos matches with that skin well that could be the title of the video how to win solos okay there's my gear i think my throat's trying to kill mine is he trying to kill you uh guys i'm dropping four 4k on the buy for someone to get a self-respect thank you all right uh there's actually more gear here yeah you can get one get one uh there's gala on there's galileo mac 10 here again i don't think it's yours uh we have to cross we should probably cross now before we're on the zone yeah let's go oh are you getting shot someone's shooting atc 86 oh my god round one nice sharp go away we got an airstrike yeah i just put it on there let's just move now guys move now that's quite rare actually to get downs in the sec like that with another finish it's the angle i managed to hit the pillar right in the middle so if you can get it like that it actually goes in the middle people here by the way just keep an eye it's interesting yeah be careful here like it's like like a little rat don't hear anyone i'll just hear here from the people we killed bruce claire hey grandma yeah i'm going up the side here can you get up this bit yeah you can you can mantel it it does give you the target group over at fire station if you fancy a snipe also they're still on accident they're in the truck oh who's standing at the top there oh that's you okay you're doing a such a check stun yeah you gotta check the corners these days little rose skin idiot pros everywhere does that go on top yeah they're people on red market yeah one of them's down on blue marker here come by the bunker bounce nice they just called their loadout in he's around the bottom lovely oh i'm being glinted from top of uh northwest hill yeah they got car 98s careful i see him someone's just rest up there can you guys get up here yeah i can get you jack brook do we want to get top of hill yeah we should take him we should take him get himself down he's the worst okay hang on hang on yeah yeah i'm coming on the hill oh literally on the hill one two four right now up the top there i'm gonna get beam above the blue hut i can see them i can see them oh he's gone behind the fence he's gone behind oh oh my god what the hell did i get the show from north west i stood out in the open for two north east as well there's a truck up there cam are you serious you could flank right jack yeah we need to go together though we split up let's get together they're just flanked all the way right into this edge of zones we've got people maybe coming in yeah oh yeah oh no yeah he's still sniping us yeah it's still hitting me they all were at the top yeah down the road up there move yeah i saw that i've got to get up though broken's in perfect position oh i probably can get behind a rock here in selfres hopefully northwest doesn't fight me i'm taking fire yeah again to be careful there it's all good there's more than one up there broken oh i'm still being sniped by north uh north west right here right here another one further right down the hill bit blue blue that's nice i think there's still one there on blue another team another team maybe no no no i think it's clear okay i'll play guys uh gas mask here guys i've got there's another munitions box too what is happening right now at least we've got some cover up here oh there's no there's a player down down down to my team watch your six holy crap what is happening how did he get back i don't know i think he must have pushed up the hill from like northeast maybe uh we have to go north of northwest now which kind of sucks but it it is do we go down into military and like oh god this is awful i don't know because all the way over here or something that's where we want to be why don't we grab some bouncers and then come back in just hopefully there's no one here easy easy i just got an assist on somebody so down there at the bottom of damn i just got someone just died down there it's the last person i shot and didn't kill ninja bugs i mean we could go compound and quickly get a uav i've got the money i don't think so i'm gonna i'm gonna go over and get a uav all right i don't have a ghost and about you guys yeah i died oh no maybe i did get maybe i did get ghost did you pick your guns up when they get it yeah i think i did get it just struggling to remember so much has happened yeah this game feels like it's been going on for an hour yeah it's it's a very i'm losing years of my life to this one king king i think my game just crashed any chance oh no we're back we're okay yeah we might want to get to the wall push all the way left vehicles incoming we can probably nade it whereabouts he's in the king vehicle yeah he's gonna go into the gas okay yeah he's gonna go he's gonna go super long we can we can slide him i think we're gonna come up do you want to just take the hill now this is like a finish from the other day guys do you remember that match we had yeah uh super super sweaty match and we had foresight yeah gyrosaur how do you slide cancel so you you tactical sprint and then you slide and double tap slide so slide double tap slide slide double tap slide slide double tap slide slide double tap slide so i have automatic tactical sprint on so just i don't have to press shift as well well that's how you do it it's a full core man so it's basically just all out yeah oh they just they're loadouts let the other two teams fight and then um do you know at least it's only yeah that'd be four before i'm probably one even before before probably they'll probably weaken each other if we fight first okay they're fighting now we have to find them they're up on our ears we have to we have to get up there right now before we close the gap yeah yeah if we're the last two teams and those two teams okay there we go it's 4v3 so we need to position ourselves if they if they're definitely not anywhere near us we need to get the best positioning well let's get green then green's the best looks they're probably gonna buy they're probably gonna buy if we if we're close to it we're 75 years in we would see them on the hill if i would have thought surely i feel like they might go for an edge by so we'll see there you go there you go they just bought at an edge by so now we need to we need to position ourselves keep going where did they which edge by front of us there you go so just position yourself for that position just get up on the hill then yeah yeah yeah they're going to be cool just damn it's easy just push it yeah yeah they're going to be late it's a circle let me know where to precision by the way and i can just do it straight away low on the right oh one on the one on the right hand side right hand side 150 150. ah right here he's low damn it one on the biker skin on that on that tree did he hear me or something it's going to oh there it is there it is okay boys it was m16 for far m16 that's what he was running are you joking i don't think they'll have self-resistance left to find out got this stuff you got this yeah you got this mr stodd that's the ssl oh unlucky nice try double dude oh that push man oh that sucks we were so close with that game as well that was so action-packed that's a good game unlucky unlucky unlocks yeah i don't think he got me on baby monitor because i had ghosts so it shouldn't have come up unless it was bugged i don't know what's going on well that was that was pretty mental uh jackson thank you for the 15. it's kinda you need to try the m13 it's okay turd but it's like it's just not the way that i've got my setup at the moment is like i'm not playing sniper because the amax can do medium and long range and then up close you just use the max 10. i think maybe we should have stayed at greenhouse i think that was the better play instead of pushing i don't know why we didn't need to push but i understand the thought process behind it like they've got the low ground we get the high ground but in hindsight maybe it's just best in that situation to try and play play the zone what is the baby monitor the heartbeat sensor king heartbeat sensor yeah thanks again jackson for the 15 it's kinda what's up rc you've got work to be getting on with yeah just get on with it then so good you can always watch this afterwards as a vod get yourself the proper warm up we'll be deploying soon what kind of pc am i running dylan at the moment it's a uh an intel i9 108 50k 5 gigahertz rtx 3090 graphics card but i've just uh i just had a new pc turn up and i'll be doing a set of videos soon and that's got an amd 5950x in it 3090 water cooled so i'll be doing a set up video with that because it is sick warm-ups time to kick this off how does cameron know what loadout the other player has well you can just see their guns right so what's up carsten hey adriel yeah we do stream on youtube

go sort this [ __ ] out nice shot things yeah i'm from the uk uh trash panda thanks for becoming a member see if stud can do this i'm not sure ford night is for kids i mean a lot of adults play fortnite as well it's quite a tactical game but it's definitely like the appeal is kids right so i mean look at it so why is the scope glint regardless of where this sun is in the sky harley it's just a it's a balance thing isn't it it's it's for the balance of the game it's so that if you've got a long-range sniper rifle people will have a chance of knowing where you are so they can at least get cover that's far too realistic i think for a game like this to think about that kind of stuff a revolution thanks for becoming a member if your teammate wins i'll donate fifty dollars okay donuts michael did i ever mess around in taco yeah i played a bit of talk off done it he's only gone and done it good good oh okay can i please have you got what's that uh i could drive over and get it here

cam yeah that was the mara there's at least two more i downed one and i saw another yeah there's another attempt here they just got their loadout phantom green moving pushing them yeah could be a different team did that guy that mark that's the last guy last guy broke him or hit him he's inside the tent no hit nice lads well played nice little push there i think there might it could be another team nothing nothing okay because i thought maybe he was out of a different team that i was playing there's nothing on heartbeat all right well played well done well done and they've just quit because they load out disappeared gotta go let's go spr and uh there's a guy oh got him blue roof he's just dropped inside they're right there there's a sniper on the right type on the right yeah you just shot get my loadout there's a few teams around there it's going to get messy he was over here on green that's where he was seen him head head head down nice moving position oh vehicle victim we just literally got caught right in the middle of the sandwich we were the meat by the way that guy had some really really snappy aim it's definitely still consoled it was aim assist but yeah but it was it was seriously strong really strong chronos max let's go it could be chronos max although he missed quite a few shots it's just the way that it kind of followed the vehicle i was like what the hell dude i've seen some videos of that crowd as max like it's full on aimbot as far as i'm concerned for console yeah you're up next mate get ready it's not exactly the same as the name but on pc but it's kind of simple if two of us don't survive we just reset because it was like two nice well done well played to stop i'm watching don't really want to go that load out maybe i should at the bullets go stolen don't know i don't know where they went dude they were like can you no you can't so rose skin is like insane yeah okay i mean you could yeah yeah because let me just see if there's anyone yeah they're right here they see you they haven't spotted me what what range do you get the know they're running away but someone drops in is it 100 meters um no actually no maybe 150 oh it was your penny i was using stodd yeah yeah okay two in the building two in the building here stop okay one down okay pushing ready anymore that's it that was it yeah i was waiting for you so i didn't want to push it on my own any chance for a quick read we even got enough no yeah i'm gonna oh wait where did my stun go oh you've got my son today um yeah uh is there a yeah yeah i'll be there grab the grab the recon contract yeah see where it goes oh here oh right here he's got dmr i'm gonna re i need to replay let's go on my left okay i just ran in doing my building stud two in there good luck nice oh god nice try unlucky and you know i knew i was dead unless i switched weapons so that was really unlucky if that was controller dead yeah controller's got a bit like it's got like almost uh like gravitational pull for melee doesn't it you can like swing from a bit further away that's how i keep getting killed by people with pistols at the start because they just lunge really far forwards each time and i'm like you can't do that on pc yeah you can lunge further on console on controller do you think that if you like if you're really good on controller is the optimum way to play this game on pc with controller because you get aim yes i mean i think the movement can be done better on uh mouse and keyboard though yeah so the movement if if you can if you've got the movement like say huskers then i think he's gonna win most fights but if if for aim control 100 percent yeah i think i'd say the only bad thing about controller is long range yeah you can mitigate though if you're playing on pc you can just not take close range fights obviously at some point you have to but for the most part you can kind of keep your distance if you're really good at positioning and you get recons yeah but that's why i think the top winning teams are all on pc yeah and the top killing teams they're all controller yeah that makes sense doesn't it on pc i think his whole squad all right yeah i don't think there's a single one that uses maybe one of them it's like on pc you get higher fov you get higher frame rate you get high frequency monitors you can turn the graphics down so you can see people easier and if you use a controller you get the aim assist so maybe if you wanna if you wanna become like the best maybe that's the way to do it although i'm terrible on controller i can't do controller thank you liam if you play mouse and keyboard on ps5 do you launch further no you launch further on controllers tommy on controllers play time's over mate you're going to the war zone all right let's even get a load up what are the two angry gamers up to today i think they're playing valheim i tried playing valheim it's fun it's really good it's just another survival game to me though i'm kind of bored of survival games now battle royale like a drop point for your team you'll lead them in your leader gas closing in fast get to the safe zone where are we going all right uh well i don't know if i've actually got it on here anymore i don't know surely not on the youtube meme that's fine in the past filthy power live on his new account so they want you on your new account another municipality we've got the money we've got the money yeah oh oh oh i lagged for or oh hang on hang on hang on now where are we going uh we're going this way i guess yeah go that one this is not a good one here we should wait go further yeah uh maybe you go for the flag again it should be there you can quickly do it where is there yeah no it's just it's hurry all right play some proper music uh oh i don't want to get i don't want to get in the car i want to get the load out please stop stop can you buy some plates please no no don't do it no hit oh dude i thought the vehicle kept on going there's a full trio running in yeah they're about to kill this guy you want to just hold this position up here on the on the hill maybe there's also another team over here on green so we're kind of like part of a team triangle team sandwich a team love triangle what are you getting for one day they're running down run down here down nice pushing is he still in the building sniping me i don't think there's an upstairs in this building around the back team oh hey yes val still rocking it right there's team down on green yep they're fighting someone they're fighting vehicles here oh right there guys in the shed he played it dead sneaky man he did was that the same team maybe it's nice no no no he went down there repositioning there's a team on here we've hiding there the whole time i think they got the lowly over there but then i think it's different scene that's that's different there's someone up to the left as well up to the left yeah i downed one on the loadout right at the back oh my god that's what 550 meters yeah do you want to push southeast spr bloody i don't that's the spr on it yeah let's go jack let's go there is still a team on this white building up coming up i think i think big barrier cache oh yeah they just got in there caught in the okay where'd the body quad where is it miles away 500 meters no no no no that's a loadout behind that was on this buy station here you know there was the team here right yeah there was yeah that's who we're trying to push i think but there was someone who just got on a quad bike that was about here so i reckon they've just left and pissed out there's a satchel here supposed to be my nick that's the jeep from before yep that jeep came down here and got murdered by the team that were here again a lowly on the ice oh there's so much there's so many cars around that that's where the quad bike went you know they're still fine never mind moving positions locating they got their loadout on it yeah they've got it pushing up a bit yeah me too we just don't want to get caught so maybe we just take this position here and then just hold it a little bit maybe that guy that i snipe that team have moved off now they were on the airport by i think and then they drop their load out behind this building i just rest someone dropped in back towards yeah right running right now hold on yeah they're sniping out now there's a clinton over there for a comma we're coming the guy's sniping he sniped from behind he's never mind oh yeah see him down got him i think that oh there's a vehicle whoa that's the guy on the hill okay jack yeah just one here there's more here remember are they in there one down watching the sides never remind that i think the garage is star door they further here's one there's another one on the back side on ping i'm gonna go back on the other side of the carriages the squad that we're behind us who just got killed i think i've got an assist again i'm gonna go high okay oh they've already pushed away yeah i think so didn't want the smoke that's like he would say oh was that that was from that was from closer in front of me really oh dude he was waiting yeah to see him cross down did you guys get your ghost i got my ghost yeah i didn't get my ghost you like that peli do you stud three um it's it's not the kind i ate you know is it a good strange sniper though i gave up on this gun before and i'm just like i don't know give it another go it does need a buff i i think the pele needs a buff well play right here oh that pawn secondary yeah you have to i got is and it is a pog right so that team though shooting over here we never really snipe ahead just uh like on this marker just the right overhead but further if you know what i mean that directions air southeast there you go two here there you go two guys two guys are they pushing up they were yeah one down one closer stunning why does the mac 10 make you feel invincible because this is dude i'm running the players val right now but as far 1b1 yeah you'll beat the 10 but the mac 10 is just absolutely well the mac 10 you can hit fire and you don't have to ads whereas the uh as val you can come over easter start requesting moving there dropping one team on green team on green oh we don't need it here hey a green team we're right in the middle of nowhere let's see where green team goes heading helicopter south if you fancy a long range shot oh i hit it where oh yeah i can't mark it's too far away hit it again it's a big shot big shot well he's not going up and down it makes it a lot easier to hit the target i think he dropped i think he dropped out of it yeah he did he dropped out of it i mean that team from police could just keep pushing i yeah they could push the hill and that would be the vehicle i mean it would be more sensible if they went up here surely like they wouldn't come down here we're actually in the worst position for any fight so yeah that's not great why don't we get up here like something like that actually well next zone is down here and we wouldn't want to go up to come down would we well yeah because we can gatekeep people from quarry oh people from korea are all getting pushed into thank you for becoming a member that's very kind to you and else as well i appreciate you guys team advanced warfare yeah you've got to pop that advanced uav really when you've got that much cash you might as well spend it and it just gives you a good idea of where people are you know we know there's a couple teams here there was one team here and there was a lot of people around downtown so yeah that just gives us an indication of where we've got to watch out for what's up jay hey david shane the pkm has a horrible reload time yeah i don't like the p again it's not the one for me close range instant kill isn't it that's how it's been it's always been like that okay anymore go from the hill yeah i think so green's probably the spot because i think they're gonna go maybe they're still fighting now but we haven't heard anything one thing i have most about warzone compared to every other vr yeah is it never ends up for some reason being third partied isn't the worst thing in the world good job oh my god they say that no way um yeah being third party isn't the worst thing in the world in this game whereas if in every other pr oh that's it yeah the third in apex is horrible like because it's so in because there's not really hiding in a building doesn't help you you know it's an apex like just bullet sponge online i hit him in the armor big combination on the right disabled bro tv by the way and he was announcing yeah right here don't tell me he's gonna got a tower well he'd be insane he might do at the back here repositioning just him got in the vehicle yeah he's off again it's driven off he's finding another squad there's another squad there's a guy here i'm blue he's fighting they're in this building now blue marker move it to you guys let's move down to the petrol station um yeah he's sniping that guy two of them sniped them two of them down one on the right oh he's beamed that guy someone just shot me from the left then as well i think yeah it wouldn't pull my parachute the game i jumped off the rock and it just moved oh yeah yeah i see the garage [ __ ] i got an orange i'll get your cam i'll get it hold it hold it thank you i'll keep you covered thank you very much i think they're fighting each other now upon orange guys we we need to move really yeah i thought i'm sorry sorry i'm dropping ammo here you need it yeah i'll take it i almost did the same thing as westy yeah it really annoys me when it does that really annoys me so i'm very much far enough away from the rock to pull my parachute thank you oh my god he's right up what didn't hear a thing yeah no footsteps at all dude that's the first cheer i've seen in about like 10 or 11 days can we spectate can we expect it yeah we're having a great game as well spectacular uh yeah he's behind the sign got him going oh nice play starts right i'm gonna go land on them yeah exactly if you want to die in the goo lag i'll see if i can land on these guys i'd rather get killed by him to be honest for the content where i could try now no no that's not them that's not them they might be up here mark the target get everything you need and if you can kill him kill him just screw it kill him and get all that gear they could just be baiting dude let's try and beat the cheer okay enemy uav over here i'll be them as well with the uav truck on the right side you can report him uh didn't see yeah it was it was yeah it was yeah yeah i remember seeing a default skin there's the rose skins on the top that's him that's both is that him superman is that him yeah that's him that's him that's the cheer cheater yeah we did we killed him he killed him okay his teammates was on the right somewhere he's just going to go straight for a rest need to kill his teammate otherwise we're getting back what if he's shooting as well i don't think so i think it was just the first guy that beamed me was not so good oh they go there fighting fighting you should hold this position hold the um no dude we need to get out of there this area has been searched still i'm just not gonna just don't let me get to bye wait um zone's pushing as well i can hold here you are telling me i would have got surely wouldn't have got to buy it yep this guy knows where i am um i don't think they were cheating they would just change yeah one of them died in the gas who's that is that them no it's not them the one we're looking for a supermage i don't think he's come back i don't think he's come back sure they wouldn't have had enough time is that them maybe this is them this is the cousin kind of wish that when you're spectating like when your team's done it would be nice to like actually get like a full view of who's left in the game and where they are no i think i think they're gone yeah all right go back let's report him was super mage was his name yeah the first cheetah we've seen it's literally been i feel like it's been about 10 or 11 years yeah two weeks yeah it would have been it tomorrow would be two weeks since the first bandwave so well that's sad but i mean hopefully did you find him where is he yeah he's one third of the way down on the right side um oh yeah i got him yeah what's around him um fa is the icon above him and there's like a bull with three eyes found him found him yeah they block him as well yeah he was playing i can't remember who he was playing with why didn't they let you sort it by who killed you recently yes that would make a lot of sense yeah we should probably block as well whoopsie yeah i was unlucky dude at least we killed him we got revenge i need to fix my sensitivity in the bit command yeah my sense is like way too fast on menus because it's 1600 dpi look how quick it is just gets away from me man uh you want to see the a max loadout sure i did a video on it a couple days ago and you want the t-pose reticle or you can go with default but i like the t-pose it feels nice it's good this is my turn i didn't get that one so that must have been someone on your block this jacket could be someone else uh some canadian dude thank you for becoming a phantom it's kinda man revenge is sweet in this game yeah you're right good afternoon blando how's it going man it is it is still a bit of a kick in the teeth charlie yeah just to be killed by a name but yeah free to play game it's gonna happen was a bridge how do you fix the dpi in the menu i don't know i need to look into it hey kim how do you compete with these op blueprints as a new player it's really hard kim it's difficult if you're not playing from the start in these type of games and you've got all the unlocks and stuff it's hard to keep up especially if you're just like a freezer play player i mean it depends what weapons you want to level up though right like if you want to level up the amax then you could try and get like a cheap copy of modern warfare unlock it level it up in 24 7 shipment or something uh zombies is good for that for leveling up your mac 10 ffa our new town as well i think the quickest way to level up without like having to really think about it is to play plunder and you just get a helicopter and you do the supply runs so you know the the clock the contract that's a clock drop get a heli go to a supply run get back in the heli go to the buy station and have the weapon out that you want to unlock so you put it in your loadout and then you just repeat that for like 20 minutes that's a really easy way to level up without having to get into fights with people do i play pub g i used to take mo geek i used to play a lot of pub g but um it's a bit stale for me now waiting for pub g2 is the ak good not really not competitive at the moment unlocking the a maxes in war zone is hard yeah you've got to do it in modern warfare really difficult rumble as well if you just want kills yeah but if you just want to turn your brain off then supply runs on plunder so easy uh lucy thanks for the five in bed ill and the stream is easy my pain love watching jack keep going man thank you lucy i hope you feel better dude whatever's wrong i hope you improve and start feeling more like yourself again audio preset diego i use boost what's up red dragon you're new here well welcome man pretty chill stream hey jan what's up wilmar aka is very good in multiplayer yeah but not really in warzone we doing it let's go you you yeah mp7 is very good yusuf very good and that is satchel found the perimeter okey-dokey yahoo have you seen any of the footage from the super nintendo world in japan in tokyo yeah yeah actually oh it looks so sick let's see when kovid's gone the game changers are all going to japan for no reason it's always sunny music with the gang goes to japan oh that's the wrong one isn't it that's definitely copyright yeah i don't even don't even copyright music isn't it isn't it one of the longest running sitcoms ever what um it's always sunny yeah it's always sunny it's been on for like years if you like dark humor and like really awful people it's amazing yeah it's fantastic i only watch it on airplanes like sure really yeah i've only ever watched it like oh it's hilarious yeah i find it very funny it's on amazon prime i think no it's on netflix it's always been there is it on there is it on netflix free to watch for only 12.99 a month uh three that's going to be 99 a month is that what it's called i think so yeah l.a pandemic you know because everything's good no one's buying netflix anymore get loaded yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah someone's doing a flat cap over here somewhere uh more plates on the bar if you need him somewhere so let's be all right where are that everyone's doing recordings because it's the meta oh sweat lobby is there all right that started yeah chasing vehicles why what are we doing he's on that roof oh yeah he's on the roof right now i'm out i hit the guy on the roof but the tackle it just drove away i did not have it one of them was on orange isn't he yeah asking for it i don't see him there anymore stud yeah he's moved he ran away we run over he's a pussycat yeah yeah hmm well played someone on the right of us as well lots of fighting in the bone zone can we go to bone let's go to the bone zone there's a respawn over here as well southeast oh god yeah that's over here isn't it never mind never mind never mind do we want to go for that or do we want to go bone zone what do you want to do let's go over here southeast i think slightly less action we might survive let's go okay he's gone he just jumped off and he's by that [ __ ] now okay you reckon i can push push little cart nothing on heartbeat he run away you sure he's not on there moving position is within 50 meters there's still someone on this roof here though broke him oh my god that was insane i'm breaking with a quick scope found him oh let's go baby nice little blades you pushing in pushing in cracked on the street there pushing him from construction there's a team in construction yeah i got i downed a guy at construction earlier they're sniping me from over here oh down here i'm moving i'm here i'm heading through yeah yeah footsteps on me oh it's jack yeah oh there's still people from green by the way yeah they were here like down there as well he's insane what are you doing down there shot him through a window he's probably got self-rest that's the only reason i could think he was speaking there one mad man he's insane dude did you get the guy up on the hill was he still there yeah we did you did i think someone did because we got teamwork yeah different team could be a different team i don't know okay just careful i mean there's there's a heli over here hi still on are you kidding me so far around the corner okay well there's two different teams so yeah we're being pushed right now to the rescue let's go let's go i'll cover when i've got my blades on thank you i'm not had anyone pushed yet is that a glass break do you guys are scared okay or me i should say any more right there was a team on green that was pushing over they're on the grass right oh um he's very accurate where i say that i'll say that i don't know where he is um from the hill again same place i just got head shotted and didn't miss a shot a little too accurate maybe maybe could i get a res maybe i'll come over that was a little he missed me completely he missed me completely i'm guessing it's probably a kilo or a max head shot auto aim i'm going to push back here we could go get our ghost if you want to like i need to get plates as well i've got none i can drop you too stop here you go thank you they've just rest on the buy over there as well yeah it's not a great position there for us do we want to take like uh these buildings here on green we'll get a get a view of that three loaders here wait one's invisible skin yeah no they're pushing over now they're pushing over now trying to get up on the roof trying to get a different angle down the down one in the bus uh it's the invisible skin in the bus hmm i just found them i just found them get one below you let's do it i don't know okay this guy knows exactly where i'm peeking from just saying default skin just saying can i come and get you cam i think you can yeah i mean i'm safe here there's no way they'll shoot me just stop might need to provide some cover from that team at the bus i killed one at the bus okay i downed the invisible skin lad it was right here yeah by default skin peaks me before i even p i'm just saying i'm just saying it could just be random yeah i see i see the default he's still on the bus he's still on it heading there now i kind of want to take him down one yeah down him down down the guy i guess we have to push i'm down uh just got he just who confirmed that kill none of us what okay did he just quit finished one i was one of the guys not the default it could have just been a good shot me but he very very quickly acquired me there the default is the default still alive i'm guessing did you get him enemy most wanted over there did you guys get the default skin i didn't kill them i mean i downed him but i don't know if i got the kill or not because i down the guy and i finished on that mark so he might still be there uh no invisible skins here he died yeah no i could that's not the guy that was headshotting everyone are you sure yeah he's dead he's dead fine fine fine yeah i'm just saying some absolute bangers he's part of their squad though let's chase him down over here you want to go on yeah yeah this guy don't stand a chance now oh he's beaming stunned he's running he's running dead was that young default no it wasn't that wasn't even him it was just a different lad team white though so yeah it was a team wipe was that even the same team though yeah i think so because he was he picked up the most wanted at that area where we were yeah he was back there so unless he was coming over here to get his loadout because there's two loadouts here never mind okay well that guy was very sus that that but as well at least we've got ghosts i didn't get my ghost let's go back then yeah let's go back you cut it last second you cut it yeah this has been weird been a fun game at least we're moving around a lot yeah yeah yeah i got 11k oh yeah we should get um self-resistance and stuff bit lager there lovely bit of lag no problem more lag a little bit more lag bring the uav okay nothing there's no one around nothing not a single ad was found this time 44 under circle two semi-sweaty probably semi-sweat or yeah well with that uh that guy that kept acquiring targets very quickly yeah could get king spice up let's go objective is he's on the truck maybe he's like on the there's a truck at the bottom uh they'll just be at the top we're gonna get an air strike on the way uh do you guys want the rest of my money you can get uh self-rest come yeah there's no way there's no way this guy is down low he's definitely up top what the airstrike i have a daddy as well oh player in the sky here he just said got that [ __ ] that must have been like a revenge kill or something hmm it moved then yeah i think he's still up there oh yeah they're just waiting for us to push for us to make the mistake yeah i would like to feel the pain of mistakes playing mistake right he knows we're coming come on come on peek it lad you'll probably oh there you go truck on your left jack as well oh yeah he's shooting he's shooting in the truck he just called in an air strike he couldn't air strike him seen him he's got down the hill he's in cover this guy isn't going to peek he might now he's he's not ghosted but well he might be ghosted but he called in that airstrike and uh showed him up on the mini map hmm did that rose king go uh just in the forests he's now a forest dweller he was on the roof wasn't he yeah yeah it was yeah well i don't know what is i think maybe there's more than one yeah it seems like a risky push i could daddy up air strike it see if they come down that is the point yeah guys we can we can always rest yeah we're quite close to her bye morning someone else is shooting at them now i can hear him yeah yeah i'm on the sounds like an asl what is that oh where was that from no idea he's not on heartbeats he's ghosted for sure oh you got it just had the door crack that was me downstairs can i go up the left guys yeah you can go out lift we've cleared that okay i think we're good yeah it's clear we're good all right that's steal okay and that's deagle found that's the eagle here they got their loadout hospital top of it oh yeah no down low down though unfortunately they're just taking it yeah yeah he's on there he's on the petrol station no ice for me can't really see him yeah anything's unfortunate on the trees right down here frankie benny's moving there that'll probably be the team that we're shooting at the the guy on the river on the roof i'll watch the right side back and see if they peak target i'll shut the guy on top of garage he's run now all right so they're finishing that jack's in he's in he's in he's gonna win it's jack but where is it i don't know they're buy down there hit one shifting location it wants i think it looks like just one guy so far i'm blue now he's resting right there i don't know where this guy's gone he went into the shop he's just rest 30 meters this guy right above and then there's one yeah one in the building 26 meters i think he's in here on the outside maybe be advised oh he's here here i've just seen him i just seen him there alright marco just seen him there no eyes on for me still i don't see him yeah he's inside he's in source though cover my door gas station no uh there were people at gas station not sure if there are any more we just have to take the hill there's a car at the buy station at the top here and that sounds like sniper fire was it just one guy frankie bennett's yes this is one compliment did you have a heartbeat jack no no no heartbeat no okay he was on heartbeat sorry that's twins they're on the they're on the hill at twins i literally hear moving yeah they're on twins i

jack push him i've only got two shots from my sniper left so i'm going to keep pushing the good work there's both peeking me both picking me right now they're just waiting for me to be running they're further along than i thought down's one oh he's gone down the down around the rocks he's gonna raise that guy okay we're gonna come to the hill onto the hill up here we're gonna be super exposed on blue yeah maybe we should try and focus on pushing in they were killed by someone who got killed they just got killed right do we want to focus on pushing into twins yeah we kind of have to well they've just rested on this by here we're gonna be exposed on the right if we go there you wanna come all the way left come all the way up yeah coming on the left twin as far as i can see they were just fighting up there so yeah yeah i'm just going to move all the way i've been wiped out i'm not going to get ghosts i'm not going ghosts i don't think it's worth it i've got it already don't we have it already sod sure we have it already i might apply alert i can't remember i haven't seen my highlight go off so i don't know i can heartbeat if you want just keep pushing enough let's make sure

did you indeed that ruined us i'd say gg's i guess that was mental it was fun yeah but just being down by an airstrike that you don't even get a warning for like it sucks yeah really that's really annoying and i think they screwed themselves over to those guys they died because they waited for us i died ggs did i see the new justice league trailer yeah i did it looks sick i'm really looking

nice to have some you know modern warfare guns on the ground and not ridiculously broken cold war guns going down armor i'm coming over i've stalked out the uh car park as much as i can let's get it done we can get lonely now let's go let's do it baby it's right here yeah baby let's do it i'm dropping that right here right here you can get it from inside the bush if he wants to peek does he want a peek he's not vegan anymore i might draw him out if i shoot he hasn't peaked since since the great event the great event of him peaking it was a brilliant event oh this is gonna get messy i think in this area yeah it's all it's all kicking off it is indeed no one in it no one in it they've just got out here on green moving here it's absolutely kicking off there's many many teams around here including that bouncy team that are in long building my dad here i'm actually not dead if i can stay in cover guys yeah illegally i think i've got illegally illegally there you go other side of fire station you see him on the minimum jack did i absolutely smash that guy yeah and he destroyed the truck we didn't do anything and i didn't get destroyed understanding i thought that was somebody nice one here i think in there i think in there he was just prone on the ground dude yeah lmg yeah what the roof ow on the road still maybe that's the mask and that's also there's also a bounty and there's also a vehicle uh evac evac kelly evac is in let's get the hell out of here let's get out of here uh airport bruce airport oh repeat me he piqued me he's on fire we're gonna get yeah in the back we're gonna get on the back here let's move back back here to green because this guy's just gonna hold this roof and get him down he's got a teammate he just sniped me okay wait watch out westy because the guy on the roof is locked we haven't shot him yeah he's still down fire you don't miss he's just jumped into the building he's like leaping around down here oh on jack uh i can come back hold on i can stand if they cross rowing start noise no is that nothing he's gone in i think where the hell has he gone what oh f4 maybe what i stunned him and he just all their forward yeah yeah you must have bought record that's cool what a player what a gamer being tracked by an enemy team stay sharp that's so dumb that is so stupid like pushing i think i've been there but like not when i'm the one being aggressive yeah when when i'm the one pushing he got some shots on him i if i didn't stun him he had a chance to kill me but he just went nope i'm out do you want to go yeah i'd love to yeah there is a team or there at least there was over here when i was getting my loadout i've spotted them i'll go get this flag cap 47 players beginning of circle two read the standard orders they're in the uh compound right in front of you yeah yeah target illegally i think this is really dodgy push for us guys oh i know yeah i think we should just give up that loadout maybe yeah maybe under secure because they know we're here they've got head glitches they've got good you want to drop back and go left get across the river over here somewhere speaking with an amax just going to keep switching sides on you speaking i don't we don't know i don't know where he is he's on green yeah he's on green we don't go back we don't have snipers either team fighting back here god he's so good he's so good at the game i'm you guys oh my what a theme that guy's got he was in the middle of reloading and he was shooting me yeah that makes no sense a max i think with a mount i don't think he was mounted he wasn't around i mean i think it might have been team in there in the bunk in the little hangar at least one okay let's just keep going push back this way because you're in the open there um zone is pushing oh vehicle vehicle yeah yeah footsteps footsteps yeah yeah oh they pre-aimed the what okay all three of them pre-aimed he didn't dive what gun is that oh yeah he's not getting him he's attacking him but yeah he's aiming kidding me dude come on please i almost killed him i almost killed him too that was him yeah he locked onto me through a wall spectate time what was this if i survive spectate time it's a fun it's a fun game the cheetahs the cheese are officially back head back please it's pure it's pure rng oh my jesus christ it's a fun game it's a fun game just land on there i'm landing near the airline right here yeah they're literally there it's a fun fun game where everyone has fun having fun one kill there we go frank the tank it's frank the tank that's the guy is it no it's two-tone stub two-tone stuff it's a two-tone sub not this guy the guy with the drum round kilo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he's got 16. he's got 16 kills already the cheats are back that's why almost i almost got him that's why the game was so important we almost made it two weeks guys almost two weeks that's two cheaters in three hours make sure to report yeah yeah reported and i'll block him once we're done that's a new account isn't it they've made new accounts yeah 50 yeah ranked 51. so whatever they put in place one of the cheap websites has already worked around it let's have a look at the other other players in the squad yeah there's only 23 players left one kill for quando rondo and the other guy's got one kill yeah he's literally carrying the entire squad but why is it fun well i mean like is this fun like just look at it stopping you think you turned it off then we'll see no i mean the kill cam was quite clear that he was warhage again solid aim lock yeah completely yeah because he switched between me and the other player he tracked me through the water that's the thing you could actually beat him with a mac 10 or an ffar because if if if you could get the shot maybe if he was distracted by somebody but the three-man peak yeah that's exactly what they did they all shot through the wall at the same time they all shot through it so maybe they make their own comms then maybe he called out to him i just don't understand the appeal like the game like you're not even playing everyone else most of the time they're just queuing you know they're playing with just average gamers who you know might not be streaming they're never going to know so what's where's the gratification in that they get the voice comes reactions they get you know they get killed by cheaters so they justify it with like well if i'm if they're going to cheat i'm going to cheat yeah but they could they can't use that excuse because who was the first cheater it's like no no no no no no not everyone i'm saying that that these are just the excuses yeah basically you know that let's say you're a bad player every every time you play you get absolutely beamed by sweaty players now you get your own back you get home from school and you're like hey but i can i can win the fights now look and i i can feel good about it see this guy though two tones up like look what's he do is he looking through a wall there just to like he knows where the next player is so that he could there's a squad yeah there's a player up there he knows like he's looked through the he's seen through with his wall hack and he knows exactly where he is i just hope that he dies i i wish someone stuns him and i hope he dies in the game in the game in the game you can't get up that mate i mean the thing look he's got terror terrorism video cheetahs the back again well i've done my video for today so that the room is clear for jack no no i mean it's live right now so you know there you go i'll just rename the stream i'll get my uh i'll get my tweet out in the game not even today we all send out angry tweets to uh raven yeah that's just my normal not even two weeks rave building guys it's weird because they did the they did another update like two or three days afterwards didn't they were like hey another bandwave yep you've got to keep it up it was on tuesday last week they had another update oh my god dudes got sick how do you do that by the way he was looking through the building that's why i thought there was someone in the building but he doesn't know how to walk over oh yeah he's doing what's he doing here adjusting uh just twisted his name back range the severity of lock-on that's what he's just scaled down a little bit oh it's a bit too obvious isn't it it's full rage hacking as well there's just no yeah he doesn't give a crap doesn't care for expecting i mean like he's got his aim pretty much straight on the player through through cover might not just shoot through the tent oh he missed this he actually messed with this guy's gonna jump peek him i bet you it's a rose again look he's tracking him through he might he might lose if why is he using the camera because he can head to anyone oh god left yeah there it is there it is there it is well well done he's on for a 20 bomb this guy he's on for a 20 bomb i can't believe it only lasted two weeks man two weeks of sweat and this is the reward it's two weeks of probably the sweatiest games we've had since war zone began no no no since maybe like season four season four was pretty sweaty you see right the thing is right right now if they had a system in game that was retroactively tracking players headshot percentage and recall and stuff it would know this is not possible just bounce straight away marked or it's marked for someone to review you telling me they don't have spectator slots on servers and if they and if they don't they should and they they can and if they don't do that then why like could they not um employ people to do this stuff i hope so yeah the thing is though with 19 kills blatant aimbot like this that's plenty of data that they could just retroactively look at live and go yeah absolutely and they could do that with automatic systems right lift band straight away well that's the bare minimum isn't it if they had a like an active anti-cheat in the game then you know we wouldn't have to deal with this that was one thing that fortnite did really well you could literally you could see people banned in real time if they're in a game they just literally disappear from the game and it pops up at the side saying this person's been banned you think it's just manually like someone goes through reports and sees and then dude all it is shadow i bet you this this engine has an export csv function and it exports all of the suspected accounts and i bet you they have to manually go through and decide whether somebody is is cheating or not i think that's how it was bit like bf5 where it wasn't fit for purpose at all they can't lock onto vehicles can they now you can't you can't lock onto the heli that's why if you're in a truck you can actually kill cheaters i have actually seen um cheats that do i've been locked up to vehicles a jeep before and a truck this i mean look this guy he must just be looking around at walls that's what that's what he's doing he's just looking around oh we literally played those guys last round what daddy ray like it should be easy to just analyze this state of life and go this isn't possible i don't understand it it's why aren't they doing more about it please please jack please do something it's been a great two weeks it really has i've really been enjoying war zone yep me too and today two cheaters within how long we've been playing three hours yeah two years and maybe three because the default skin remember oh yeah yeah we were quite sure we weren't quite sure weren't we no i'm just saying default skin pre-aiming me every angle it was super dodge i'm just saying okay so there were two players on the on the map that were like over to the left hand side he's running away here we go here we go look he's he can't even did he not see him at the loadout let's play right in front there yeah there you go oh so basically he's using the car 98 the bullet velocity is not fast enough to be able to land the shot on the head if he was running hdr these guys would be dead because if you get behind the player it doesn't matter you can land the shot i mean is it is it out of the realms of possibility that they could get their qa team or employ people to literally join servers of reported players and spectate them is that out of the realms possibility or is it just too much work i might be ignorant i don't know if this is like way out of the scope of how many people they'd have to do with yeah but it's activision they're like multi-billion dollar company of course they've got some cash line around to do that of course they have well haven't didn't they come around and say they've now permabanned 300 000 accounts globally is that is that the number isn't that what they said like it's three hundred thousand but there's like a hundred million at their unique players and it's like boy this is it we have do you remember we had the same cheetah twice in one week this year yeah you know and he still hadn't been and he got still into it yep well apparently the meme now is is that spm m is so strict that cheaters are being put into cheetah lobbies together and then but then that doesn't solve the problem because the cheaters continue to play the game and then the system will at some point put them in a lower level lobby against legitimate players and ruin their match for them yeah and if you make a new account that it's going to happen anyway right because they're going to be lower kd to start with yeah look i mean this guy has no fear he's look look he knows one there there's one there no he knows they just threw a stun oh no what a shame you scored knife these guys might be good i think these guys are good players they've got stuns what's he doing he's trying to figure out the guy yeah yeah he's trying to fight him he's gonna die he's gonna die you could ball bang they jumped off i think they jumped off nice nice nice i think they're playing it really well these guys yeah yeah yeah one jumped off one went down and i think i think they know that yeah he's in that building he just beat the window he just cleaned the window ah oh my he's got a gaming chair that's it it's got one of those gaming chairs which one do you think he's got jack is it a nice level yes come on dude he was so close to getting beamed out of the air he's not playing that oh he's playing up read the standing orders and understand them and understand them illegally dude that was so close because he obviously can't shoot whilst he's parachuting no oh man die die die die oh my god he might die you might die to gas yeah he's like oh he's like oh no it's crap enough time someone's coughing behind come on get killed let's get killed can you not pull in full and falling please fall in please fall in oh my god yes yes he actually died you legend i knew they'd messed them up i just came in to tell you that i played this guy last week is he what the two-time franklin i played this guy last week he's squad are gone the squad are gone yeah it's the fbg guys man what if these guys are cheating 20 kills i also have played x impact this week as well wait no no no no no no he's a legitimate this guy's legit he's a good player we believe no he's dead though no nice try very well played well at least the cheater died that's the main thing i'm so happy that it happened so sad for a second no i just i saw the level one and i was like oh no yeah that's a bug that is if you get to level a thousand it resets and just stays one well that tells you the kind of lobby today yeah yeah that was a sweaty day today we didn't get a win though we did an insane win over um before i feel that guy deserves to win there so unlucky he just i wonder if he knows he killed a cheater i wonder if he knows i hope i think they did i think they did that's why they played really smart at the end yeah they just knew they were getting pushed up on by cheater yeah good game boys uh tomorrow more more pain thank you yeah more pain tomorrow hey guys what played you be a cheater i'm proud of you [ __ ] that cheater makes me yeah he's gone he's disconnected more pain tomorrow more pain tomorrow more pain more cheeks it was just funny seeing like five people in the server that i've played this week ah warzone please please please make sure you block him and report him guys as well before i go oh yeah yeah yeah otherwise i did i did report already where was he where is he guess who's on this evening i'm gonna cry you're gonna be playing in the evening lucky i'm playing we're going to cry and kill myself in the game good luck i'm trying to think of uh you know the tune where is it who was the guy what was his name um two-tone he was with frank the tank by the way we were in soltex lobby who's an fbi.gg's lead streamer as well oh yeah frank the tank was one of them i think the tank was one of the guys with the cheater isn't he yeah i'm gonna block him in case they do play together because otherwise i don't think he's at the top i can't find this dude two-toned sub he's demise a device a good player fpg i recognize that name something like that yeah there's sultan
