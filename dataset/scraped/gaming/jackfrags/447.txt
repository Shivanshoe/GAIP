today we pretended to be bots in cod warzone myself study and westley all picked the default skin attempted to mimic certain new player behaviors and decided to play a match to test if two things were true one does picking default skins give you easier lobbies and put you against newer players and two does it change how people play against you and their perception of your skill before a fight takes place what do you think about this let me know down in the comments below does this actually make a difference i've heard that there are lots of conspiracy theories about skin based matchmaking like if you buy a skin and then queue for a game it will put you in an easier lobby to try and incentivize you to buy more skins or that if you pick a starter skin you're more likely to be playing against other people using that skin i'm not sure if either of those are true but this was a really interesting experiment for sure and lots of fun to boot i think you guys will enjoy this if you do hit that like button below thank you and as always cheers to all these fine folks using my cod supporter creator code in the store i appreciate you with that said let's get into the action now can we be believable as new players is there really skin based smashing let's go baby have we found the promised land look at us look like a complete bunch of noobs i like your cut g how do you play this game dude look at this look at us who'd have thought hey look at that it's not me with us who would have thought not me come on come on i feel like train might be the road skins are going for train i'm just going to keep spotting them i died yeah yeah let's go baby but there's also a guy shooting me for something hold on you're good is that roasting seem gonna be like did we just get killed by

won't know that it's a rose kid he's being shot from there all right hey mr uh no you're standing perfectly still with one foot hanging in the air my game is a very different experience than that it's because you're starting you're standing on the box is it like this constantly but really really fast it's like pretty much yeah really really fast what would happen if i stayed here it's like uh you'd probably get killed by a rose skin and i get a kill like this i've got a crack down oh oh player on him no ammo okay we're all just bunny hopping crouch sliding just that's it that's what we have to do constantly just just jump it looks so good dude i love it no no one expects the default skill hey this is a fun free to play game we've just found yeah it wasn't going to blue why do i feel so chubs though i feel like each other as well yeah i do feel pretty chubs the wrath of the defaults oh yeah in the building here back down literally it might well be it might well be skin-based it's an anomaly surely no no no no no no no no no no no guys we're doing really well as default skins get our ghosties yeah it kind of it relaxes me i'm like i've got nothing to lose they're right there on blue that's where they got their lovely oh they're shooting at us this default school seems to know all the tricks let's just get into these buildings here we're getting here we got the height advantage they just steve just swore oh they're brushing me they're rushing me they don't care i'm trying to cover you sud trying to get height one's low guys hang on yeah he's on the road down he's gonna die more yeah there's yeah he literally just ran straight across the hill just like yeah i'm going to push this default skin and then got beam rip we cracked the code haven't you yeah even if there's no skin based matchmaking just being a default skin incentivizes people to rush it yeah and makes them make the mistake and then you just peek and they're dead i mean we figured it out guys the secret warzone algorithms the old tale isn't it never judge a book by its cover yeah sun tzu act weak when you are strong that's the one also i can't run the other one where default skins not rose skins yeah we're default skins and that way the enemy won't push you that's such a thing yeah they used to they use that in like the 200s how did he know yeah that was a long long time ago so he dressed his soldiers up as peasants and then it turns out they were like spartans yeah like he predicted micro transactions the internet call of duty video games why something else used to do he used to um he used to buy skins for his soldiers before a big battle and that way he'd get an easier walk oh yeah that's a big one that's a big no that makes sense and he made sure to fight in cairo as well yeah always in cairo in egypt so what he'd do is he'd be like oh guys i'll come come and fight me in egypt against my peasants and then they go there and they just see a load of peasants on the hill and they'll be like we're pushing these keep bunny hopping crouch bunny hop just accidentally turn the stun because i was doing superman yeah you know just spamming buttons i like crouching it's fun hey guys look there are cars in this game oh it was oh wow that's amazing your car just went red no you need to have the default skin jack they're gonna finish we're about to get triple quieted what we're doing it's not working yeah yeah paul's not working it's just default skinny i don't know how to turn oh it makes a noise when we drive the truck just oh no you've got the weeds drop

defaults he's seen the defaults i made sure uh he knows he knows people he knows we're default is he just in there then yeah he is yeah he's deep he's deep inside okay right they're fully aware they know that we default done hit done here yeah there's two at least two in there okay i'm gonna do the right show yourself in the face yeah show yourself show your skin so they really see it hey look it's me people people i'm gonna stop pretending we're fighting other people just start resting well it's not resin i'll cover that up i need to point out do you know who we killed over here there was

wherever it is oh do a flag cap yes draw them in yeah there we go just go and just go and stand there and you know stand right on the flag together oh on airport roof oh no we can't go and do our flag that is the road getting there okay i'm now being trapped enemy team is tracking your location correct okay one of them's got a riot shield that is my worst enemy as a default oh i broke him he's not here you were competing then they just got their load out they just got their loadout they threw their loadout off the roof yeah he's got a riot shield yeah but i've hit him once he's not going to play oh oh no no what the hell the car is going to run me over hang on it's a rose skin where are you from we're dead i i didn't get sniped anywhere i got shot out of the car he literally thought i was a d4 jack so he just ran around are you saying that did it work he thought he thought he could just run me over because i was a deposit i was a d4 skin and he did run me over i feel bad now back okay thank you dude he was not excited d4 is getting deciphered like that on green or green oh there's so many fire i just got shot in the back that's a good sniping actually why don't i just do this hold on there's people coming over from the tents as well watch out yeah this is not actually an easy ending at all over here down on roof yeah people on green we've got people on green snipers careful everywhere you're left broke he's right here on the edge on orange right there green marker green marker look look oh right there as well oh no it's fine i think we're okay if we just stay on this side i might go down here oh no no okay someone's pushing up behind you jack i need to get to you guys i've got no armor i'm moving hang on you want to arm boxes yeah yeah go go go someone died just here down that guy down that guy there's also a guy above us somewhere she's this is horrible uh we're still we're still deeply so difficult to be default skin nowadays there's people ahead of us

unfortunately corner of the wall nothing there's a guy to all right try and crawl it i don't think i'm gonna yeah he's got me i believe in my default teammates i think they're gonna win on that one more one more [Laughter] it works well return of the defaults it works okay it worked in this game let let's not extend it that far but then again think about it we did face some sweaty teams but because they thought like that literally the guy in the car if he just jumped out and just shot me i'm dead but he literally tried to run me over because he thought i was fresh yeah i saw that yeah that's a good point actually yeah he ran me over because he thought i would have killed me that scene that two-man team would absolutely kill me if they thought if they actually thought i was a threat but they just decided to try and run me over look how good we look [Music]
