glory kills gives your health back I just smashed his head into his neck it's great down here feels just like home this chainsaw so the chainsaw in this game gives you ammunition back so if we change all these foods here and get some ammo glory kills for health chainsaw nice and straightforward look at this oh my god that's horrible give me those shells and yes we can double jump in the armor and this I think is a weapon mod do we want to go with sticky bombs or full-auto on the combat shotgun we're gonna follow us out for now unlock that I think we can get both so should be fine all good weapon mods let me Adam test this out yeah that's a full-auto shotgun that's pretty open fun turns it into like a mini gun barrel almost all right here we go first finger room let that double jump out shrine face get the ammo back up this guy to these desert or lovely I mean they're very we need to keep my amo topped up if I can oh man oh well that guy's arms gone horrible in a good way horrible in a good way alright so I'm actually out of changed oil fuel right now so have to see if we can find some got some shotgun ammo here so satisfying this go I just got hit by his friend our demons friends with each other I don't really know I don't suppose they are yeah goodbye I'll blow your final I've got a little achieving their own progress through an achiever and there we go room number one complete what stop hell barges read that later baby [Music] alright this is go after what oh there's his head are we taking on with us I presume that we're on a hell barge and this is what earth looks like it's in a bad way oh my god so that's the game then take out the helpers I mean look at this guy earth didn't stand a chance these massive that's cool I could do my mech suit got another shot gun mod here sticky bombs I'll take it thank you weapon mod swap press F to swap mods got it bit of armour their objectives alt cool well I need a bit of ammo don't I oh look there's some right there and we did get a bit of change so fuel back at some point I love that one literally smashes his head into his shoulders it's great right let's drop down here alright oh look at this swings that's cool weak point I rockin it on hold on we've got a bit more slang to do here it's ripping TAS tomorrow ding there's these sticky bomb look at all that he's devastating let's get back up do that swing again that was cool double jump into the swing and we're down it's an interesting mechanic disc because you kind of have to write so weak point is the gun on his head I think is it he I don't know a she maybe I miss oh this guy's quick oh here we go big one right in the eye that guy is just full of blue goo I'm not a big fan of that well I want to need a demo thank you I think we've got to kill everything here and then we can progress only weapon I have at the moment is the combat shotgun smash yeah there we go and that I think is the assault rifle so how do we get up there and jump out here this must be the right way no that's where I just was head up round here on the top and we made it Q or five to quickly swap to your previous weapon so we've got mouse five or we can hold Q and we've got the radial wheel and this must be the assault rifle what's that looks like a map also much stations reveal all undiscovered areas on the map cool oh there's me hey here's the map so that's where I've been so there's a couple of secrets that I've missed already obviously secrets are a big part do items found Arsenal codex challenges oh man I just want to shoot things for now let's just shoot things all right through here I mean that is a chunky assault rifle what was that Rich's head open the demons are actually shooting each other so they're not friends after all they don't get on with each other definitely not they definitely don't get always me goodbye chance on my hand okay so if I do that go for that week's loss oh you're dead now I'm nearly dead as well there we go we got it oh it's so satisfying it really is it's just your gun the movement IMing it's very good isn't it nothing too complicated start with come here Oh swept the leg karate kid that was right this way cut a bit I'm over here too I want to use this assault rifle some more Hey oh my god it's a giant mech I assume it was defeated by that massive hell demon my favorite it's the best Oh Oh bang another one it it's just brutal that's one of those mix again you doing up there goodbye wall climb the Slayer can attach the pitted walls by pressing Igor Mouse for yeah there we go nice climb up there yellow keycard pasok leads to the jeweler [Music] from behind that's a new one it's so good I could just do this to hours and hours guys honestly God just broken Hall good job about a bit of shotgun ammo here yeah fireball you again don't like those things stop that I was absolutely mad so Karami thank you I went for the left by that time it's mush yeah I've got to avoid those fireballs a bit about it next time right so first upgrade for the assault rifle this guy here oh it's a heavy canon precision bolt or micro missiles come on you got to get micro missiles test these babies out on something soon frag grenade left controller massery to launch a grenade which explodes after landing on the ground it gradually recharges over time lovely shoulder-mounted frag grenade boys that will come in handy for sure caki diamond I could just use that shotgun but at the same time I want to test these new missiles give me the eye [Music] that's why this grenade up who who was Musti the music is well so good that sticky bomb is actually really good you get some on my back yeah three-for-one too high for that I know you can get upgrades further on in the game where you can like decrease the distance or quarry kills [Music] didn't like that comment find out that's a Malphite another one I hate you [Applause] excuse me boys fast cheese fast I think that one's a she guys I mean at some point in the game I better be able to pilot that thing myself Shirley come on [Music] we're support during this oh thank you your suffering continues to inspire us eight that no I got there I got some armor over here I think I could double back on myself for that one can I climb up there there we go look at that 50 armor I wasn't too much of a distraction mine kind of feel bad for those ones okay what are you excuse me that's a bit of a jump scare there but I watch out for those they just bully the other guys so they are bullies oh that's good [Music] front of this wall Hey what a bit interested to see you or not oh he just rubbed me that that's not cool gotta get some help here the sounded that makes fun it's just like I don't know it's so fun yes that's all I can say I don't know how you guys are finally watching this but for me it's it's just really satisfying to play out good job there's some health there in the head really mr. I wonder how many animations there are for that like how many um Rory kills in the game total they've done goodnight it just goes on and on and on never ends got to get some fuel so I can power up my chainsaw and there we go broke the seal can't get up that nope use this job bud oh hello come on up how do we get in there then above somewhere I mean that one was simple right I couldn't have been easier so I assume that if I died there were no consequences for now just a straight one up yes oh I mean I help pocket the neckbreaker really I love the jumping ones I'm not sure if I could chainsaw that guy like straight away and then you push me off touch the flames yeah they do a lot of damage I missed it the arm against jumped really quickly I know that there is a way to get Armour back a bit further on in the game where you set the demons on fire and then if you kill them when they're on fire they drop a load of armor the demonic Citadel a there's like a giant demon they're carrying something not but that's one of the barges I assume right should we go through the giant hell pause well I think it'd be rude not to maka center of this facility all right here we go I'm gonna use my grenade a bit more because I didn't use it in those last two fights I mean that's a bit ominous his neck hey fast travel teleport to predetermined points on the map cool this looks like a boss arena five ever seen one it's so gothic hex hey give me the thing I must kill her then hey it's me nothing the sacrament of this world to the great is written from the slopes of the non-believers you will not see only needs to say [ __ ] a shotgun it was he's a man of few words kick a little achieve in there as well cheatcode no surely not the fortress of doom I think that's my ship no what am I missing the flame belch is yes and this is how we set people on fire guess I'll just set enemies on fire then we'll drop ARMA shards here we go it's simple so we've got grenades we've got flames we've got guns all the components of a good doom game quick-draw belts so these are crystals hey you can select an upgrade to increase your health our more ammo capacity there are four upgrades available feed category okay I've got it created that bad boy crystals some weird noise all right good to go mate this is so cool exalt eeeh we build the celestial locator locate King Novak's chamber retrieved the celestial casing look at this come on come on right jump onto that good this way why is that so it like a greyhound or a dog with some kind swing Hexen oh it's bright Oh Dex it's a wolf is a wolf for $1 be a little more like a dog to me I think I'll die if I drop down there there's a hand over there some flying demons hey boys right let's not forget these my grenades or my flame belch 50 I think is my max at the moment it's really easy to kill the Cacodemons like that grenade oh that's powerful considering that that recharges over time pretty good luck oh no I remember you look at it go Ron helmets are horrible to fight they just charge you gotta say my fire there's definitely a dog there's that the Infinity Gauntlet blood punch blood punch is a melee attack that deals extra damage glory kills filled the blood punch meter once charged precio massport relation so it's a more powerful melee attack that's how we charge it up it's ready here we go it's just the nine age groups of enemies yep like that simple and you fill up really quick as well okay I've got it already ow I wonder if you can like stack them and get more at once ridiculous ruins ruins enhance your abilities or enable new abilities you have limited rooms so choose the rooms that fit your playstyle right so we've got glory kills faster go Rico from further away speed boosts after a glory kill survive one deathblow and briefly slow down time giving you the chance to recover that's pretty good increases how long enemies remaining stagger greatly increased movement control wall in air so that gives you a bit more air acceleration I guess old mouse to in the air to temporarily slow down time enemies killed by equipment all under the influence of equipment will decrease the recharge time enemies kept a blip on shockwave drop health I've got to go for the slow-motion guys I just have to it's gonna look amazing I mean the game already looks and runs incredible and in slow motion I'm sure that's it's gonna be even better right put that in there so you get three in total I suppose you can swap them out pick your own play stall and everything right okay by the way I came down as a little secret affair looking on these electric things quite annoying are we dropping down I guess we are the same on fire whenever we made him you stay there slow motion mix all's in the heads put that so good why shucks in time forget the footballs on again too far away retrieve the celestial casing a brand new Oh some armor here just gonna collect this trying to avoid the fireballs all right let's go yeah oh that's good wine boys hmm Oh mamma need to get a chainsaw kill there we go eat that I wonder if you can upgrade the ammo capacity on the chainsaw at some point you don't get many but it does recharge slowly over time by itself as you can see in the bottom there I'd like to be able to maximize it though you can give me some armor back but you just disappeared you gotta be dead ow 12 eggs feelin don't do that oh there's some chainsaw Hey stop got quite a short range on it as well a plane door [Music] we're night out mints ISM need to use that more to as like a big melee attack weapon points complete all the encounters in the mission to earn weapon points heats mission is ten weapon pointed toes or spend weapon points in the Arsenal tab of grade your weapon mods right okay so I can actually upgrade these to precision ball quick recharge instant loader primary charger oh man so many I kind of want to get the other or see what the other thing is gonna not back out of this just get that oh it's just I think it's just got it anyway let's go back oh yeah I can't unlock that yet can i let's do that reload time decreased so I need three for that I can't do anything on the shotgun full auto no right cool so you can upgrade the weapon mods to a lot of elements going on here the way you can customize your character and everything what is that oh okay so I guess there's that wolf again I'm going out this way you can set these guys on fire I think maximize my armor how would I get over there then I don't think I can reach that if I jump I don't know but there's something pink up there if I try now there's no way there's nowhere to reach it maybe I can come back to that later kind of zoom on to the wall there hey wolf so what is this big on my hair now I kind of want to get over there but I don't know if I count at the moment go around again I'm hoping there's a duel here we can get to something it's like the Assassin's Creed logo that apex get up top okay I've gotta break the machine there's another one down there I jump on it a one more round here look there we go history of the Sentinels I ain't got time to read oh hey that's me I think - yes we could - look at this oh that's cool that recharges right okay so now I think I could get to that area the double - that's sick hello I was one up there guys right I've gotta go for that it's like a jump jump - grab get the winner I wouldn't have seen that looky that I turned around there oh the environments is so good so well done is that my throne gonna take it anyway you know our loss despite their transgressions against the government they are still of centinall blood what you interfere with now this bigger than you can imagine it is written it is their time to give penance if you continue you will bring down the heavens wrath you are but one man they are no longer your people for save he's chunky lot he doesn't listen to no one no one Wow nothing behind me nope it's electrified guys are they just fine with electric are they okay right and - now it's so good everyone's we have fear that's what it reminds me of I think the slow motion is so well done in this yeah Holly up smush out 30 HP that time choose about Lana absolutely ruins up I'm a - grumbles that healthcare look at the goal line what he's going on the house door effects did so good I've got a weapon point excellent oh here's the thing okay plasma rifle yes are we going up against the revenant right now I believe unlocked a point tonight can I please get this I don't think I can get that yet come I know but we just got this Heatblast microwave beam plasma rifle okay let's do it why is really fast and it sounds amazing there's a little Paul here there's the revenant where is he gone there's no way I killed him then arias it cooks right in the back and a big explosion [Music] stay back come on they just come after you like just olive oil yeah are you as long so there's the one up I'm gonna use one of my lives there as a lot of all before me thank you very much yeah you just - everywhere so so satisfied hey oh oh can I put the battery in there no I think maybe I've already used it yeah that's it's gonna burst through there or something I'm a now I can do it can I just break through this nope I think I have to put the battery in there I don't know where it is thought I already had it Joe that's a nice thought portal there isn't it always a secret there this goes all the way around so I do okay it's down here probably yeah this looks horrible slowing me down as well oh okay I knew something was gonna happen and they sell bubbles ain't really hurt if you're quick enough you can get them before they get you I didn't see you the map the one up there and that's the weapon mod thing isn't it how can we not anyone else no second time I did that you can't jump out of this doesn't that you bounced out of it or anything okay there we go right now I can get this precision bolt so you need those stations to do that Lovelace a power cord nearby you can use it to activate the mech and clear a path forward I'd be much obliged there we go Oh sign man then it's Paul Ironman please give me one of those at some point in the game hmm let's go a bit higher yes I love this like a little CS style jump map but I'm doomed Slayers but it's all good that's cool right so if I put the other mod on this is the one that I just don't watch the railgun isn't it I try to just reload in a doom game what's wrong with me I feel like that uses up a lot of ammo though and I need to like save that what's this I don't know but I'm gonna jump down into the fiery pits of hell because why not there another one hello that doesn't look like there's anything there so what's the point of this then hmm did I miss something then not sure I suppose I could I can swing on this and get over there all completely miss it and fall into the lava there we go so where are we going now just a cross-court I think that's right is that right yeah that's right that's a giant door to hell we're kind of in hell already I suppose now you have to complete the sequence though so cool oh my god what all right hey right can I test this out on that a rack no lad down there or the revenant all right that's just knock that off straight away so you can really use that tactically just pick people off by people I mean demons you know why not all right we're gonna think of it now boys where's that revenant you know what I'm gonna give him a sticky bomb enjoy that [Applause] we nearly had me mate you nearly had me this one from the behind me screen then it's little sniper rifles brilliant Oh [Applause] so with that slow motion you can really line up some precision shots with that thank you not really use this time let's be honest I know you can get an upgrade for it which like oh I need hammer come in come in you can get an upgrade for it which lets you like pop people and that's cool good we're just putting a load of damaged hours and I'll come later I kind of want that grenade to reach I trust there but this there we go my guns gone now what was that one very close no I wanted you spider get in
