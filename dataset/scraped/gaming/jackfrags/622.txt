hi everyone and welcome to some pf3 live gameplay commentary today we are playing a bit of scavenger if you remember this game mode really fun why you that's a fence but today i'm playing in 1440p which i haven't really done that much on bf3 to be honest usually i'll be playing 1080p but using my 1440p monitor today and it still looks good doesn't it it looks really nice what's that guy saying chad a gun give it to me that's a grenade he said what up jack not your biggest fan or anything but yarack i don't know what that means but i'll type hi what is yarack that's an enemy let's see if they respond in kind you can't be waiting there still surely oh they just run away that's an asphalt a pretty good pickup i think did he reply no a slang yeah but a slang for what i mean is it's got to be slang for something else right like you can't just say something is a slang or does it just mean hello or something we have to try and capture this point don't we i'll do my best without dying although i've only got 13 bullets there's ammo everywhere isn't there right now i've got no bullets i need i need to know what what he was saying hold on i slang for what a bit too far away maybe for the glock yeah gun cool nice to meet you legend he's still there i want that gun oh know he's picked up the gun ow i'm trying to back now i'd like to move you too jack thanks i like this guy seems like a nice dude that's going on monkey here monkey monk is dead you can't pick up guns up earthquake oh my god i forgot about that i suppose that was the whole point of the dlc though wasn't it m5k look at this bad boy this thing just tears at close range doesn't it i love this map though that just lies very cool come on yeah there's another guy around here i'll get this instead what's this oh beautiful mp7 beautiful look at it it's gorgeous this rips [Music] more here i just went prone that's me out of ammo again good good oh no i didn't get that kill there's a guy on the steps just hammering me in the back with an mp443 oh what's this scar l beautiful see if i can make it work get some kills with it lovely it's one of my favorite weapons in bf3 this so punchy uh dice no down there excuse me oh we got a tag no kill get a better position there no kill again there we go that's about it just in here is this making you nostalgic yet because it is for me it definitely is for me all right so the gun spawns are always the same excuse me i couldn't get back in destroyed i tried my best to just dip back in there that's a very russian i don't understand what they're saying i wish i could speak russian though oh please let me out i want the p90 oh it's an earthquake that's the distraction that i needed imagine that if the map just like split in two it's already kind of split right like there's a giant split but just imagine like in the single player campaign at the start if the level just split in half ah stuck on a pixel vault he says in chat my favorite happens to the best of us mate don't worry and the p might do it doesn't quite have the range although i'll tell you what that's a good throw right there tag again that's the mod are we gonna get the win on this first map let's see what's next i like this server because it's got loads of uh random maps on it gg i want to type gg good first game that anyway enjoyed that one second i'm just going to check this y-a-r-r-a-k turkish why see what i mean next map on the server was operation riverside conquest come on i haven't played this map in ages it's got bikes on it and tanks and helicopters yes and lavs let me on the tank how am i on 45 hp already on this bike what's that about that doesn't feel oh watch out doesn't feel legit does it but i suppose it is these bikes but oh sorry sorry i didn't mean to oh you want a beep off to you i'll give you a beep off [Music] it's awesome just like riding these bikes around the level but it still looks so good oh that's an lav i barely remember this i just i don't really think i ever played this map that much but it's a cool looking map isn't it it was part of the oh it was part of the endgame dlc right let's do a bit of sniping shall we now there's bound to be a recon somewhere that i can shoot in the head oh there's a glint didn't move usually after the first shot they move oh you had the plane as well that drops in lavs right and you can spawn on it something like that anyways i'm gonna move does it have fish i don't remember if it's got fish one out of ten no fish ai dude pick me again that's what you get there's definitely someone up here though i'm kind of a bit worried about this oh look we got sniper boys up here can i get me a sandwich let me get the sandwich let me get the sandwich sandwich there it is thank you very much for the sandwich oh we got a we've got a c4 biker here going for a tank c4 going for the tank come on you can do it i believe where are they going they must have spotted a tank somewhere oh he's flying come on buddy i'm going to see a tank any second i don't know where this dude is going he's just gone going around the map apparently and now he's gone down the waterfall and he's off the bike i don't know what the plan was but i admire it the team have done a phenomenal job here try getting your gun how about that this will probably help quote it oh i can damage vehicles kill assist yeah i'm gonna get out and help kill this guy here it's gonna have an rpg out looking at the tank it's gonna be a dollar for me honestly that hurts that really hurts [Applause] inside of my soul a piece of me has just been taken away and i'll never get it back oh i see some doritos here have you what kind of a that's on 2 hp i was about to say what kind of a vehicle is that well it's a dead one that's what kind of a vehicle it is missed the easy shot hit the hard one oh chad for that tank that tank knows i'm here i'm moving mate i'm gone sorry can you not do that please something's going on there but it's simply too laggy for me to understand or comprehend with words a human being shouldn't be able to see that it looks like he's moon walking stand still stan whoa he's doing like 360s oh someone is contesting the warehouse simply unacceptable ow at the top can i crawl through no i can't i've grenaded me again this is my warehouse congratulations on the engagement you know what this game just never gets old does it it just never gets old i can come back to it nine years after it was released and still have a couple of rounds on it and have a good time it still looks pretty good it runs
