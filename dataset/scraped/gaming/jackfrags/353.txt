hi guys hope you're all doing well today before we get into some dirty m13 gameplay i just wanted to take a look at the patch that released a couple days ago for warsaw because there was actually a lot of bug fixes in here and some huge balance changes to the game that i think are very good and it seems the game is stepping in the right direction again these changes were all accompanied by a blog where raven software who are now the lead developers on warzone actually went into detail about all the changes what they were and why they're doing them so it does appear that communication from the dev team is getting a lot better now so i've got to give props for that the goal of the majority of these changes was to move to a state where lots of the guns in the game are at the very least viable and they're doing this by addressing the time to kill so if you've played warzone for the last 12 months or so you'll know that when the cold war weapons were introduced the time to kill half it went down from on average about 600 milliseconds to 300 milliseconds with guns like the dmr the far the mach 10 etc and the game just hasn't felt as balanced but what they've been doing slowly over time is addressing some of these concerns but in this latest patch they've tweaked a lot of the guns and the goal is to start raising that time to kill again as part of a larger initiative to raise the skill ceiling in the game i'm all for this i like this a lot and they said that they're not just addressing the cold war guns but they're going to look at some of the modern warfare guns as well and bring up some of the ones that are just never used because they're statistically bad for war zone so the amax has taken enough the pharah 83 the streets we put the bullfrog i've played it a little bit i like where it's at right now they did some changes to the ground loop as well and they slightly buffed the ppsh across the board really happy with this they tweaked and fixed some of the attachments too so they're working as intended and some of the cold war snipers actually got a buff although i've not really done much sniping with the cold war snipers so i need to look into that now this patch has come in test them out and then i can perhaps give some feedback on them but overall it's a great post love the detail and i just wanted to let you guys know about this if your favorite guns been feeling a bit weaker than usual that might be why with that said today i've got an m13 gameplay so with these balance changes guns like the m13 will become more relevant again and the m13 is one of my dark horses i love this gun and if you set it up like this and you focus on controlling that recall and going for headshots you can down people incredibly quick and i was pairing it up today with the spr it's a gameplay here with cameron we're in a squad of two against trios it's a really fun game action-packed and i think you guys will like it as always thank you to everyone using my code in the cod store jack frags in caps i appreciate you guys thanks to all these lovely folk here who've done that if you use my code tweet me a pic and i'll put you in a video like this one if you
