i know that br games are a dime a dozen these days but one of the first that i played regularly was pubg and there are rumors floating around that suggest a new one is on the way but sadly i don't think it's true pubg leaker player ign made a post earlier this month saying that pubg 2.0 is in the works as well as a new mobile game however i think that it's possibly wide of the mark kim chang han who is ceo of pubg corps parent company crafton said that they plan to release a new mobile version of pubg this year as well as a new pubg related game on pc and console by next year i think that's the important part of it though pubg related now you may have heard of a game called the callisto protocol and it was teased at the back end of last year it's a story-driven single-player survival game being made by a new studio called striking distance and that studio is run by none other than glenn scofield the co-founder of previous sledgehammer games why is this important well the game is based in the pub g universe don't ask me how striking distance is also part of crafton and it just reaffirms crafton and pubg's plan on building multiple games around their universe with the callisto project not due until 2022 it's possible that there is another pubg game on the way but i very much doubt that it would be pubg 2.0 as some people have speculated or would maybe expect or want yet not only that but part of me thinks why do they need to make pub g2 pubg on pc right now has 100 000 concurrent players with a 400 024 hour peak i've just checked and i've no doubt that the console version would boost those numbers significantly in terms of pubg mobile well that's been downloaded over 700 million times it's incredibly popular still that should give you a rough idea of just how popular it is not only that but the pc version is based on a live service model they're adding lots of cosmetic items for sale seasonal events and even plenty of new maps in fact when i jumped in having not played for a while i came across a new map called haven that i didn't even realize was in the game and this was a seasonal map i just guess there wasn't that much buzz about it on social media now just because i don't think pubg 2.0 is coming anytime soon that didn't stop me thinking about what that game would actually look like from my perspective what would i want changed and what would i improve on and of course this is entirely subjective it's just based on my experiences with the game with other games and things that i enjoy as a gamer now when pubg originally released it gained popularity way beyond what was expected and the devs at the time were called blue hole and i don't think they expected that either the netcode was pretty bad performance was often worse and server stability wasn't all the best either not exactly a recipe for success except it was over time the game improved no end performance is really good now the netcode is definitely better and the movement mechanics have seen a lot of refinement to name just a few key changes and i don't know if this is the case with pubg but i know that from speaking to developers from other games that sometimes new features and certain game mechanics are not possible without very time consuming code changes sometimes if you want certain game features you'd have to start from the ground up from scratch and of course now the next gen consoles are firmly within our grasp if you can actually buy one you have to say that pudgy isn't the best looking game of all time it's not that it's a bad looking game in fact there were times when i thought it's pretty good but the animations the lighting are especially looking quite dated now some of the textures and models in particular too feel quite old gen and pubg originally released back in 2016 and remember then it was an early access game too and at times i do think that some of the maps lack visual cohesion what i mean is that there are times i'm walking around some of the new maps feeling as though someone has just plucked down a load of unreal engine assets to make it into a playable area with the original map there were a lot of reused assets lots of buildings were the same regardless of where you were on the map towns didn't feel all that different to each other because they had the same empty buildings i have to say that as development has gone along and new maps have been added refinements have been made there is a bit more variation now i have to give credit where it's due and i'd like to see that continue but i do think that the maps could benefit from a bit more theming at times and while we're on the topic of maps what number is too many i can't believe that this is an issue now considering there was a time where i myself and others were hoping of wishing for a second pub g map every day but i think that in pubg now there's way too many this opinion may not be shared by people who play the game every day today so bear with me but right now you can't even choose what map you play because clearly they realized that some of the maps had extremely long matchmaking times because people just weren't playing them as a result they left multiple maps in the pool and now you're given one of them randomly and this means that i could very likely end up on a map that i don't even want to play which isn't ideal the only map that you can choose separately is the seasonal map in the gameplay footage here so what if pubg in the future adopted the same system that other vr games have done have one extensively worked map but change it up during new seasons with different areas different weather whatever it may be if you're building a universe around a game you could use this as a way to integrate different changes into the map if you mix it up regularly you ensure it doesn't get stale for players but you're also simplifying the matchmaking you could still have your seasonal map be separate though perhaps this isn't something that the majority of the players would want i'm just speaking from my own personal perspective but other people may enjoy having a completely different map to play every single time that they queue i have to talk about pacing as well i've of course been playing a lot of warzone recently and while there isn't much time between gunfights i'm well aware that pubg is not warzone they're vastly different games in terms of their mechanics and i respect that and what i love about pubg is the gun play it's slower more challenging and it takes more skill in terms of controlling the recoil burst firing accuracy that being said when i played a few solos the amount of times the player count was down to 20 to 30 by the time i'd finished looting and moving into the zone was just crazy some of these maps are substantial in size and going to play other games just enhances how often the pacing is to me i played the new seasonal map haven which only has 32 players and even that felt empty at times couple this with the fact that you can just loot upon meds and stay in the blue zone for a lot longer than other games and you can make the downtime even worse and i can't be the only one that feels that way though i would have thought how do you fix that issue more players a respawn mechanic the latter probably a more controversial topic for pubg because i wonder how many pubg players would want something like that in their game it would certainly make playing squads more enjoyable for me knowing that i could get my teammates back in but i think a lot of the player base prefer the fact that pubg is more unforgiving and challenging it's probably a big selling point for a lot of people whatever route they went down though i'd like to certainly see some tweaks to the downtime and the pacing and part of that could be simplifying the attachment system right now there are so many attachments and items in fact there are new ones that i've not even encountered before so you could simplify the system so you pick up rarities of weapons instead of separate attachments but despite the fact that this would get you in and out of the action quicker without taking away from the actual gun play i imagine that this wouldn't be popular with some players and i think another big improvement which i would hope would be the least controversial of all would be the movement over the last few years there have been tons of improvement to the movement and animations in the game as well as adding new ones and improving the vaulting despite all of that though the game still feels incredibly sluggish to me and i'm not talking about the movement speed as such we know that this is a more methodical game but the animations for movements don't feel as crisp as they could be almost like there's a bit of input like to your character at times and i'd probably look at the vehicle physics too because they can certainly cause some issues and of course a few funny moments it's also sometimes really easy for me to forget that pubg has two different modes that also separate the matchmaking first person and third person when the game first launched it was third person only in fact i think it was designed that way and then first person mode was added after quite a lot of requests it's the only mode that i'll play now first person if i load up the game that being said i remember seeing an infographic some time ago although i can't seem to find it for the source that would suggest that third person is way more popular across the entire player base while i personally wouldn't like to see first person mode disappear i think it's okay to wonder if the game needs to just choose what it wants to be and just make that the game own the decision whether this is first or third person and that's how the game's meant to be on the flip side i appreciate that the devs have put the option in there but it does separate the player base somewhat so if they ever make pub g2 perhaps they should just pick one or the other and then there are the other things that i would love to see improve too for a hypothetical pub g2 the netcode while better than it was four years ago still isn't where it could be the sound system is incredibly inconsistent especially when it comes to verticality just makes it really difficult to judge players locations and then we have anti-cheat this has been such a big issue with pubg that has plagued the game for months cheetahs on pc we accept that with all the best intentions in the world you can't completely eliminate the issue and i don't expect any game developer to do that even though it would be fantastic that being said more has to be done to ensure that cheating gets dealt with in pubg quickly and harshly this definitely seems to be a big area that needs some attention and work when it comes to pubg wrapping things up i still think pubg is a good game even if it does feel a bit dated these days but the idea of a new pub g built on a newer engine unreal engine 5 from scratch would actually really interest me but sadly i think any pubg game we're going to get in the next few years will simply be within the universe rather than a direct sequel or a spin-off we can hope though right pub g2 i'd be all about it with that said do let me know down in the comments below if you were the game designer in charge of building pub g2 what would be your top three priorities or changes for the game and that's all guys do leave a like if you enjoyed the video thank you that's a great way to help support me dislike it if you didn't like it not a problem at all subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
