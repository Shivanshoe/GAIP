so this building here is the capture point but it appears there's a dragon in it is it safe have you stopped now that'll do i'm not sure i killed the dragon then but we'll go and have a look okay dragon stop that dragon these guys are trying to revive themselves oh teammate thank you very much appreciate that that's a sandbag or a group of sandbags [Music] you miss noodles oh come on i can revive myself though with this medkit i think because i really don't peak me i think they're still up there big res boom feels good man oh oh bro you got some nice shorts there where can i get me some of those bad boys fancy shorts and flamethrowers aside welcome back to enlisted i've already done a couple videos on this game before and a big thanks to them for sponsoring this one they've recently released a new campaign which is the battle of tunisia that's the one that you're seeing here so i thought we'd hop on to that and afterwards we'll play some berlin as well because that's just a really cool map if you're not in the loop with this game obviously it's a world war two multiplayer shooter and it has a strong focus on historical authenticity it is available on pc xbox series xs and ps5 as well as ps4 and xbox one and it does have cross-platform support so you've got loads of infantry fighting different weapons customization vehicles as you can see here i'm in this armored vehicle just going ham on some infantry also airplanes as well but i'm not a great pilot so we'll leave the pros to do the flying for now so the game is free to play it's currently in open beta there's a link down in the description below if you want to check it out for yourself and if you use my link you'll get a free bonus as well so with that said we're going to hop over to berlin now playing as the germans attempting to hold back the russians in the ruined city it's a really cool map there are some great moments here i think you guys will like this if you do leave a like and a comment below thank you for watching let's get into it all right we gotta defend this point lads look at this place can hear the cheers and the screaming this one i like in my war right oh my god that's a lot of soldiers the full auto mp40 it's kind of cool that the weapons are asymmetrical though oh hello they get a thousand tickets as well oh my goodness what are you doing up there oh just clipped his head sick i'm right at the front here reminds me of playing russian i'm just getting up in the uh attacker's grill here is that like an artillery barrage or something so if you hit him with a shot that's a headshot they go down for good you can't be revived or self-revive so i'm trying to always go over the headshot if i can like that got one shot left missed one in the mp4 z missed oh well i'm ruined that was rude yeetman killed me switched to my other squad member there so i'm playing squads here and there are real players but there's also ai because you have your own squad and as you can see there i got killed and i switched to my squad and you can give them orders as well if you want basic orders hold position follow go here go there that kind of thing try this left bank instead [Applause] well that sounds meaty trying to go for the objective there should be a little yeah there's a little gap here look at this that's an enemy tank there's no one behind it one of those headshots i do have a bundle i think like an explosive thing that i can throw at them but i think i already used it on this guy so might need to wait i have not pushed me off yet is that a plane or something bombing what the hell was that i like that you can lean as well let's do a little jiggle piece here cross off the angles ttk is really fast got him sure i saw someone up there and get into all these knocks and crannies as well oh look at that tank commander there oh he's gone down the hatch i've respawned so hopefully i can do a bit of damage i mean that's right on it i think it exploded on top so maybe he didn't do that much damage there you got to get him in the tracks i think or behind show me where the bad guys are up there okay i'm going i want to test out this knife in here nope looking for the stairs where the stairs oh that's a ramp that'll do yes give me your gun thank you oh oh look at this nice sniper overlook here can you hear a plane oh my god turn out it was an enemy plane all right they're gonna get this point but they've only got 90 tickets they did get some more then though i'm defending of course so they're going to have to push a bit further into the level now but i'm going to try and be as annoying as possible here and defend from the front see if i can bleed some of these tickets away chuck this on uh that's right underneath it oh my god that's embarrassing that's got a massive radius on it back to the mp40 hello oh that's the entire russian army there not the best idea jack back in though oh no oh i can rest i got the ppsh though man it's too strong throw oh dog a throat in time last ditch effort come on yes he gotta kill luke i think somebody killed him all dead quiet i'm really being that guy right now i think there's no one ever expects you to be here do they i just think you stay on the point but it's quite a good tactic this what's that take it bang don't even know if that's going to reach it did they've got no tickets left in about 35 seconds to get on the point so i think we've got this he shooting at yes 25 seconds come on clean it up 10 seconds that's a tank i don't want that mad you might want to move over here stay here for a sec [Music] yes successful defense love that those bar action rifles are meaty man but yeah there it is guys thank you for watching once again a big thanks to enlisted for sponsoring this
