hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some more Call of Duty war zone a big thanks to Activision for sponsoring this one and today we are going to be playing some battle royale solos so this will be the first time on my channel that I've had any solo gameplay I guess I just haven't really tried it much this week I played a bit yesterday but one thing I've discovered is that it's quite big it's quite different to the squad's it's quite different now I haven't really changed up my gameplay style that much but what I have been doing is using the vehicles a bit more and there's two vehicles in particular which are really good in solo mode because they're really tanky there's the blue Jeep or the defender and there's the truck now what I was doing yesterday was getting the truck driving up to people and jumping out and destroying them and it was great I actually got like a 17 kill game by doing that unfortunately I came second because I forgot that I had semtex grenades and that would have won we the game but I forgot anyway so I'll show you my loadout for solo mode so I'm actually using an mp7 this bad boy here but the monolithic suppressor on there for a bit of range on the FSS recon TAC laser commander for grip and the 60 round mags no optic because I roll five you don't need an optic and I run that with the Joker because a lot of people also used vehicles in solos but you don't get a warning when someone fires a joker at you so you just get so many kills by doing this but that's what we're gonna be doing I've also got my sniper loadout there as well if I want to switch late-game but with that said we're gonna get into a game and have some fun I hope you're all doing great guys thank you for coming along if you watching this live if you're watching this as a vaadwaur sup how you doing thank you for watching I can't see the chat and I will be responding to some questions but of course I'll have to concentrate on the game at the same time so we'll see how it goes guys should be good fun and we'll be live playing for a couple of hours we've already had a very generous donation here from giorgos been watching for years still very entertained thanks for all your laughs and tips best regards George from Norway George that's very kind of you Thank You Man you see some names in the chat here we got rocky Tran Ben quick Steph's Zachary

guys doing thank you for coming along right so we are deploying shortly I should be warmed up because I played a few hours of war zone earlier on I was playing with the two angry gamers and we we had we had a few games so we should be alright let's get straight into the action those solos they do get a bit sweaty but different place so Jaden Radke thank you for becoming a new member but hopefully I can provide you guys with a couple of hours of entertainment on this Friday evening I know a lot of you are probably cooped up at home right now not being able to go out and yeah should be good it should be really good Samuel Shields I will try I will try my friend all right let's have a look at the flame it's quite central really so what I'd like to do in solos is find a location that's near a blue van or a truck maybe get a few kills to start with to build up some cash get the UAV UAV is really important when you're doing this kind of strategy there's a few trucks around which one should I go for feel like I want to drop central I'm gonna go for that one there maybe there's a couple of missions up here storage towns storage town can get a bit crazy though and we'll do our best all right let's go first game can we get a win I don't know Stevie thank you for the five and hi sedge thank you for the 60 I am doing well yeah I'm really enjoying creating content at the moment thank you good fun okay so got the truck straight away that was nice and easy do here a box appear oh it's right at the top I don't want to go there right so what I try and do is just drive towards dots on the map let's see and before I instantly get killed or something by a proximity mine obviously when you're driving around in these vehicles people can see you on the map you're definitely not inconspicuous let me say almost been here as well there's a guy there it's great as well because you get this massive you get this massive field of view and you can always use the truck like that as well he was shooting us something ah he's wise he's gone in the bus I go knows exactly what he's doing Lieut this building here see if I can get an armor plate maybe you know what I'm gonna take the m13 just armor plates you sir thank you for the two greetings from Austria what's up man there we go bit of money there I'll Drive back in the truck yeah I feel like that guy's got his head screwed on so don't know if I want to go there you can always go for the bounties now that area is really messy those and you know what we're gonna go in or do it I need to work out as well when you actually get out of the truck does it get out on the side that you're facing not sure I think it might hopefully I don't die climbing up this ladder in landcruiser what's up you actually fall off if you look too far right so we've got a bouncy already let's go sneekybeeky in the truck I mean I just in this building here there's another one there he killed my bounty and I killed him all right oh dear it's very good right get a load out I hate this one's just so open where is it oh it's actually indoors I thought this one was outside that load I'd drop some thanked me the two does anyone else think this PR can be too easy at times you solo stony um I don't know I mean I think I've had some I've had some quite challenging games so far definitely I need a bit more cash so I can get an armored plate bundle here would supply drop somewhere a box sorry this building maybe come on cash where's the cash a noob gaming how you doing - there we go house go just floating in there all right mate where they're going anyway I'm a play bundle it's on that armor back I never going back in the truck this is what it's all about guys all about the truck as a health care I mean still got like 95% health on it I'm gonna go around to that recon mission see if we can pay anyone in I didn't work that time cash where we go robust is this the best bi yet it's pretty good it's pretty fun I have to say I'm really enjoying it I think it's the one that I've played the most in a long time I've just got wasted I think you must have seen the truck and just came over but look how Anki is like it just takes so much damage and I even fit it under there it's too much of a big lad right hey glad our perfect just the right size how's anyone camping here I don't know see we can get this are you got it right next to it but not drone there that's cool Wladimir yeah my jewelry's good man it's all recovered now thank you feel like there's someone around Aiden thank you for the 15 hi from Ohio might have national gold come through our man that's crazy dude a bouncier be nice no bounties around really I'll go back over there boneyard gets really messy though I don't know if I want to go in there you know but yeah the truck I'd say maybe is the best weapon in solos it feels like it at times okay right so I'll get up there with the truck but he barely touched me you know I mean like it doesn't take any damage we'll go back here we'll buy you a V no one around it's a free armor plate there that UAV helped revive kit just in case I'll take the I don't that guy's following me nothing sir here's someone

camping that I don't like it you know I'll go get the bouncy and then we'll see if there's someone nearby oh yeah full HP truck though here if your mom into later when I finally go around that corner and point reverse right there may get the truck down these stairs ah the truck just just doesn't care all day baby all day yeah I knew it look look at that this is the one yeah there's someone there

me their cover while I buy this UAB that guy I want that guy it's so dumb I could go for the bouncy he's over here something look he's just buying this and that's really rude okay now I thought that was my truck I mean his tactic was thrown on the ground in hope that no one's around I guess now if I get killed here by some camper I'm gonna go absolutely mad buy another one you see this tactic works they're all camping on roofs this guy maybe that's a good target right there me if I maybe it bingo people are there's a guy in the petrol station and it was someone over here I don't know

getting to the oh look he's having a fight with someone geez isn't he like right there he's right there I missed so I still got UAV I wonder if there's anyone round here I don't think there will be maybe in these buildings I'm not sure that I want to go into one of those buildings though because there's probably like claymores and all sorts of stuff that's a loadout drop there for someone else so there might be someone around here and you parked the truck in the garage get in the garage yeah in guys it's too it's too chunk there we go we found a hole there's a guy here donkasaurus good nothing you could do against Juncker Soros what could you have done did you possibly agree what do you hope to nothing it's the chunk literally just Mary Oh beauty I mean if anyone was a fight here

all your life but the chunk will come for you well I think I'll still got your ID as well adore white thank you for the 10 Oh someone here having a great time in that building I think they're just in that building I mean if any one of these guys had an RPG or a joke I'd be dead like I don't know why this is allowed I just simply don't get it chunk chunk chunk chunk but he's gonna have to come out of that building and when he does the chunk is ready come on I know you're in there no you don't want to succumb to the chunk he would rather die in the gas okay well I'm not being over here yet where is everyone now on shooting or anything I reckon they're all in those buildings baby oh that's an explosion what was that about have a strange my targets remain and they've got all be in the house surely they're all in there chunk is ready unless I mean someone could be behind that wall there come on I think that was a - of been the chunk was - feared guys the chunk was defeated I don't believe this this is this is unbelievable I was defeated by this man Carter zero one it was c4 he got me with the c4 AirPlay turns out that the chunk isn't it's not indestructible after all anyway gg's we're gonna chunk again boys we are gonna chunk again cuz that was quite a successful chunking right there can we all get a rest in peace chunk in chat please because I feel like I feel sad you know poor chunk you get an F in the chat for chunk miles thank you for this money that's impossible oh that was fun that was really fun do I mean though the truck is the best weapon in again the chunk was defeated yeah ah man that's a sad story and we'll go again you know what chunk has an extra life he got a few kills before he bowed out though didn't he chunk definitely did some damage there it's nightmare fuel I think for every one that chunk killed is there gonna go to bed and have nightmares tonight sure grip John miles thank you so much for the 20 that's very kind here rest in peace in

well thanks miles have been a big fan since the f3 and Daisy glad to see you streaming it's so fun to hear your live impressions and everything Starks just donated five pound a chunk thank you so much right where is I mean we could try with the smaller brother jungus you know chunga says he's not as strongest chunk but chunga's can do some damage but you know he's a bit bit faster is a bit a bit more agile you know he's a younger model but as you can see you know he doesn't have the it does have quite the same heft that Chong has but still yeah maybe we go with younger brother Tongass Tonkin chunga's living together best friends forever I found another grenade launcher earlier guys did you watch my video yesterday where I found the first grenade launcher Oh someone's been here and they ran out of that building and into that one okay so we know where they are in their little Gilly boy what's the window don't just stay in that place stop looking at jungus okay he's not for sale cash that's cash that is look at that what did this guy do buy you a be straight away someone's capping that point down there chick fight going on up there in there are they just in houses at both looking away from each other as well right there's one on the right and one on the left is chunga's seize me what are you doing that's mine I hope he doesn't have an aide I need a big run up there guys chunga's is among us I don't where he went [Music] there is this sounds very sad state of affairs right there real sad thanks for the money I guess I'll Drive [Music] the chunga's is the free lad he cares not for money nor society all he wants to do is turn around on the ice all day like this their skilled driver let's chunk top mark to call him I was gonna be someone up there in that I could get the choppy kind of feel like I should go do some missions though once innately so about there is a bounty nearby go for that [Music] [Music] I like here's the Jeep again up there [Music] that's a pro-gamer move there guys see that a pro-gamer move hold on I'm just gonna check if there's any any loot in here I'd like to buy a UAV right so I think in a building I don't know it looks like they're moving no they're open these buildings here I [Applause] think he's in that window there [Music] in the yellow building come on fight me Yeah right how can I climb all the way of this and jump behind him I don't know if he can get back to this point from the roof probably can he's in there no one is there we go game of cat and mouse there wasn't it all right we'll go buy a UAV tonk will protect me thank someone of that oils do we need Roxy okay for now living yeah I'll just sum over here again Arius see that guy there are they've gone on the roof a cha I can't yell I can't get on the roof with chunk ain't gonna work [Music] well that was close Oh something else firing out mouthing see that's another great way that you can use those if you jump out hey someone just grenaded they maintain their momentum so what happens is people tend to keep shooting the truck you've jumped out of your shoe in them but it's a good distraction tactic a corrupted design thank you for the ten best stream I've seen in a while oh hey would you like me to introduce you to my friend trunk no okay he didn't didn't want to meet chunk Rob did thank you so much for the ten I really appreciate that bro I'm trying to manage things there yeah yeah he's barely been scratched early been scratched oh there's a new one there is a primary trunk here we can switch yeah Matty the best weapon is this this is the best weapon I should go for that loadout really shouldn't I I'm gonna go for the loadout get my carrot with the Joker and over then our moms I don't like this I feel like this is death like it's such a built-up area isn't it yeah big nutty the mp7 is brutal man it's really good is it on camping up there maybe not that I can tell it's not one go back in the safety of the chunk by stationed down there Oh what is chunking what is this chunk come please no is he stuck no no no well let me get back in tonch this is the only thing that could defeat him rocks thunk I'm so sorry bud what if I could nudge him can I touch him with his younger brother chunga's maybe Toby oh wow yeah my same on him right pressures on boys pressures on we got it right we were like we were here were me I think that's where we were I don't know if I should go back there though because our guys there and he's got pretty sick gun grip Chong grip jungus don't really know if I want to go for that bouncy that one's probably easier like what God it's an enemy chunga's see down there enemy jungler spotted I need I need a gun ASAP there's one I think that's a death there you know actually got a deagle someone's bald eagle in I just want to check this building because I feel like it might some might still be someone here superstore ow it hurts really really bad I'm getting closer to the bounty as well no armor plates cause I think I'm ruined the bounty is gonna know that I'm coming don't know where this other guy went let's see if he follows me it's that Jeep here I'll find some armor plays RPG with one shot we're gonna die so fast if I don't get armor like any engagement that I get it unless that bounty comes over here maybe maybe they will the guy that absolutely chunked me then was over there first thank you for the two but get 4200 though might be a spare on my plate in here somewhere in that building there or on the roof okay that wasn't my bouncy though you might have some armored plate so I'm gonna go up there one got this though now what that guy was doing now that was again we lost it as it could be up here good now don't see anyone directly below me come on I'm exposed to all these roofs we get sniped on Oh Cassie's Mohini news sites are located well I've got him eventually that was the bounty but of course I didn't get the reward for that grab the pp okay I can go buy some stuff now look how expose this by station is hate this please it'll be someone camping there in there oh joy I can't go back there oh hello see that behind you guys did you see that quad bike somewhere [Music] [Music] know where they've gone bio insomniac thank visit n and you don't do that please [Applause] I've got bounties I'll come back for you I'll come back promise that's not don't look behind you and drive at the same time it's not conducive to a good driving experience you know this guy is just camping in the store isn't it actually no he's out there hey it's me I'm the threat pick on an RPG ah who carries an RPG that late into the game who does that who would do that it's unbelievable he was looking he was looking at the Jeep and everything I'd done him but he just fired at the ground that guy that guy simply does not care it's at last grill oh yeah shoot the RPG in the ground why not yeah go on yeah yeah why not oh hey Oh Deary me Jerry Jerry Jerry may well rest in peace chunga's you know that was ours the story of chunk and chunga's I feel like chunks chunk is a more acceptable candidate for best weapon in the game god damn it guys bio insomniac mission failed we'll get next time thank you for any buyer one man's way thank you for the five you really dig in the game Jack said Nikki tax 101 yes Nikki I really am it's a lot of fun it's a lot of fun yeah I think my last words were he's got an RPG I wonder if he has that microphone being gone you know there's a thing in this game where if if you kill someone you can hear their microphone for like two seconds I think I've got it turned off though but I wonder if he heard me maybe I don't know King David I can't believe you've done this thank you for the 25 simon Dalzell the best weapon for solo is the truck it's the truck hold on for where we go we're going south to north I could get an early chunk could do it could get the chunk on lock but we could go all the way out here get the chunga there's a chunk up here so I'll loot here though honk up there's chunks everywhere guys I reckon that one that's the chunk that we're looking for that's the one right there boys that's it time for the real thing all right let's do this am I still using the owl Condrey if I'm in try hard mode yes I think the alga is still the best weapon in the game Christopher thank you for the 5 then better luck next time Jack thanks for making my quarantine in the u.s. bearable yeah I know a lot of people are self isolating at the moment or it's a difficult time for them because you can't go to work or maybe you've been laid off or you know you can look after your kids when you didn't expect to so you know if um if you're one of those people just hang in there man I think it's definitely gonna be difficult it's gonna be a difficult time like the next 12 months or so but yeah we can do it can't we we can do it got this I almost forgot to pull the shooter I need a gun oh my god where dude if I was him uh-huh I'd want to come back and kill me wouldn't you let's see if they do where was that scavenge mission us above and that was a hell of a beatdown cured a package no just all the time I wanted that guy you're gonna come back here man did you win the gunfight I don't see anyone all right well I'll go do that mission I'll Drive Simon Dalzell we did you say Solo is a lot more competitively viable than squads um Oh can't can just do that no problem yeah I didn't know that is it more competitively viable till notes about it so I think the nature of our real games make like they're not competitive in their face design you know cuz it's random I think the squads would be more fun to watch them solos because enemy chunga's yeah I think squad would be more fun because um it's really rude team playing everything and tactics would would start to get involved with it you know it's climbing outside there's another guy in a jeep I know there's a dude on the roof up there I wish I had a grenade he's one head dad is on the roof that I can't get it I don't think I could get him either you know it's funny if he devar pgb then either one you still up there have a look if that guy's still up there if he is I'm gonna put this artist off Eugene his face oh my god you know what I'm going that guy's the sweatiest of them all this where did that go I got another one Hey suck on that can't believe that missed this is crazy how did the RPG miss it was right inside him he's literally right on him is that gonna finally come down oh my god I can't believe he's killed me where was I then I was around here somewhere wasn't lying I think hopefully I can win this and get revenge how did I miss him then with the chunk if it is dude look at this dude [Applause] oh gee slay thank you for the 5 check out oh gee Franklin or THAAD [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] that's all you need that's all you need it was around there wasn't it this guy kills me again I'm gonna go crazy I didn't even say the truck as my body is I'm again maybe that isn't yeah throwing knife no armor go outside knows where I am it's all die anyway I'm gonna jump off we're okay Chilean for a second um would you recommend Oden over a sniper rifle definitely not Hong be honest with you I've not really tried the olden in war zone I've used it a bit in multiplayer but I don't like I find the slow firing weapon that's just on not that good in this game because the time to kill so fast I'll Drive anyway but we'll just pretend that that last bit didn't happen someone just called the load-out in over there Shawn needs to get back on the Chum needs to get back on track Punk oh yeah and the roof that guy look at that guy like get hello how do I get on top of this building oh I hate guys I nearly ran into that I nearly ran into that so we just run into that tent where all the chunkies is thirsty though the chunk has thirst do you not real mrs. solos this is what happens in solos if you don't miss around I think he's right above me oh man how did he not die yet for long writing anyways as I was saying typically that's what solo plays like if you play in avoid comments normally I mean I'm sure you can have fun that way but I prefer just tuning around in trucks way better we have a new member as well Alexander thank you for becoming a new member Superfly thank you for the five I Jack and someone who doesn't play main game cards still have a good time in warzone I think so Superfly yeah I mean it is free to play in standalone so anyone can download it and play it there are some custom load outs that you get straight away so I don't think you'll be at that much of a disadvantage to be honest I'm sure that a lot of people who didn't have modern warfare and bought this just as good as someone who already had the main game so yeah it's just about practice really isn't it it is a really big download though it's a big download I think it's if you don't have modern warfare installed it's 80 gig if you already had it installed and you need the patch the patch is around 22 gig Oh Jamie green thank you for the 15 rekt why is that sticker that's like a hippopotamus or something or a dog falling apart on a on a gaming chair is that a picture of me say hello to your fans in Brazil I've been watching you for a long time and I'm a fan of your work thank you so much but or boppy that was close yeah Saphir yeah it's you talking about this game easy and relaxing I think squabs is definitely more relaxing than solos solos can be a bit uh sweaty but you've only got yourself to blame right like if I if I die in solos it's my fault isn't it so he does it does kind of put a bit more pressure on yourself I suppose in that respect [Applause] daveed do you ever have problems with the map bot loading in not really a plan PC though so I don't know maybe that's a problem on console Bobby Hodges thank you for this and appreciate that hey James Cameron great job with the avatar films buddy what so precise hey Gilbert what's up hilarious Yuen Albers Sam Gonzalez darling Hanson enjoying watching you play during quarantine thanks so much fun at bond $5 Jack frags the cure keep it up bro I don't know about that but I'll do my best to keep you guys entertained if you get bored alright we're going now a white haze how you doing it was anywhere around me then kill them all I can do that well actually I don't know if I come that's someone right next to me I get thrown knife kill as well I get another one yeah there's another one that was easy Green shotgun I mean I'll end up changing that soon anyway I just hear a footstep maybe no come up there get some armor plates why would anyone ever by a shield turret from that like why would you do it you just wouldn't do it would you something about that car looks strange oh joy [Music] [Laughter] going around yep but I'd like to use the shotguns a bit more you know still devastating in close combat it's just I think shotguns like you only really use them when you're in buildings don't you because the map is so big they're off more often than not you're fighting at these kind of ranges and a shotguns just terrible there it's so situational I think you just got a camp if you want to play effectively with a shotgun you just have to count how do I get up there as I promise I'm an experienced gamer a fierce Betty thank you for the ten new meme challenge get a kill with the shield turret oh man I don't think I've ever had a kill with the shield sorry I mean there's one there I dare I attempt it takes ages to set up and it's not very good I think it needs looking at maybe buff it or something oh it's so dark in here someone's been in here already someone here no no I don't have the chance Oh mangas James yeah the the truck is pretty LP how quick that reverses run this is saying stopping power mp7 ice dirty what to draw well I need a bit more cash really [Music] something going down a pair [Music] I thought I was a goner then well I was going to blow up [Music] you're not building that [Music] dude that's what you get like a poor chunga's he's unlike 50% health Oh Lu I know I get the entire mag back that can't be right is it just 15 bullets now I need a bit more cash and then I can get my load up and here a meme down here cash oh come on e $100 Whittlesey for knocking at your door

right ya animal Crossing's out isn't it I'm not a big fan of animal crossing myself but I know a lot of people who got it today I think it's it's mainly aimed at kids isn't it like it's for kids I think although a lot of adults play it too so I've just never tried it some people have said it's kind of like imagine if a game was a Tamagotchi but also like it's like kids stardew valley or something like that as well like I'm probably not giving it anywhere near as much respect as it deserves but I've not played it myself but I know a lot of people like it you won't see the mp7 attachments ego screenshot that quickly you got three seconds go I need to actually get my loadout this game because I'm done that last couple matches yeah Empire this is live yeah is 100% alive no

to the year 2020 where call of duty Believe It or Not has a free-to-play stand-alone battle royale experience but most of the players see if I'm breached the whole game and have a great time like this guy here he loves his life I wish that would have killed him I wanted that so bad what's up demo Alexander thank you for the - yeah you can order the index but it doesn't let you buy it like if that makes sense anyway I'm gonna go get my loadout you could buy it when it becomes available and it hasn't been available for ages for me anyway like hasn't let me buy it [Music] my god there's no one on that roof are you kidding Courtney there's someone on the roof there's always someone on the roof I was a choppy there yes what are you doing no that's the wrong one I didn't want that load up eyes up hang on I can just buy another one I'll get the right one this time I promise I should have bought you a V as long he was going in for the swoop I learn what that guy was doing - whoop - whoop - re-roof I can't bring myself to camp on a roof guys do you want me to combine root for this sniper rifle the whole game is that what you want is that what you want gasps opposing him relocating the safe zone where was that guy from before wasn't you was it kept good this mp7 is guys ridiculous hey you do you want me to count the entire round hold on you know what I can't believe I missed that shot I'm really upset with myself but if I camp on the roof the whole game guys I've become everything that I hate you know yeah me right here what as I'm so confused what are you what are you that that can't be real I'm so lucky that I popped that UAV I just wanna run out there and died honestly as mad isn't it why would you guys the sweatiest position I think I've ever seen ever in the history of ever like you know games till I don't see any enemies uh also this isn't completing the prophecy of the chunga's you know like this was about the chunga's I'm gonna sweep down there I'm gonna get me that bounty and I'm gonna go spend some cash hot cash all they just thought they're in a building guys [Music] I'm not entirely sure if that's the bounty it was the guy on the roof the bounty the guy on the rooster bounty von chef thank you for the donation the six six six six I've never been in here before that's very kind of you boy Jack I've been following you since the beer three times she's still my number one I was very kind to you I'm grateful for all the content you made in your wonderful personality stay safe von shush thank you so much man really kinda need to say okay so a man on that roof really should spend some of this cattle they've moved really should spend some of this cash I don't like that area to be honest it's some bit crazy in there look at the headshot oh man I don't wanna mess this up one-hit-kill if I am in the head I think this dude's just running for the zone he's gone over here and they're just waiting here somewhere oh man he's like really cheeky I want to kill him so I can't give the shot on him I just want him to stand still for a split second now I'll pull the trigger only got eight seconds one second late one second unbelievable anyway I'm gonna go here I'm gonna go buy some stuff because I'm absolutely loaded right now good requesting recon which one which one is it I think it's this guy be advised UAV is being off you are TV for resupply race I mean that building that you like I thought I could just our aim in there with the hipfire but mister no way you actually cut that unbelievable I was about to rush it but I think I just left that a bit too late that's a shame I thought I had that one who nine kills up there but maybe I shouldn't have gone for that that guy that was over there in the building right we will do one more match and then that'll be it for today it's going to be true Tungus though we're going to go for the true chunk yeah PA I've got the I've got the laser on it so that's why I thought I could win that duel but I think maybe at that distance I should have continued to aim see I've got the TAC laser on it Andre Jack can you recommend me a good game we're in quarantine in Brazil Andre I mean what what kind of games are you into bro like this is pretty fun right now I would say especially if you've got a squad to play with doom Eternals just come out doom eternals really good fun Animal Crossing if you like you Nintendo games oh the resident evil 3 demo the remaster that's just been released I've not played that myself but that's supposed to be really good counter-strike csgo is always good fun that's free to play as well isn't it Valon I mean there's rumors that that might be out soon right games competitive game that's the first person shooter kind of like counter-strike there's a few decent games at the moment a ribbon why don't you play on console um I I don't know I just prefer mouse and keyboard I prefer use a mouse and keyboard and I prefer having you know 240 FPS and high frequency monitors just more comfortable for me I do play some games on consoles if it's a multiplayer game especially if it's a shooter I always play on PC is available but this has cross place so it doesn't doesn't really matter anywhere to be honest yeah Rainbow six siege is still quite popular it's good fun I like siege but you have to play all the time otherwise you just fall behind the curve too much like you need to know math knowledge is like everything in that game shakka sing thank you for the - you're also a war zone streamer cool man good luck without good luck with everything Emil is it always cross play it's cross play unless you opt out you can opt out in the account settings but I think if you play war zone and if you play ground war it's always on like you can't you have to have it turned on for those game modes I know I hate this gun check-in if there was someone around there all that crosshair is horrible give me a gun SMG okay it's a lot better than this thing think
