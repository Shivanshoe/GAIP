so today i woke up and chose violence it's been a difficult week for me so far just some personal things going on a bit stressed out and i decided to take that energy into war zone with me and just play like an absolute scumbag this morning and you do that with the panzerfaust whatever reason the vanguard panzerfaust it's in the meta and it just destroys people like that you can hit fire it you can fire it when you're sprinting it's pretty accurate look at this i'm about to lose this fight get ruined cheeky little pop-up locate the enemy bang forget that that's as simple as that so i've got two games that i'm going to show you here with a commentary on rebirth but before we get started i've become quite obsessed with this donnie darko takedown that you can do and it's a bit scuffed like if you are in a tight corridor like that it doesn't quite work and the head just explodes but you'll see it here so i get the down and then you know again just feeling a bit just feeling a bit of that scumbaggery coming in it gives them a gun that blows them back and then a jet engine falls on their head so here's an example outside this one kind of gets scuffed up as well because the camera goes into the bunny suit but there you go jet engine falls out the sky head explodes and there's a plot point in the movie involving the jet engine falling out the sky no spoilers go watch dolly darker if you haven't seen it but could there be anything worse than being killed by a giant bunny and then having to watch them drop a jet engine on your head it's that must be one of the worst ways to go in warsaw and surely but i was laughing maniacally whilst doing it so made me feel better now i've not really been enjoying caldera that much recently to be honest with you resurgence on rebirth though i think that's quite fun and they've got this horn here on the boat and sometimes if you press it they send in a care package a massive plane comes along and then drops a care package and it takes bloody ages to land on the ground and it does attract a bit of attention like this but eventually it will land and then inside it i think is like a load of money i can't remember what i got here was it like a couple of airstrikes or something like that armor box uav all the good stuff you know there's also this little easter egg in bio weapons at the basement if you come to the shower and interact with it it literally rains cash on you it's just a nice easy way to get some cash early game i don't think many people know about this you also get that key card which you can use in the tower so just a heads up about that one i think it was westy or lackey that told me about that one more clip before we get into the matches do you think i was too harsh on this guy just wanted to give him a chance see what they did scurry away i thought they're gonna sell for us there no actually drop down the ladder i'm impressed and then they had a quick look up at me like okay this guy knows exactly where i am i decided to give him the slow clap and then they just sped up yeah i was in a really really bad mood when i was playing these games but anyways let's get into the action what's that symbol mean [Applause] i don't know what that man's doing up there can i even shoot them through that what if i climb up nope are you coming down you're jumping don't worry i've got this uh semi-auto grand or svt or whatever the hell is there's someone hunting me i'll go and find him closing in relocating the safe zone that was close ow okay we got we got the car dude stop firing at me there's the loadout [Applause] okay this mp4 is nuts by the way oh my really enemy dropping i'm gonna get revenge on anybody go get your revenge yeah i will let's get my gear back that's not like you stop creeping up on me [Music] people just keep shooting me in the back there's a guy there enemy oh it's so stupid come on selfres sorry comrade cat ow [Applause] you can't hit me through that mate maybe i waited a bit too long in the gas there with no mask hello [Applause] die i didn't expect you in there there is another one on the outside here gas is inbound i think that blue mark was like uh an aps thing the gas thing me see i'm trying to get as many rocket kills as i can oh that was close the only problem with the panzerfaust is that it does it travels quite keep your head on slowly swivel so you've almost got to lead it a little bit [Applause] yeah i'm just trying to buy a sulfurous here i'm just dropped in there i think i'm good here for now top 10. nice job you even got enough damage with this yep uav is out of fuel returning for resupply i did consider shooting him down there with the panzerfaust [Applause] rocket time [Applause] what can you do like you could just can't there's just no possible way of getting away from that i heard someone then chasing that oh that's great timing [Applause] the rocket went behind i think they just slid forward all right we'll try again i'm gonna land here this time just a spit like further away nearby [Music] what is that looks like a luger or something it's got a lot of recall on it i don't really know this area yet it's time for the jet engine it's so good that's so good someone else here apparently [Applause] oh my god why did it jump it it jumped onto the balcony [Applause] i've got to get the finish here okay don't care all right there's one down the roof there but he's going to come out now that i've killed him [Applause] and here's someone i think this is the guy on the roof [Applause] okay easiest kill in my life close the gap a bit [Applause] right next to me in the building some armor for my launcher [Music] up here somewhere i don't hear any footsteps there we go enemy soldier nearby that wasn't even near it broke his armor i think you can get up on the roof from that side enemy cluster strike what's your friend [Applause] it's so scummy oh man look at this thing as well little button you press it spend 1500 and it makes a uav there i know there's a gun underneath me there's a guy zooming in he just got absolutely wrecked someone will shoot me on the left there three left i know there's one behind me there's another one coughing in the gas [Applause] i out the kill minus 10. [Applause] god as if that worked okay there's one left gas is closing in relocating the safe zone try and get it with the launcher in there maybe no they're not on the high ground we've got to see them on this right side in here no on the left there it nice is oh my god wow gg that's the panzerfaust that's what it could do for you that truly is the scumbag scumbag of the day right i'm done if you enjoyed the video leave a like subscribe if you're new catch you later bye
