[Music] why does that work why are you allowed to do that doesn't make any sense why is this game you know what screw the meta screw the ffar i'm sick of it today we're running with the pkm and the bullfrog i don't think i'd ever had a pkm in a loadout before these two games but thomas suggested this build here it is apparently that snatch grip is a unique attachment to the gun as well but as it turns out this is an absolute beamer really good and it invites a different play style that i don't usually play but it's good fun nonetheless and the bullfrog well that's a good secondary smg lots of fun to use i haven't leveled it up though so you wouldn't want to copy the build i was using because it was a bit of a hodgepodge but still nice to use so i've got two games here to show you guys playing with study and tomographic first game was intense it was really good fun insane end game but we were having a laugh at the same time similar story with the second game too but hopefully this demonstrates just how good the pkm can be i think it just puts people off because you can put so many bullets in their direction without having to reload for a while it's good stuff as always thank you to everyone using my supported creator code in the cod store i appreciate your lots if you use it tweet me a pic and i'll highlight your message in a video the growth of the channel has been really good recently tons of new subscribers and views pouring in and i'm really enjoying making content so hopefully more to come let's get into the game now for the damage for you maybe soon may the cheaters come yeah come on come on there we go he just stood there and took it he did he just okay not simon well his name's just simon yeah do you think they're testing bots in this game um no no no

this [Music] i'm sorry yeah i know jack i wasn't lying mate i don't lie to you how is this not meta what is this i've always said it could be mata but it's just the reload people and the weight of it people just don't take it well i think it's just that there's other options that do it as well yeah is the brewing better or worse though right but it's not as much of a it's not as much of a beamer as the pkm anymore i know that um what's called nick marks he's just the he's right again i don't know anyone that used to speak him get uh cell phones cash though is he street level tom or or what right in front of me here probably inside the bill gonna be my guess oh he's kept running he's kept running on the right stub reconstruction this bullfrog's not off bad either oh yeah it's close range
