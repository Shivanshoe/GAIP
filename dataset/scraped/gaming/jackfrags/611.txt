ah i want to jump on him so bad i think you should do it i'm doing it i just focus him oh did you get oh my god here here find the heli behind nearly oh god get down watch that no hog what suppose what dude you're not gonna assassinate him are you gonna try you're too slow she runs so slow jack how dare you have you been working out don't bring it into yeah i can this jump that's all that matters just hit the quad i just stand by him see if he can make friends where's he going he's got an rpg careful he's shooting them make friends make friends he's making friends he's just gonna make friends dude juggernaut have no friend jug frags hi guys hope you're doing well today i've got a bit of a chatty video for you with some juggernaut royale in the background they bought it back but this time it's quads before trios but now it is quads so it can get a bit hectic let's say there's still only three juggernauts at any one time though i'd kind of liked it if they had introduced another juggernaut so maybe all four of you in the squad had the potential to become the juggernaut you could just roam around the level destroying everyone but it's so much fun honestly i'm really glad that they bought this game mode back i know next week it's probably gone because startup season five and everything i'm guessing there's gonna be some big map changes we know there's a couple new guns coming as well but for the meanwhile this is what we were doing for three hours last night it was myself acolyte study and westie it's a blast if you haven't tried juggernaut royale just check it out honestly get a couple of your friends together and play it even on your own i mean i've played a few rounds on my own so far and it's it's really good but that's in the background for now a couple things that i wanted to talk about today the first one is an announcement i guess of sorts i i've had this goal or this challenge this dream in my head that for august this year i wanted to do lots and lots of live streams on youtube obviously it's the first of august today so it's time to talk to you guys about it i know i've been doing live streams every now and again usually on warzone we've done other stuff too like we did the halo 3 campaign on pc recently we also did modern warfare 2 remastered i did a bf1 stream as well about a month and a half ago i don't know if you guys remember that but i've been really enjoying it also from the chat and from the comments afterwards it seems like you guys enjoy watching it too i feel like august will be a good month to test this out and see how it goes because there's not really that much new stuff for gaming this month yeah season five warzone like i mentioned we'll be doing a lot of that marvel avengers i think that's out as well so we might try that too but there aren't really any major releases that would be relevant to me this month so i wanted to take this as an opportunity and just see how this goes so apart from lots of warzone what else will i be streaming well battlefield of course that's an obvious one going back through some of the older games bf3 bf4 maybe some bf1 hell let loose great game love playing that with friends maybe a bit of valorent i do play that every now and again with friends warzone will definitely be the game that i'm live streaming the most i looked at the data recently since warzone was released i've done 22 individual live streams on youtube and my average concurrent viewers is around 15 000 and that tells me that there is a demand for that kind of content on my channel apart from that the other aspect of this that i'm really looking forward to is streaming games that i haven't had time to play through or complete because i've just been too busy over the past few years and i'm mainly talking about single-player games like uncharted 4 god of war spider-man maybe something like horizon zero dawn control do maternal those single-player games that i don't usually cover for more than one video on youtube i want to go back and stream those playing through the campaigns for myself but also for you guys because i know it's annoying when i only do an hour of a game when it comes out like 60 minutes with that series that i do but the intent of that and the purpose of that is so you can watch that video the first hour of the game the last one i did was ghost of tashima the point is so you can watch that and make an informed decision for yourself is this a game that i want to buy and play for myself so i see that as a separate thing but streaming is a bit different for me and i'm really looking forward to going back and playing those games and really digging into what makes them good because there's some critically acclaimed stuff that i just haven't had time to play because i've been so focused on fps games and shooters and trying to build my youtube channel but i'm really comfortable with where everything is now i'm happy i feel like i've built a great audience here everyone's quite respectful in the comments to each other we don't do any drama or anything like that it's always just been focused on the games and impressions constructive criticism feedbacks just the joy of games playing with friends the social side of it and that's always been the driving force for me in building this channel so i feel comfortable with where everything is right now and i'm happy to try experimenting a bit maybe a couple years ago youtube live streaming i think a lot of people would have been like oh why aren't you streaming on twitch but in the last two years youtube live especially for gaming has exploded so much there's loads of people watching it now and ultimately it's where my audience is it's where you guys are so it is starting to make good sense for me in terms of it being a regular thing and i'm not afraid to do it anymore i have to admit that in the past i've been reluctant to do it more often there's all these conspiracy theories about oh live streaming on youtube will destroy your channel the algorithm doesn't like it when you live stream and publish the video afterwards because the average watch time on that video is low therefore it doesn't push it to as many subscribers and it won't put it in recommended or trending and it will make a nasty mark on your channel or something i don't believe that anymore and from my experimentation and testing and also from what youtube have said i know this is getting a bit behind the scenes the most important factors are are you making good content are you making a good live stream or a good video that people stick around and watch so i'm just going to do it and in august there will be lots of it when am i going to be streaming on youtube hopefully most days i'm thinking twice a day once earlier in the day probably around 12 or 1 p.m uk time and that's typically when i'll do the single player games and then in the evenings around 8 p.m 9 p.m uk time that's when i'll be playing warzone and the first person shooters and i'm going to try that in august and see how it goes there's still going to be videos of course whether it's a video on a new game that's coming out some first impressions a new gun in warzone an easter egg whatever it might be of course i'm still going to do videos as well as these live streams and i do have to say it as well but the live streams will be on youtube it sounds silly but i've had people come to the live video afterwards and they've gone jack i miss this stream where do you stream the stream is on youtube that's where i stream so what happens is i go live if you are subscribed and you hit the bell to get all notifications that's the best way to know when that's going to happen i'll stream and then i will publish that stream as a video so anyone that missed the live stream can watch it afterwards and yes it is cliche but the best way to be notified is to subscribe and make sure that you press the bell and got all notifications turned on usually what happens with the live stream is if i create a live stream you'll get sent a notification and typically that will have a time when i'm going to go live on it and then when i go live you should get another notification then so that's the best way to know and just go off the times that i just said because that's when i'll be aiming to be live i'm going to try and stick to a consistent schedule as well as i can but it would be absolutely fantastic to get you guys support on this i'm really looking forward to giving it a shot and it should be a good month and i'm going to emphasize on video quality i'll be streaming in 1440p at a high bit rate audio quality will be good and it's all about having a good time and providing you with some entertainment there will be days that i missed because i'm probably working on a bigger video although you guys might see a 12 minute video on youtube that could take me maybe one or two days to make so i can't guarantee that i'll be live every single day i might have irl stuff to do i'm going to play it by ear but the goal for august is stream as much as i can on youtube look at the results after did it work did it not work did i grow did i lose subs did i gain subs did my viewers enjoy it or not so much i promise it will be fun and also if you can't make it to a live stream i will be publishing every single stream as a video afterwards so if you weren't there when it was live you can watch as much of it as you want afterwards and that's the top and bottom of it really i did want to get a couple of suggestions from you guys too when you become a member on someone's channel you get access to emotes just like if you subscribe to someone on twitch i've already got quite a few but if you've got any suggestions for emotes that i could use funny stuff serious stuff means within the channel let me know down in the comments below i've got a couple of artists in mind who could potentially make some awesome looking emotes that we could use anyways that is it for today guys do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below as i said videos will still be going up too i know not everyone can sit around for a two or three hour stream so there will be videos too it's just i want to do a lot of live stuff this month and have a crack at it see how it goes enjoy the rest of your weekend if you like the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
