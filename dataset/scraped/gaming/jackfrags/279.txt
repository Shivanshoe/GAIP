hi everyone and welcome back to more back for blood the beta version of the game on pc a big thanks to warner bros for giving me early access and today we're playing on a brand new level this is the second half of act one i believe and we've been sent thank you but i'm sure it's not going to be nice zombies infected some kind of horrible monstrum we'll find out soon so i've got this m16 here i just upgraded it as well i put a high zing scope on it that apparently will give me more damage to zombie weak parts or ridden weak parts as they're called in this game my teammate got pinned are we good and i also put a higher capacity magazine on it so you upgrade the guns by going to these supply stations which are at the safe rooms and you spend copper to upgrade everything copper's the currency that you find scattered around the levels and secret boxes and stuff like that smg smg i think i'm gonna stick with my m16 for now seems to be doing a lot of damage cool so it's really opened up here let's see shiny things you can also buy stuff like molotov's health kits bandages with the copper as well it's not just about upgrading your guns a sleeper what the hell's that that thing there it just came out the wall did it oh there's a box here i'm gonna have to kill that guy first check it out what we got some painkillers i've just got to investigate this farm the shinies so that's copper that's the currency about 700 i think that's enough for quite a few upgrades find all of the nests that's a minigun what is that hey watch yourself i think i just threw up in my mouth a little yeah we need to destroy there's a little thing here is that one that looks like one maybe it's disappeared there's a horde coming where from i don't know oh here we go yeah the gunplay feels what the hell is that the gunplay feels a lot better now i did play this in the alpha i live streamed on youtube i'm getting overrun here i feel like the gunplay is a bit more satisfying now it feels like it anyway so there's going to be another nest somewhere lots of zombies didn't see any of those little red things there well that's one of the things that was in the wall oh my god i shouldn't have opened that door that's a bad mistake oh no there's more here oh oh no i'm surrounded so you've got stamina i might go down and i accidentally found some health well that was lucky what's in this crate some upgrades that's gonna give me increased firepower well that was fun i need some rifle ammo have they done it rifle ammo rifle on a sniper ammo this may not have been my brightest moment well that was disgusting where's the rifle nope let's do this i'm gonna go get that in my team that'll do the job they're all on fire hey guys oh sidearm all right we have to go down here let's go oh more guns oh there's a sniper there ak i know you need ammo ammo pouch hang on can i put that down on the ground where did it go did i just use it i think i just used it i thought that would be for my team at least let's go boom what the hell is that noise oh my god look at them all up there in the bridge sorry you want to go in here let's go i feel like this it's one of those weird sleeper things again nothing else molotov i mean that saved me before really didn't it let's go right is that the safe room up there i think it is oh that was pretty intense on the way what is it oh it's a little more zone caravan just make sure i don't have to carry you guys next time who's that we're just all covered in blood [Laughter] what the hell so that's part one of the second half of act one done i'm really really surprised i didn't get killed then you can rate the match that's three stars great teammates ten out of ten continues remaining two interesting right so in between the levels you see what corruption cars have been played and their game modifiers that aren't very nice to you but there are some challenges there too and you can also pick a card from your deck but i think all of mine are a quick note i tell a lie 10 ammo 5 health i think more staminas to play i think that's what you want isn't it and then in here we can go to the shop oh there's a vector oh my god he's sleeping i can upgrade my magazine there let's do that oh we're in a tunnel oh that's a big lad uh guys guys right we got it oh no they're trapped so unfortunately my teammates have to leave but the level has continued and they've just been replaced by bots so we're gonna keep pushing forward through this tunnel and i guess we can just test how good the bots are compare more horrible things yeah so i can only have one of those i assume at some point you'll get like cars that let you carry more than one let's go you gotta climb up pop some heads i think one one one of them just ran in front of my crosshair then i accidentally headshot them sit down it's very foggy here it's kind of cool that you can stay on top of the cards as well start the tow truck pulls the horde [Music] all right then i'll start it i don't care i'm ready for the horde what's it going to do pull that you ready boss i think it's doing it oh my god why did that explode i was just trying to grab it maybe one of the bots shot it it's making a path isn't it a crusher which one beverly oh hoffman we can help oh no no no no no the big ones got me sorry okay right guys i think we can go i think we can go now let's go oh no that's so stupid this way oh my god i'm trying my pistol oh check this out the lighting's really nice here you see the squeaks everywhere sorry zombies these people had families just push them back don't get too far ahead i see shiny's here there might be some ammo hey that was rifle maybe i should try and conserve a bit more he's sticking together really that hard oh no no no no i thought that was a special there this way i'm going to get lost here big bang how what the hell set me on fire then get out of the ammo rifle ammo i mean that was just perfectly signed wouldn't it what is that that's an smg purple mp5 don't mind if i do i hate those things it's got a super quick reload on it could hit fire as well stay back demons yeah it does have pvp as well i've not tried it yet though shotgun hello god this swamp is horrible more copper i can spend that on upgrades something about this graveyard here well there's a church there i think that's our destination for this one you know opening the safe room door will cause a horde i'm prepared boxy you ready let's go i'm unlocking it we're in oh hi i'll die oh no let's get in there what do we have to do let's blew things here fortifications uh the windows yeah i can qualify the windows oh my god die one of my players is down i'm going to assume the box will handle that eyes wide ears open one of them's got like a heel or something see that green stuff i don't know what that is all right that one's done i'm going to help you no they're breaking the fortifications [Music] greatly appreciated what's i got this [Applause] [Music] is that one still finished yeah that one of them the left is still done here we go two out four um this one here zombie stop that uh okay can you guys can you handle that [Applause] yep i've got a fortification to do i mean the bots seem to be covering me quite well don't they [Applause] i didn't invite you [Music] come on come on come on oh there's a big lad no no no no you sat there i'm just cheesing it through the gut there is that it close the door hold on i think it's all done oh man cooped up in that church like that running around trying to fortify everything oh okay good job
