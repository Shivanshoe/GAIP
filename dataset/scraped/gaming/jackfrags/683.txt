I spent most of my morning going on cheep forums for call of duty war zone and therapeutically reading through the forums smiling from ear to ear it's just really good for the soul right now late last night Infinity Ward tweeted that they'd added SMS phone verification as a mandatory step to be able to play war zone on a new free-to-play account they actually went and did it this in itself is a massive deterrent for cheaters and it will help in the long run and I thought to myself this morning you know what I haven't actually experienced a blatant cheater on warzone for maybe two weeks now like something has changed and so I went searching online and I found a couple of cheating websites which have forums on them and on those forums and various different websites that I won't mention I'm not gonna link I'm not gonna promote them or anything like that there are so many posts on there about people complaining that the cheats that they've paid for aren't working anymore and they've tried new accounts they've tried new IP addresses they've tried spoofing their hardware ID on various different levels and it's just not working for them they make a new war zone account try again and they either get permanently banned or what they call shadow Bank what they've deemed as a shadow ban in warzone is that you make a new account after you've been banned for cheating and it will just infinitely search for a game with 200 ping and never put you into a match and then usually after about two to three days that account will be permanently backed and then they make a new account they try using a hardware ID spoofer they've changed their GPU they've changed their hard drive they've even gone as far as formatting windows and buying new hard drives but a lot of the things that they're doing are not working and that was last week and now on top of that they've got SMS phone verification that they have to apply to their account before they can play call of duty war zone online now I think this is a massive positive step for the game a great step forward in keeping the game as cheap free as possible and some people have said well you could just get like a Google phone number online I could do that in a couple minutes and just use that well if you look at these forums people have said they've tried that and they're not accepted someone even posted on one of these forums that they work in the telephone industry and they said that they can easily filter out those type of online numbers and that's probably why they're not being accepted as a legitimate phone number so you can play war zone and then some people say well okay I can just get a SIM card for a dollar or a pound at my local grocery store wherever yes that's very true in certain countries you can't just walk to you nearest Walmart or Tesco pick up a SIM card for a pound but in certain countries that requires ID and then you have to register it and in other countries like China SIM cards are apparently quite hard to get hold of from what I've discovered online so it's another big step for if someone wants to try and cheat on a new free-to-play account again they have to either order something online or go out of their house go to the place get the new SIM card come home take the SIM card out of their phone put the new SIM card in boot up register it send the text and then eventually they'll potentially be able to play war zone again but based on what I've been reading because of all these hardware bans that somehow Activision have managed to pull off it's not just checking like one thing on your PC it's looking at a lot of different serial numbers and codes of your hardware and grouping them together so even though you think you might have changed one of these things with the hardware ID spoofer you may have missed something along the way and the second you play on an account which has any or one of those string values which is registered in the Infinity Ward Activision anti cheat base you will just be banned again so with whatever Infinity Ward have done with the hardware ID banned side plus this new phone verification for new free accounts honestly I think this will make a massive difference to the amount of cheaters in the game especially those that are blatantly cheating on PC and yes I know that this will not completely eradicate cheating in an online multiplayer game there will always be people who slip through the net and managed to find a way around it but the point of these things is to put so many hurdles in place so many annoying things if you actually want to play the game again and cheat on a new account that those people just give up and stop cheating play the game legitimately or move on to another game do something else this is a really big deal and I think as a community we should be celebrating this because it really is a big win for the majority of the playerbase who like to play fair who enjoy the competitive attitude and the satisfaction of actually improving and winning games with your own skill and tactics rather than relying on a piece of software that will just do it all for you so I think that this should be celebrated and I wanted to say thank you to the men and women that have programmed this and put these kind of systems in place to make this awesome game that we all enjoy playing fair and as cheap free as it possibly can be so keep it up you're doing great and I personally am really thankful for it it was absolutely crazy though going on those forums and reading the amount of stuff that these people are trying to get their accounts to work on their PC hardware at the amount of money that people had spent on various different ID spoofer they'd find new windows keys some of them had spent like six hundred pound on new hard drives to try that one dude even said that he went as far as replacing his motherboard which appeared to work for a couple days but then they ended up getting banned again on a new account further down the line like I said I'm not going to show any of these posts or link to any of these forums this stuff is quite easy to find but it's just so satisfying to me reading through all these posts where they just keep getting banned over and over again imagine being banned on war zone and then signing up making a new account and that gets banned straight away so you think okay it must be hardware let's buy a hardware ID spoofer oh that didn't work right okay let's try a new GPU that didn't work either try a new hard drive nope sorry still doesn't work alright then okay so it must be my motherboard it's got to be the motherboard guys you take all the components out you PC case take the liquid cooler off or the fan take the CPU out take the memory out unplug all the power connectors buy a new motherboard install that into your case put the CPU in put the cooler back on put the memory in put the GPU in plug everything else back in make a new account but now you've got to go out and get a SIM card from somewhere you do all that and then you get banned again that is so funny to me and really satisfying and I just hope that with all these elements in place now it will have a big impact on the amount of cheaters in the game and it will stop people coming back and just making free accounts so easily it really is a great thing anyways what you'd be watching here is me in the waifu waggon being chased by a guy in a jeep in the new stimulus Solo's game mode I played this late last night mad this game mode is absolutely mad I kind of want original solos back now though because this is just a bit too hectic at times and I think it feels a bit orangey but you can't play it as tactically you can definitely get more kills and what I'm using here some of you may have noticed is the emperor theme with the blackout rounds someone suggested that I try these out so I have been playing a few matches with them to see what the deal is with them and unfortunately it's one of those cases again where the in-game stats in gunsmith are quite misleading because when you put these in your gun they say that they do more damage than the typical 50 or 60 round mags but you only get thirty of them what they actually give you is more damage at range but they also remove your traces and remove the enemy skull icon from when you kill someone I've been playing with it in a few different matches I just feel like they're not very good like they're okay in solos but in squads I think if you're running in m13 you definitely want the 50 or 60 mag just because you've got so much more sustained fire there and you can take out multiple opponents so I wouldn't really recommend ever using the blackout mags in warzone I'm sure some people have success with them but for me personally I just feel like 50 or 60 round mag is a much better option in warzone so that's that and we'll let the gameplay carry on here but I was looking for a bit of feedback from you guys my viewers the people that tuned in on a regular basis I've had a lot of requests to do regular warzone streams on YouTube so when the game launched I was doing quite regular streams on the game and it had a load of fun with it but the lasts like two or three weeks or so I've just been so busy with video content with video work that I haven't really had time to stream anything but things are starting ease up again for me so I've got more time to potentially stream water on YouTube and I wanted to know from you guys in the comments if I were to stream warzone regularly on YouTube and have a consistent schedule with it so you knew on this there this time jack is gonna be streaming warzone number one how many times a week would be a good amount because you have to remember that I'm also uploading videos too and there'll be videos on warzone as well as other games too that I've got to fit everything in here together and I don't want it to get too messy I don't want to over saturate things because then the quality starts to drop so I was thinking maybe three streams a week do you think that's a good number would you like to see more or less and also number two the length of these streams for me personally on YouTube I like keeping it to around two to three hours because it means that I can keep the energy high I can keep engaging with the chat and at the same time trying to perform in the game on a consistent basis so to me that's a good length but I don't know if I should be going longer or shorter than that considering that it will also be published as a video afterwards that people might watch so let me know on those two things down in the comments below that would be very helpful and also Infinity Ward Raven software you're doing a great job with the anti cheat stuff but please like I did just killed me he made zero footstep sounds and I don't think he had dead silence that's one of my other big problems with the game at the moment I think footstep sounds well they haven't proved there's still occasions where it's so inconsistent and you just don't hear a thing so I'm looking forward to getting an update on that and also reducing the RPG spam a bit but with that said that's all for today guys I hope you enjoyed this one do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you liked it leave a like and subscribe for more that really helps out with my videos being seen thank you if you didn't like it dislike it not a problem once again kids for watching and I'll see you in the next one
