almost a year ago now we took a look at one of the most popular FPS games in the world and many people simply hadn't heard of it if I gave you five guesses as to what that game was I imagine that we'd get the usual suspects suggested Cod csgo pub G halo something along those kind of lines it was none of those games though instead a game called crossfire which is incredibly popular on PC in Asian markets but now it's coming to consoles aimed at Western audiences in the form of something new called crossfire X and I've been playing it over the last couple of days and today I'll bring you some gameplay and first impressions to see if it's something that's worth your time crossfire X is an xbox exclusive at least for now but before we get into it let me just remind you how many players crossfire has just a mere 600 million registered users admittedly a lot of that player base as I mentioned is within Asia which is why perhaps a lot of players aren't that familiar with it in Western Europe and the US the game is produced by small gates who are a South Korean game developer and they've decided to bring the game to consoles for the first time because up until now crossfire was only on PC and with that sort of player base just on PC imagine the possibilities for console crossfire X is a two-part of though and a bit of a different story there is a multiplayer component that small gate themselves are taking care of but remedy are producing a single-player campaign for the game and you may know remedy from games such as Alan Wake Max Payne and more recently quantum break and control considering those games I actually expect the single-player to be a good experience but for now let's focus on the multiplayer because that's all I've played and that's because the crossfire X beta is available on Xbox this week and if you're part of the insider program you can download it right now and play it so I jumped in for a few rounds to get a feel and see if it's got potential at its core crossfire X is a tactical team based shooter and most of the core game modes you'll be familiar with and most FPS players will too because they've been in a handful of games or there's nothing evolutionary or drastic here when it comes to the game modes that's for sure but to be completely honest crossfire didn't have much going for in terms of originality either and that did just fine it took inspiration from a loss of key elements of the game like counter-strike so I've played three different modes during my time with the game on three different Maps I played team match on Black Widow which is part of the classic playlist and then Specter which is also part of the classic playlist on a map called laboratory and then finally I hopped onto the gr tower and played point capture which is part of the modern playlist the first thing to know is that the two different playlists offer a very different experience the classic crossfire playlist doesn't have aimed on the site on weapons nor are you able to sprint the modern playlist however allows you to end on the site with a number of different scope attachments on your weapons and you can sprint full speed it also has a tactical growth system that adds options to improve your sprint speed or even defensive options by giving you a riot shield how to both playlists the modern playlist is where log players might feel more comfortable because it feels a lot more Call of Duty let's say the mode I was playing was called the point capture and it's got two teams fighting over two points and then when one team has enough points there's a little moment where everyone can zipline down through the windows onto the last flag while the zipline down is a relatively cool moment there isn't anything hugely unique about the game-mode itself when you die you respawn and really quickly so it's easy to get back into the action there's no downtime and then there are the two classic modes that I mentioned the first one will be very similar to fold across by a player's and anyone who's played counter-strike or any search-and-destroy game-mode it's very much a round based attack and defend mode no IDs as I mentioned so you've really got to be a lot more precise with your shots and well as you guys know my controller aim it's a bit rusty so I definitely found this harder than the modern mode but that's good as it offers up something different for the console market but while I enjoy these sorts of mode to someone who's played a lot of counter-strike over the years I'm not sure that it will be the - mode for the majority of CrossFireX plays the map design felt incredibly similar to CS though very lane based but remember when you die you're out for the entire round the other classic mode is called Specter and this one is definitely quite different there's still an attack and defend element and there's still a bomb that has to be planted by one team but the kicker here is that the attacking team are mostly invisible as an attacker you've only got a melee weapon available but you're wearing a special suit that makes you invisible and enemies can pretty much only see you when you're right in front of them swiping away with your knife but the more you move the more visible you become you can sit hide and be sneaky although your suit does make a little bit of noise so if the defending team are paying attention they may be able to hear you sure this is something different and it could be fun to play with friends but I don't really see it being a game-mode that I would personally play more than a few times but I can see it being a favorite for some when it comes to weapons well you've got your usual suspects the m4 deagle a.k.a WM sound like any other game there are also no real options in the game so to speak you can tweak a few of the controller settings sensitivity for example and brightness but that's about it it is a base after all though but I'd like to see a few more customization options on release in terms of visuals there's definitely an improvement over the base game there's no doubt about that it's actually pretty night and day when you see them side by side but you would absolutely expect there to be a big difference because the original game came out in 2008 but you could tell how much the original counter-strike influenced it the levels were really basic as was the case for many games back then but crossfire X definitely brings the game into modern day with a huge improvement to visuals sound design and animations I'm not gonna say it's the best-looking game ever and to be completely honest the player animations look a bit off at times but considering the game's multiplayer is free-to-play and considering the original game has done so well with the really basic graphics I don't think the visuals are not important to the core player base but this is of course not really aimed at them also based on what the developers have said what I've been able to play in the current build of the game is nothing compared to what will be dateable later in the year when the fourth game launches they were going to be a lot more maps and lots more game modes to keep you busy you could say there's something for everyone just from what I've played already there is a Counter Strike Star mode as well as something a bit more fast-paced for the Call of Duty fans and something that the more casual gamer can enjoy with Spectre mode on the surface though CrossFireX doesn't do anything hugely innovative it's not the best looking game nor does it have the best gunplay the best map design or really anything hugely unique about it what it does have though it's a strong history at least in Asian markets and while the franchise clearly has a player base in the West I get the feeling that small Gate would like crossfire X to be somewhat more popular across the water and having a free to play console game is definitely one way of having good go at that there's not many counter-strike style clones on console apart from the recently released Warface breakout so it could have a really good shot here although its exclusivity to Xbox at the moment might hamper it a bit interestingly the executive producer on the game has said that one of the reasons they think the original crossfire was so successful is because it was intentionally designed for lower spec pcs and it could just run on anything but because of that crossfire was not something that met well with Western players expectations and I think that what he's saying there is that it's just a vastly different expectation across the markets of what players want and expect from a modern multiplayer shooter and they think that they're meeting those Western expectations with this new crossfire X a game that will still retain the core DNA of crossfire but with more modern visuals and gameplay on top as well as a single-player campaign by remedy what does surprise me though is that this is just an xbox game at least for now crossfire X is not coming to PC only Xbox but it seems that it may arrive on ps4 at some point perhaps they don't feel that they need to provide an updated crossfire game for PC yet because the core market is still actively playing the original game so they'd rather focus on bringing the franchise to something new to console in the West but pushing it towards different markets at the same time wrapping things up crossfire X based on what I've played it isn't going to blow you away but I think it's a competent game it does what it needs to well and it offers up a fun experience will that be enough to bring a die-hard PC shooter the success that they're aiming for on consoles only time will tell it releases later this year but like I said the multiplayer is free-to-play the beta is going on at the moment for a couple more days if you in the insider program and it's also open to anyone this weekend so do let me know your thoughts on the game down in the comments below reckon this is the kind of thing that you would play or perhaps not let's hear your opinion and before we finish I just wanted to say a massive thank you to anyone that's donated to the special effect fundraiser I started yesterday my original goal was ten thousand dollars in two weeks but we hid that within an hour I've kept on increasing the goal and at the moment it's at nearly forty thousand dollars which I just never expected I've now increased it once again to fifty thousand and if we can hit that before the first of July when the fundraiser ends I'll be over the moon the link is on the screen now and also in the description below if you'd like to donate anything special effects basically they were charity that helped physically disabled people play games and I like what they're doing with that said that's all for today folks thanks for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music]
