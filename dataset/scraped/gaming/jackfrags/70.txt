okay so this is infantry only conquest on bf2042 this is the new weekly mode that they've put in and when they say infantry only it just means that there's no big attack vehicles like our tanks no attack helicopters no little bird so it's just the mav that one there it's this one which is the latv4 recon the jeep kind of thing and also i think the hovercraft and i've never played 2042 like this before really in the inventory only conquest style setting so i thought we'd jump on i mean i've seen a few people on twitter talking about it and they said that it's quite good so see what kind of experience we have here we've actually got a full server as well it's one of the featured game modes so i think a lot of people might want to try this because i know that vf fans historically have enjoyed this kind of infantry only star gameplay nice kill there so this is the this is the 30 millimeter cannon oh no we're being hammered that mv is going to kill us what if i can get around behind it and get a kill is three c five enough i don't know i've got a cheeky flank here rich two three bang yeah it's enough okay oh where'd you go angel does it again you can't be wearing christmas stuff in april i'm sorry it just it's not acceptable over e1 is this even a good loadout for the m5 i don't know has it got hybrid on it how do i no that isn't a hybrid it's just a bigger scope put that one on instead that one looks cool this is no shark canals isn't it bf3 map so i don't know if this inventory only conquest is oh stupid ranger if it's only on the portal map so did they actually put it on the 2042 maps as well i don't know i hate these things so much someone killed it good infantry down here oh man this m5 it was always the best gun god angel don't you dare do it again angel how am i alive look at my health can i cut through that yes okay there's gonna be more enemies there on there nice i think i've got a suppressor on it but i'm not sure is this one of the suppressors that actually keeps you off the minimap it might be i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead angel yes how am i not dead there's two people there somewhere that works one guy here yes okay we cleared it nope one there yeah location revealed i think that's because that was a pay i've got six bullets wait i can switch can't i can do that that's cheeky gun i've got time ah i thought i had time but it spools it up doesn't it that's not a bad start there 12 kills in the bag one death i'll take it oh i've got so many good memories playing on this map in bf3 not just because of the tdm area there but just playing it on conquest and using the is it the tunguska i think the aaa vehicle that only reveals my location for the peak that i shoot at right it doesn't ping me for other people that could actually change i suppose because they talked about those reworks that they're doing there's a guy in here look on the minimap ah come on where's the aim at jack we could do better than this i'm rusty man i've not played this since when i played it yesterday but just on that other featured game mode they had flashback conquest again that was actually quite decent you know um they're all spawning in over here and my aim is off okay i have to switch again put the big mag in looks good though i mean i'm playing it on ultra in the past when i've played this game i always put it on lower settings just because the performance was kind of bad on the 2042 maps but the frame rate seems to be better on the portal maps maybe it's just because they're smaller could be jack frank's hello no way he's playing this he made a video on it the other day should i say hi how do i no that's team hello let's see what they say i didn't get a res that hurts back on charlie one how's it going oh good thanks i could no they're dead okay you know what i don't think i've even done like a c4 ge4 vehicle in this game ever not that it's going to be great on this unless i can ram an mav or something okay i'm going to explode if that guy hits me yes oh my god i was so lucky there was a guy i can't aim down the sight that stupid bug oh my god there you go there's the game just kicking you back down yeah i literally can't abs but they said they fixed that in update 4.0 no idea take fire on only if i only hit fire only if i only how did i get away with that damn it i want to aim you're friendly yet you're just a weird looking mckay [Applause] i'm sorry they can fly ow okay i can't aim down the sight i guess i'll just try and get lucky hello from germany i'm gonna try and embarrass myself here golden tag does that work i think that works okay onto the d flag what is that oh that's the irish aps system i always wanted to do a video testing that but then there was like never any point so i didn't bother with it come on lads capture this point i still can't aim by the way guys just so you know that game you played with tom on the last video looks so fun are you talking about myth force the one that looks like the 80s really cool art style that yes looks great yeah it's super cool how about that i don't know what they wrote there that got starred but they wrote something who knows man okay maybe oh no i'm out of explosives i mean i might as well die right so i can aim again boris boris unless is that going to let me aim no well this is awkward i jump up it get on top of it if only wait i can there
