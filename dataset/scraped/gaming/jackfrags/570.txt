hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to call of duty black ops cold war multiplayer questions gamepl the chat you want me to look at anything in particular then please feel free to ask i'm looking at the chat and i'll be interacting if you guys want to know how something feels or any particular loadout or whatever it might be let me know i expect the chat will be pretty crazy but i'll do my best to keep up with everything so for the next couple hours we are going to be playing through all the different maps i think there's about 12 different maps in this playlist all sorts of different game modes and combinations so i'm really looking forward to this it's gonna be good [Laughter] i'm glad that you've all joined me thank you so much for coming along here i appreciate it so this first map we're playing is called armada and it's domination 12v12 there's a couple of vehicles in here there's attack boats which i didn't expect we've got jet skis and you've also got lots of zip lines that connect this giant aircraft carrier so you can zip across you can fight in the middle well it's not an aircraft carrier sorry it's more of like a i don't know what you call it a submarine carrier a submarine dock something like that but here we go so i have made a couple of custom classes already these ones you get straight away they're just different options but these are the ones that i created and here we are we're in straight away i could just jump on a jet ski these boys got in a big boat straight away but this is a uh capture style game mode so you've got points on the outside i might be able to get this attack but actually straight away let's have a look there we go oh this has got a mini gun on it as you can see it's pretty good they can damage it with small arms fire though but we've nearly captured that point there we go so where shall i go with this underneath so we have a look underneath oh you can't climb ladders when there's an attack boat around mate sorry all jet skis in fact [Laughter] we've got waffles over there someone's shooting at waffles what's going on there goodbye i'm not sure if you could wallbang that i don't know i might go around to eat can zoom in a little bit as well with the attack boat but as i said i am vulnerable like players can can hit me with anything small arms fire other boats i'm sure this is the point that i just captured right that's a little turret up there hey i see you keep your head down mate right we're going to jump out this attack but we'll go inside and fight a little bit you can swim in this game what is it it's like an m4 m16 i guess i just got sniped nice shot you can slide as well the slide is kind of weird you slide and then slide again if you want i don't think you can slide cancel like you can in warzone or at least i've not got the mechanic down for it yet let's say but we're playing on pc here we're at 1440p i'm on high graphics at the moment this isn't ultra graphics it can go a bit higher than this but we might switch to that later there's a sniper over there losing a losing c see if i can get to a it's being capped here i mean like a sniper on this map would be really good wouldn't it that's a score streak right there i'll pop that out it's a uav basically spy plane you can shoot when you're in the water as well ow there's a sniper locking me down you can actually ads when you're in the water are you still there not sure if that dude is still looking at me priority tasking request receive is he going to peek again nope so there was another one there all right we're going to go in again i want to get up there if i can we put a little proximity mine at the top here that should destroy anyone that jumps up there he's contested i don't think so mate no escape who's contesting this ah snipe from above he was up there wasn't he i think yeah so if you haven't figured it out already suppressors in this game actually take you off the minimap but they do reduce your damage a bit so that's where the trade-off is no mounting in this game unfortunately and definitely miss that mountain's good fun in uh war zone and modern warfare i like doing it anyway is that mr ruffle waffles i don't know he's legendary if it is him that's amazing time to kill is a bit longer than modern warfare i would say let's get to this d point here can i not pilot this i just want to drive the boat was that too much to ask you going cap c yeah so this is a lot bigger than your typical domination map obviously air patrol what does that do i don't even know what that does i think it just destroys if there are enemy helicopters in the sky the jets just come through and destroy them what the hell it's like a swarm of angry bees someone coming through here i think where's that teammate fall back a bite in this game i think it's tack mask or flak jacket it basically maximizes your defense against stun grenades and flashes but you know if you play modern warfare you know how powerful stuns are if you take that perk you should be okay in this game these guys flying across on the zip line there's a little sniper here no one is using the attack boats i think i was the only person that actually used the attack was that right at the start of the game as well as i said like attack boats i don't think there's been anything like that in a card game before so maybe players just aren't used to it you can have shotguns as well in secondaries without using overkill in this game it's not called overkill though i think it's called law breaker i'll take you guys through all the perks afterwards so you can have a look at everything oh wow that's a napon striker something there that was cool i don't know if you can get shot when you're underwater [Music] maybe you can unlucky could that kill streak short sorry score streak [Music] all these zippy boys again i mean if no one's going to use the attack boats i'll use them ridiculous [Music] i think that was like an assist council kill there because i did a load of damage to that dude that's like swine flies this is great [Music] all right mate waffles i'm sorry oh the handling on this is incredibly simple i would say it's a bit simpler than the vehicles in warzone if i could compare it to anything [Music] you get a horn as well that's a bit hard to hear oh that's not cool jax was up on the turret there fair play so i think if i didn't have the suppressor on there maybe i've got that dude you get shot from up there on losing locked down where'd you go where'd you go it's kind of weird how you can swim and aim down the sight at the same time i think it was like that in black ops 3 and 4 though wasn't it there's something wrong with this ladder there's a glitch or something there's a bit of a bug we lost b you coming in i wasn't sure if that guy was gonna wait for me or not yeah footsteps sounds are actually pretty good as well someone asked about the gun playing the chat there um the this game feels very different to modern warfare and warzone i just released a video on it where i talked about my impressions like a bit of an overview about the game um i don't think the gun play is as satisfying as modern warfare let's put it like that i don't know if it's the animations or the recoil like i feel like the recoil is a lot less in this game than modern warfare so i don't feel as connected to the guns as i do in warfare and warzone it's going to take a bit of getting used to the movement as well it's a bit different there's no attack sprint so you do feel a bit slower i would say there were no doors obviously i kind of missed stores never think i uh i would say that but there you go the map design as well feels very old school and it's just overall like layout of the maps and the design of them very blocky there's not much parkour like there is in modern warfare so it feels like a completely different game to modern warfare it's quite different really definitely going to take a bit of getting used to it oh that was lucky okay right nice little streak how did that go now see me there's a guy above me there securing c [Music] losing a i don't know if i'm going to get it before the round ends though i need to get a few more kills or objective play there we go let's give this a shot i'm not trying this before that is really loud and it's gone that's a pretty decent game wasn't it not bad for the first game this dude went ham with this smg nice how did we do then we got 32 kills 10 deaths look at this little graph here that's interesting guitar is sick like he's a really good player i think i've come up against him in other games before and he's always like really really good uh right so i think i have to back out of this lobby now i'd await instructions on the discord if you've got any questions now is probably a good time to ask them i think i need to put slow mode on the chat as well because it is going absolutely crazy right now i can't keep up with that uh hold up a second slow mode put it on 10 seconds there we go that's a bit better right cool game one is done right okay so while we're waiting for the discord message i can show you guys some of the weapons so gunsmith is back in the game but they've changed the user interface it's a lot simpler now than modern warfare and warzone i actually prefer the one in war zone in modern warfare but this is how they've got it and you'll notice that on this gun i can actually have eight attachments and that's because i've got this uh perk sorry this wild card here gunfighter it gives you three additional attachment slots i was quite happy with that xm4 as it's called so go all sorts of different sites here that's kind of like the blk i guess different muzzles i appreciate this as well it actually tells you the percentage effect of what's going on with that attachment in mw it's just plus and minus but now it gives you a a real number a real indication of what's actually happening so i'm not going to put a suppressor on it this time but we'll use a different weapon different barrels extended that one does more vehicle damage i think you'd really only want that if you played a lot of combined arms maps well that looks like a decent one different foregrips not sure if i want the laser on there aiming move speed different mags these are locked so i can't see them but that looks like a different type of ammunition there so i wonder if the damage on that is higher or maybe lower because it's stan ag could be a high rate of fire different handles so i still got two attachments so you might as well put them on yes that's what we're looking at there like i said you can take shotguns as secondaries now without needing where is it no it's a wild card law breaker so that's overkill that just lets you take any weapon in both slots otherwise your secondaries are pistol shotguns and launchers i think obviously there's probably going to be a lot more weapons when the game releases but for now this is what we're working with but the spaz 12 there it's kind of a cool looking shotgun isn't it reminds me of jurassic park the dude who's like clever girl muldoon i think is his name you don't want to put a sight on a shotgun though dear come on you can put suppressor on it extended range that trade-offs here in there aiming move speed have a nine-round mag yeah so these are the different perks engineer let you detect enemy equipment and score streaks through walls so i think that's called tracker or spotter in mw tactical mask that's the one that basically nullifies the effects of flashes and stuns black jacket it's classic less damage from explosives molotovs and get yammer fallen players we all know that one quarter master recharge equipment over 25 seconds track it yeah so it's spotter was the other one that one lets you see enemy footsteps and you can aim at enemies and reveal them on your team's mini map hello i didn't know that cold-blooded so ai controlled scorestreaks won't target you player control scores score streaks will not highlight you you show up cold on thermals so thermal sights are in the game players and vehicles won't see your nameplate so good for combined arms maybe ghost undetectable yeah undetectable by enemy spy planes whenever you're moving planting or defusing bombs or controlling scorestreaks and ninja that's very similar to dead silence i suppose but instead of being a field upgrade it's now a perk tacticals in this build smoke and stun lethals fragging c4 is your field upgrades you get proximity mine does what it says on the tin sam turret so that will take down school streaks i think that's what happened to my chopper gunner jammer disables enemy field upgrades and degrading any the mini map information and then the field mic so that's if you're camping i suppose you just stick that down and you can just look at the sounds on the mini-map and yeah these are the wild cards danger close extra lethal and tactical start with max ammo law breaker we went over that one overkill basically gunfighter that gives you the three additional attachment slots and then perk greed which gives you three extra perks i think that's i've got agreed on that one you can see there's six perks here uh someone asks are they unique operators yes there are so adler is the main character or what are the main characters in the story i don't know who baker is garcia i imagine that these are all from the campaign i think i saw sims in the trailer port over she's kgb that's just a milsim it's stone 1964. stone you could have told us you were going to be in the game song vargas hunter and powers so those are the operators we did just get a notification in discord there to back out and wait for further instructions so we're going to go ahead and do that uh quarter kill we're just waiting we we're not allowed to queue up we have to wait until everyone's ready it's how this live stream is working did they say anything about warzone i believe they did say something about warzone they said that it's going to be connected to cold war whatever happens in cold war will have an effect on war zone and vice versa so there is some kind of connectivity i think they don't want to ruin any surprises right now because obviously when they do a big event or whatever it is the map changes there's a new map in warzone they want to make a big deal about it right they want it to be a a massive event so it's really unlikely that they would just give it all away [Laughter] but i'm guessing that there's going to be some kind of big event that changes the map maybe all the guns change the cold war era the vehicles the level whatever it is i'm really looking forward to it what settings am i playing at so i did say mostly at high settings so i'm playing at 1440p 240 hertz some stuff on medium disabled disabled i might put it all on max a bit later just to show you guys how it looks unlimited frame rate i've got my frames up there 60 in the menu but i think it was like 200 in the game a lot of the settings are similar to how they were in black ops 4 in modern warfare you got all your toggles your holds all your keybinds it's a really nice pc build of the game as far as i can tell everything is here that i would want really all the audio stuff controller settings it's all there what was the down light the download size download site i went a bit australian there didn't i the download size was 60 gig is that ultra wide support i couldn't tell you i don't know i'm playing on a 16 9 monitor so i don't know i'm still waiting for instructions here guys i'm sorry for the delay but this is a live event and they're syncing us up with the live stream that's going on on the official channels at the moment you guys want to see some of the weapons so assault rifles we've got the xm4 the creek 6 the ak smg's mp5 looking good type 821 ak74u the ak74u is really good it's really good attack rifles m16 that's burst only unless there's a late game upgrade for it i couldn't see how to make it automatic type 63 is pretty op light machine guns got the rpd and the stoner 63. stoner don't know how you would say that someone asked if i could look at the score streaks well here we go rcxd that's a remote control bomb spy plane artillery strike napalm strike we saw that one we also saw the air patrol i called that in last game war machine dirty grenade launcher attack helicopter shot down one of those with the boat and the chopper gunner i barely got to use it hopefully we can use it in the next game all right we've been sold to ready up we just got to find out what game mode we're playing i imagine it's going to be this one kill confirmed satellite oh snipers sorry i didn't show snipers did i um yeah snipers so we've got the tundra that looks like an awp or an l96 and we've got the pellington i think that's an m40 obviously they can't use the actual names probably because of licensing but yeah there we go there's the snipers for you right okay i'm being told to queue up now so we're gonna do that we are cueing domination miami right here we go so this is a very stylized map it's a night time some nice reflections on the store some nice colors will there be a zombies yeah it's got zombies it's got a campaign i think they showed some zombies in the official reveal bit of a tease not much though like i haven't played zombies the only thing i've played is multiplayer r700 yeah that's what it's based off that's right hit scan or projectile nook silver i don't want to say for sure but i think it's his scan i have to double check that it feels like it's hit scan there is gunsmith yeah we've already gone through that [Music] is that prestige i don't know if there's prestige do i think they'll be skill based matchmaking yes absolutely so we only need a few more players two more players and we can go i apologize if i sound a bit weird as well i've got a bit of a cold at the moment so changed my voice a little bit i sound a bit uh stuffy at times is it a new engine uh no i don't think so as far as i know this game isn't using the modern warfare engine it's using a different engine probably why it feels a bit different we got 37 000 people in here can i just say thank you so much for tuning in guys i really appreciate you all being here let's get it game number two well i might use an smg so i was on the xm4 the first game that's all that i used i mean the chat is just mad it's in slow mode and it's going crazy a big thanks to all the new members as well thank you so much guys i i can't keep up with it right now the maps take a little while to load right um should we go smg let's do it domination domination yeah you can see the war zone players this dude's busted out a sniper so i don't think the the sound design is as good in this game as it is in modern warfare like there's not as much ambiance in the levels but i do really like the footsteps i think the footsteps are good we are falling behind you know modern warfare and war zone footsteps can be a bit inconsistent but in this game i think they're done all right with it but i'm not sure if i've got ghost on right now if not i should put ghost on or ninja ninja's the one which makes your footsteps quieter i think to turn my volume up a bit actually but as you can see what i was talking about earlier with map design like it's very blocky you know very old-school cod i think that's purposeful see if we get a little flank on here let's go this way now i don't really know the match yet so i'm just being cautious taking my time i've got c4 on this class okay i thought i could get lucky there dude's got a sniper up there i'm almost out of ammo what okay i've got the rocket launcher seven bullets all right i'm dead yeah i needed to die there i don't think i've got scavenger on this we lost i'm not sure about that secondary either ow ibra killer field mic available is that stunned enemies yeah snipers could be good on this map holding gay yeah up here there's a nice little sniper route up here if i had a sniper here this would be a good spot right now look at this put your back oh oh that's got so much stiff on it check that out it's friendly down there the greg someone's covering that what's that mp5 it's almost got built take what you can detect that's a different throwing speed in height uh modern warfare gotta get used to that what's a beach ball oh halftime right so he's actually switching in this domination um should we try a sniper i'll try the dmr see how that is can you lean like in modern warfare no you can't you can't lean you can't mount or anything like that uh i could go overlook this couldn't i with the sniper taking alpha you capture that i'm gonna go up here [Music] oh that's nice that does a lot of damage who stun me then what that bounced the wrong way we need to get b lads let's go multiple enemies by playing contacts this dude right above me drop down they can probably see me can't they on the spy plane there's a little tactical reload there did you see that ah too many they were spawning around there yeah so you can i didn't even realize that you know how modern warfare introduced reloads where you still aim down the site dude i'm trying to demonstrate game mechanics please [Laughter] he got me while he was stunned well played oh this is a nice looking area turn this out can you tactical sprint no you cannot i don't like the look of this corridor dude this gun is really good very high damage it changes the game a lot because the ttk is usually quite long he's up there you take a little dip that's 12 feet no way you can hear an enemy no what the hell's going on yeah this is the one no i thought i had teammates there look at that my teammates were right there i even go on the beach there's a bloody there's like a speedboat out there check that out what if there's a megalodon there's always a magnet on i can hear someone so i'm talking about with the footsteps actually really good i'm sure there's someone there maybe not enemy spy plane inbound oh you can't get onto this i didn't realize that get it securing me oh no artillery come on wow yeah that is a really weird kill streak it's very defensive it's just all about getting rid of their score streaks 50 expanded i like the russian voice actors i good oh okay nice pick he's sniping i could do a sniper myself maybe come this way and i'll come in this way guys are there nukes i've got no idea if they're nukes oh even the hip fire on it's really good oh that's kind of uh see now this would be the perfect moment to use that score streak i should have saved it what's fun game how's it me let's go i'll get stunned here don't i and the guy comes in behind me and kills me how is that how is that a good play oh no i got the third one wow so cinematic such aim many well so not as good that game as the first one but we did all right is there sniper glint in this game i don't think so i don't think there is all right we gotta back out again is this open beta no this is alpha alpha gameplay what's up thingy hey skywalker nelson craig what's up buddy god it's hard to read the names man infamous hd how you doing oh boss man zero two smith great name blood eagle 27 how are you doing guys thank you for coming along to the stream i hope you're enjoying it giving you guys this first look at call of duty black ops cold war multiplayer are they finishers like eliminations no i don't think there is i don't think there is so we're just waiting for another instruction here what game mode we're gonna play next guys honestly i'm just i'm so over the moon that you're here watching this thank you thank you for coming along i'll show you guys the operators again someone just asked adler he's a war hero from vietnam as you can see he's got some pretty nasty scars on his face there baker navy seal garcia garcia has seen like he's seen some stuff look at those eyes man that's there's a lot of pain there sims this dude just loves playing the sims so he changed his name to the sims porn over get gb it says on the gun there this is my rifle do you guys see that this is my rifle that's full metal jacket isn't it this is my rifle this is for fun this is for fire and this is something like that i haven't seen full mail jacket in ages great movie though hunter how many secondaries at the moment there's not many two shotguns two pistols one launcher do kill streaks restart when you die no they're score streaks in this game so you get points towards your score streak by being alive by playing the objective being a team player and getting kills if you die it doesn't reset as far as i know obviously kill streaks in modern warfare they reset when you die so it's a bit different i think it just gives people playing a more of an opportunity to use the the cool stuff i guess all right we've been told to ready up i'm just gonna find out what game mode we are queuing for next what's it gonna be i wanna show you guys combined arms on this map because it's got tanks you can see one there in the picture i'm not a big fan of vip mode though didn't like it can you mount a gun nope no gun mounting is there a right shield i don't think so not in this build of the game mastery camos i don't think we can see any of that barracks is locked we're not allowed to see barracks on this build of the game unseen shooter what do i use to edit sony vegas oh it's called magics vegas now vegas edit right we're just holding for the next map auto rotating mosh pit so that's all the game modes i know they announced a uh a game mode called fire teams on the stream but i haven't played that that's not in this build of the game it was a bit interesting i'd like to give it a go though because it was fire teams of four on a big map and you've got to go around doing objectives together multiplayer i think they said it was for 40 players or something i have to check that because i only i was just half tuning into the reveal because i was trying to get ready for the stream only for next gen so this game is coming out on pc ps4 xbox one xbox one series x and ps5 and also it's cross play between all of those platforms so if you're lucky you got a bit of cash you fancy splashing out on a ps5 but your mates only got a an xbox one or a ps4 you can still play together it's kind of cool right so we've got a queue for team deathmatch on moscow let's do it i can't see any skins i don't have access to any skins anything like that it's not coming out on the nintendo switch relaxing end as far as i know but i'd love to see it i would love to see that bro don't know about prestige play with the ak-47 ak-47 uh you don't want an optic on the ak do you surely muzzle break effective damage range i mean you want that don't you let's be let's be real let's go with that all right says that we're joining a match search and destroyed not in this build of the game i don't know if they've got it in the full game or anything but not here you want to test the drop shot you can slide i don't know about drop shot i'm not sure did that just kick me out okay that sucks try again is there a knife i don't think there's like melee weapons when i saw the single player campaign though i did see a tomahawk so i mean come on it's black ops there's gonna be throwing gaxes isn't there for sure vietnam maps uh not again i haven't seen any vietnam maps but surely i mean it's in the single player it'll be in the multiplayer i think struggling to get into a game here oh here we go one more player eight more players i mean you can see katarga at the back there he's got a an axe or a tomahawk of some delineation looking good that's stalin isn't it was it lenin i didn't pay attention in history class it's one of them hello aaron from germany what's up are they flamethrowers i haven't seen any flamethrowers no but again with it being set partially in vietnam yeah probably dedicated servers i think so it would be a massive regression if this game didn't have dedicated servers it must have them i think the days of peer-to-peer call of duty and hosting lobbies on clients connections that's done that's long gone it's a 100 dedicated servers i would guess 60 tick rate as well it's taking ages can you inspect don't think so i didn't see an inspect k let's have a look usually it would be here wouldn't it nope it doesn't look like it how am i gonna make thumbnails for youtube hmm okay i don't know what happened then but some kind of error has occurred there try again nuketown i should hope so can't have a black ops game without newtown right the highest obtainable score streak is the chopper gunner mini gonna go that's what that is right there i'm sorry this is taking so long guys you know with it being a live event there's gonna be hiccups i have to follow instructions that are in a discord that i'm in this guy's got really shifty eyes moving his mouth around as well wonder what he's saying how is this the quick scoping i don't know from memory it's pr you can you can quick scope perfectly fine in this game free for all yeah it's got free for all played free-for-all well i've been searching for like eight minutes now and it's not managed to find a game which is unfortunate there we go i think they heard me complaining only two people in this lobby hmm well i'm now being told to wait for new instructions so yikes can you slide cancel don't think so is a sleight of hand or fmj not yet they've changed the way it works i mean usually it'd be there wouldn't it oh we're getting again oh it's done the thing again what okay there's obviously something going wrong here isn't there i can't play zombie mode guys it doesn't let me just grade out it's locked hmm i don't know if i missed the game now because it was full or something did other i are you guys watching other streamers right now did they did they get to play on moscow team deathmatch where are the loot crates colton i don't think there are any loot crates i haven't seen any can you reload cancel okay we're about to get new instructions again yeah some people did get to play moscow okay it didn't put me in a game then for some reason missed out on that one [Music] i want to play uh the snow map though hope that's coming up next i'm just waiting for further instructions again show sniper class model uh where is it you can put full grip on that what the hell sof target designator it's done that three times now okay we're going hardpoint satellite right hopefully this works hey there we go this is a desert map [Music] i think maybe someone took my spot for the last match never mind it's quite clean looking map this one it feels very old school cod there we go let's get in there let's do it we're in the desert i think this is north africa right so you guys wanted me to use an ak so that's what we'll do i think you want a a weapon with a scope on this map though because of the range is on it you can go all the way out to the side here and just snipe if you want to identify i'm sure that i'm about to get sniped any second our point is secure we're taking control oh it's a lot of damage isn't it damn that's a powerful stun eat oh they're right behind us it's quite a nice looking mountain isn't it the sniper out there try and push that sure there was someone there look at that body that ragdoll though see i mean you can come out all the way here it's kind of weird oh the spawns have flipped hardpoint is secured all right they say okay oh that's a lot of damage it's nice you can definitely feel that compared to the smg's put a little mine down here hostiles have the hardpoint once you get round back over to that side again sure i had a footstep there maybe not knew there was one there somewhere let's even get over there i've got the spas 12 on this one check that out yeah sniper out here would be great i just realized why it's called satellite as well because there's a big crashed satellite there it's like why is it called satellite we're not in space ah the shotgun there it is nice try that sniper smoke i say okay here suppress oh great shot turning on me come on revenge let's go yeah perhaps i should switch to a sniper i'm just getting sniped left right and center here we lost the hardpoint hardpoint lockdown i wanted it napalm stripe is jerusalem everything's on fire sure there was one here hey the ak is nice beautiful watch out [Music] okay can i get that that's what i want steal that guy's sniper someone coming through here hold this angle maybe nothing i thought they'd push through there located good job [Music] there's a guy there i'm just waiting for the peak come on let's go not too sure about the names above the heads i think they're a bit too big maybe spy planes up let's go in the back [Music] this guy here somewhere oh i'm stunned located please secure we're fine chopper gun is doing some work thanks for the work let's get to the middle behind us good shot to try and get a kill with this shotgun really shouldn't i how fast it fires oh you can just spam the crap out of that what the hell yeah they've definitely slowed down how fast you can throw stuns and grenades as well need a close range engagement here i want to test this shotgun oh okay yeah you can just click that so fast it doesn't appear to be a limit on it like you can just hair trigger it you can spam it wow that's a nice little head glitch there isn't it gg oh the okay it's fun enemies pick up player again oh a nice little slide in the shotgun beautiful very nice there we go game number three is done that would have been game number four but i missed one unfortunately ggs okay next let me do combined arms please this is the one that i want that's the one that i want right there how do you see chat i've got it disabled yeah the game's out in about seven weeks right so it isn't going to change much from this as far as i know the core gameplay is in there obviously really happy with where they've got it and what do you guys think so far in the chat what are your first impressions of this will you be playing the new war zone today i don't think there's anything new in warzone today as far as i know can you turn off health bars um you can have it so you only have the icon there's no field of view for pc no there is a field of view for pc mine's 87 [Music] yeah i mean apparently we're taking a little break now like a little five minute break but i can summarize how it feels to play it based on what i've because i've played about five hours now and i did talk about this in a video earlier today that i made when i was allowed to release it if you compare this to modern warfare it feels very stripped back and they've done that on purpose there's no attack sprint there's no mounting the level design is very old-school cod three lanes blocky you can't really do parkour and jump over things and get onto roost and that i think in terms of the animations and the graphics they're not quite as good as modern warfare especially the animations they look a bit they look a bit old-school if that makes sense i don't know if i if you get what i'm saying but modern warfare was very flashy and fluid and smooth this feels a bit staccato but stop start the gun play there's definitely less recoil in this game than in modern warfare and i enjoyed the fact that in modern warfare you had more recoil on the guns because they felt a bit more satisfying to use it's a very different cod game you you play modern warfare then you go and play this it's night and day honestly you guys can probably see that based on the gameplay and some people will prefer that because they prefer that old-school cod gameplay loop very arcade arena style gameplay whereas warzone and modern warfare i felt like they made a lot of advancements to call of duty they evolved the gameplay a bit they made it a bit bigger you had ground war the levels were more open you could create inventive routes for yourself and tactics but because the map design in this game and because of the type of gameplay it kind of feels like uh an old-school black ops game and they've done that on purpose again that's their choice i'm not knocking that i think that's fine some people love that style of cod game but to me i think i prefer the direction that modern warfare was going in where they actually evolved and it felt a bit more next-gen and the features were enhanced a lot so we'll see i think for me it's a case of getting used to it because i've been playing war zone in modern warfare for a year now and my brain is like this is how you play cod right now and then this comes along and goes actually no you have to go back five years and that's how you play cod now the audio design as well in this i like the footsteps i think the footsteps are great in terms of it being a game and gamifying things footsteps are brilliant i can tell where someone is above me below me left right wherever footsteps are great and that's a big problem with modern warfare and war zone but in terms of the ambience of the game in the audio and the graphics it's not quite on the level of modern warfare the user interface as well i i think it's too simple if that makes any sense i don't like the font that they've used again that's just preference but it looks a bit placeholder to me it could be placeholder now they say this is alpha gameplay but like i said the game's out in eight weeks so is that going to significantly change i don't know but it's all purposeful in my opinion they've done this all on purpose make it as simple as possible anything that might have confused players or convoluted the gameplay loop they've took it out and there was a bit of that in modern warfare i enjoyed the depth so some players might look at this and go you know what this maybe it's a bit of a step back overall but i want to show you guys the combined arms maps because this actually quite a big map that one it's got tanks on it and jet ski sorry not jet skis snowmobiles and i think there's a couple of trucks on there too but it's almost there like black ops cold war version of ground war but unfortunately there's only 24 players so you miss out that grandiose cinematic feeling that's how i feel about it anyway i'm sure some people will love this style of cod game i need to play it more though get used to the gun playing the movement because my brain is just fixed on war zone modern warfare show us the perks so i did show the perks earlier but i'll show them again if anyone is uh coming along new engineer attack mask flak jacket scavenger quartermaster tracker cold-blooded ghost ninja apparently there's a game starting saying let's i haven't oh it's just bugged right i'm really interested in the single player campaign though um about a month ago they did a remote presentation for some content creators and press and i was very lucky to be involved in that and they actually showed some campaign gameplay they've not released that yet for some reason but it looks sick they're doing some things in the campaign that they've not done in a cod game before where it's not just an action game where you go through cinematic set pieces one of the missions was kind of like hitman you know the game hitman made by io interactive you're in the kgp headquarters as an undercover us agent and you've got a series of objectives and you can choose how to do those objectives you can poison people you can bribe them you can interrogate them you can like do a bit of hacking and swipe a key card and change the the digital information on the key card all to get to a couple of objectives so there's a bit of choice there there was another mission which was kind of like far cry where again there were multiple objectives and you could choose however you wanted to to do it you could go in any order figure out what you wanted to do you could spot people with a camera that was interesting and there was another mission which was like a classic cod one where you're you go to this weird soviet union building and inside is a fake main town usa location with the street and cars and mannequin dummies and there's a like a video store a cinema a mall and the soviet union are using it as a training facility in case they ever decide to invade the united states and you go in there with woods and you infiltrate it and then it all kicks off it's very classic cod campaign with explosives and guns and you end up like on top of an armored car so they've got all these different styles of single player which i'm really interested in zombies as well zombie's a massive part of black ops but i don't think we've seen any of that apart from what they showed in the trailer today it was just a little snippet all right we're about to start again so i'm going to find out what game mode we're playing so they've had the short break yeah we're about to play guys i had to wait it's a live event so we're having to wait until they tell us to queue up because there's only a limited number of people playing the game do you play as mason in the campaign no you play as a soldier that you create you create a character mason woods and hudson are in the campaign though but you don't you don't play as them as far as i know you play as the guy that you create we're about to start guys i'm just finding out what game mode we playing next please be patient i did say as well that i was going to put the game on max graphic so we'll go ahead and do that we'll see what the performance is like [Music] special effects shadows weapon shadows i don't like motion blur so i'm going to keep that off subsurface scattering there we go right okay so we are queuing for vip escort on crossroads okay so this is the crossroads map but this game mode i'm not a big fan of are you sure your pc ain't finna crash [Laughter] i think i'll be all right i think i'll be okay what's my dpi 408 cents so this game mode for a bit of context i think it's their competitive modes i don't know if they're going to have s and d but simply put it's round based one team has a vip and they have to get the vip to one of two x-fil locations if you get shot you go down and you can be revived but if you are killed you have to wait till the next round so it's one life per round kind of thing but we played this a couple weeks ago i wasn't a big fan i have to be honest it just didn't i thought the map was too big the idea of a vip game mode where you can you know you can see the where the vip is and it doesn't work for me but i'll show you guys what i mean maybe we'll have a great game here we go did i not turn anti-aliasing on i thought i did it's a bit weird there's no music here either i feel awkward all right we'll do a snipe vip escort protect the vip until they ex-fill there you go 140 fps so you can ride these snowmobiles around if you want so we've got two extract locations a and b the vip is there and they have a a spy radar so they can pop that when they want they can pop the uav it's a much bigger map this one see if we can spot anyone i think all the enemies are over at a maybe well someone's doing a big flank right now it's just i don't oh i'm playing the game that's a bit disjointed i don't i'm not a fan i'm going to be real with you guys terminate the vip before they can expel so now we swapped around and we got to kill their vip but we don't know which ex fill they're going to straight away enemy spy plane inbound so he's popped their spy plane there probably not a good move this but i'll go and do it anyway get some high ground i don't see anyone over here all right they're over a the vip is commencing don't let them escape so there's no way i'll be able to get there now so they escaped i think the map's way too big i think that's the biggest problem for me it's not fast-paced enough switching rally points all right who is the vip protector uh you know what i'm gonna do i'm just gonna get on this i'm gonna go this way by myself to a and i'm just going to see if i can extract oh i'm so dead [Applause] oh he had like a ranetti or something look at that switching sides yeah this is uh it's not the game mode for me i'll say it up terminate the vip before they came to a last time didn't they are we gonna go b now knowing my luck i did see someone there so oh damn it so i think i downed the vip there i'm gonna get finished off here i just eat myself off the edge [Music] yeah this game was not the one it's not i said a naughty word nice shot there we go that's vip mode needs needs some work needs a lot of work that not a big fan of that let's see what's next i want that map on combined arms please a frag killed me the irony yeah yes it did is that the vip the only vip mode in this list yeah i think so i know there's miami as well oh don't ask us to play miami please yeah i just i don't think i'd have any interest in playing that game mode when it's released i'd much prefer if it was s d the small maps smd let the gameplay breathe a bit please m-16 i don't think i've done a m16 build have i have a look tactical rifle so there's no way to make it fully automatic fire it that kills your damage range you just put that one hmm so many attachments with this park don't want a suppressor on it i feel like i'm using the same build on all the guns okay just waiting further instructions now we'll be backing again soon combined arms combined arms combined arms come on let's go we don't get to choose unfortunately so so up to them they're running the live show so they've obviously got a a plan for what gamers we're playing use the second assault rifle as well that one that one looks sick actually that's probably going to be the meta rifle isn't it kind of looks like a like a fully automatic follows on me there's the boy is there a motion in the game not in this build now i'm trying to ask the next day artillery strike war machine okay not use that yet await further instructions everyone keeps asking to see the operators i feel like i've showed the operators like seven times is it based off an ak-5 is that what it is there is no sniper glint gus no snipers are going to be very strong in this game really strong someone has to look at the snipers again i'm upset that you can't see them i want to see what these things do but it looks like they're just locked until you've unlocked it you can't see what it does which is kind of weird i'd like to say bundle speed loader i think the attachments for the l96 are the same yeah they look like the same it's got the speed loader as well i'm still waiting on instructions here guys uh nearly ready to go come on let's start [Music] what of campers well i mean there's going to be campers in every game that you play in there's xerox it depends on your play style some people like to be defensive and hold angles and head glitches with assault rifles and sniper rifles other people like to run around with an smg like absolute mad lads it's all preference this this audio track is just burnt into my brain now that see will ground war 32 b32 vasi as far as i know it doesn't have ground war in which is a shame that's a step back from modern warfare definitely unless they're going to announce it in the future i don't know uh coney thank you for the five it's very kindly man come on come on come on i can't play something sebastian i have to wait there's only like 12 people playing the game [Laughter] and and we have to queue when they tell us to queue on discord i've got discord on my other monitor i can't play until they say play sorry they're taking ages for some reason i don't know if they've got a technical problem or whatever what's my thought on the operators they look a bit bland to be honest with you honestly i i'm not really into any of them you look at the operators in warzone and modern warfare and they've got a bit of character to them these just look a bit generic maybe my opinion would change once i played the single player but i feel like they've got to add a lot more than this adler's one of the main characters he looks cool the rest of them i don't know like that none of them are really doing it for me are there slug rounds in the shotguns uh don't think so i mean maybe later on in the unlocks magazine so that's your standard shot and then you can get a stanag but it doesn't say what that does so it might be slugs i couldn't tell you we just don't know or you can put this on there showcase weapon updated so where is the is the gun rack just here is that the gun you can just put whatever weapon you want on there the music sounds like avengers it doesn't sound like avengers to me i can't see any mastery cameras rogue recon i don't see anything like that so apparently one of the games is going on a lot longer than they expected it to the other game of vip must be a quite close game ready up and girls let's do gameplay is it going to be vip again i hope not come on give me that combined arms baby let's go [Music] you know when you've got a cold and you feel fine in the middle of the day but when you wake up and when it gets later at night you just start to feel like trash that's me right now i feel like trash i've got a headache my throat hurts my bones are throbbing i've got a bit of a fever it always gets worse towards the end of the day as well i must be some biological reason for that any scientists in the chat probably just to do with energy isn't it come on i'm still waiting for the instructions you know what i need i need a mcdonald's i think that'll fix it i think when i finish playing this i'll go get myself a large big mac meal with some fries and a strawberry milkshake maybe a couple apple pies or a mcflurry we are playing vip again by the way so maybe i could mess around and show you guys some of the gameplay mechanics i've not been sick for like nearly a year and ever since you know covered happened i've been so careful i always wear a mask not really seen anyone [Music] i guess you could you can just get sick really easily what's the meme with travis scott on mcdonald's is there some kind of promotion in the us that's not in the uk right now there's a travis burger is that he's actually got a burger in mcdonald's the cactus meal what does that mean why would you want to eat a cactus that doesn't make any sense what kind of burger is it right m16 i promise i'd use that [Music] very cinematic vip escort terminate the vip i mean this map looks quite nice on maxine's isn't it i don't know if those are real-time reflections but maybe i don't know if it's got ray tracing or anything all right so we've got dead teammates on the right there no one's coming down here oh dead like really i think if you want to enjoy this game mode you've got to be on comms with people like right i'll go a you youtuber b i'll play middle with a sniper vip go to a that kind of thing you know it's that kind of game mode it's a weird model isn't it it's got a knife a knife i don't like that smoke okay you want you want to go about the oh my god vip come back come back vip is taking fire that's done was horrible vip is taking [Music] fire gather yourselves brothers and sisters we're gonna see a huge play here oh he got the vip oh oh the jumping ak switching sights eliminate the vip before they reach the x-field jumper proximity line right i'll go put that down at a a yeah oh what's on there ruined that's an smg 100 yeah the 74u is like clearly the best smg in the game as well i might change to that other this one next round did i get a kill without i actually did get a kill with that proximity mine i think that's funny incoming flag come on deluxe let's go oh no he was flanked trimax reload there we go look at that fast mag that's nice i like the look of that yeah i mean the game looks alright on max graphics doesn't it i just it doesn't have the the detail that modern warfare has whether it's the texture quality the lighting or just the lack of things on the ground or i don't know the environment doesn't feel as real feels more gamy more like a game hopefully i'm making sense there we go all right we're gonna lose this for now aren't we again play the game no i don't want to be the vip uh i should go with my team really shouldn't i so the vip gets two stuns or two flashes a frag and some kind of listening device there i'm not sure what that is all right guys you're gonna have to we're gonna have to go somewhere right do you want me to follow you this is not let's get let's get to let's go b yeah let's go b this is a coco cabana here that's the end of that location there we go anyone want to quit yeah i do not like that game mode at all it's not it is not the one for me it's i don't think it's gonna be a fan favorite put it that way put it that way right guys um i have to be honest with you i'm i'm feeling pretty uh rough at the moment so i might end the
