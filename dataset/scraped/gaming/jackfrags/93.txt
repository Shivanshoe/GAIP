welcome to ghost wire tokyo big thanks to bethesda for providing me with an early access code to this today we are playing on playstation 5 in 4k in the quality mode and to get you up to speed without too many spoilers i suppose ghosts and spirits have taken over tokyo and we're playing as a guy who has a spirit inside of him called kk and he's just given us some powers and we're gonna leave it at that for now i think there's some ghosties over here that we can try and take out these guys so i can charge up attacks he's horrible look at him he doesn't even have a face then eventually if i do enough damage i should be able to rip that yellow thing out that's the spirit core and then that will banish them there's a couple more here too on here they are horrible that umbrella's not doing you any good mate is it oh my god i can dodge as well and also block i'm gonna stay down oh there we go grab the call oh the other one attacked me we nearly got it give me that some gorgeous particle effects and animations in this i don't know what this is i've not played this bit before atari gate [Music] i'm dr strange basically just think of it like that doctor strange fighting against ghosts that's the game some kind of unlockable in there is there is it it's your card you can still cleanse the gates oh yeah i can smash these things here and that gives me a bit of ghosty energy where's the dog i just heard a dog woof up here i must know if there's dogs and can you pet them oh it seems angry i don't know oh god i love that animation you stop it is he dead i think he's dead no he's not dead oh my god was horrible so what do we do with this then friends dogs turn them into spirits so the fog rolled over the entirety really interesting though it's such a unique concept tunes 42q some beats in there there's going to be a phone booth around here somewhere people still use phone booths or there's some spirit here can i help come to me spirits where's the dog doggo hey pet yes you can pet the dog [Music] good boy a lovely dog is it a shibenu i suppose the fog didn't do anything to the dogs then the dogs are fine just the humans and it led me to the phone booth look at that this is going to connect us to the matrix and we can send the spirits back in oh no oh he's the bad guy foreign [Music] he's already done some crazy stuff in the first chapter need to help as many spirits as we can 240 300 spirits doggo this looks awesome i've never been to tokyo i'd love to though i think i was planning on going in 2020 but that was ruined of course oh go see sprite see if i can show you guys the stealth take down oh no it is a bit scary sometimes definitely a couple jump scares that i've had already in the first section let's say you can go in the pharmacy [Music] it's a floating cat then that can talk what the hell hello a human in my shop very funny lots of good stuff i can trade for it have a look noodles yeah i'll get some dog food can i feed it to the dog cucumber you know what let's get some instant noodles why not okay and some red being a haggi that's it for now cat that's very strange [Music] oh you put a seal on it oh do i do this with the the pad [Music] okay so that's like little blocks it's basically unlocking an iphone isn't it put the code in give me that nice little shower bathroom here very good 10 out of 10 on tripadvisor restroom magnetic field measurements what is this guy doing whoa [Music] do you think he needs another screen or two what's in the box it's a bow let's get out of here maybe i can test this bow that'd be cool wouldn't it oh my god that's a dirty sink put the utensils away throughout the empty food and get the kitchen cleaned up before i get back you slob so someone lives with him then foreign outside the building oh no not pt not like this wait where am i oh my god underworld interference that looks awesome what look at those effects i've got six minutes to do this as well oh we're upside down that's unusual can i go this way no open the drawer the upside down drawer running on the side the wall now oh my goodness oh hang on wow go back outside that place is safe there we go what the okay [Music] that's a dead end is there anywhere else that i could go oh i can drop down here i'm to think about this in a different way than usual branch through here some goop on the wall yeah this is strange give me that hoover i'd like the energy inside it geez i think we got it we did it okay my spectral vision imagine if you could eat something or drink something in real life that enabled you to see ghosts if they exist would that be exciting or scary both maybe oh can sometimes be caught up in unchecked corruption you can use a spectral vision to uncover the source of the corruption and that's going to be all around the city a cat foreign i can read his thoughts i'm in a bad mood why are you in a bad mood cap what's wrong what happened i pet you no it doesn't want to be paid never mind really nice looking game isn't it it is only about 30 fps though on the quality mode maybe a bit less at times it does have performance options too but i've not tried those yet just wanted to play in 4k really get a sense of the graphics nice reflections here too oh i can grapple on to it hold l2 to aim at a tango and press x to grapple there's one there no that's a spirit it's an evil lad i graph on to all right see if we can kill these spirits up here i could glide as well lovely little headshot there i think we'll close this gate and then i have to end because i'm only allowed to do 20 minutes [Music] gonna pick this up again more the fog's gone good i'm gonna practice this glide i can actually just fly through there it's fine oh maybe not a good idea hi guys oh my god it's throwing things at me i don't like that can i take those out my bow back come here oh is that a one shot no you stay back slenderman i don't want anything to do with you [Music] okay he's gone i'll show you the stealth attack here it's pretty freaky i think we can do it on this guy oh let's get a good look at their face there though i've got to go up there that's one behind me oh cool lovely well i think i'm gonna have to end it here today guys so i'm only allowed to do 20 minutes like i said but thank you for watching gorgeous looking market here and another flying cat what more do you want guys let
