rifle yeah i do have a rifle these things can be deadly if you play them smart if you don't play them smart which is how i usually play you just drive them into a nest of enemies and die and that's me oh look at that the shinies in the rock i think i think that was a sniper or something come on fellow horsemen let's go definitely a sniper here it's quite difficult to hit i'm trying to be careful though like i said don't just want to throw it all away you know we can use the horse effectively as a tool of warfare horse of warfare that's it that's horse warfare right there horse fair they call it oh come on where's my team get with me i'm gonna be bombed on i oh my god go horse what are you what are you playing at boss the horse just wouldn't go i just didn't care anymore i need to go back

oh love that something about the iron sights in this game makes you feel something you know deep inside there's a guy with a mortar here i'm pretty sure those first two shots from that guy's head he's one of these well the music started now hello you guys got a scope ow ow stop b looks fun what should i go with did i make it i think i made it just in time i just switched to support as well machine gun and you want to get 26 bullets in this don't you we'll need to take this who's behind me come on seven seven seven two eight one two eight and pivo inside 45 we need to take this b point back right now it's our primary objective we don't get it the war ends we fail m1909 here sorry where's the crosshair it's really difficult to see then i wasn't sure which one was the crosshair seven seven eight one oh nine seven 778 109. we have to kill this man he seems invincible yes okay we got have we got b yet we've nearly got it lads come on we can win this look all we got to do is conquest assault isn't it that's it we just capture all their points and then they're ruined yes this is a turnaround this is it okay we just got to get d it's simple you capture the d no we haven't got c now what's happened i'm gonna put some pressure on see what do i have mines that's a horse oh you just stood there and took it didn't you i bet they were stuck right here put my grenade down let's go yeah on that objective lads take the point come on we can do this i believe just got to stop him getting b yes we kept shooting he as well man just literally went prone right in front of me there come to the objective get the beams on yes they're all trying to push up here i need some ammo put that down as well why not put all the things down hang on that's a timed explosive i thought it was a mile i thought it was an anti-tank mine such a dummy i need to play i need to play these older games more listen come on we're losing a i'm not going to stand for this look how close this is if we can get these last two points we can actually win this gotta stop him try and hit me again try and hit me again let's go i know you're there i know you're there yes getting this trench system a couple people here somewhere where are they friendly dead so if i can get behind them because they all came from d i might have a little flank here oh he was behind me look how close this is we have lost objective no we've lost e there's 10 tickets in it no it's all your fault plane die yeah that's right you bail out i don't care no defeat that was such a good game though ah it all seemed lost in the mid game you know i felt like we didn't have a chance but at least we came back we just couldn't capture that last point anyways thank you for watching hope you enjoyed this if you did leave a like if you
