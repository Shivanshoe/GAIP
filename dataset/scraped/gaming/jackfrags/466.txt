hi guys hope you're all doing well today i've got some call of duty warzone solo gameplay for you feels like it's been ages since i've played solo in warzone i've just been so focused on trios and quads getting involved with this crazy dmr diamatti meta that's going on at the moment playing with the boys having a lot of fun of course and finally we've got some form of communication about a balance pass for the game raven software just tweeted as i was recording this don't fret we've heard you and a balance update is coming soon to address concerns about the dmr14 type 63 mac 10 and dual pistols that is music to my ears hopefully that comes out this week i'd love to see it happen ladies and gentlemen we got him but back to the game now this solo game had an absolutely crazy ending no spoilers but something very surprising happened so make sure you stick to the end but i thought that i'd do a commentary over the top of this one didn't record my mic at the time but it turned out to be a great game [Applause] i dropped to storage here a couple of people fighting it was quite early so there's quite a few there and i just chucked the decoy out wanted to get this guy on the top hit him with that grounded grunt sir that i found grope sir is it gross or grosser most people say groza bought the uav there popped it i noticed the guy over here just holding the angle and they've started to run away so pop that dead silence off we go to see if we can get hold of them and they're in the building here so i just thought i've got dead silence i want to rush dude i had no idea i was there and then the bounty target comes over to me again bit of a distraction and they just stood there looking a completely different way and that has worked out great for me get the load out i thought that i'd go call of duty week one meta in this one so my first loadout is the invisible heartbeat center the m4 and the rpg and i'm being rushed by this dude and listen to the gunshots here like they just had no direction at all to me when i was playing it sounded like they were behind me to the left but the gunshots were actually in front of me above but we managed to take down brad pitt there continue on with the game so not a bad start really five kills notice dude on the left could have taken a shot there but i wanted to be sure and i thought i'd try again i must have been so close i ended up tagging the attacker rover behind that dude but i found myself a nice little roof in the zone right on the edge i thought i'd wait it out here picked up my second loadout on the way to hdr i told you it was a week one meter kept on strafing into me for some reason got the down unfortunately no air strikes so we'll leave that one i stuck around on the same roof though notice the movement that's the guy that i just took a shot at at the airport ramp tagged him once missed that one and just as they're going over the edge got the down but again self-rest no air strike so two kills that i missed there because i didn't have enough cash surprisingly so far in this game i don't think i'd come across someone with a dmr maybe i was just getting lucky i'm trying to make a move to the next zone before the people do and i spotted a little guy here up in the woods rushed that first shot a bit a little flick shot for the second and i wanted to confirm this kill so i thought i'd push i'm trying to keep my eye on the rock because they're going to be self resting behind that rock right but i want to get the high ground on them so instead of just rushing straight towards them when they've got cover on that rock i went a little bit to the right got the high ground ended up behind them fine he's going to expect me straight in front crack the armor put the pressure on with the sensex they start plating up straight away make a run for it take him out and i just had a quick look to my left there as i swung back i noticed a bit of movement dude wasn't happy but i think that was the guy from the airport ramp again who i should have killed earlier in the game it's kind of nice to just screw the meta though just go completely off meta the trusty old m4 which i think is still pretty good as for the hdr it's got to be my favorite sniper in the game so satisfying to use i do think it's a close race between this and the spr though [Music] but this guy had a little fight as they came running out of the airstrip and turned around got a couple shots on him finished eventually and then i got shot in the back that must have been a sniper rifle now check this out this is weird there's attack rover on the mini map driving parallel to the train and it looks like they just get out there so i'm thinking well where's this dude going he must have jumped on the train i'll be behind it and there's nothing no one there i don't understand so either they were killed by the train somehow or they just all effort and the car carried on going i don't know it really confused me though but as i was over there someone rushes up on me here i'm in trouble here but using this cover as much as i can go pro try to be as unpredictable as possible close fight that was close fight he must have shot me in the leg there with the car 98 i think but i know that there's still a sniper out there looking at me and what i'm doing here is moving location where he can't see me i'm going to pop up where he doesn't expect whack-a-mole they probably thought that i'd be on the left side there where i first crouched but i used the cover went round to the right and then there's a dude up on the hill who just starts beaming me fall back i just waited there for a sec crossed over the chasm the valley keeping an eye on that area get the heartbeat out looks like i was up there it's been wary of him they rushed down the hill it wasn't the greatest play there out in the open but i think they were trying to get in this building next to me but i believe i heard someone yeah i can hear him running around there i thought they were gonna come through this door right there but they didn't then there's a dude at the top get my eyes peeled switch the hdr he gets in a fight wait for the shot [Music] love the death comes so good you just can't believe it and here's where the crazy thing happens so i'm holding this wall there's only seven people left pretty decent spot really that guy must have been a goo lager quite late in the game though but i reckon they were hanging in the air for a while dmr shots on the right shooting the guy in the car i think i fancied my chances so i held the wall got the hdr out and i was going for the headshot there i missed it jumped up so they couldn't run me over crack the armor and then i get shot in the back the guy gets out of the jeep i'm thinking well they've just got cover now so i'm gonna be okay here getting railed in the back by this dude tack rover saves my ass doesn't know it's me whoever was driving that attack rover you're the real mvp you saved my life there buddy i was so upset at that point so i was like i've got pretty decent gameplay here shot in the back attacker oversaid my ass that guy was camping in the shed there pretty much the whole time wait for them to climb that m4 does bounce around a bit and that's the 1v1 i'm going to get the high ground probably the best circle bounce i could have got so i've got a head glitch here on the roof spot i'm in the market i'm just being very patient waiting for this one and then i get killed by an airstrike i'm just kidding i've got this gun locked comes out crack the armor in the gas that's big trouble for that dude and that's the victory solid game that was but i've really got to pay my respects to the attack rover guy because without them i wouldn't have even posted this video so whoever you are thank you so much and with that said that's all for today guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike
