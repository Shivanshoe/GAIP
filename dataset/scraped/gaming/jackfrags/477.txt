hi guys and welcome to among us this is gonna be good i've only ever posted one other video or one of the stream on my channel playing this game before and i thought as it's christmas it is the season of party games and uh this could be good fun so we've got 10 people together or usually play within in the videos and uh we're gonna have a good time today uh also big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this one today we'll be playing on geforce now and this is a platform that you can use to essentially cloud play gaming so you can use this on multiple devices an old laptop for example if you wanted to play cyberpunk with ray tracing and dlss or hell let loose or assassin's creed valhalla apex cs on an older device that couldn't necessarily natively run those games or you can use geforce now and it will be available to just play straight away and um if you're interested in checking out for yourself it is free the basic version of it is free and you can click the link in the description below and have a crack at it there's plenty of free games to try on there as well but today we are going to be focusing on among us i'm really looking forward to this it's going to be good so without further ado we're just going to click here play and that should load up the game straight away and this will ask me to sign into my steam account and then we should be good to go join the lobby so today we're playing with the two angry gamers we're playing with tomographic had slacklin freeman part welsh remag johnny and the tactical brit so there's a lot of lads in there there's gonna be a lot of banter it's going to be good fun i'm looking forward to it right here we go let's do this online uh so i think we've got a gamer it's on north america as well right i can't paste the code in so i've just got to type it in there he said hey there's player all right i'm in oh jack oh lovely he's the player i am the player he showed up why did you have to get yourself players i just didn't change my name i'm just player it's just defined let's go i'm purple that's all you need to know that's already a little bit of stuff mike muted he's a bit of a player this might be okay so i got imposter straight away now i haven't played this for a little while uh so you'll have to forgive me so i have to pretend to do the tasks someone's going to react to meltdown already easily answers around here as well and to do some tasks that's fine everything's fine there's hunts should we kill hans simple i don't think anyone saw me oh i might go and find the body there uh i can sabotage in any second okay dead body classic oh i've got no sign thinking it was so eerie i hear that what's going um i found hats in the electric room i'll be honest i wasn't really paying attention to who's coming in and out of it i just walked in there freedom instead as well though i was with bong and lee mike reemac was coming from park bong was going the other way so bong i'm a bit suspect of i can vouch i can vouch for johnny i don't think it's him at this stage but past both of us didn't he coming from the fence he did but he was saying that bong's yes because i've just gotten into electrical and body yeah yeah i didn't pass you so i went south past the south reactor room right from there no someone picked it someone passed me i just don't remember it was i thought that's the only street well chat i saw jack run past me from the from the uh lower engine is that anything i didn't even see you that round that would be something yeah you did i saw you well i i all i'm gonna say is i was on the panel at the top trying to make sure the reactor didn't melt down yes i saw you doing that i saw johnny do the other one i came in to do it i had him as well i had a bong floating around me oh yeah i i am suspecting i'm sorry what are you talking about floating around christmas eve what'd you vote have you been overlapping latland's convinced me who can meet you with what time he says he's floating around he's seeing floating bongs so yeah i just yeah a little bit that's what i'm saying well i didn't even see you that round one you did you did play oh remax though from lachlan i know yes i'll skip [Music] maybe it is johnny couldn't beat me i was with you all right got away with that one i don't like the fact that lee i mean lee's gonna give us away here so could do a sabotage i'll say i'm going to pretend that i'm trying to fix it got a kill order here as well they've got that that was tommy and johnny are they not are they not like going to fix it or what where's the other one i don't i don't need to pretend that i'm an imposter to leave because lays the other imposters so i can't do another sabotage gonna okay all right it's dead it took us way too long right right you called them in no i did jack and lee uh well tactical bro as well why did no one go for the oxygen you all right i did but you were there already so i didn't do with thomas i ran past you and went in to do it i'm leaving right behind you well lucky can't really defend himself dude i got it with one second to spare i yeah when i was with you johnny i was like go jolly go go i saw you two there and i i just went for the other one absolute nonsense jack absolutely nice i i did i saw johnny but if i was the imposter i would i would go and fake it wouldn't i you would yeah you would or would you if you knew to do that at the time yeah hang on here's the thing the six of us left do we truly believe that bong was one of the imposters because otherwise it's going to be a very easy win for the last two people here tommy you did a bit of a dart towards me at one point yeah well i thought you were going to kill me so i was oh no that's what i thought you did but i'm now feeling like johnny's convinced me i think it's jack well i thought it i i saw it so you two were on the you two were on the thing so i just went for the other one but you didn't go through what's the point of me being there well because i just i don't know the thing is if there's two of us if there's two murders left we're ruined we have to go have to vote someone out is quite sydney lee did he wasn't you weren't going for the o2 lee i don't even know what that means and he's playing on his phone i didn't have a thing for the o2 what everyone in the game decision probably will damn it i don't like i should have just said nothing like i gave myself away didn't i lit i should have just played it like they did and just uh didn't say anything i can't believe i didn't sell it i can't believe it devastated johnny's running around with an egg on his head as well now i nearly i think i nearly pulled that off though i nearly pulled it off they've only thing is right lee could actually lee could actually do this because there's not and there's not that many players left and they've still got a fair few tasks to do um can i help yet no i can't where is le there he is we're going to follow lee he's got a little robot dog i don't know why he's just done like if he just keeps he needs to get a kill oh god well i'd have to call it because um well well here's the thing there's uh well i don't know i thought had the opportunity to kill me and didn't tom will have the opportunity what color is your name and why is it red i'm yellow what color is your name and why is it red well he's trying to get him with the old yeah he doesn't know the game everyone's used white to either tom was on a big brew and fix the lights that he broke fine possibly tommy tommy's done a big bree in a cold meeting i would have just killed someone by now if it's me and just finish the game because if it's two people left and it don't need i actually think we've got i think one we've got one of the killers i think it was bongo jack but i said i think there's one song so you johnny that came into lights then yeah the end to fix it because i don't want it bothered and it pissed me off yeah no it took forever for the cfx i was in the fuel to the right of it in storage i i know it's not johnny 100 i'm not sure about tommy still because i don't know where was the corpse foul we didn't even find a question because i was scared the game is about to end because if there's two killers left and someone you only need to get one kill so i think he's very quiet no we can't even we have to we have to vote someone don't worry i just think and very good [Music] for no reason listen i mean [Music] remember to press start straight away presumably jack jag isn't jack right no no i'm player all right can you change it before you join no just uh join again is it the same code yeah yeah yeah it's just because someone joined um hey hey please stop joining us hello right away so that no one gets a chance uh although that guy to be honest got him pretty quick well okay is that everyone is that actually yeah 10 10 let's go wait yeah you have the code visible on your stream yeah i know but that's because i couldn't be honest oh man right i don't want to die raymond i don't like i don't like freeman's really good at this game he's very good at pretending there we go that's complete that has is looking to us already i don't know why there's just something something about the way he was moving there go down to storage okay we're gonna fill this up yeah it's done and then we have to take this over here don't we i'll do two of these though haven't seen any bodies yet ah i get so stressed i get so stressed i called it because i find i think it's tomo in electric no i don't even know i haven't got to listen i i look i did what i did last time to bonnie i'm going to say it again remag you're floating around people maggots i'll tell you what i was doing i went out because i saw uh johnny was in there and i wanted to see if he was gonna you ain't what i'm hearing here is the navigation room and i i went back where's the body it's electric i mean it couldn't it i walked down the right hand side of the map i passed with johnny and reemag were both like looking at each other so i thought i'd look at you guys as well i was suspecting both of you i'm not yeah the trash at the bottom yeah then i seen re mad go to the button but he was no he was standing near it but not really on it and no trash came out remote so explain yourself what are you doing there what do you mean no trash came out well you didn't press the trash i'm not sure he could have got the electric in there this has not been a good discussion mate i know this is not good for you guys didn't kill tomorrow i know that i know that for sure because he didn't get too electric i was with him the whole time i was good did you see anyone because i went back to the room half the people out and make sure that we get two of those let's throw you out then well that's nice democratic isn't it i'm not sure if it's building a lot of you all voted today i'll say that i don't know i don't like me because he was obsessed with me i know that reed man didn't kill thomas i know that that's all you know i know tommy was sassing me so it's not tommy i played this game i'm gonna skip i'm skipping because i haven't seen anything can i just say though jack did say we're all gonna die at the start of the game yeah that's his jackpot this was me i'm very dubious about lachlan now very very genius about that okay three foot six 92 pounds green big absolute big lad what is my task down here i mean i'm i no i don't tommy was a bit so sad lee i've not seen lee at all this round that's the first time i've seen it that is the first time that i've seen lee i trust johnny because he called the body i don't think johnny would do a double blur oh my i knew it it was it was lachlan it was lachlan he just came right it just came out of nowhere tommy please help me find my body someone find my body who's the other one then freeman maybe freeman hasn't said much go on tommy get in there get in there get in there get in there find the body what no he didn't see the body no okay that's good found there i found a body to stop the stop the oh teeth oh my lord where are we around but i just saw jack going towards electrical on these night dead i think it's freeman on the camera sadly jack and freeman's colors they're just both green to me they don't look like green and dark green but i don't know which type of green it was i just found i think it was freeman on the on the camera room was awfully quiet i don't think it's really i'll tell you why because he's muted he's just shouted at the camera i don't think it's not anymore i would suss at first but i don't think it's really bad i was just trying to reprimand for like say because he usually just talks over people i was saying i was trying to say i'm letting tommy talk he's just shouting at the camera that's a big play big big mike player like that right here's the deal here's the deal chaps we need to vent someone because uh we've all been killers where's the body did you see it on the camera on the camera room he was on the camera's room i don't think jack had time to get to the camera room i don't think it is jack's dead he's near electric that's dead i don't know the only person i don't think it is i know it's not me where are you if we have an alliance we can invent whoever we like well johnny's sneaky though isn't he could be him who knows well it's not me because i would have killed one of you right it could it could yeah we did tommy and remag or tommy and johnny we have to vent someone and i'm very lackland as well all right tommy done i think tommy's trying to force the agenda that's fine well everyone completely well then everyone quite quiet as well right soon yeah i actually think they've lost this round now i think i can't believe that he wasn't kicked off then like why hey i mean he even flipped and said um i'm pretty sure it's not rebag now like he actually sold that one okay here we go right hello let's try this again someone has to go out otherwise we're going to lose the game in 30 seconds someone has to go out here there's two killers in here um if you vent me you've lost how do you know because no one's gonna absolutely look like nothing and then just jumped on the top he found a wagon i think that's so sauce it's literally was you because you have actually not you've done anti-floating since thank you very you much you haven't seen him he has been dedicated to time right he's been busy killing other people well i don't know about that well i can't i kept a good good idea are we getting leo are we getting tactical well it's one of those but why not if they vote tactically again they're gonna like tie vote it and then we're ruined all right well let's just get it pick quick okay but it's great to lose the game i know if you vote me a rematch we lose i know that so it's it's up to you i'm called lachlan if it don't say now we can't say because people will tactically because everything's just saying no because people just listen [Music] if they tactically vote now that we've decided okay if black lands mainly unveil his vote johnny so i had to go with him but otherwise we can't go back oh god this is sass maybe it is someone has to go out don't they there otherwise go are you gone anyway you're gonna know in space probably i think it's yeah sus isn't it i can't believe that lachlan has actually how has he got away with it for that long is it he's not even convincing did they add shapes to this i think they did for colorblind right oh god here we go again right i just want to try to [ __ ] do this upload i just want to say i want to say yeah i've seen born go to that place twice now because i'm trying to travel did you know i'm gonna have time the first time no i won't be good this year i started uploading okay uh i don't know if we should vote anyone here i feel like that was absolutely the thing here's the thing i've got about three tesla it's all on the left side of the map i've got one i've got one this is my last task i'm sure that their people are doing their tasks aren't they dead people i've still got i think i've still got two i saw everybody commit to one room there so i don't think this is worth voting for i went completely opposite direction well that's a bit i think tactical brit then i mean no no i just don't know because we have to vote i think we have to vote just vote don't we well we'll remake you vote whoever you want to i mean everyone just vote what you feel in your heart and then all right i feel like voting for people at this stage would be stupid well either we're about to die anyway because there's two killers left or what well yeah but we we had suspects before i don't know how if we've got two uh two bad guys there's two bad guys pretty much dead anyway so yeah unless we vote one off now that's what i mean but if you've only got one bad guy left it's pretty hard for them and just get on with your tasks oh my god people breaking me i put oh my god what are they doing stop please i swear to god if i can't do this god damn task okay all right it's done it's done it's fine if lachlan wins this like it's gonna be the throw of the century it will literally be the throw of the century i purposefully let i let them hear me groan then as well i didn't have myself muted for that oh how did you not vote enough i can't understand how you did it blended in well sometimes you you had a suspicion it was like early on and then you voted i know like on the vote gave himself away in the first round because they were they were split voting it down to three three i was sure it wasn't johnny and remo so i was like well if they're split voting it we have to go with who you're convinced that's exactly why you did it level ten play from me and bong there because we were i think it was level smooth play from everyone else yeah we were quite smooth yeah i don't think it was a particularly good play for us three times in a row i think that exactly because of smoothness was that it was that tactical mic meeting or was it just accidental no no fully accidentally because i just wanted to secure the safety right let's try not to get murdered straight away that'd be good i'm going to scan myself yeah oh no it's not the skin i'm gonna put some blue stuff in vials you don't need to wait okay so will that just be ready soon i guess 46 seconds elmo looks like he's it's fine i'm gonna go with the cameras that's cool britain johnny up there on my age there we go bloody hell that's quick that is really cool is he first every time yeah yeah navigation yeah so lee's dead in there i mean lots of people ran that way rematch and sponge were the last two people i thought so basically i've just ran up from the southern shields and then gone and done leaves with you tommy i saw bong in the room and remag run into that room as well so yeah yeah i ran out freeman no i never came into the room no i know you didn't so i ran out saw you in the corridor went past lee who was also in that corridor pasto too i think there was somebody else in o2 at the time with freeman right yeah can i just suggest that we get rid of anyway no you can't just kick people for the sake of it because he's the third imposter all the time get rid of him right now just two imposters to start with that's it but i went i went down towards shields i saw freeman coming up right and then back up three mangled bomber the only one to navigate it could be freeman or it could be bomb who have you guys voted for i've voted remotely i wasn't even in the room near your heart i didn't even go in there i'm going to go through my passion because i just i think free oh my god we've made a great mistake third imposter's gone like johnny said at least if he's actually imposter keep an eye on bong that was sus tom the way that tomographic said that no i don't know i don't know hdr spr oh no no johnny it's fine i'm just gonna do this i'm gonna let johnny handle that oh my god did johnny think that was weird what's bond no bong bong there that was that was dodgy that was proper dodge the way that bong just stood there looked at us i'm gonna stick with johnny i trust johnny he's safe let's go around and do tasks together johnny come on you know you wanna you know you trust me don't oh god here we go i don't like it stop following me it's just you know like no one's dying was ejected wasn't he so no no one's died are you complaining to me yeah because i trust you i trust you it's terrifying the person i don't trust is bonk marinating why are you trying to throw me under the buster i know what you're doing bonk i don't know what you're doing trying to help with o2 me and johnny why don't i have the cage part i was in navigation i didn't see tommy in navigation and then i did i'll shut up that's all i'm gonna say oh my god i walked in did a task walked outside your task on the wall i know what you're normal vents you vents on among us good lord anyone gonna say i saw i don't know it is my choice of that i saw you doing your task as normal as i walked past you after doing a task and navigation that's it fair okay i saw nothing else of note i saw no lingering or looking just when i'm stuck i was a bit late because it was done quite quickly and johnny and jack were there when i got there why are you surprised i could support jack stalking johnny yeah but i i had plenty of opportunity to kill you johnny didn't i are you now trying to kill jack i was in a room with jack by myself and he 100 could have killed me but i didn't get killed does that happen for freeman because me and freeman weren't reacting was doing simon says what's going on here the way that you said no events tommy maybe no one does that right so tommy knows that i'm just yes good job see johnny it was just trying to it was what was it was it play again play again it's basically one versus and i [ __ ] killed someone so it's a bit stupid really because we i just like i went in a bit i was hoping that like bong would kill the next person that came in so guys are we all in is this all the correct people yeah it's hard to be able if i don't get killed instantly i'll instantly be accused yep well let's just let's do a rule where we we give there's no [Music] here we go okay pretend to do the tasks i'm gonna play it safe this time i need to sell it don't i i could kill hans again we got three people i don't know if johnny's got a kill yet is anyone down here come over to me will come over here oh i don't know if johnny's got a kill i really hope he has because they've done like 30 of the tasks i don't want to give the game away oh they've done it nice big brains there she's been too long we all went for that yeah no one said oh wow but there's no reason to do anything then i'm to say let's just have a lovely chat and talk about yeah hello hello that's good tell us what have you been up to i've got my voice back do we vote should we space ads i'm just throwing i've been watching the cameras i can say that freeman's had multiple opportunities to kill people and hasn't so i think he's the least sus out of everybody well everyone has this way you're trying to follow people around like you just follow me around like it's really weird you should be doing that i know it's like it's like i walk past the building he goes oh i'm going to stalk you for a bit though yeah i did see lackey at the end of my street the other day i don't think it's bong he did the card uh i did the bottom o2 i'll say that could be myself was on the cameras mostly on cameras yeah i dropped off a sample had to wait 60 seconds so i was on the camps i would have definitely killed someone in round one that's what i can see i wouldn't have failed you know yeah everything makes me think it's you i'm skipping no no i'm during the 02 panic at the end there the only person who didn't even make a move or wasn't seemingly doing a task was tommo uh i did simon says and then i went up to uh it could be something a lot of you kill instantly and i know that some people don't and those people who don't kill instantly are lee and jack that's all i was saying it's kind of a risk not too though isn't it really right i need to take frame out because then i can kill freeman they're gonna think it's tomographic what do we do here i don't even know what you do oh no one went down there no went down right i don't know why i went to the meeting thing but freeman's been silenced oh my god who was on the right side of the map because freeman was just on shields i i just thought there was a lot of people there come on i saw jack kill he didn't talk enough i saw jack you saw jack kill freeman i have i saw jack in the moments before the game ended so where was he he was on shields freeman died on shields yeah i saw jack are you just trying to throw me under the bus again i wasn't there no no i had i had the will before yeah i ran across saw the fog of war i saw i was look deliberately running around to make sure i got view of everyone and i saw that i saw you running around there was like five of us at the bottom in columns for ages and then i went up with tommy jack if that's the uh you're saying that you saw him kill him you actually saw that i saw i saw you're just trying to will this is absolutely right because i didn't know exactly someone else might try and kill me so you're saying that will is actually fabricating the entire thing and that's it there's no no he's picking on me i was with bung if someone goes again but i i was in i was in admission okay i was with bonk i guarantee is accusing jack really early and tomorrow just silently sort of agreed with him and voted no longer no i literally said i was the first to talk good you made the right call first to talk lucky discovered okay right it's not remag i don't think it was rematch either just so clear because i hadn't seen freeman's body but what happened was i was on shields and walked away from it to go into comms then went back to do a task in navigation no the last last round freeman died last round on shields yeah so there was like a five to ten second period right before the meeting got called last round that freeman was dead it was was killed and jack was in the bottom right so in the first round tom freeman was really sassy okay so rematch let's see it was the recap remax said he saw jack kill freeman and you're you're clarified absolutely yes okay so if if that happened why didn't he report why did he report it instantly yeah why didn't he report and when he was reported why was jack in the description i have this is what i'm saying i was on sh so listen i was on my shield that's why we're here i finished shields and went into columns freeman walked past me and was on shields so when i when i went up to navigation the meeting got called which meant freeman had been killed on stream you're just trying to get rid of him though thomas suspected you in the first round i'm voting tomo because he's the last person the smart player would be there if you're killed on shields were to go into the vent right by shields i feel like from the body foreign i have a gameplay question now that you've all voted um i keep getting this little arrow pointing me at the wi-fi thing wi-fi the download or the upload uh i don't know like one of the download few different ones upload i don't know depending on what pops up i can't interact with it though oh my god justice he's been doing justice he's talked to him i think you've made a mistake christ you've made a mistake it's jack i'm telling you it's jack wait i can't believe i got away with that i can't believe i got away with that all right there i think i'm gonna get voted off next round though although johnny is playing this really well so i i do think we're gonna win it's just um will johnny be able to pull it off tommy's gonna suspect that i don't know if he's running up for the meat in there as was quite suspicious of me before so i'm just gonna follow him maybe he'll trust me stick together in a big group i've nearly done all the tasks i need johnny to get some kills jesus oh it's so jack that's i had plenty of opportunity to kill her right i just found lee's body in electrical pads and jack ran past there i i ran back down from storage and then up into electrical and then there was a dead body here's the good news we spaced one of the killers oh we think we did but um oh no we know we must have right oh no no no no we can't no yeah you're right okay it could still be two unlikely though i'd say so i don't think i saw i saw jack leaving the middle bottom whatever that is where the fuel can is that area as i was going up the engine so i haven't seen anyone for ages i was in med bay by myself jack was following me like i saw him following the dagger yeah no right keep sticking together i was suss of john i don't know so i was running around just waiting to see if he'd move he just followed me around the entire map for at least 20 seconds it's jack i think it's jack and bong i think it's jack and johnny and the reason i think it's jack and johnny is i i don't think it's tom and bong's had chances to kill me which means i think it's jack why do you myself report going on here i feel like i could feel it to be honest can we all just agree that jack is one of them no but why haven't i plenty of opportunity to kill you i haven't seen him stuff so i can't i can't comment well that's because you know the other killer is johnny and it's yeah and you'll know that you'll instantly win if you go by jack is that why you're happy to estimate if you vote me you'll lose we need to vote someone if you don't vote jack we'll lose [Laughter] oh no this could be a loss today this could be a big loss i think i think johnny's got this yeah i had to take one for the team there i had to take one for the team let's see what he does he's got a there's no one there though it doesn't matter that he's there leave it johnny leave it don't do it okay he did it all right that's going to convince bong but tommy's waited always waiting for johnny to get a kill tommy knows it's johnny i think he knows oh god there's a game being played here and i don't like it johnny just spent the whole round chasing me oh [ __ ] i think you chased me okay this is definitely bunk surely that's why he called them me i i was just a little bit nervous to be honest well here's the thing i did [Music] this is such nonsense basically you thought i think i think bong is actually i think he's actually throwing himself out there airlock there with that i reckon i reckon they're going to vote a task so i thought well i'll just stick with these guys then to see what i feel i was waiting for one of you to finish one of your tasks two meters social distancing and let me do reactor that's my final task are you why did you run past the reactor because you're scared yeah yeah because both of you were chasing me if either one of you was the killer like again you should have made it to my kid okay look i'm very happy to space long here but it could be i think it's johnny johnny no because then you see split vote there's no point doing that listen it's a bum come on i promise it's not me hats it's got you've got 60 seconds to convince me uh i had multiple opportunities throughout the game to kill you when we were alone this is true this is true and it's not me i've been the killer like [Music] the content i've got one task left i didn't have that's all i'm okay here's the thing all right i don't we don't this is technically not allowed but look are you happy to go task grouping then is that what you're saying well i'm fine to do that yeah i think tom's trying to [Music] i trust that judgment as well johnny there's no point doing a split vote i got absolutely done there well played thank you for that absolutely done by the sheer love if you have any hard evidence in this game your immediate i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry i just want to see some passion well i want to see i want to see some i was muted out of the ship for calling on jack i'll be honest you generally didn't do the touch because you were scared i ran off he'd have killed me no i would have i would have stuck with you two hundred percent then i was always well i can't be sure of that can i because we can't communicate totally you got blind lucky he's what he's saying well done well i can't believe don't go away with that yeah you saw two people being killed each round as well i hope the ghosts are doing their tasks by the way i feel like the tasks weren't being uh yeah i did i did again three three times already i'm getting lucky with the imposters though i need to get rid of the smart ones what's happened late i found a body in storage by the fuel petrol can i didn't see anybody else around it's a brave kill petrol store the storage room yeah that's playing the room at the very bottom on the actual fuel canister on the actual fuel canister because that was where i had to go and you didn't see anyone else come out of the room or i didn't see anyone else the entire round oh why did you why did you say cafeteria then or was that something else that's what i mean it's called okay i just went straight over to reactor if anyone's interested i guess not oh so i'm not saying one of those can't be the the but they were the one that killed lachlan is this did you kill themselves it could have been sweeper johnny i feel like it's a really bold place to kill someone on the petrol test kill maybe thought oh maybe i should have done that here's another thing was this was this uh this wasn't a meeting not really defending yourself i don't know i thought it was no i don't think i'm skipping by the way please what this is i've got nothing i genuinely didn't see anything i didn't see a single person my entire round what about the what about these accusations that you may have killed and reported accidentally with the touchscreen well let's just keep an eye on it i guess i didn't even know you could self-report that's exactly what a self-reporter would say i've got nothing i'm skipping i'm very happy to skip we don't have enough evidence no well enough evidence for you oh donny there i i was casting his stone early johnny said for freeman i'm good i've called it straight in on freeman did i pull that off i think i pulled it off where the lights did you see who was above the body johnny no i went to fix the lights and i just saw you running around i think it was your friend who else was in there with the remag then where's the body reported come on can i have the evidence it's been electric i went to fix the lights and i was like i was in the electorate he was leaving jack's reported here did you both press reports you were up there though you were the only other person in there jack can't be the imposter for the third no no johnny there's two other people in that room at the top that's that's all i'm saying sauron lee can vouch for me because we were both doing tasks at the top of electrical well i was doing tasks yeah and all the [ __ ] you were doing was dead at the bottom of electrical so between the three of you so what was the reason i was in the stop i didn't see anything i was at the top guys guys guys wait listen you know in lord of the rings the two towers and they blow up the wall that helms deep and they put the bombs in the little nook at the bottom and they have the really dramatic torch bearer guy runs forward and jumps in it and then guys like bring him down legolas and all that all of the orcs at the front line have um flame torches right why don't just one of them just just walk forward and just let you know what's that got to do with it no i just thought it was interesting i i just everyone just votes for me i just have to not speak i think we've cleared this up who i i don't even know i'm just going to skip ladies and gentlemen we've got the votes speak for themselves johnny it's gone it's gone it wasn't me johnny i did not kill that body i didn't do it i did not i did not hit her [ __ ] reminds like that wasn't my fault like i didn't really have a choice oh god that's annoying so annoying ah man i was just wrong players wrong time if will hadn't killed uh who did he kill who's dead tonight where is he where is he on the map i wish i could see i wish i could see the other imposter on the map should he just iced him yeah but then lee would have reported the body i think remax killed lee where was it uh in navigation and i couldn't even see the body but the report thing started flashing up there there's a dead body of navigation electric hearts tommy and tommo in the bottom left fairly recently so yeah unless do we know we're pretty sure i mean johnny's you're you're pretty adamant it was jack was a killer well let's just be honest with johnny though he's a sneaky bugger so he could have he could have said he could have said he saw jack do report but he could have been the one that killed and then jack reported it so there's another theory true but why would i again yeah that's true googy in theory not how i play but good go on tell me your response to it i'm not well i'm okay but i'm just saying that is something that could have happened so it might not have been jack like i i i knew it wasn't why would you dance around johnny originally put the blame on jack and remax so remind me trying to deflect here we're in a six-person scenario and we don't know if we've got the killer so yeah we kind of have to play something like that i think remaking johnny the most source right now you just go for me every time johnny johnny's seeming quite successfully get it right between johnny and remag i'm going johnny let's see if it if it's not me remember it's remy guys remember it's remarkable just remember that that's true [Music] who are you voting for everything it's like i'm like an easy free for me it's remark next right guys next round just remember let's get a win over oh god i voted johnny but afternoon we don't wanted to vote for him so no but we don't even know if jack was guilty so you know i think this might be a death i think this might be an imposter win how did freeman get away with that how did he get away with that i can't wait to tell johnny that i didn't kill killing that uh electrical no that looked a bit suspicious what will did there follow me around and see how he plays this i think tommo knows this remake though no don't do it don't do it don't do it oh just just stood on the vent look tommy and tomorrow are sticking together as well turn off the lights okay he's just killed red there i think that was perfectly timed there with the kill maybe that's helped quite a lot he's not he's not trying to fix that though i know where he's gone who's there he's probably up here that's farmer they probably trust each other now as well who the hell is that that's it's that's [Music] i mean i think tommy and thomas so it could be did run past me though i think it could be johnny is one of them that's my dead doesn't matter he's dead no no that's why there was only one kid but we don't it doesn't matter we know there's only we know there's one killer left because there's four of us here and we're overall the king would be over here um listen so me had yeah sadly you're the only one that wasn't running in a group now that could be a big play from i want to say tomorrow someone if they yeah i did break off in the end but um and the lights went out and i lost you and ads you know i've still got two more tasks to do so i think we've got no no i think we've got one task left i've done all mine i've done all mine i've gone online i've been waiting at the the well you got that remote what's up i've got the the one in navigation i don't know what it's called i don't know i don't know what else i'm not a [ __ ] wizard and then i've got one in uh reactor still yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna we'll see what happens get a wizard hi there we go see i told you mark play again again i'll probably get someone in johnny i didn't kill you in that room you were dancing on a corpse yeah but i didn't kill him will killed him remag actually saw me accidentally under the river who was the other one in the room and then we could both take no but we couldn't because johnny literally ran in as you killed him i didn't have a choice [Laughter] sometimes it could be a good opportunity to get two kills and then sneak off it's just um he's the imposter on the imposter team it would have been big brain it wasn't [ __ ] so jack could have killed john quantum imposter yeah but lee was at the top and he just would have ran down he could have just ran away and it would have been fine we could sell all right quick scopes i want to be impostor again i would like to get a winner's imposter that would be great i'm just going to ignore that and just hope someone else johnny get away from me get away from me johnny don't you dare kill me speed run all the tasks here we go wonder what the world record time is for the tasks lee is doing a task there i trust they go to o2 wash this one no one's going for kills here or i'm just in the wrong part of the map get away bomb get away yeah i was dead tommy is dead on uh bottom engine coming down from reactor on the left side of the map well i saw a tactical brick coming from that direction and on the lower level i was in electrical doing cabling and then i was going east towards navigation so i didn't actually see his body i've finished i'd wanted a reactor with freeman and hats i think they were doing simon says and i come down and tommy's dead there yeah i'm trying to remember who did the react thing because i got there just tommy was one of them how he was doing it i think i saw hands i didn't do the reactor but i went into the reactor room afterwards i came last because we have five seconds left before memory task or whatever it is but all i can say is i saw a tactical brit running left to right on the box i didn't see his body i was in doing the electricals and then i went to navigation but you could have done this it's a straight shot for storage and i ran past lee i think on the way through where did you say lachlan so i was in the electricals doing the cabling like at the top of the room yeah and then i ran straight across through storage into navigation but lee was at the top right of the map like the whole round because i was up there with him right well that's that's what i was that's where i was at no it wasn't yeah you were somebody that wasn't literally if you get me booted because of this because you don't know the map i'm gonna go crazy you were at the top right hand corner i was at the bottom of the [ __ ] map i wasn't at the top like i did a thing in the cafeteria i had to do leaves in the cafeteria okay and then like yeah in the top 102 room and then it went down the bottom well that is the top right though that's the top rightly but i wasn't with jack i was okay well my version of the truth is different who was that late okay well bye lachlan oh they actually got they're all gonna go hope you enjoyed that 30 second round lucky welcome to my life lee lee was at the top ryan gordon wasn't it he was over here he was up here this is literally the top right hand corner i mean i nearly gave myself away there like well i didn't give myself away i nearly what do you have to do here don't trust ads nope nope [Applause] hey you just never know you never know come on we need quicker internet speeds in space i don't think lee suss i just don't think he knows the map get away from me well i think well will just triggered that didn't they will just triggered that uh it's down here isn't it once again i'm gonna hope that someone else does that and we don't all die we're all going to die we're all going to die yeah wait what he killed i died on the other hand i just thought someone else was going to go do it freeman thought well i'll go to that one but yeah as soon as as soon as it was just tomorrow and bong i was like oh that's it then my heart was racing yeah you did well wrong you did really well someone's not joining that's good i'm gonna take the last menacing skin because i think lots of people think i'm killing just because i'm wearing the mask kill me like instantly voted off are you not even really oh yeah he just mouthed himself off so that's the first time i've been killed or spaced this entire session and i said on stream guys i haven't been killed or spaced yet literally [Music] didn't bother [Laughter] all right just everyone always goes to them right tommy's gone up and done that task there or pretending to do it the lights are off blue red done go down to shields no one's down here that's good [Music] i like the sounds in this game they're good fix this i feel like i'm a three-year-old child playing this game sometimes okay well that was good johnny johnny johnny i was on cams and bonga's just walked into the camera in that hallway and johnny's just shanked him whilst i'm right on it so i'm in the cafeteria right okay hang on i went from electric up to cafeteria no i was fixing the lights but by the way i don't know how to fix lights i sexualized this bong then i went right i had to do it i had to do the little uh hill switch thing next to cams and then i quickly looked at cams and rise i checked it i cut the corridor that's beneath that joins cams uh johnny's just shanked bonk right there where there's a cam above him well wait wasn't john i wasn't johnny an electrical just now oh i did electric he came from where was the where was the body in the hallway into cams there's a little bit that goes from you know there's like crossroads i don't want to protest too much a lot i love people i'm fine sauce there was a lot of people in electrical that came from that direction though so that's kind of if you're saying you actually saw it that's one thing yeah i witnessed it it's just you're okay you witnessed the murder watched johnny you killed one johnny 100 hundred and ten times out in your mind okay then we might remember johnny won't say you yeah i was in cafeteria so i could find loads of people but i didn't see anyone killing anyone i didn't see anybody i've got nothing like other than being a cafeteria i don't know what else to say it's just a bit yeah it's it feel bad for catching someone on cams but like either i you know yeah tommy is a keen camera andy i never go on cams usually um also that i just might as well this information i did a task to the right of it and then i was like i'll just check cam's quick brought it up in that one second i watched it yeah he got me on cameras and got me going on he though to set it up for when he's imposter so he can i'm gonna be honest johnny i voted johnny nine seconds guys i'm skipping i've got tomorrow just for you know i'm going to school i don't know yet it could be a ploy we believe you thomas we believe you thank you this is an easy one of them gone easy win for you you could vote me off next round then i'll be happy but uh okay done that's reverse psychology there's there's one more left let me tell you don't know is lee following me there was doing a task i don't want to die i think he did the task i think it's okay uh i'll get the o2 i don't like coming on this side of the map well someone else is going to do it right someone else's uh someone else is definitely gonna fix that we've got 15 seconds okay someone else has done it that time that means there's probably only one killer because that was quick so i guess that maybe johnny was one that is a self-report there guys for me tommy shut up and just shut up i'm talking about yourself out of it i'm not gonna let you do it tommy's got the microphone right okay i first of all was going to say remag is that i didn't see who it was but then pretty sure it was you that just walked into reaction and killed freeman and you're instantly trying to reverse it i just no because i would you've i let you speak because i wanted to see what you were going to say i didn't read that no listen to this listen to this i ran in and he killed and then he reported as soon as he saw him you're such a [ __ ] liar i came to the reactor because i listened to advice everyone used to go me and freeman did the reactor but what happened there is we did it remag smoothed it walked in didn't realize i was on the top kill reed killed freeman in the middle of the room i walked into the middle of it he's doing the thing where he talks when he no no no no no eve smoothed it did anyone else see anything in that round it's time to iron rematch i ran in he was there the body was there and then he recorded it to him and that was it he's reported he's done a self report and that's it guys do you think i haven't got a [ __ ] clue i was going to ask you what you think you probably know tommy's lying about that now we just went oh [Music] had no chocolate cookie no well you can't describe people no if it's not remember that's fine and that should be the win that should be gg mag you're very bad at life i mean it's not your fault it's not bad it wasn't i didn't even see you i didn't know i was just happy i had my macbook you were running i had my map up and then i just saw the report button clicked it i i saw that you know i've reported i've saw someone come in the room but i don't know who it was then i knew exactly who it was because he went [Laughter] i you make me think it's you [Laughter] it'll work in my favor it's not good when i have to imposter with you i don't feel good about it yes you [ __ ] up it's not my fault we're all in right did you see the blinking red camera johnny when you did the kill yeah let's go this one i thought that was tough i thought tom was lying then but they they voted for remag anyway got him off johnny was pretty obvious i think like he didn't defend himself very well when thomas said that he caught him he just went straight away i'm in cafeteria i could tell he was lying i know johnny too well that's the problem isn't it i think when you play this with your friends who you know really well you don't really lie to each other what were you doing by that's again tommy well uh lights were off it's tommy guys oh my god i walked into navigation and did the little flick the electric switch absolutely i entirely agree i enjoyed it tommy it's tommy tommy hats and tommy ran out of and the lights were off but there's a body on the lights it's someone those let someone electrical yeah i arrived very much with intellectuals left navigation with tommy and hans is now dead walked down five seconds you were walking with him as well by the way that was five seconds before the end of the round i always go through navigation i know it's tommy there well i went down and did shields and then the thing was called as it did the shield test that's all i know it's not a vendetta this is fact oh is it behind me i think i'm not actually sure to be quite honest you're gonna get yourself spaced again it's time you guys well i i i don't know who it is who's the guy in the electrical that's dead is anyone saying anyone near the name it wasn't lee i know that much i think it was freaking out mate i don't know well what are you all voted like i've heard a few i've got are you for some reason got some sort of vendetta against me lachlan why did you think it was tommy no not tommy not tommy i thought it was tom oh but oh my god called the body exactly now now that remag is the one like he always jumps in front of people when he's done something wrong so that's why i vote for him well that's questionable then when he does it when he doesn't do anything let's just get the third imposter out and then we can play the normal game oh god oh no no no god christmas is ruined i think i think it was tommy but i didn't i wasn't 100 sure so i didn't bother voting if i see you tommy i'm just gonna run away from him it could be that they're doing it together they're just playing a game because they argue all the time oh god tommy gets very defensive like when he lies but he's also very defensive anyway if someone attacks him he always defends himself i feel like i should try and help with this because i don't know if there's many people alive lee please it's in here tommy came out there then with remag there's gotta be a body somewhere i trust i trust lachlan i trust the latino in this round so i'm going to stick with him don't trust him i can tell me do this oh god was that actually no way it was lachlan the whole time no he played that so well you just saw me enter right yeah yeah so uh jack is dead on the the switch as you enter was it yeah the body was already on the floor you didn't you didn't do a kill animation so i believe that you've added and then do that like several times oh i was like oh something subtitled me guys i'm just saying oh can we just please get the third imposter out i'm just i'm sick of it now i'm sick i'm so sick that's protesting what's wrong i'm not protesting at all because he's just [ __ ] been deterring from the last game but also i'll be honest i didn't see anything i don't know who's dead but it's jack's dead who have you seen coming out of there i haven't i've just entered i i did the reactor on the right side uh did two tasks and now i've came down left yeah the thing is i'm gonna have to instantly vote really now even though i don't think it's him wrong did you guess he's gonna third imposter so i have to vote innocent and we're going to kill each other because it's ridiculous so i don't know so i'm just going to i'm just going to balance out we left the room with heads i mean it has to be you i'm going tommy you were like five yards away from each other sorry zach land you know that you've come on yeah i'm on i'm on the northern o2 panel i think it's remag he jumps out in front of everyone well you're guilty as well then i'm on the i'm obviously personal rematch knows like he he understands like lachlan's trying to pass the blame there i hope they don't vote reemag out now i think i think it's uh it's tommy's the other killer he's fine when he says [Music] that's third imposter found i thought raymond was gone then i thought he was out of there they actually voted tommy off i do think that's right though i think tom is the other one i don't know if they're going to get locked in there like he's playing it he's playing it really well um it's the final boss first time so if you've seen that video where i couldn't do that it's because i had v-sync turned on i don't know if they fixed that since but that's why uh what do you have to do with this oh it's simple a toddler could understand no chat desi pizza was that all my tasks then no i've got one up here is this the sort of game that turns friends into enemies uh i mean it as long as you all know it's just banter you know and and it's just fun we're all just good mates having a laugh really so it wouldn't turn any of us into enemies no i was starting running there but i'm not sure no i'm not sausage you i'm not so boring i am source tactical brits because the body is where i saw him going i was also very defensive of tommy yeah i'm all the way over in reactor right now i haven't seen lee where was the body farm i'm with i was and it couldn't have been me because i got sealed in cafeteria which meant i had to go all the way around to reactor to do the task that's not true i just saw you in admin well i don't i don't know i don't know about bong yeah i was thinking it was remag but and then johnny saw i was going to do the shield thing so he stuck by me and basically saved my life yeah yeah but then i was like confident it's not us three well how many people how many people just just died doesn't it i think all i'm gonna say is i'm all the way over in reactor and i got sealed out of there from the cafeteria where are you where are you i got sabotaged from cafeteria so i couldn't go down you were quite intelligent tommy though well yeah but that's just because of how remag is and when he normally talks i think it's him so far he hasn't done anything to me that makes me think it's him who did you vote for johnny lachlan it's the last person i saw going into happening so it could it could be [ __ ] anyone i know it's not lee but i couldn't kill him i was literally with you i don't know if you were not until i've been convinced because i'm all the way the reactor no one's next to me i think the closest person tell me tell me what you said on your travels lee i haven't seen anything i went into electrical and i thought well i'm gonna die in here because i saw you picking up the petrol can so i was like this is where bond kills me because i thought it might be you didn't happen but then nobody killed me in electrical and then i'll come out of electrical and then was going on the left-hand side and then that was it wasn't called lacquer was suspiciously absent from the game somebody could run past me just as the thing got called but i don't know who it was were you insecure really or near security okay i'm very intelligent i'm not voting because i was all the way in reactor i think it's bunk but i'm skipping well you didn't even skip either so would have any votes would have done it it might be johnny i don't know he's a winner that was a smooth round i [Music] bye don't know who shank is yeah he could just hold the place till we get somebody else and then he'll be back we'll just see if uh it's sonic the hedgehog the girl just uh with a knife in his head i can't actually uh get rid of him he's done i probably only got like one more yeah i'll play one more but yeah well we could just do it nine to be honest it's fine isn't it fine well there's a youtuber yeah g dippo youtube yeah he did so he you did for the wrong reason there's actually a task on that then i was looking at it the thing is the problem no no i suspect because i saw you both run out of the room the first thing you said was oh you went to that event but it was just there was a task on it and i was standing by the task he just didn't see it because you smooth that's what got me killed no i didn't what you killed is because you run out of the room [Laughter] post that bit mean like landed a [ __ ] job because we were teaming up was just obviously yeah i thought you played that the start of the game though like then really well like you did that well i i was 100 convinced it was on the second thing as well just to kill him shut him up i killed two people and literally left the room like the first two people who died guys yeah that's cool it was good yeah i murdered the first two people and literally slipped out of the door and tomorrow went in straight past me i was like oh my god oh the following round the lights were still off for some reason so i managed to escape tommy from hunting me down um yeah well the lights on off for me obviously right good luck everyone thanks hmm this one takes quite long doesn't it 10 seconds for that one [Music] going to react oh they've done the doors already no no no no no no but i'm gonna try and help that this time it's in here isn't it yeah okay oh two i got it don't worry don't worry right i've just ran jesus christ to go and do the oxygen and remag's body was on the floor i didn't notice it at first because i was looking at the yellow arrows now there was a group of three that ran down of that group of three who ran up and then turned around and ran down i ran in from the navigation to the o2 room i did the chair i didn't have the navigation i ran over back from the chair did leaves i had another task in there but i ran out in the three running south to go presumably i was going to i was going to the next though too i don't think it was wrong because i was literally right behind him because i saw loads of people in admin so it went down south and then bong reported where i was jacking all this i just ran down to the medical scan and just did that all right what do you say loads of people in admin that then there was three people in the oxygen thing that leaves yeah there can't be that many like no no i felt like there wasn't enough people going to the other oxygen so i was meeting with him i was literally right behind was full to the brim are there any solid evidence i'm skipping uh well i mean lee as well i've seen leo jack there's any people answering i think he can't even defend himself you say oh lee what have you been doing no no that's what makes the greatest killer though isn't never it [Music] i've got no idea it's bad though because we're a player down already there's only nine that started i think i don't think it's bong lee and tommo don't think it's lee cause lee's i don't know who's that is that thomas stay away from me tomorrow get away get away yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay yeah thomas the killer i was a killer 100 100 don't go on kill bomb kill bomb kill bomb kill bomb i'm pretty sure it's summer i could call immediately now but i haven't really got much evidence have i someone has died i found his body adds his body i mean it has just did the reactor i ran down south from the actor after we did it is the result on the left of the map yes oh yeah yeah we just me and i did the reactor right i did the top when he did the bottom we walked out with freeman i went south that's it yeah i just did one to ten and reactor and the cat and the doors that lead top down got closed like the reaction is shut off i'm sealed in reactor next to you tomorrow i just saw it at the end of lachlan's name through the door because i'm locked off from medical bay to go through the top left yeah as we came out the reactor the door slammed at the top so i just went south and i thought yeah but then where's the door so the doors remain closed is that what you're saying yeah like he does like a door slam bonk i physically can't leave was that you on the right hand side of the map with me uh when it when the alarm started yeah i was doing the leaves and then i i yeah i felt like you were following me and then i went down the corridor and then you saw the bong was in there and then you decided to run away i i waited with you guys to see if either of you got killed i was just on the edge of that like shadow so you were in the like the darkest part i could still keep my eye on you you weren't trying to murder me is that what you're saying and then the reactor got cool that's when i left it sounds like you were trying to murder me somehow because i could have easily done that because we're absolutely terrible at doing the that's the last i saw and then freeman's i've done it i don't know if he's a self-reporter though this is the thing i'm pretty sure it's not lee i don't think leigh's guilty of anything well maybe then he is i'm sorry purely because i think it's just no one is on my way no one from this group does the door thing when you're the sabbath we are i trust bong i don't trust freeman i haven't really seen much of him and watch what he does see if anything happens the tactical bridge just started no tactical brits alive just run up there why because no one was voted out last week that's good good idea to be honest needs a vote no one died then so we can't really i know if you just saw me like back on myself there that's because i was being followed by you and lackey underneath the camera because it was blinking red which means someone could have witnessed the murder this is over 9000 iq played by freeman dude i know he's like this is what i'm thinking but it can't be he can't be this can't be this who's on who's on cams that said he's on yeah i'm on camera so i think jack's in the club sabotage tomorrow i think came in just after i finished it and that's all i meant to be in tomorrow but they were just there yeah why does it clear me being on cam's toddler because well it's more so that because you haven't got any tasks to do wait is jack no i've got plenty of tasks to do still thomas well maybe you should be doing this if i've just cleared jack he wouldn't right now like suss himself by saying that i think jackson are clear i've just put gone up the right side and lackey and lee were following me and i saw the camera was blinking so i stood underneath it so they couldn't kill me follow you i went to the friend then i would have had a witness um i went straight past both of them i think i think thomas is up to somebody i don't know i don't know why i'm doing something he tried to kill whoever went into communications but then he clocked me and then went the other way i just i went back in towards shield and he was just kind of stood in the middle of the room i just got on to communications tommy was doing it and when he completed it that's where you said to be fair left at that point you have to get rid of somebody it's only when there's four left that's true to lose two of you guys yeah it's seven and four if you think i'm going to tomorrow because it doesn't i don't it doesn't kick you off because i got stuck on that thing earlier oh yeah you can get started because i it will only kick you off when you start it if someone finishes it i ran past lee tomo waited in the middle of the room and i went past lee and thomas you're voting for innocent you're voting off an innocent again if that's the case i don't know though like i feel like he was although freeman freeman's a silver tongue he can mess you up a moment's notice like he could be playing the long con here it's simple i kind of want to go back to security and just go on the doors of club oh no no no no lay right we're gonna have to go and fix that i've got no idea i've got no idea running he's in the fuel room bottom fuel room i got um he died freeman sorry green oh his body's in the fuel room i was running up running up from the bottom of the map towards the ot and i saw his body was there anyone else down there i was in the field room at the time so you think it's time i didn't see i didn't see either i just i came in from the shields way through that right now no you didn't say no you didn't because i was in the field i was in the i was in the room i was in the fuel room and i was like waiting for that door to go so did you see the body in the middle of the room then no well it was in the middle of there there's no way you could miss that so you must have killed him no unless you and him were on the other side of the fuel room no no you should shut the doors hang on listen the doors weren't trapped i walked in there was i was going towards the o2 thing hang on tommy you were near me yeah yeah we were in the cafeteria i went down to the shields came back and understood it from the cafeteria that quickly i mean i have to well actually i actually you couldn't go to the cafeteria so i don't know fine all i can tell you is i found the body in fuel going 202 that's it that's all i know i didn't see bong near it didn't see anyone near it i saw lee pass the chair in cafeteria and jack just briefly saw at the edge of the screen as well i don't know where lachlan is as well i'm behind me do you suspect leo or lachlan um he's been sort of wandering around but i wouldn't say any of that delicious i mean i didn't see bong i i don't understand how you could have been in there though because i didn't i was stunned leading to the closed door waiting for it to open to go to shields from storage but i promise you i was in the fuel and i reported and the doors were open i'm good i'm going with my half i'm skipping because i actually don't think i don't know i think it's tommy steffen it's death for you guys i think that's the gg oh man it's lee it's lee then lee's one of them i think leo bonk i feel like i should call a beard oh god we've gotta fix the thing first don't we i think we're dead they're gonna do double kill us here no no no no no no i've got this one don't kill me don't kill me lee's going to kill me i'm going to go call him in lee did that oh no way it was lachlan was it lachlan again how was he so good at this how was he oh man he's just i absolutely trusted him i'm 100 trusted lachlan that's devastating absolutely devastating i would never have said like one i just wouldn't have i just wouldn't have guessed it i was sure it was late i was i just ran up from storage to go and do the o2 in the uh admin room and jack's bodies in the corridor dead i see i feeling like lachlan was wanting to kill me no i think it's you and the reason i think it's you is because i was with jack in o2 but like in the admin room doing the o2 and making sure that it didn't collapse and then i left i haven't been south i went south you were there i went south went all the way back around towards reactor to complete a task and then the bodies found i didn't see bongi anywhere near the entire situation for me right now lachlan it's a 50 50 coin toss between you and lee and i i don't suspect you so and lee defended tommy last round and i'm almost certain tommy was the killer the way i defend tommy i voted for tommy no you said no are you with me i i haven't really like gone for anybody voted for him because you're like oh [ __ ] tommy's out here no no no he was with me because like it contradicted his story i haven't gone for anybody or like said that it was a hundred percent anybody but that was the one which one i don't know which one of you ghosts keeps locking doors on me well it'll be whoever's the killer that's dead i i this is the only time i've said that specifically i think anybody is us other than that it's been pretty straightforward he doesn't sound like he's lying at all does he i've got to do a reactor code but i can't find the post-it note right lee head to tails i don't know tails i'm going bonk i'll go only oh dear oh no methods no one yeah like basically i thought tommy would go around murdering everybody so i did my best to clean my case for as long as humanly possible if i just said that i've come from electric rather than the shields i wouldn't that's it yeah yeah i promise this isn't me or something you know [Laughter] the galaxy um yeah i just had to kill mag immediately i can't be asked it was so funny though what happened after you killed me yeah like because we just we just ran we just ran past tactical brit so that was perfect for you but then i had literally just ran past my body and then and then nearly missed my body as well and then he went back and then it was like everyone was there at the same time i thought tommy would get himself outed like midway through the game because he was like murdering everybody and i was hardly killing anyone i just made him i may i got caught in a lie fair enough when you killed jack lee was the other side of the door looking at it yeah but he wouldn't have been able to see what he did i didn't think that i was like surely he just saw eckland dude you can close enough also when tommy killed me he was nowhere near me oh yeah no the lag american service we had quite a lot of repeat imposters there didn't we yeah i got it like four times [Music] [Music] event is that stard hates us all i thought what
