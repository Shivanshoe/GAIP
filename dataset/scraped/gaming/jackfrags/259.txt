hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some call of duty vanguard multiplayer to offer but gamepl got some decent footage recorded and we're going to talk you through what the game mode is and also just how this new game feels to play in multiplayer so this is a 16 player game mode and you're in a team of two when it starts you're in this arena and it's got lots of segments to it where you'll have your individual battles at the start you've got a little bit of money you can choose to upgrade your gun buy a per buy a kill streak that kind of thing and then you can see here it will actually randomly assign you another team to play against and that 12 of 12 there is the lives that each team has champion and we are playing against easy and you'll see here in just a second i'm going to get the first kill and their lives will now drop down to 11 and that's over the entirety of the game and you'll learn what that means shortly so here i wanted to test out the new mounting feature you see you can mount your gun and actually move left and right now it's not just a pivot like it was in modern warfare and warzone you can also do a blind fire i didn't test that out in multiplayer but they did show a snippet of it in the single player gameplay and i'll just put that on the screen now so you can see what it looks like [Music] but that may have huge implications if that comes to war zone we have to wait and see but in this particular round we've only got 14 seconds left at the top each round is a minute long we've killed each other three times now you see how it says nine at the bottom red team just picked up an extra life though and we're about to switch and play new opponents now if you wanted to you could just sit back play really passive and try to not lose any lives in that specific round of the game but as you can see that one was a draw so neither of us will get bonus cash there is a buy round a bit later on too so now we're playing against baker squad got this training cam kind of feel and you can pick up armor as well you can see that i've got one armor plate in at the moment and i'm just spending my cash here upgrading my gun cash looks exactly like warzone too and this is on the modern warfare engine and it does feel very similar to modern warfare but just with slow rate of fire guns maybe a little bit clunkier a little bit heavier but if you're a fan of modern warfare and that movement how it feels tax prints slide cancelling all that stuff it's all here didn't realize that guy crept up on me there this team have only got four lies remaining careful there you go you got 10 seconds upgrading my gun there again fnj rounds can we get one more kill nope unfortunately not so that one was a draw as well so no bonus cash an easy team at the top there i've only lost two lives so they're doing great and now we're playing against fox who have only lost three so this might be a tough round i think we get to see some of the destruction in this round as well see these boards you can shoot those out just testing here and that is an extra life most of the arenas have an extra life position and that gives you a area to contest i suppose but here's a quick look at the destruction here you can just make a little peephole kind of like rainbow six siege it's not as in-depth as that i don't think you have the same level of control the destruction in this game feels a lot more scripted i would say than other games but it's there and the maps are designed in such a way that you can use that you can shoot out boards on the wall tiles floorboards there are even some walls that you can blow up as well so that's going to add a new element to the multiplayer gameplay [Music] and this is the mid game buy round i suppose so if you've saved your cash you can buy a load of stuff here i chose to get the stg44 upgraded it a couple times there get a spy plane or you can buy armor plates you can even buy perks here all the different perks and you can buy extra lives as well so if you're down you might want to save money and get that it could be a big play byron's over and we're going up against dog here who have admittedly done a lot better than us so far but that spy plane goes on straight away and if you look at the uav at the top i can now see them nasty car 98 shot there didn't kill me though teammate went down it starts to get real tense you know when you're up against the team who also don't have many lives and they're hunting you down you know you don't want to be eliminated but at the same time you've got to go for those extra lives like here right in the middle of the map so it's a bit of a risk reward thing picked it up guy in here slide in get the kill the teammate just had me lined up there with the sniper rifle shot in the back we're down to two lives now picking up the kills getting revenge there looking at this other player i think they were just right above me from the nade shut me in there unfortunately and we are down right now we're down bad we haven't got any lies remaining but because we didn't get eliminated in that round we get another round and this team have five remaining so probably pretty decent players picked up an early kill there though that was nice so you can say it says no respawning i should have upgraded my gun a bit really because i think we've got a bit of cash i was trying to just play as aggressive as i can you know got that life but then instantly got killed if you can learn the spawns on this super advantageous and i'm dead now i'm out we don't have any lives left so just spec in my teammate and they're going to have to play super passive as well because if they get killed here they're out but charlie have only got two lives as well so they might be inclined to play defensive too both teams just playing real passive here 10 seconds team baker has i think this could be an issue with the game mode that people just end up playing so passive with it but in a competitive environment maybe not that's it take their lives we did win that one so we got a thousand dollar victory bonus no buy round here though so couldn't get any extra lives and we go up against dog who are in second place right now so i hope you guys are following along and understand how this works when i started playing it i was a bit confused but having watched the footage back a few times and read about the game mode some more i understand it now i think it's quite intense really quite fun don't know how i got that one i think my teammate goes down there yeah so it's just me 2v1 they've got two lives got an armor player there could be really fun to watch this as an esport if you're into that or if you're a competitive gamer playing this with your mates or a group of friends or something i'm being flanked i'm worrying about this i've got 14 seconds as well we're trying to stay alive grenade out of nowhere perfectly you've got 10 seconds don't know how they landed that on me and i just get jump peeks here and that's it our team is out of there we finished fourth and then you go back and you spectate and you can leave as well if you want and just queue up to another game but you see dog and easy here they've got two lives each so they're gonna play each other now and fight to the death pretty much it's uh interesting concept and i think the the money and the buy system adds a bit of a meta game to it that's why i think it could be interesting to watch and play for competitive players i think for casual players maybe it's not going to appeal to them because cards always like 6v6 and more recently it's much bigger player counts right like ground war and warzone and that's what cod players are enjoying so i don't know if it will have mass appeal it's an interesting and unique game mode for sure i don't know if any game that has a similar mode to this please correct me if i'm wrong but i've certainly never played anything like this before just a couple things before we go as well i was playing this on playstation 5 in 4k so it should look pretty good i did have a look in the menu though because i know people are going to ask this it does have a 120 hertz mode which is great looks like that'll be there at launch for anyone that has a next-gen console and a tv or monitor that can support that but and i don't know if this is just the alpha build no fov slider still perhaps they're going to put it in at launch for console players i don't want to say for sure but it's not in the menu and that's something that modern warfare players and warzone players have been asking for pretty much since those games came out and it's just never happened and i think if you're sat there with a super expensive powerful console like the ps5 and the series x you might be wondering well the specs are good enough so why aren't they offering us that i don't get it i hope they add it for those console players because it makes a huge difference but yeah let me know your thoughts down in the comments below on vanguard and champion hill the alpha starts in a couple hours it's on playstation this weekend and then next weekend it'll be on xbox and battlenet for pc as well thank you for watching guys i hope you enjoyed this if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music]
