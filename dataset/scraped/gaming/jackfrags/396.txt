hi guys hope you're all doing well today we are talking about battlefield 6 and the hype and potential for the new title in the franchise and before we go any further into the video i just wanted to say that there's no new information or anything the last thing we heard was about a month ago on the ea investors call and then the announcement with criterion and dice la working on the game so there's nothing new to report i've seen a few fake args and troll accounts people pretending that they know things but officially there hasn't been anything new since that last update so if you're looking for that you're not gonna get it in this video because there just isn't anything else to say at the moment but what there is to say is that more than ever before as someone who lives and breathes on the gaming internet myself i spend far too much time because of my job on gaming forums doing research just generally getting a vibe feel for things more than ever before there is so much hype for the potential of what the next battlefield game could be and there's a few reasons for this and i thought that it would be quite interesting to discuss them in this video so first things first we were discussing this the other day when we were playing warzone if you're a fan of multiplayer first person shooters really there isn't that much available right now and in terms of what's coming up this year that's already been announced well there's basically nothing right until the next call of duty which let's guess will be october november and of course battlefield 6. as far as i know there aren't any other big brand new multiplayer first person shooters or battle rails being released in that time frame a lot of people didn't get on board with black ops cold war so they've stopped playing it or never bought it in the first place modern warfare has stopped being supported battlefield 5 development on that stopped rainbow six c just had a few updates every now and again apex of course is kind of ticking along halo infinite that's supposed to release at the end of this year apparently hell let loose yeah if you're into historic games that's been ticking over as well but in terms of modern shooters well there hasn't been anything new and nothing's been announced so really the next two big shooters are the new cod game and battlefield 6. now warzone is in this equation too warzone has been regularly updated with live events a couple of small changes to the map but overall i would say that the changes so far since it released last march it's been out for over a year now a lot of people have been quite underwhelmed with what they've delivered they introduced the stadium opening that was cool the underground system which was fun for a couple weeks but then no one used it new guns new operators and more recently the ship crashing into the land and the zombies beginning to move across the map in their epic bar crawl of the dansk so overall i think the live service for warzone apart from the halloween event which i thought was brilliant that zombies mode was great fun there hasn't really been any big or sweeping changes there i'm talking about gameplay as well as ma there's rooms of a new map coming next month whether that's a completely new map or just a remake of the dansk we don't know yet but i'm sure that will bring some excitement back to the game but a lot of people have stopped playing warzone that's obvious to me based on these comments that i'm reading based on the state of the game generally i know it's been pretty bad over the last like eight months or so with cheaters they're doing a lot better recently i have to say but the implementation of the cold war weapons has really screwed the balance of the game up and right now the time to kill is incredibly quick and that's just put a lot of players off who were playing the game enjoying it they've now left and for the people left playing the game the time to kill is so fast that everyone is playing really passively holding in buildings and it's not really that fun sandbox game that it was when it launched now it's just like waiting building if you try and cross from a to b because of the time to kill and how fast these cold war weapons are you'll die incredibly quickly so i know a lot of people have gone off warzone i do think there'll be a resurgence when the new map comes out though but i'd love to see more gameplay changes there my point is that those players who were enjoying war zone enjoying modern warfare are now stuck with nothing much else at the moment and what do they have to look forward to well according to some articles that i read yesterday on dexato modern war zone and games radar the rumors are that this year's call of duty is call of duty world war ii vanguard developed by sledgehammer games so it's said to be a continuation of what they did with their world war ii game a couple years ago and there's been a bit of a mixed reaction to that already if it's true we don't know if it's true you should always take these kind of things with a pinch of salt but if it is another world war ii game when the cod fan base has spent the last year enjoying modern warfare and war zone and really getting used to that modern weaponry and setting and attachments and all that customization perhaps it wouldn't be such a good idea to release another world war ii game can they play that nostalgia card again and get away with it but in my opinion it all comes down to the gameplay if this is real what kind of call of duty game will it be will it be your typical arcade shooter like black ops was yeah didn't go down so well or will they actually try and push the envelope a bit experiment like they did with modern warfare do bigger game modes expand and develop on what they had with ground war more interesting gameplay mechanics that kind of thing so to me it's more about what is the gameplay rather than what the setting is but modern warfare stuff always goes down really well and i reckon that one of the main reasons for that is the relatability so you're playing with guns that you'll recognize you're playing with vehicles that you might recognize gadgets and gizmos that are cool today also there's a lot of young people that play these games and maybe they don't know anything about world war ii or they just don't care about it they didn't live through that band of brothers saving private ryan call of duty one and two medal of honor allied assault and all the other world war ii clones that came out in the early 2000s they haven't experienced that so they just don't care about it now the context of that is important because let's say the battlefield are developing a modern game and that's going up against a new cod world war two game and we don't know the setting yet for the new battlefield game but we know that there's a huge demand for it and if you look at the history of what dice have recently released they've done battlefield 1 world war 1 game battlefield 5 world war ii and star wars battlefront sci-fi so i'd say that there's a good chance that the new game will be a modern day setting and that could be very appealing if it sets the right tone and offers some interesting gameplay opportunities especially if there's no major modern warfare type game as competition towards the end of this year the game is supposed to be out holiday season 2021 right so october november this year that means by the time that comes around it will be three years since we had a new battlefield game and there are two things we can take away from that the first one is that the fans of the franchise are just really eager to play a new battlefield game especially when bf5 was so divisive and the second thing is because of that time gap we can assume that dice have been working on this game for at least three to four years and they've got criterion and dice lay helping them on it so a lot of fans just have this faith that because of the time period spent between the games this one will be the one that launches in a good state with fun gameplay and a solid regular plan for live service which is so important in today's gaming industry it seems that ea are putting everything into this game they delayed need for speed because of it they've got dice la working on the game when previously we thought that dice lay were going to start doing their own thing under the arms of vince sampela but apparently not laura myeli who is the chief studios officer at ea said that this game is a love letter to the fans so there's a lot of effort going into this and a lot of confidence behind it even though we know nothing about the game the way the ea have been talking about this product has got a lot of people hyped but you have to remember at the moment that's all it is it is just hype and it is really easy to get lost in that but that's the reason i'm making this video if you look on social media there's a lot of people waiting for this game and just interested to see where dice takes the franchise next and i'm certain that the reveal is right around the corner ea said spring april and may makes the most sense so probably not long to go before we'll have some actual solid information to go off but with that said that's all for today folks let me know your thoughts down in the comments below what are your expectations for the next battlefield game the next call of duty game what are you playing at the moment what are you looking forward to let me know down below thank you for watching guys i hope you enjoyed this if you did leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
