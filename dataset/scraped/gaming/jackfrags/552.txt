hi everyone and welcome to star wars squadrons and a big thanks to ea for sponsoring this one today we are going to be jumping in to multiplayer so we tried some campaign yesterday got the hang of things how the ships control learning the basic systems that kind of stuff and today we are going to be hopping in to multiplayer we'll do a bit of dogfight and then perhaps we'll try some fleet battles a little later into the stream also today i do have nine codes to give away i've got three pc steam codes i've got three ps4 codes and three xbox codes and i'll be dropping those in the chat every now and again and i will say when i'm about to drop them so first come first served if you get one congratulations if you don't i'm very sorry with that said i'm looking forward to this i have played multiplayer a little bit but i feel like i'm still getting used to everything balancing the power is the most difficult thing for me but hopefully within the next couple hours we will get used to this and have a couple of decent games i wanted to go in and show you guys something on the customization i didn't show this in the campaign gameplay but i thought that this was kind of cool uh all the customization options that you've got up here so you can change all sorts of things about your ships you go for a pink x-wing if you want that's the default one i kind of liked the red one yeah it's classic isn't it that's the one that i'm gonna go for but yeah we can equip it you can put decals on too you can add these all over if you want get yourself an ewok do you want an ewok on the side of your x-wing maybe some people do not for me though i like to keep it classic right now you can also get holograms for your cockpit so we've got a galaxy there monkey lizard i think there's one of those in the movies called is it salacious crumb i think that's the name and you can get some pilot portraits is that chopper that's chopper from star wars rebels that's kind of cool i like that one and that's the big hexagon that they they end up flying inside that with the millennium falcon but the coolest thing i think for me anyway personally these little charms that you can get so you get like a luke skywalker one pod racer toy tontons uh the best one in my opinion is is this the porg now the reason for that is that i actually have this in real life and i got this when i went to star wars galaxy's edge in florida if you go to galaxy's edge and you go into the cantina you can actually buy this it's a mug basically a big cup i suppose and at the time they serve you a drink in it but you can take this away with you it's like a souvenir mug i've got that in my in my cupboard downstairs so i just think that's i just think that's awesome that that's something that you can have in real life and also in the video game you can also get the um hanging flares here pretty sure you can get that galaxy's edge as well anyways i digress so we're going to jump into multiplayer and um yeah have a good time here i hope you guys enjoy watching i am looking at the chat if you've got any comments or questions about the game please do let me know we've got a dog fight preferred faction random yeah so you can choose would you prefer to be new republic or galactic empire i like to go random because i think you just you just leave it to the hand of fate right i don't really have a preference at the moment which i prefer still learning the game also today i have to say um i did wake up with a migraine it's kind of weird yesterday in the stream we were talking about migraines and headaches and this morning i i woke up with an absolutely banging migraine um i have shifted it now but i do feel a bit fuzzy still so it's going to be a pretty chill stream chill video if you're watching it as a vod and i hope you guys enjoy this i think we're in a game straight away there are we is that loading me into a game right now yes okay i didn't realize oh let's just put me back on the main menu all right try again the vr is amazing martin i've not tried it in vr yet i've heard it's very good though i've got a couple of close friends who have tried it in vr and they say it's great you know what's interesting as well when we did that stream yesterday a couple people emailed me and were like oh jack i i have a lot of migraines as well and this is what i do to help and some people gave me some great suggestions one person just said just drink a load of coffee so when i woke up this morning i read that email went downstairs made myself a massive cup of coffee down that and then took a hot shower okay this just keeps all right we're i think we're actually in a game here aren't we yeah we just gotta wait for ten people we're all level one so i drank the coffee i got myself a hot shower and i felt a lot better straight away but migraines tend to like linger for the rest of your day so that's what i mean when i say i feel a bit fuzzy it's all good we can still we can still play we can get some nice shots man you've got all this customization as well that i've just not i've not looked at this at all i love that they give you all the stats there too it's really useful max iron dps so i got to the point in the campaign where i was given ion torpedoes or iron missiles so you disable the ship and the shields and that just sets it up for a big laser barrage i think repair droid you kind of need that right but you can just go full assault if you want i feel like for the first game i should just stick with a pretty standard loadout like balanced all round you know see how it goes what's up ron the don thank you for that orange juice for the fuzziness is that what it is just a load of vitamin c was it vitamin d in orange juice it's vitamin c isn't it hello life effects how you doing hey tamor king lobster what's up hey kyle westy says hi okay what's up wesley how you doing man are we still waiting for two people to ready up here dj chris does the vr on pc support xbox controller input i don't know for sure but i'm going to assume so [Applause] i love that noise reminds me of rogue one that's very good [Applause] hey so these are the guys that i'm playing with we're going to nadiri dockyards it's got crossplay as well by the way which i think is super neat pc xbox playstation crossplay i feel like a lot of multiplayer games are going to be like that though in the future hey maxim what's up luke's how you doing hey lucas tony gaming how you all doing all right let's get this standing by right if you're new to the game as well i just thought that when we first got into a game i should i should show you this so the basic if i don't get killed or eliminated i should be all right the basic control systems so if you see down in the bottom left i've got a blue a red and a green bar so that is my engine my lasers and my shields and you can choose where to put the power do you want more speed so if you press one on the keyboard that puts all the speed sorry all the power into your engine and you see the blue bars gone up to the maximum there and when you're up there as well that yellow bar starts to charge up and that's your boost so if i press spacebar now i will boost and it lets you do sick things like this drifting you could do drifting in space so that's your your engine power also when you're adding more power to your engine you're more agile so you can turn quicker so if you're in a dogfight you can evade missiles better you can get behind targets easier so that's your your engine your second one that's your lasers so the red bars gone all the way up now and then you see the horizontal red dots there just on the dashboard they're actually charging up so by default if i show you oh they're charged up now but by default they're just like a normal red color but now that i've switched you see it counting down now that i've switched to my lasers like this it goes up again and it starts to overcharge the lasers so that's you know when you want to get on target put as much damage down as possible i've got a missile lock in here so i'm going to try and uh so i counted that with one of my counter measures well i might have to dodge this one so you can dodge missiles like that one hit me i'll repair so that's the lasers i think i'm gonna get uh eliminated here but whatever i can show you guys uh the the shields in the next life all right we're being locked on again all right so the other thing is the shields which is the green bar and you can actually choose where to put the shields do you want them balanced do you want them at the front or do you want them at the back and i'll show you guys that again just in a bit more detail my team are probably like what's this guy doing he's just flying around in spawn but i wanted to explain the game to you guys you know so if it's something that you wanted to know about so i'm gonna put all my power and shields so now the green bar has gone all the way up so my my shields are overcharged now and if you look on the right hand side where the little picture of the x-wing is you've got a a circle and a semi-circle so if i mouse wheel down that will put the shields to the back if our mouse will up that puts the shields to the front but i can also just balance them with middle mouse like that so that's like an overall balance so that's you know typically the uh the basics of it it's super cool and you've got to you've got to learn how to do this while flying while keeping speed and fighting other people so there's a lot to think about it's kind of like the old x-wing tie fire versus x-wing game if you guys remember that but anyways let's see if we can uh get some action here uh you can target things through here like this and we got a kill assist on that one that guy took a load of damage then and we're gonna lock on hopefully for a missile okay assist again that's cool you can also ping areas too so let's say i'm playing multiplayer and i want to say to my team hey go attack this guy i've told my team there to go and attack him so there's a bit of teamwork there although this is just your basic team the deathmatch battles which we'll get onto later there's a lot more objectives that you can go after see i put the shields to the front there but multiple people attacking me i like the fact that you get a kill cam as well i think that's one of the first times in a frostbite game that we've actually had a killcam so that's kind of cool on my way lucky you so there's there's loads of depth in this game also those individual pips there that i showed where you just change them with one two and three you can have them incremental if you want so i think the pro players who are really good at this they will be able to really you know balance those things effectively i think that guy was just taken out there yeah he was wow okay he just flew into me am i capped at low fps no i'm you should be able to see my frame rate here can you guys see that overlay on the screen in the top left there you should be able to see that so that's my frame rate 200 fps i'm playing at 1440p max graphics as well so it's it's very well optimized this game see if i can get this dude can you go all the way down here is this the play space i guess it is you can also steal power from certain parts of your engine and quickly put it in others if you want but that's more than an advanced thing that i haven't really got into yet yeah you can't i thought i might be able to go around that it's also got full joystick support as well if you're one of those players that enjoys playing with uh a joystick a hot house or something like that you can use that i've got a missile on me all right so i did actually counter that but i'm i'm such low hp now that this guy is probably going to get me unless i can outmaneuver him i've used my repair as well incoming missile against go around this shoot there we go we dodged it yeah there's tons to think about in this it's a really complex game it's accessible but there's a lot of depth it's the kind of game where the people that play it regularly are just going to be so good at it oh wow my repair again can i outmaneuver this guy [Music] got this repair here let's try and get this [Music] i was too late there with the counter [Music] measures what's up of course how you doing hey cvp what's up a me master how you doing i swear like siri just please help is on the way i say things that just are nothing nothing like siri and yet every time see so one of my teammates there actually disabled that and that set me up quite well look after this guy oh someone just fought a load of missiles at them i've got someone chasing me we got the victory even though i spent most that game in the spawn showing you how to play the game we won i mean that was not i think i had like two or three kills or something what did i get did i get the uh participation trophy i didn't get any trophy guys but we did level up elliot is this game new yeah it's just come out commenter i don't think that will work yeah uh el sevado we're live right now a lot of people don't believe that my youtube streams are live because of the quality i just think it's pre-recorded but i don't i don't get it i can see you in the chat austin as an xbox player i worry about cross play vr i think will be a massive advantage um austin i don't know i think you could be very proficient on every platform and controller system with this game i think maybe the best setup would be a joystick that would perhaps feel the most comfortable but i mean there is some insane space in mouse and keyboard players right hello ferguson from idaho what's up black cloud no this is not in vr we're playing on pc in 2d uh but i'm going to drop a couple of codes in the chat right now we're going to drop a pc code for steam an xbox code and a playstation 4 code first come first serve i'll try the uh the a wing this round what loadout do i have standard again okay here we go so i think these guys are on console it's cool man i love that there's a frostbite engine crossplay game it's awesome we'll go standard loadout again i need to actually learn what's good what's bad i don't think anything is good and bad actually it's just a trade-off hey zayn from houston how you doing aaron is this live how many fingers am i holding you're holding two rock on my friend hello anita how you doing love you too what does leveling up do for you i'm not entirely sure i think you just unlock uh additional cosmetics and upgrades for your ship or side grades so to speak hey mario yeah it's cosplay justin yeah me master thank you man that's kind so bennett cheshire cat hey victor alexander what's up uh if you get one of the codes by the way um tweet me tweet me a picture or just say hey i've got the code plain third person uh sawant this game does not have third person it's designed exclusively as a first person game hey lucy i'm okay thanks yeah this game is all about the experience of being a pilot in first person uh skipper yeah there'll be more codes there it is again [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you don't really get much time in that little lobby do you hey eddie what's up the console players have aim assist marcus as far as i know in multiplayer that there is no aim assist please correct me if i'm wrong if you've played this with a controller but i think that's how it works so it's even i suppose [Music] it's not the same as aiming in a first person shooter game because your lasers go where the center of the ship is like this this cursor that's going around here that like that isn't aiming that's just moving my ship my lasers always go right in the center where my ship is pointing and you even have to lead a little bit as well so i think you could just be just as proficient with the controller in this game doesn't make me feel any better should i try and get behind this guy oh i thought i was in an a-wing maybe i didn't pick it correctly oh that guy got toasted see how i'm kind of having to lead a bit to that guy even though he's quite close by the missiles please forgive me yeah we got him nice l3d here [Applause] oh there's a thai bomber put some damage down on this guy stay on target oh okay obviously the more that you play these levels as well you'll learn where the cover is put the shields to my back seems to someone chasing me that's a lot of damage i think my teammate actually saved me there as a thai fighter on my left so you've got directional audio as well that missile nice can i get a repair here try through the gap all right we're gonna rebalance the shields come on come on come on incoming missiles put a counter out oh there's so much going on it's so difficult i'm trying to avoid this missile did we yeah we did we avoided it i think what would be super cool as well i don't know if you can do this if someone spied a missile at you could you could you lead it into an enemy ship i think is there a friendly fire in that respect i don't know that's a chunky boy cheeky nando's okay i'm always up for a cheeky nandos we get three kills here that'd be nice nice little triple kill that guy is burning man so fast yes fina ah thanks i knew it's tricky it's so tricky to stay on target is that my missile yeah okay we've got a couple hits off there put the power in the engine so i'm a bit more agile maybe i can catch up to this guy that's not good counter attack all right okay someone's on to me here try and get that repair hit it nice put the shields to the back all right we're gonna boost we'll do a drift oh he went past me i was gonna try and put the whole barrage in there all right that's another incoming missile oh we're in trouble now 36 health it's very tactile getting this oh no no no i just flew into the cover let's boost out there i'm being chased i mean this would be insane in vr come to think of it like it'd be so much fun get him gonna get him yes no we got four in a row the tie interceptor got me a benjamin is there any kind of street bonus for getting multiple kills i assume so i guess there is i guess there is hey bone daddy what's up y'all ready for me hey sedan i am playing on pc yeah but it is cross play as i said so you can um so in vr i mean you can do it in 2d i just press the button i can look behind myself and around but if you're wearing a vr headset you could just look around maximum immersion right there let's catch up to this guy and when the crosshair's red you know that you're hitting them or you can hit them let's say i think i can request help as well do some quick turns trying to avoid this nice that's a thai bomber coming for me this guy he was after me let's get him oh this guy's done three x-wings on him there's no way there's no way i'm charging my lasers up here that guy just got wasted straight away one on one let's go i love the droid sounds as well they're awesome i wish i could understand what they were saying oh no my teammate flew into me no that's not that's not fair ruined all right so we're going to stick in the x-wing then for this game and then we'll try the interceptor next game eyes the b we'll drop some more codes after this game who's locking on to me there this guy here please don't not like this can i make them fly into this do a quick boost get out of there i want this dude here ah just gave him a really easy shot there didn't i i'll play the tie fighters sound amazing right guys did you get the code wicked yeah tweet me if you get one of the codes so we are slightly in the lead here we're about to win that's the dude that got me last time let's go after him i want revenge i think this guy's a good pilot do a quick 180 turn now someone is ruining me yeah the interceptors are really strong aren't they i didn't even see that guy well played hey watch me ball what's up sasha here i come hey john wick john wick taking a break and uh watching youtube streams we got the win nice two in a row [Music] i feel like i should have got a award that time accommodation i did okay i think i think i did okay i got hey i got the unstoppable five kill streak there you go so our team did okay okay there across the board right next game we're gonna try oh pp we got to what level are we now level six something happened then i don't know i didn't read it properly so we're gonna drop some more codes here we've got a pc steam code a ps4 code and an xbox code coming up in the chat hey luca what's up merrick cyber yes i will how are the controls compared to bf completely different what's the boy scout hey kathy cook how are you doing um foe hammer there's no music because if i turn the music on i'm likely to get uh content id problems on youtube with it being star wars music can't really uh get away from that one hey bobby cool what's up flimsy hey keith from new york hey okay right on the other side now we'll go for the interceptor they seem really good look at this dps here so the the standard cannon is like 681 that one is what 1680 that's crazy cluster missile that one does 900 damage that's a mine though that you leave in the sky so if someone is chasing you you could drop that i feel like that one's kind of cool cluster missiles yes multiple missiles on the same target that's my counter measures you can stop people from locking onto you with that no one can lock onto you for duration that's probably really strong so what do the uh imperials get that's uh what is that a carbonized couhon i like the vader statue that's kind of cool medal of the emperor's fist mouse droid again the vader hologram special forces pilot chimera oh thrawn may be missing but his legacy remains it's adorable so we'll play one more round of dogfights and then we'll get on to fleet battles hey guys what's up hi bye what's up xavier hey william hey devon hello fellow adults look how cool we look [Applause] titan two in formation i've gotta try these missiles is this the place that was in solo the [Applause] movie but so are you destroy all enemy [Applause] fighters i feel like i want to try and get the ones at the back i think that was a hit oh it sounds amazing doesn't it hey the missile got him cool you can fire that so fast that guy's in an a-wing i should be able to like keep up with them though could snag this oh i lied as expected right you've got to use your radar too where's this guy that's uh after me on the other side of this wreckage i think yeah right here yes dude those missiles are sick i get through this hole oh my god no i think i could have got through that hole but i was i'm just a terrible pilot i think i was going a bit too fast there cou huns are the venomous centipedes from attack of the clones is that right double-edged katana inbound shall we shall we let's do it we've got someone over here shadow striker oh you can fire those from so far away look at that that's ridiculous all right who's this guy that just came here and he passed me can't have that yes income and missile i'm trying let's get a boost right here shields to the front i could have got a missile off there damn i'm on 21 hp this one get this yes and that missile got a kill as well not sure what happened there i think i was just in the outbound area too long [Laughter] so we're spectating this guy we're gonna redeploy i think i just went out of bounds for two too much there now we turn the tides the cockpit's amazing isn't it it just looks awesome the level of detail i can hear like a clown horn every now and again i don't know what that is damn it get around this problem were they taken out then i think so pro tip guys don't fly into rocks it's not a good look saved you calculate ruined halfway who's this guy um the thai intercept is ridiculous guys this is really good [ __ ] i don't know whether it's the maneuverability or the firepower but it just feels really strong it does it sounds like a clown horn oh the rebellion's not having a good time today hit the repair i'm nearly on the outbound zone here what i appreciate about this level design though is that there's a lot of cover things that you can hide behind you know how dare you i missed but they counted it maybe i said that they've locked onto me countermeasures all right we're gonna boost quick turn space drift is that missile gonna hit me no i think we dodged it oh that guy wants them so i think my blasters killed that guy the split second later they flew into me there you go this guy's an enemy of the empire take him out yeah indeed i'm not playing in vr yes sir warhacks op no we're playing 2d today [Music] help us pc players out so i can come blow you up for the rebel alliance those a-wings are so fast oh ruined teamed up on me uh if the car no there's no third-person view how are we doing we're winning by three points so it's quite a closely matched game right here they are not expecting me uh right who's the closest target here oh there's someone right next to me behind me i did put my shields to the front there but i think i was a split second too late i mean it's a cinematic kill cam for sure big oof what's up car how's it going titan squadron i am inbound [Music] multiple targets in front of me here they've caught up now haven't they they're teaming up as well which is what you should do right just doing my duty titan one worry about yourself next time they don't know i'm here no he's going to get the repair unless i get it first close gotta get back too fast i tried to do a drift and swing myself back around there but i i think i was just going too too quick a chad did i ever play wing commander no i didn't uh sure damn do you get sick from the motion i don't really get sick from it but i don't know what it's like watching it obviously i'm controlling it so my body and my brain are in sync and they know exactly where things are gonna move to so no i mean it's fine for me ow i think they're going to dodge that one miss all get him get again nice was that did we win yes one again you have some horrible teammates oh they did fine i think they did fine i think everyone's new to the game right now we did okay then okay all right so we've hit level seven got some stuff to buy we're going to jump in and do fleet battles now and i do have some more codes as well that we'll put in the chat so we've got a steam code for pc we've got an xbox code and a playstation code going in the chat right now first come first served if you get it congratulations fleet battles ranked oh man okay right we're gonna have we're gonna have some some tough times here guys ranked ranked gaming let's go so this is an objective based game mode a bit more variety i kind of want to try the interceptor again i like those multi missiles as well you're getting it just for the imperials hey fiction what's up justin i don't think i don't think the scripts basically just you just quickly right click copy paste that's how you get it they're real people as well because um you know they tweet me i do lots of giveaways on this channel and usually the people that get the codes uh tweet me afterwards i do ask that as well so see a guy called thrill pickle tweeted me 13 minutes ago and said thanks for the code for star wars squadrons so that's a real person i know thrill pickle they've followed me for a while they pop up on my twitter feed every now and again you just gotta be quick guys you gotta be quick i know if you're on pc as well you can log into the sony store or you can log into the xbox store and then you can just copy paste it so if you're like trying to put it in with a controller you're not going to be fast enough and obviously when there's this many people watching what are we on now 6776 people watching you've got to be quick but i uh i always try and get codes for you guys you know i work very closely with a lot of different publishers and i'm very lucky to get early access to these games and i always ask if i'm doing a a sponsored stream or just playing the game can i get some codes to give away for you guys that are watching so i'll always try and get some stuff for you guys but i know that when there's that many people watching it's uh only a few people are going to actually get the code so now a guy whose name that i can't repeat on stream has just tweeted me saying that they got the steam code and i can't repeat it because there's a swear word in it so there you go um if i get some more codes in the future obviously i'll drop them in the comment section below maybe so fleet battles right we're going to focus on the game here it's 5v5 again this is stages so this has got ai in it as well i think and if we take out their starships or their players that bar at the top will go towards our favor and then we can start attacking there flagships and then we can go after their mon calmari which is the giant one at the back what is that there that's weird so i could go after these guys here i think these are ai yeah but that will actually help my team you see the bar at the top you get more morale if you destroy players though but you see straight away there we've got the advantage so now we've got more morale we can start to attack their frigates here and i can i can target this put the shields to the front and try and put some damage on this but of course it makes you a target for the enemy players because they know you're going to be attacking that hey owen got me with the missile there and this is the tactical map as well so this is our star destroyer those are our flagships that's a raider as well so that raid is going to fly in there that's ai and do a lot of damage to this flagship here so it's a it's a total war i suppose you could say i am an advantage but you can actually fly back into the hangar and change ship as well [Applause] i might go after this player here yeah so now he's out of the way i may be able to boost and put out some damage on this i'm gonna die here but you see i can put out some damage here obviously i don't want to die but i think on this occasion i may just trying to put out as much damage as possible here so we've got a bit of an advantage now already you see the bar has now gone back against us because they've taken so many of us out so they've got more morale so they can now try and attack our flagships but they've got to deal with this radar sorry raider that's in there now so it might be difficult for them to actually get to our flagships here but i'm going to try and defend oh so they're attacking that was actually a friendly that i was trying to target there they're targeting me whoa okay that guy is hammering me with that gunship all right let's try and get out of here i'm gonna fall back a bit put the shields to the rear in case someone's chasing me so if i fly back in the hangar now i can change ship [Applause] bit of a hot land in there but it's fine uh i could try the thai bomber i've not used this before so they've taken the shield off the right one there which is kind of bad charge the guns up end level boss see that's their raider that's gone i'll try and defend this as well as i can go after this u-wing i'll have actually destroyed one of ours that's not good so we started really well but i think maybe we lost too many ships and they got their morale okay so now they're gonna go back and defend and that'll give us an opportunity to attack their frigates all right we're going to get this one now for sure come on come on come on okay i think that's it it's nearly dead it's nearly dead come on come on yeah there we go we got it we got it nice so we've kind of even things up a bit here although i'm yeah i'm disabled i'm gonna be ruined here yep as well played hit me with like an iron missile there or something just drifting in space it's gone that's cool right our radar is there as well now oh no they didn't destroy one of ours okay now things change good so we do still have the advantage here but we need to take this out we're losing morale though going after the raider i mean it's nearly dead isn't it try and get over there quickly do some last minute damage to it good kill oh those iron missiles suck nah if you get hit by one of those that's it it's game over hey justin how you doing i'm off yes there is drifting you can drift if you do a boost you can quickly drift and then do a 180 if you've got someone chasing you hey kingsguard hope you're having a good stream dude this game looks sick thank you king god i appreciate that it's very kind here so this is ai here and that's going to do a lot of damage i'm going to try and take that out you see how i destroyed the turrets on it there all right my lasers are out of juice i'm going to let them recharge good good good that's gone okay this is should practice good aim don't happen again put a friendly fire there maybe i like this tie bomber so now we can go ahead and attack their massive mon calamari and i think this has got different sub systems on it so you can attack different parts of this i'm not sure where the subsystems are though on this i'm in the tractor beam no no no i don't want to be an attractor beam how do you get out of this any boost out of it okay we made it and we're dead yeah this is um original trilogy b tax it's set after return of the jedi so the death star 2 has been destroyed and it's mainly the the ships the starships that you saw in the in the original trilogy now we turn the tides yeah how do you see the sub there's a way that you can target the star destroyer is needed the sub systems but i don't know what they are on the mon kamari there's a button that you can press that's typing i'm not sure what it is what's that doing i don't know what that's doing just gonna try and get over there do as much damage as i can okay yeah so we need to get some morale back now and defend for a bit and they're locking onto me that's not good dead but try jamming their radar you recommend using a raspberry like a raspberry pi right i'm gonna switch to a uh interceptor are we defending here hold the target button is that is that what it is craig yeah i remember doing it in the single player titan squadron i am inbound is it no that's not working for me yet i helped you maybe i've rebounded or something anyways we've gotta try and uh take this out 40 hp come on him uh where did he go sir okay raider's gone i'm not you know i've never seen spaceballs yeah glaciers have you played it in vr they are not expecting what's up akiva from maine how's it going eliminated it does sound like a clown horn that i'm not sure not sure what that's about okay so i'm going to try and get over to the montgomery there boost over let my lasers charge up a bit so the weak spots are now exposed someone is on there you see those like lightning strikes on the uh on the ship there those are the weak spots now so if you hit those you'll be doing way more damage yeah the hoster i'm sorry i'm sorry hey from hamburg standing sword what's up [Music] i feel like i should go after the players and we got a gunship over there all right shields are down i'm gonna go from above this time see if i can be a bit stealthy about this hit the weak spots well i did a load of damage there okay well that's not good so the shield's back but we almost destroyed it then no let's get out of there how did i survive that i thought i was dead for sure evan thank you for becoming a new member i appreciate that it's very kind here cool okay we gotta defend now yeah imagine if you were playing this with like a group of friends are you calling out tactics and stuff okay i've got a guy following me i need an assist you know that kind of thing budget yeah we invaded it nice okay so now they can attack our status for this guy wants me dead still following me all right we invaded it i think we just died there hit a space worm or something uh rook you can see what's still up on their capital ship on the map under the icon of their ship when you die oh i see it's this here right but it shows me what's on our ship but not oh there we go so they've got their left shield generator and their right shield generator but i don't know where on the ship they are because i've not attacked one of those in single player i know where all the subsystems are on the star destroyer but i've not learned where they are on the uh montgomery well that was a bad move that's a lot of morale right there go after this player [Music] i've dodged that get some morale back here how good this game looks i always forget man all right sometimes you just see the star destroyer in the background and you're just like whoa okay it's gorgeous must be very immersive in vr okay right i think we got it okay we did yeah excellent work awesome love [Applause] it of course there'd be music now something like that yeah just i don't think the uh youtube algorithm will pick that up i don't think my singing is accurate enough you know [Music] dude that's it man i just i could just sing do you want me to do that instead or is that not it's not what you want does 5v5 seem like it's small scale uh i think it makes it a bit more tactical i wouldn't mind more players though i think maybe that game mode could accommodate maybe 88 immersion ruined yeah banned yeah banned see you later watch me ball [Laughter] we love you but don't quit your day job instant ban [Music] [Music] okay i'll stop uh i'd like to try a different map i like cheese as well heathen hammer cheese is good man in moderation okay i feel the copyright okay i've not tried the gunship what's wrong with me i mean look at the dps on that what is that i'm going to try it for the for the meme whatever let's do it where are the b wings uh you can you can play as a b-wing i think the bombers oh actually they've got y wings i don't think they have b wings not sure turret mine tactical tractor beam six thousand iron damage yeah my drops life turret behind you that will automatically fire at nearby foes okay why wouldn't you want that no sorry what hey lads bones malone that's there that's a hell of a pilot yeah they don't they don't have the b wings they've got y-wing bombers i wonder if they'll add them later on i don't know if they're gonna do like additional content for this that'd be cool echo we've given away nine codes god rogue squadron was amazing steampunk privateer i played that so much on the nintendo 64. so much man rogue squadron was a hell of a game i loved it yeah i'm pretty sure that i 100 of that game [Music] titan one standing by titan five standing by titan three standing by titan four at the ready bring down their flagship that's not fair no not turn that off like voice chat okay it's gone yeah i hope that i wasn't like voice chatting this whole time can you imagine how annoying would that be you just hear some random guy just waffling on about nonsense i've not tried hosas with this game philip i don't have i don't own a joystick or anything like that so i um i've not i've not used it so a good impression of it now things change i'm sure there are people out there who've used hotas already on this but i haven't so i was talking again i still am am i i'm actually still talking again how embarrassing like this whole this whole live stream i've just been waffling on like the people yeah looks right there isn't it but voice chat's turned off is that a voice chat for me i'm just gonna change that to something what's chat input uh we'll change it to the elgato whatever that is so there you go so yeah so this whole time this whole stream oh that's funny i bet some people have recorded that and gone who's this idiot i wish he would shut up this guy thinks he's some kind of youtuber is it i didn't see a uh open mic microphone mode where's that oh there we go open mic this whole time i've just had to open mic on oh that's hilarious open mic please it won't let me click it there we go push to talk okay right now i will spare my teammates the uh the what the waffle is wafflization there we go no one got mad i mean i i think i've got voice chat turned off on my end so i couldn't hear them but this whole time i assumed that they could hear me i think that's quite funny oh that's so that's so good that is so good i've not played this map before what is going on look at this that's a wide boy i don't have a co-pilot that's a shame oh this thing is meaty so i think that right click is a uh like a dumbfire thing it seems yeah this thing does not handle anywhere near as well as the uh x-wing or the interceptors nice that's a lot of damage yeah not funny for them but hilarious for me and for you guys as well so there you go they probably just muted me anyway so that's fine put that mine out uh ethan thank you for the five i bought this and was playing it last night and it's like you're in a movie love your content and keep up the good work ethan that's very kindly man thank you typical gamer we all do it yeah i thought i turned it off i thought voice chat disabled but this whole time i am an adventure oh god i just imagine that there's some like some kid on his tv and he's been in one of these rounds or she's been in one of these rounds and the parents come in like who who are you talking to because i've got no idea there's just some some some weird guys talking about youtube and streaming and and this game that's quite funny to me hey that does like serious iron damage doesn't it just disables them straight away oh i'm disabled now i was going in for the kill hey zachary yeah it's going good hey van sonley what's up you want me to free look why do you want to free look was i in free look mode destroyed [Applause] superior firepower has arrived i mean you can look all the way around behind you that's what you guys want to see it's a nice cockpit isn't it i'm being hammered by an x-wing right now yeah i don't think this is the ship for me i feel like i was doing much better in a uh interceptor and a bomber so i'm going to change to the uh interceptor it looks like you can have like set loadouts as well that's cool they are not expecting me that's more like it yeah there we go look at the detail on the star destroyer looks so good i think they're underneath the corvette got me yeah you're right uh tell us there it is it's a support ship and i was flying it like a fighter you've got to play completely differently with that ship uh herman no there's no third person view no third person being in this game well yeah i hope i'm giving you guys a good idea of if you're interested in this game or not got him ah star destroyer took a lot of damage are once then operational all right let's see if we can put a bit of damage out on these do a little flank watch out for the space rubbish all right let's go for day unreasonable i think that's kind of what you need to do you need to just get some damage off and then just get out of there recharge the lasers where'd you go where'd you go trying to get this kill i know there's someone chasing me but got it nice still chasing me countermeasures let's go around this rock get a few more shots on this come on come on come on come on oh man it's so strong we get it yeah we got one of them who is coming after me here i think it's this guy yeah i am playing mouse and keyboard gavin yeah oh let's throw pickle in the chat thrill i saw your tweet by the way thank you i'm glad that you got the code nexus thank you for becoming a new member kelsey thank you for the one i appreciate that if you're taking out a frigate hide behind the engines okay that's a good a good uh tip right there inbound thank you b storm anyone know the counter measures button for console i'm not sure it might be b yeah i have a feeling we're going to lose this game we got a whoa i wonder if there's any easter eggs i suppose there's gonna be lows isn't there die die die come on yes resupply thank you you shoot these things they explode right then all right so go from behind look at that bomber on my left let's get out of there there's the clownhorn destroyed damage there to our star destroyer i don't think we've even touched theirs [Applause] go from underneath here got it they're targeting me whoa now getting a bit seasick now i assume that they've got some systems on the top here just finished an hour of this in vr and now my head is killing me christian yeah in a good way or a bad way neil 64 players sounds cool but chaotic for this i think 64 players will be way too much for this the way they've set it up it's like really competitive game with a lot of depth 5v5 like i said i think 8v8 would work quite well uh jake no third person lots of people asking about that actually incoming missiles they're locking onto me you bought an index for this game too use the bombers yeah i could actually it's a good point um time bombers i don't know if i've got the right load out though i've got the multi-lot missiles they work all right against the flagship yeah the maps would have to be massive you're right divine if they really wanted 64 players i just don't think it would work though there's all these little roots that you can take in between the asteroids i'm gonna be ruined here i think [Music] once you've got someone following you it's really hard to shake them it's very difficult hey natalie how you doing use the bombs in the torpedoes right yeah i'm not sure i've even unlocked them you know star destroyers shields are down it's almost lost i think we lost this one guys i don't know if they could like do they have to push the morale all the way back before they can attack or if they're skillful enough can they actually just try and attack a flagship without needing the morale maybe disabled my ship please i'm begging you i'm dead i'm dead so i'm alive i don't know how but i'm dead now yep ruined oh the control is good the controls are fine jonathan yeah i think it would probably be a bit more intuitive on a controller or with a joystick i'm using mouse and keyboard they can attack anytime right so this the really skillful players assistance is on the way they could perhaps ignore the morale system to a degree you're safe never doubt i owe you nothing on that one how did i blow through my lasers so great then how we lost [Laughter] [Music] that's probably what's playing right now how did i do uh we got seven kills not great placement match oh am i gonna get a rank am i like potato rank or something [Music] well ranked did you give me game wood plastic potato metal um i don't know how do i see what rank i am rank tear progress oh you've got to play 10 matches you gotta play ten matches of flea battles before you get a rank so you've got maverick that's probably where i would be the lowest rank i assume hotshot hero valiant legend and then galactic ace and here's potato that's me right there win ratio 0.5 kd ratio 0.7 all sorts of challenges as well so you can just put insane bombs on this then uh i did miss a couple of donations there though thank you uh chariot fighter thank you chariot and kelsey thank you for the five appreciate that kelsey so i imagine it's the auxiliaries where you can get bombs proton torpedo deals very high damage from long range but it's a long lock time and cannot be fired at close range ideal against capital ships yeah so if you're like really serious about this game and you had a a five stack or something you could completely meta the hell out of this and build a really sick team composition with bombers that had specific loadouts on that were designed to just do max damage against flagships or just do max damage against raiders or other standard enemies a goliath missile that does four thousand damage by the way that's insane zerkasika mine proton bomb so could i build like a sick x-wing laser cannon the burst cannon seems like it's pretty cool grant how is this potential skill ceiling complex enough yeah definitely the amount of customization here i mean if you think you've got one two three four five six seven different components of your ship and each of them have um five options i think all of them have five oh no some have got even more so when you consider all that and then you consider that you can have five people on a team i mean you could really meta the hell out of this receive less damage from the front stunning gamer thank you for the five i appreciate that thank you natalie it's kinda neat so they're not lock-on missiles that one's probably really good you could fire that disable someone and then just hit them with like a massive laser barrage okay on the ion missile counter measures so that one destroys all the missiles behind you but you've got to fly straight so you're liable to take damage from normal lasers can you change the paint job yeah you can cooper that's like a ecm jammer long cooldown i'll try that standard hall max health do you want more health or more shields what do you think reinforce hole you're gonna sacrifice a lot of maneuverability there that'll be fun that's all the trade-offs it's really interesting jonay this is live right now see you later slam engine all right we'll try that loadout hopefully i'll get on the uh the rebellion side dogfight new republic there we go ryan you think max movement's better hey david what's up phillip how you doing hey jrs how are you um someone wanted to see the additional customization it's cool you can do this while it's still searching for a game so these are the paint jobs i did show these earlier but you know you can get a chrome x-wing or a rust bucket what is that that one's quite like diamond you can put decals on as well you can customize the cockpit holograms all sorts where's r2 i don't know joe i don't know if rt is in the game there's a couple of like uh cameos has that just put me in a game that's just ended i think that's yeah that's not that's not ideal why did i get xp for that i didn't do anything i mean i'll take it for sure yeah like uh wedges in it in the campaign in the little prologue bit there's vader and leia but that's set before the game um harrison doulas in it if you watch rebels you'll know who that is who else is in it admiral akbar's in it i'm only about a third through the campaign so there's probably more cameos like i don't i haven't played the rest of the campaign yet so i couldn't tell you what happens also i won't want to spoil it i don't know if ahsoka's in it or anyone else i mean it's a canon star wars story so i could probably have done a lot of things with it right jack is going for the boom and zoom with this x-men layout yeah that's right gold leader he's spinning a good tactic try spinning so change up did that i think that locked in before it put me in a game i don't feel like an orange rest easy squadron vanguard one is here vanguard woods here that's cool vanguard 2 standing by vanguard 5 ready for battle this isn't fair look we're up against the level 14 and 11 oh look at this it's cool i like your attitude so you can go like inside this just tunnels and everything turn this i think i need to get with my team really i'm here yeah this guy is following me oh they just crashed into the ship okay my little turn seemed to have worked are you still following me yeah oh this game's nearly ended as well what the hell why you do this so that's my new blasters check that out yeah this is just gonna end unfortunately hopefully next time it puts me in a game which is uh that's a nice start she carried it yeah i want to play it in a match that's gonna last a little while that's a lot of damage right there whoa that's like way quicker damage than the normal blaster look at that that's insane yeah i made a bit of a glass cannon here i think because i don't have any counter measures but i mean uh are we gonna go after steve steve what are you doing i can't repair they've locked on think that was my only play there that was my only option what's up christian done looks like it's very difficult to evade yeah it is you can crash into if you're fast enough william you will you will kill yourself that's the easiest win in my life right there easy money thumbs up that's kind of weird isn't it it's stood there thumbs up what blasters they're the burst lasers previzular gaming you just semi accidentally bought this how does that happen carl can you land and hide you can you can't land so to speak brap but you can come to a complete stop in space you will be drifting a little bit obviously because you'll never completely get rid of your inertia but yeah you can pretty much almost stop so you could hide but i don't know if there's anything that will take you off the radar completely this guy called joseph o'connell's just tweeted me a picture of himself wearing a an x-wing pilot helmet saying that he's ready that's it joseph that's it right there man that's the stuff uh asia thank you for the five yeah it's not to everyone's taste you know thoughts on the game's longevity terry i would like to see them add more content i don't know if they've planned on adding more content i mean if you go i was gonna say if you go to the main menu it says in the bottom right operation one so i assume that they are going to add like an operation two and three and just add more stuff to the game i hope so because at the moment there's i think there's six maps and obviously they can add more starfighters down the line so i'd like to see them come up with some kind of uh live service plan if they're gonna do that i don't know i don't know what they're planning starfighter assault looks like faster gameplay maybe paul yeah starfighter assault in battlefront is very fast-paced it's it's arcade isn't it battlefront is much more of an arcade game this is definitely a star wars starfighter simulator it's much more like a flight sim where's the millennium falcon not in the game as far as i know hugo there's no hero ships so to speak uh peter astrond no i've been playing the whole game in 2d i haven't tried vr i do have a vr headset but it's in the box so yeah i need to unpack it and everything sorry to hear that she's hey evie how you doing a tournament on this game i mean you'd see some seriously good people in the tournament for this i think there is kind of a spectator mode so i guess it's possible [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes tom i have played that i'll be covering it in a new video soon [Music] [Applause] all right here we go stefan i don't know if they'd put the naboo starfighter in because it's the wrong time period unless they did like a prequel pack right which was just prequel vehicles and locations i guess though even now it would still be naboo star fighters right they wouldn't have just destroyed them all unless there's some kind of cannon thing that says that they were all destroyed i don't know [Music] alex um i was sent one of the cards luckily i know a lot of people have had trouble getting colder than though but i think i i'd hope that they're producing more so people can actually buy finish them off first if we're gonna do this let's do it with style right okay let's find a target let's test out these lasers again ah he got it well played and that guy took a bit of damage then i'm trying to shoot in front of him need speed see counter work great then yeah he's going to get away that's unfortunate yeah that tie fighter was just putting all their power into speed into their engines and getting away from me and i was being attacked from behind good team play though from their part harry you've already finished the campaign what did you think of it harry scrubs is it available on console yes chris it is it is uh i'm the only person on my team with a kill here i feel like the teams are a bit unbalanced we'll stick with it we'll stick with it yeah it's on console it's on pc ps4 xbox and it's got cross play as well we're gonna get destroyed this game i think um and if you're interested in checking out the game there's a link in the description below try and switch to my engine so i can keep doing tight turns really hard though the tie fighters are so maneuverable okay i'm just flying into debris i'm dead teams are definitely unbalanced that's fine yeah that dude's got eight kills totes mcgoats man getting it done fair play to the guy they've always got five up and we're just kind of going in uh staggered it's not good keep getting kill assists i don't understand they're just flying into the the weird zone and just killing themselves i think paul campaign finished here too marvelous is is gameplay of like i mean like i said i've not finished it i've played about a third of it it feels like it's um it feels like it's a tutorial for multiplayer you know and they've woven in some of the story as well that's how it felt to me anyway from the initial like couple hours that i played let's try this a-wing that's the mvp right there hey we got the mvp that guy's so fast too fast too furious you're still in the game nice too it is easy to die andres uh although um the teams are quite in balance here and i'm when i'm getting in fights with people uh i'm being teamed up upon so it's not 1v1 so i'm dying quite quickly i've just realized we've got daffy ducks right lola bunny and bugs bunny in the game with me i couldn't ask for a better team trying to max out my uh lasers before i get into fights [Music] i've gotta watch this dude look how quick that dude that is insane i mean i know it's an interceptor yeah that guy's pretty good wb in the house your team is really loony i like that hey paul um i will try it in vr yeah but i'll do that off stream probably because i don't think it's like vr's good to watch you know you can put a vr headset on and watching it is a completely different experience and they only need one more kill and then we're done yeah there it is well played gg looking good in their tie interceptors and got the yellow and the wings there very nice that's the music there from the game i just turned it on for that last second for you anyway boys and girls thank you so much for watching i appreciate you all being here i've got to get off because it's getting a bit late for me and um my uh my head is starting to ache again so i hope you enjoyed
