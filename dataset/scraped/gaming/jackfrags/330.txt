so we've been playing some more rogue company and i wanted to show you guys one of the best clutches that i've scored in the game so far and this is the capture the objective game mode and it starts off really chaotic everyone just kind of runs towards the middle so i thought that i would throw a grenade just being the first round i bought one of those put some pressure on get the first down player over there and i want to cover this left flank here in the corridor i hear someone come in down the second player to confirm that one now it's not looking great for our team because we've got two dead players tommo and adam have just been taken out of the game completely so it's just me and johnny left right now and i can hear them rushing right above me johnny gets a down player and a kill there but then he gets down and they just push straight away finish him off so now it's a two versus one situation against me but i did score a couple headshots there so i know that this dude is low hp get the down get the finish and now it's a 1v1 situation but the timer is against me i'm going to put my ability down it's kind of like a flashbang thing that you can press q to launch whenever you want or it will just run the timer down and just launch when it gets to the end but i'm running out of time here there's only 13 seconds left and i've got to go and arm that bomb so i pick up a grenade from there which an enemy player had dropped i've got five seconds so i'll throw it there and plant on this side so he can't rush me while i'm playing the bomb literally milli seconds to go there we got it and now i've got the advantage this dude's looking for me comes around a couple headshots again and we get the kill sealed the deal i didn't think i was gonna win that one but we did pull through in the end today's video was sponsored by rogue company they wanted to do a second video with me so big thanks to them for that the game is free to play on playstation xbox switch and pc link is in the description below if you want to check it out for yourself season two is live now they've got a new character mac a new map and a new battle pass in today's gameplay i'm playing as a sniper called the fixer i thought that i'd try sniping out in this game singers in the last video i was playing as mac and i was that assault game play style but i wanted to check out the sniping and again it's the demolition mode where it's round based and if you die you're out for the round and it can get very competitive at times we had another close game here it really came down to the wire with that said guys i'd really like your support on this video i hope you enjoy if you do hit that like button below and leave a comment so let's get into it now and see if we can get the win we're going to be johnny you've absolutely fooled your way there luna man sonic [Music] staircase here is that the last two around here yeah one's running towards him running the hop up on the left where
