hi everyone and welcome back to more call of duty warzone today out of nowhere they added the rao lng this bad boy here check it out now if you remember i think it was season six this gun made its way into the game but you could only get it from really rare boxes or bunkers and then it was in the game for like two weeks and it disappeared but now finally it's saying you can unlock it it's quite easy to unlock it was just like five kills using an lmg with the scout optic in seven different matches so i did that in modern warfare really quickly just queued up to shoot the ship and i think i'd unlocked it within like 10 minutes so it's super duper easy but we're going to test it out here today i've not unlocked all the attachments for it but i've got a pretty decent build using the blueprint that i bought and a couple different ones that i've mixed and matched in there so we'll be testing it out seeing if it's any good and today playing with acolyte stone mountain and mr tommy graphic so i'm really looking forward to this and i hope you guys enjoy if you tune into the stream welcome thank you for coming hit that like button great way to help support me and if you're watching this is as a vod thanks again and hopefully we can get some dubs all right let's do [Applause] oh yeah okay i'm feeling good i think we're gonna get some nice loot come up try this lmg see how it goes [Applause] let's check that roof again see if the uh doors are [Applause] i don't know there that's where those guys went was there another team here didn't see they flew over us i think yeah i thought they were i thought there was a team coming but here i got a heartbeat let's see if anybody's here running by yeah right below here two two two crack one i'm out of ammo actually i'm done nice i think you did mostly oh there's not two oh good jump on the box i can't even see anything i have that awful em-2 that takes about 10 years to zoom in i can't believe that and the legendary one is is it gets worse the higher does anyone need this oh get the other one there oh there you go so daddy there does anyone need this we darn much cash really do we did you listen to the new phone jack of stuff done oh no i didn't oh it's so funny [Applause] well uh it's on spotify yeah yeah there's about eight episodes and they're only 12 minutes long each but they're very good well i can't

the burr at the end as well tom yeah i've done that before and after actually please follow that b u he's a b [Music] [Applause] usually train is packed with cash i know it's thinning out what's going on you think they changed the cash in the game every now and again i don't know oh yes placebo because of rng yeah my guess is it's just luck because it's most of the time i do get great cash there yeah drop inbound plunder cash here wow i'm running it with an smg because i feel like it's going to be so slow yep it's so slow man why smg you running jack uh mac 10 yeah i think that's from the fastest one is the fastest in the game right i think so if you take it with tiger personally you guys want to take this door uh well you used to run people always like the pee pee though the bullfrog's better stats wise oh we're talking about guns oh yeah that's awesome yeah the the bullfrog is a pretty good one i do like that one too somebody wrote this one a little more i don't know why but it feels good feels like a good sniper assist one for me [Applause] to roll in a sniper that i couldn't do it i couldn't do it i almost did it but i got a loadout okay i do but it's so slow with an lmg yeah over there yeah it's right here there's another one here oh okay what are you guys i've never seen one there we go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i was just trying to catch up i was just

too high there if you look don't like look fully left like look towards the wall so you're hugging it so you're hugging oh oh oh okay like don't look at that keep the window on the left screen pretend that you love the bricks there you go so the window's still in view but you're not looking away from the window you're jumping too far away off the ladder just okay okay yeah just like a tiny bit i just fall down though if i hit hold hold space just at the wall let's do it the other guy makes too much noise apparently so what do you mean the skin itself it sounds like you're wearing a tracksuit

vehicles you just dropped it right in front of you yeah that was that was a good shot airport runs i missed doing that in the early days because people expected to run you over and you just dropped

already no no no got the blueprint uh mine's 46. oh what's that that last barrel looks like it's going to give you a lot more range yeah i don't know if i wanted i would use a barrel though for this build for like a meta build mm-hmm the same as the pc he's in a barrel i got the 32-incher on it because the yeah yes and the uh why did he say it like that reason alone boy it's fine tom there's nothing wrong with that massive it's a massive 32 inch buffer he likes his long barrels leave this man alone it's what it is you know i don't know it's a world record [Laughter] i might do that from fmj jack all right give it a shot no barrel i wonder if you could build it like a bruin like the old brewing that was good definitely movement was a lot better with the brown though oh my god the bruin there's literally an assault rifle that gun yeah he's quite nice looking unknown the route is it a real gun yeah i don't know it's gonna be based off something i don't think they've made a gun that's new right yeah grab some target practice while you can we're deploying uh hey taylor thank you for the five trying different mgs while unlocking the route and i broke the fin again with the chainsaw on the scout object you broke it as in it's op i mean the fin is really good like it it's not like the highest damage in war zone but you can build it so it's just got no recall so you just hit headshot after headshot if you've got a good aim drop people if anyone peaks you you can just beam them looks cool [Applause] some guy in multiplayer already had damascus james that's insane although it's not that difficult is it to get damascus in this in modern warfare if you play shipment 24 7. hey joey and lindsay love these guys playing together so funny yeah these are a great bunch of guys man i love them very chill good players good comms all right that's enough about hey jose no fmj not on this one joe i might try it another time uh killalicious that's crazy man thank you so

here yeah i've seen this one before it's a very strange what what the hell yeah that's strange all right you ready let's drop down outside and down yeah you got it oh that is weird that doesn't make sense thank you vertex [Music] [Music] it's because we always stay at the right door you shouldn't follow me like that it's that making sure it's the full auto attack nine what we didn't even go anywhere it was an ax 50 on the ground and then it turned into an m82 i mean we can go back to yeah i saw that we go back to summit if you want let's get started yeah we need the buyers and stuff look at that roll [Applause] the m82 is just a reskinned x50 then in warzone i guess you wouldn't think that the games would cross though [Applause] i understood but [Applause] was a completely different engine to modern warfare isn't it he's baked i'm back boys thank you for the rest in your absence no problemo did you end up playing aliens tom no i didn't did you no no i didn't give it a go yeah i was going to well if the mean for you know i mean you know you know [Applause] yeah i was watching a couple of people play early we should replace words with meme [Applause] yeah the men yeah you know the meme oh yeah i understand we just know what we're talking about yeah no more well we need a bit of cash [Applause] some cash money come up your bank around here or something it's not a spawn truck there's a vehicle on the left just got in it there oh no oh down the driver oh come on now tommy let the guys play the game yeah [Applause] why isn't this a you guys sending up that hill oh my god man yeah [Applause] yeah i broke one down one that's the last guy oh my goodness mid flight you guys are crazy that was something what does he stand for something else right now he jumped out into the headshot i put my lmg oh you know what i'm going i'm going sniper lmg i'm doing baby that's the problem but is it a problem if we get a dub though i don't know this one or behind us do you even know we've got the vrk unlocked now yeah we have enough yeah i got to be okay [Music] oh it's okay i picked up through the car did you yeah here are you drunk uh yeah i don't even know daddy go ahead jump out jump up again oh we're dead crack one blanket right someone's up here [Music] [Applause] the kill kill i have to be honest the guy with the vector just hit nothing but head on me i didn't watch the kill no recall i did that this guy seemed legit whoever killed me recall gunner [Applause] uh i don't see anything right side he's in the direct center direct center holding slide he's got it dude yeah i'm lucky so fast by the time the has made the call out that he's on it it's over [Applause] uh the rall is from modern warfare fuzzy i'm not a warfare gun but you can unlock it in warzone [Applause] yeah i feel like the guy that killed me just hell is this lowdown this loadout ever existed we love them the guy that killed me was 100 aimbot by the way but i didn't watch the uh i didn't watch the kill cam he just cheater just i was uh i had to record it i was leveling up the gun he was just hip firing the roll in multiplayer and head shots only get back in your vodka yeah yeah you can you can watch it back tom um basically locked on to me no recall nothing but headshots with the vector oh god i can just back up now if you want i don't know i know it's up to you guys oh baby though it's gonna be pointless for us to stay right did you watch your tongue yeah what was the guy's name um it's loony skip cool yeah very obvious i thought the cheating situation was supposed to be better my first day back second game and i'm randy oh that as soon as you get out of the vehicle that snap is so bad it was me i think i get out of the vehicle and he's already snapped to my head hit box before i fully got there that's cool cool yeah at least yeah at least they banned those 50 000 accounts guys yeah they didn't just create new ones listen whatever this handy cheat is that they're bringing out for vanguard or with vanguard please come on please it's about time that's all i'm going to say i i saw something um today there was a guy i i don't know the credibility of it the tick tock yeah i saw that he said but like obviously happy about the further i've been exactly yeah so he was happy about the fact he got banned across all of his accounts because it seems like there actually is some type of like hardware anti-cheap but of course if the dude's already hacking like is he really even a trustworthy person for saying that or is he just making a meme out of it and just making contact because he knows everybody's going to talk about an anti-cheat in the game if there is one so i don't know credibility of it but he was basically saying that you know his account got banned and all of his other accounts got banned too and he hadn't even logged in on him or logged in with the cheats or anything on those too and if he created a new account it wouldn't let him onto the game which would be fantastic if that's that case and i'm you know hopeful it is but i mean it's just an easy way to get attention though isn't it exactly and that's what it's like is that actually the case or is it is this just a ploy it wasn't just him there were a few different likes of reddit posts there was a couple of extra like tick-tock videos showing the same i i don't know man i just question the cr i don't i i don't know him i don't know i don't know any of the credibility of it and like one person one person blows up off of it and another couple people make videos on it and they also blow up off of it you get a bunch of views it's like [Music] i don't know you know that's why it's so hard to trust i trust some of the stuff and i usually just try and wait for info from the devs but also it's like it's also in their advantage to not say exactly what the cheats or like what the countermeasures they have are yeah because otherwise people can go around the counter measures if they know what they are so it's like i don't know it's a weird position it's gonna be custom colonel lock it in get some fair games going long overdue [Applause] obviously why they don't have an account limit like how many new accounts you can create on one profile like say you can only create three new accounts [Applause] you're going to come here you're just going to turn up one day and i'll be like tom yeah i know where you live oh you like reading out places that are right on my doorstep yeah i'll just tell i mean you don't go out do you ever or ah what i'll do is i'll just get in my car i'll drive to your door and then i'll come in your apartment say hi yeah all right we said too much let's go a serious though i would like to try that internet to see how good it is like can you actually play games can you stream on it can you upload whatever it's apparently pretty good you're talking about the uh elon musk one right yeah sky now wherever it's called it's an actual it's

and then this then jack comes along jack comes in sends us up to the top sbm over here tippity top sorry i am covering my um i am covering my screen in lobby it's like if people are stream sniping it's almost better to just die at the beginning and get into another game yeah because otherwise if they you know if we just wait till the end game then they'll just kill us at the end game when they know where we are too you know yeah three point three not really a good solution three point three look at this guy yeah but i mean yo you you're like four something are you uh i honestly don't know

prevent zombies from like attacking houses and stuff yeah just difficult did you really play i never tried it i tried yeah i tried at the very first version there yeah i played it with an hour you have to buy it usually yeah like a thirty or forty five yeah i think they sent me a key to try it out or something like that all right i don't remember i didn't buy it though yeah they did a huge i remember i saw a ton of people doing sponsored videos on it go through it you should do it before it was a battle royale like the other thing of it and i remember looking at it i was like it's kind of cool because i like i wanted to play like the game orcs must die i think that's like a tower defense yeah that one looks so sick i haven't played it but i did want to play it it looks so fun it is fun it's a good way to waste some time yeah i don't have to think i love those tower defense games i don't know just shots all of your triangles on the mini map stare at me do you think people are still playing right here all i don't know like the actual pve mode oh you just threw a loadout dave he thinks he's going to die and he's right up here tom he's still in the other room he's right there oh

upstairs [Music] thanks jack whoa okay i'll just keep being the bait i'm doing well just not even worth using now wasn't that bad it was only it was only good on rebirth it was pretty trash from badass yeah i like there's a solo smg yeah that was the point it was like a good close range if you get them close to range you could do a ton of damage and then they nerfed that's exactly what they nerfed was the uh maximum damage you do from close range oh buddy it's working you do that i'm gonna i'm [Applause] [Music] nice done let's go with something nice okay yeah it's got the right yeah i
