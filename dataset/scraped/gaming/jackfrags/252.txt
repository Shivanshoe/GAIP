hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some bf1 live gameplay commentary i'm in a bit of a battlefield mood at the moment with the new gameplay trailer they released yesterday can you call it a gameplay trailer maybe not but there was some snippets of gameplay in there and there's a load of discussion about the game right now better later this month so i just wanted to jump on and do a bit of sniping you know now the thing that i love about bf1 is that it captures the environment or the atmosphere of war i thought i've ever been in the war but it makes you feel like you're in a big battle right you know what i mean i mean look at this we're in some old ruins there's fires in the distance smoke i already see there because of all that smoke it just i don't know it just looks so epic like wherever you turn i've got the m95 marksman today one of my favorites for popping heads i think i'll throw a grenade as well why not copycat oh we gotta kill with it too nice can i jump over this fire here apparently not seems that my clothes are covered in light fuel they're pushing up that hill there they're trying to just sit here for a bit you know take it all in i need to get him out this b point losing it oh that was a good sign wasn't it was that headshot sound or just like metal or something boom oh are we clear i think we got on there push him back a little bit mr mad lad with a machine gun here [Applause] need more rounds than that this guy's living the dream though not the best long range slide for this but the fact that you don't have to unscope after you fire a shot is it's pretty big deal so those guys are under the ground aren't they maybe i should move i think half the enemy team is in this bug here we've lost boys you gotta fall back you used to be able to like boop yourself as well doing that bayonet charge for that lads [Music] no don't look at me fall back army just come on look at this oh oh no i missed two shots terrible getting boys get a mod they've not moved over here [Applause] raining down the pain there with that ng i can't believe they haven't been sniped yet what's going on oh lovely right now i get stupid mood when i play this game though don't really play uh breakthrough grand operations that much it's usually just conquest but i saw this in the server browser go on then trade kill pain anyone down here in the cellar no but i want that what is that then a dead a mercy or something like that terrible french that was i do apologize yes oh come on nothing hit them at all i wonder if i could get a cheeky little flank here on the right oh nasty oh my god okay mr phantom fox oh these guys just got no idea right behind them oh here we go big flag one two three i've missed every shot right let's go for the knife [Laughter] i didn't have much chance there did i maybe i should have just reloaded you know a spooky season coming up halloween i thought i'd watch that um haunting of blind mana like i'd seen the haunted hill house and that came out and that was like really really good but spooky season puts me in the mood to watch uh spooky horror movies so i was like you know i didn't never watch that second one that they did because it kind of got mixed reviews but um i've been watching it and it's pretty freaky but i i don't think it's as good as the first season but we know some uh scary weird just weird moments in it that freak you out it's like that uh movie it follows have you seen that there's a little thing here on the can juggernaut even see anyone i mean it's quite restricted isn't it look at this they thought he was gonna shoot me out the uh the juggernaut suit here minik's not even paying attention like people just don't know issue in here i guess yeah normal checks maybe i should move i'm not the juggernaut anymore sorry i reckon the rest of this year is going to be pretty good for gaming the obvious one you know we've got 2042 beta release we've got a new cod warzone map far cry 6 uh back for blood if you're a uh a racing fan who fought the game that looked pretty sick actually they released some 4k footage out all right so we won but we have to go again don't we yeah i'm really excited for the uh the upcoming game season halo as well how can i forget no match for us that looks like a reproductive organ how did we do 42 and six not bad they've got the elite sound though trench raider bdsm barry will call him warzone's got bds and barbie rose and battlefield's got baseline here phoebus and barry he's now dead they are aggressively pushing this now not about medic just sat on fire go right around the back here and get out my juggernuts that's my spot oh my god bit of a turkey there no i missed it damn fine fight two as well didn't mention that did i oh that might be pretty good little support guy there on the mortar look at that oh oh no snipes i thought i'd killed him all down there he's hiding in the mud we're getting beat pretty bad so switch to the hell we go help the situation we're in look at this man the current predicament is it's not great it looks like hell on earth this it's actually sick though i love that they uh i explode that i love that dice managed to pull this off like you've got to give it to the uh level designers i really need to put my gas mask on there didn't i oh that hell regal though so good i remember when this thing was stupidly open everyone run around with it boom that's the bigger artillery cannon i just drilled people come on yes die oh my god i'm gonna die there's smoke everywhere don't get away with that i think i helped there i think oh my god shotgun nearly had me how good is this come on how good is this nothing else like this even today just getting real messy oh there's barry barry i didn't mean what i didn't know i didn't mean what i said barry i'm sorry i think we're gonna lose they're capturing it i blame barry it was all his fault i'm gonna get there on time no oh they've won um this was awesome though i loved it and played uh the done heights in ages great enough though i mean the atmosphere on that is it's just incredible anyways thank you for watching guys i hope you enjoyed it
