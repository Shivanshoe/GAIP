the sniping in this game is just so good nice little loop shot there to kick things off hope you're all well guys some chill bf5 sniper gameplay today just one of those games that i love jumping on from time to time i know there's no new content anymore for it but you know you maxed this out with ultra graphics and put the ray tracing on still looks incredible still has some really cool moments in it and i wanted to give you guys a bit of an update my last video i think it was a war zone video i did an intro and uh you know obviously my voice was a bit different than usual i was feeling a bit sick and uh you can probably tell it's it's not really gotten any better and over the last few days i've got worse like fever really bad sore throat shaking coughing all the time and i thought maybe i should just do a test so i've got a couple of lateral flow tests left over and uh the first one came out positive i just wanted to double check so i did another one like some time later and that also came back positive so looks like i've got kovid managed to dodge it for a couple years but it seems that i've gotta bite the bullet now and i was thinking like well where did i get it from and i'm a bit of an introvert so i don't really go out that much like if i don't have to go somewhere then i'll just stay in i like being sociable when i'm out with people but i prefer my home comforts and the only place i could think of that i'd been to is about like five or six days ago i went to a place called the trafford center which is up in manchester in the uk it's a massive mall well americans would call it a mall in the uk it's just like a big shopping center i think it's i think it's still got europe's biggest food court in it but it's really interesting place because there's all sorts of like roman and greek architecture it's not just like your typical clinical looking shopping center or mall it's a bit interesting like the design of the stuff the statues there big grand staircases and good for a few hours if you want to potter about brows do a bit of shopping and then get some food i think that's probably where i picked it up i would guess you might be thinking well why why are you working why are you why are you making this video honestly guys if i'm not working or doing something i just go crazy like even though i feel terrible at the moment i i have to be doing something i have to be focused on something or i just get bored maybe there are other people out there like that but i just have a really difficult time resting and settling down i just can't do it i think my voice is uh okay enough for a video yeah it sounds pretty terrible i understand but it's good enough for a commentary i think i'm not overly concerned about it either because i don't have any pre-existing conditions or anything like that it's just annoying because it's like completely sapped all my energy and i'm coughing all the time and my throat is absolutely killing me and the worst part about it is it might be a bit tmi this but i've got a deviated septum so one of my nostrils is a lot smaller than the other so i can't really breathe in through my nose very well and when i'm trying to sleep i have to keep my mouth open to breathe because otherwise i start to get uncomfortable and i feel like i'm not getting enough air and when you've got a sore throat if you sleep with your mouth open it makes that worse then you wake up so i haven't really had that much sleep either over the last couple days which has sucked a bit but i did get a little bit last night woke up feeling a bit better today phoebe's gone down my temperature was up to 100.9 at one point which was fun just absolutely sweating like crazy but today i felt much better so i think i'm already over the worst of it really which is good but we'll see like tomorrow and the day after if i start to feel a bit better then videos will probably continue as usual but if i get worse again then i don't know if there's going to be much content next week just because i might not feel up to making it we'll have to wait and see it is what it is i know a lot of people have been asking but there is a little update for you now in terms of gaming news there hasn't really been that much like in the last week or so but there were a couple things that i noticed that you guys might be interested in based on the games that i make content for on here so the first one is a game called off the grid and this one i'm going to keep my eye on because neil blomkamp is involved with it and he's a movie director scriptwriter whatever he made one of my favorite movies called district 9 which is still really good even by today's standards even the cgi holds up very reminiscent of like half-life original halo vibes at times and he's got together with a studio called godzilla games and they're working on a new battle royale game now i know battle royale a lot of people are just sick of it this one sounds kind of interesting though it's for next-gen only so it's going to be pc ps5 xbox series x and s there's a little trailer for it it's gonna be 150 players but there's going to be a big focus on pve at the same time while you're doing the pvp stuff in the form of story missions so you'll be taking part in the story pve while also doing pvp stuff not many more details than that but it sounds a little bit different and they were implying that the decisions that you make during a match will impact everyone else's game and their story it's also said to have customization crafting trading and blomkamp described it as battle royale 2.0 with deep player progression an innovative approach to the br genre and a deep narrative experience a lot of fluff there of course a lot of marketing spiel but i like blomkamp i like the movies that he's made he seems like a genuine gamer as well we'll see how that one turns out and the other bit of interesting gaming news that i saw was about halo infinite now season two has just launched it's called lone wolves and i have to be honest it was really quite underwhelming and apparently it's going to go on until november but there was something weird that happened during a broadcast that the dev team did it was interrupted by this weird like video transmission and they just ignored it and there's all these rumors that a studio called certain affinity who have worked on several of the halo games in the past are actually making a fully fledged standalone battle royale for halo infinite nothing official has come out for this at all it's all just rumors leak speculation at the moment and i know several years ago the team said hey we're never going to do a br for this game but i think a lot of people feel like it would be a really good fit for halo and it would be an excellent way of getting new players into the franchise and people who maybe feel like infinite doesn't have enough content or it's boring they've moved on from arena shooters that kind of thing so i think personally it's a high probability that it's actually going to happen there's no smoke without fire and i've seen a lot of smoke regarding a halo battle royale in the last couple months or so seems to be ramping up i'd love to play it i think it'd be really exciting the universe just seems like a good fit you've got the odst with the drop pods they're already established maybe you play as odst maybe you play as just regular soldiers rather than spartans i don't know what it looks like but i'd love to try it if it's real fingers crossed i'd give it a shot but let me know what you think down below if they did a halo battle royale what would you want to see in it how would it play out and that's about all that i wanted to discuss in this video really as i mentioned depending on how i get on with kovid's there may or may not be that many videos in the week i think i'll definitely do something on the 11th though for the king kong versus godzilla thing that's coming for warzone because i'm just really interested in that it might just be like a short live stream or a short video or something i don't know but i'm intrigued on how that's going to play out because they've shown some snippets of in-game stuff for that and it looks like godzilla and king kong are actually on the map and they're massive so could be kind of fun but with that said guys thank you for watching as always thank you so much for your support appreciate you being there for me if you enjoyed the vid leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more i'll see you next time bye
