okay boys i've got my ghillie suit i've got my ghillie hdr sniper rifle i've got my cool looking tactical pistol i'm gonna play modern warfare ground war and attempt to blend in hiding plain sight and snipe people without them seeing me enjoy right we are back in verdansk it's been a while at the riverside nonetheless [Applause] this is an awesome intro though i think they're gonna do a lot more of this in modern warfare too ground wall's gonna be big i feel like it's gonna be a big game mode maybe i'm wrong we'll see okay how about this here next to a rock yeah not really blending in very well but now you've seen me yet i'm gonna move up a bit and see if i can find somewhere a bit more bushy this is gonna be my only contribution to playing the objective in this match tasty little headshot there i love that there's a bit more bush around here what if i go pro next to this car reloading makes me feel like i'm playing all gillied up i was a guy in there you had no idea i'm here did you i'm in the shadows major muffin what are you doing [Applause] no get down you don't have a ghillie suit on major muffins please you're giving me away i managed to almost get around to the top of the map here and this is really kind of similar colors to the gilly suit i mean that guy didn't say anything that guy was looking like right at me i mean i know that ghost was like running through the smoke there hello i'm invisible it's working i'm gonna use my cruise missiles oh there's a lot of people around me [Applause] is that guy coming in he's going right next to the building come on i was hiding behind the door dude you just jumped over it random vehicle smoke yes maybe they can't see me as well shot out there didn't they all right mate oh what what the hell's happening here oh they're throwing grenades okay that must have been one that i killed one more there i swear that they can't actually see me i just got the gunship i don't think i've ever used that oh no i'm dead bulbous man he got me with the shotgun and the flash fair play how's this gunship work then that's really low down all right here we go i've got three weapons another one over here oh that's a lot of splash damage like this 40 millimeter pretty decent one i've got a 25 millimeter yes yeah i don't think i've literally ever used this my killstreaks are always like uav cruise missile and then vtol or something like that or like cruise missile veto [Music] ah they ran out of fuel no one tried to shoot me down though but the veto there folks i'm doing some gilly sniping again one kill i'll take it oh no it's not my piece off no this is pretty sneaky here isn't it look i'm gonna blend in nice here i don't think that guy saw me good chance to move though here i want to get in that house now i can't get the rocks kinda [Applause] excuse me hello dice what was going on there [Applause] oh that dude just rode me with a shotgun the game's really over we're gonna win i think i think it kind of i think it kind of worked look at that plane let's try another one right then this is boneyard in it that's the bow zone yeah this is kind of brown so i should be able to blend in well come with me i'll put the proper sniper scope on as well so see if that makes a difference and attack laser improve the ads speed a bit my squad mate was on this plane wing and i thought it was a cool spot so they're friendlies i've come up here not going to blend it well here though but i'm thinking that's the first kill in the bag i'm thinking it might be a nice little head glitch here [Applause] stacking them up already look at that is that javelin where's that going to the moon apparently i'm going to run past that goodbye i'm going to try and push this right flank because i could only really see so much up there and someone on the team has dropped the white phosphorus so this will actually be like really nice cover to move almost at their spawn here like all the way around the back let me just wait here for a couple more seconds okay we'll go should be behind a couple here there's one have you seen me how did you not see me i'll get this one i'm dead mate you reload gave you away you don't often hear that dear owlette they're running across here they did i think they actually spotted me though because they turned around after that slide there oh my god there's a guy right there they're blending just as well as i am the only thing is my scope is uh gonna give me away isn't it just the glint [Applause] oh i was not paying attention to the uav there at all ruined try this left flank again [Applause] where'd you come from oh phosphorus okay that's useful again there's a bloody uh apc there i'd kill it with one c4 no it's not that good he's a cruise missile maybe where is it it's that there isn't it [Applause] bang oh it's a one-hit kill on that nice look how sneaky i am there's a guy behind this thing here but i'm like right on the edge they're coughing a stone and push it run away oh that's stupid snapchat grenades hopefully that airstrikes not for me sure i just saw someone move through there this little double i knew there was someone there from the roof classic spotting warzone that wasn't a kill game what uh must have just uh gone a bit high [Applause] [Music] oh there's a new coming okay so because we captured all their points luke's gonna end the game come on beat me we're gonna die anyway what's the point [Applause] nuclear missile inbound it's not just gonna kill all of us just wipe out everyone fair enough okay this intro this might be better at the airport look at this have i even played ground war on this map i don't know such a nice skin as well isn't it i put the cronin on again because i think maybe the glint from the bigger scope is gonna just give me you away too much and it's kind of counterintuitive to the point of the video i reckon i can find a decent hiding spot on this we've taken the lead already you can still use the scope though even though it's not zoomed in oh no they jumped out if i could get to the that's not a player is it if i can get to the flanks maybe there's somewhere i could uh hide in there you can't get upstairs in this version of the map i think it's for the best though don't even get on the roof either you know warzone you can use the repel there was a little apc there not that that's going to do any good dropping there's another two there apparently looking at the uav i can't see him though because of all that smoke how cool is that where are they i was close right if i just prone here there's a bit of foliage there i'm not going to see him clint providing i don't make too much movement though might actually be okay here let's try rockets going off is that a friendly ap yeah it is god i thought that was an enemy abc there now looks at the minimum i was going to do the jurassic park thing we don't move yeah these guys have just got no idea i'm i don't know here it looks like though that's an enemy a pc want to shoot that guy another one another one oh he spotted me what do you look like man uh actually i'll kind of stand out there a bit don't i that was a nice little kill streak i feel like it was kind of working there [Applause] i'll get a clap then [Applause] it's the animations on the hdr i think it makes it so satisfying i've got some killstreaks here to use haven't i let me go cruise myself first there's one guy near me i'm gonna die i think let's go for this truck here there's two there look at the veto i like the veto because after it comes in you can like have it protect you triple kill very nice [Applause] should be able to tell it where to go you're friendly i'm just gonna press it and have it follow me coughing gave you away it comes over here it can be my overwatch from my door see it's right there on the minimum just killing people trying to do a sneaky flank here there's no way someone will see me here because there's so much green and brown there's another one i don't really want to go up there that pistol is sick man reloading [Applause] did you know oh my god that's embarrassing hi dorothy [Applause] sorry dorothy and an abc cruiser abc well she's gone inside the parking lot this guy instead oh i reckon that player was about to kill me then that was close pistol time here we go there's one there's do yes before john wick again man ain't taking d on my watch look at this laser light show here obviously someone back there is that how i look when i've got my attack laser on [Applause] am i really giving myself away though reloading a pc there how is that not a kill [Applause] difficult to move in it when you get stunned like that you can't really do much just hope that the other person messes up there's another muffin here count muffin you need to watch out there buddy you're a bit exposed [Music] he dead come on i'm not gonna pick enemies i love it when they run into it like that i think muffins dead you got the win i can't believe you know guys though it took me so long to start playing this game more often again i'm posting videos on it this is actually sick let's see the final kill he's got the javelin oh he's gone that's literally a one-hit kill isn't it how do we do 49 not bad at all i think the ghillie suit tactic kind of worked definitely if you've got the no glint scope on as well they just don't notice issue right i'm off like the video or baby yoda gets ejected into space see you later bye
