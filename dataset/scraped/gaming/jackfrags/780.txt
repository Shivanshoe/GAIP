everyone hope you're doing well today I've got two of the most intense hunt showdown matches that we've played so far I think this game is massively underrated and if it wasn't on your radar already maybe this video will help to put it there the first round on with Adam and we're pretty sure that we eliminate every other player in the server with us but is there anyone left and in the second game Tommy joins us and it starts with a standoff at a barn and it ends with a mad dash to the extraction whilst another team are chasing us down I hope you guys like this sit back and enjoy okay this clues were taken a big meatball crow head crows southeast fire let's go this way I will find someone here I saw the crows there another clear but bosses at lot babes probably where those guys are going the crows coming flew right to left so yeah I'm guessing 120 where that came from I grow zombies in the middle of the swamp yeah yeah we'll just need to be careful when we cross that's we're quite exposed yeah hopefully they're not looking behind him in front of us up yeah she was just running around with an axe yeah you want to push or yeah well it's definitely somebody here yeah she run all the way around the corner head shot dead nice pop load there is a lover here it's gonna careful though because it they could shoot you through that don't know found a friend I'm gonna lure well yeah it's really risky this I'll do the risk eight I'm dead I'm gonna see the guy my girls again [Music] hmm oh did you see that no I'm sorry she was here I had a lined up and I clicked and I hadn't reloaded my gun are no you might be supplied with those boxes yeah so I'm thinking oh that's lucky oh wow okay just keep your head down cuz I only lost a small health bars I did we got and it's still over there I just saw some movement back there that we've got we've got guys like just on the other side here really like to the to the West I can hear them running around are we around to the south now I'm crawling down here Adam gonna come in he's Sutton's in here though isn't she he can get behind us Bonnie yeah Crouch walk he's above us he's in the boss room [Music] you don't want to stay in there it's just one guy isn't it sounds like it he's got a friend to the west I recognize here this board hmm I think that's his friends the West old hole post on the right yep it's be really sneaky think he's right there you know right in front of us Adam this is he falling back hit him hit him with the maasen find a bomb watch out for backtracking you downed him it's not fun pushing friends they're glad they're right there oh yeah by the wagon down nice job I'll be clear for a sec yeah we've still got the guy that was inside the bus I reckon we can get this guy yeah I've got four hundred dollars i thirsty that's a desert 100 but that's behind us no that was ours in front somewhere oh is it yeah I think so okay okay I believe you no eyes on there oh yeah CMD attacked him good shot good shot I think one of them's shotguns the guy that was inside the bus maybe water here what enemy yeah I heard running how is he not dead one stand in front of us I've gotta reload those are dead I mean I hit you in the head a bit good spot there wrote it down well there's a zombie there oh I see Adams like they're running into the boss room it's quite far away that down okay I see his friend we're just hit unless it was a zombie it was tasty and yeah for those dogs I could hear them that's it where is she I'm gonna need that Adam watch out yeah yep sticky bomb oh yeah got a nice wall plate Wow that we've killed three groups that's good still very much mean there's groups at large then and you can only go down one more time no I draw because I've got too small and too big health bar so I can go down under the time okay if we kill the the boss I'll get one of my big health bars back keep me clear there that's hard to know now the assassin might ruin me I'll be fine lonely oh dude wasn't this your concertina bomb that you put down oh did somebody run into well this is excellent I've been looted though yeah all right I'm sitting on fire [Music] you might come on up here that's gonna help out of answers all fire again complete flu I'm gonna get like a side down right it split into two one more shoulder um I just had an explosion but there's definitely another group breathe kill this quick any dad come on stand up got it got it [Music] nice I've got my one of my big health bar backwards that really helps if we have to fight another group I had an explosion to the south you hear that as well well they're doing the butcher they were doing the butcher all right do you want to go to it's not far because they're gonna have to come up anyway for the exit look what oh yeah right well they could go south yeah interesting what we do we take the vanish like the the clues and go towards them we'll be able to like look through the wall and see where they are we know they're the last two alive yeah we'll get it first and yeah we've all got it first but if they leave I don't think they'll leave because they don't know that all of the others in the server are dead I think they would likely stay at picture crematorium I hate that go away imagine having that in your face it's not the one spin let's see everyone no Sam I'll find you they could go directly south for that exit and they could leave right now so we need to book it is it to be picked at the bar you there's another one there though well so it could only be one player oh there we go Count von borcke you just find a lowly chomps in severe I want us to come that is if they if they gets the extract before we get to them it's all for naught you should die excite a little bit you can see where they are well I can see them on the map as well I mean they're parallel with us yeah they're ahead of us the p40 they're on this road they're on the road right here Zach see for you you split a bit where's he gone down here right there running busy right down there tagged in is that that tree Adam across the river just in that direction mist under the bridge I think that'll relay one down across the bridge is it here on the bridge going under the bridge over here gotta reload down nice hot place that that's everyone on the server death jeez man come on Luke this guy here she just came running towards you that one well played for the Sun I've done that the exits from here this Springfield sniper turned out really well right if you can use it yeah I can't wrestle with the scope on it I haven't got elven eyes like you don't wow GG that was really good fun somebody saw bait in this building next that you shot the zombie next to me though it's full of salt right above a second heron overthrow the firebombing through the window one down how ones on the roof are they over here I'm gonna hill frags him time to go he went back into the big red building got one down then yeah I got one down there

they are I'm one hit down like one hit dead we have to run northeast we could just run tank one could actually just run west southwest away from them you know why I'm one hit dead from or any source of damage yeah we should go we should go where's the exit we're heading towards it now bottom left yeah yeah left yeah we'll just head Arsenal they'd probably be chasing us you could do a quick tap
