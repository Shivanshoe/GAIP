hi guys hope you're well today we are checking out a brand new gameplay video of the day before so i covered this game in january when they just released this gameplay trailer out of nowhere and it kind of looked like a mix of the division the last of us couple other inspirations in there too but today about an hour ago now ign released a brand new exclusive gameplay trailer which expands on what the game is this is a mmo survival shooter as the developers call it and there are zombies a bit of dayz bit of division a bit of last of us crafting fighting that kind of thing and as you can see here they've got some quite impressive mud physics going on i thought we'd just watch this today react to it see what the game has to offer obviously there are vehicles here physics abound large open scale environment here too there's also fuel on the right and this mud deformation it's a little hard to see because it's only in 1080p but it kind of reminds me of snow runners or spin tires you know that kind of thing it appears that you could potentially get stuck in the mud maybe you can get winches and try and pull yourself out or something like that we simply don't know looks like there's a gas station up ahead and the dude just popped two of his tires that's unfortunate and the car's actually slanted now too they're comparing the right and the left wheels here you got two flat tires mate there's something up ahead there that looks like a fresh car wreck to me because the engine is still steaming away and this dude must be his friend armored to the teeth with that helmet on looks like they both got aks as well big backpack there checking out this police car oh that's got a nice sound to it doesn't it oh they've alerted some zombies here switch to the pistol oh just got tagged in the back so when this trailer came out originally in january a lot of people were like is this even real because it looks like a single player game and in the past typically when people have attempted something like this massive multiplayer survival there's just a load of problems with it bugs lag all sorts of stuff and i mean me watching this i'm still i'm still a bit unsure if the final product will be as polished or as triple a as this looks to all me how many players is this going to be we just don't know open world survival game i mean i'm optimistic the developers of this are called effentastic or just fantastic i guess if you want to call it that there's the inventory system there and they've only made a couple games before i don't know how big their studio is and how coronavirus has affected things but i hope that they can get it right players moving in here to get some loot by the looks of it and this is set at christmas time so it's got that frozen in time feel that the division has and i think that's where a lot of the comparisons come from that original gameplay trailer though was set like downtown somewhere this is obviously out in the sticks a bit more players looting here got a big toolbox there or something [Music] i have to wait a few seconds to get the loot cassette recorder and a tape there i'm cassette player what else we got here cash register surely there's some cash in there there's some kind of a key card and what look like a tape player or something where we're going next so i guess he's going to try and fix these wheels here reinflate the tires 60 oh okay car repair kit look at that we just built a car repair kit there from the materials is that one back up now not quite one at the back looks like if you have vehicles you'll have to manage them repair them there we go cars looking straight again now very nice that fuel's going to start going down again though in the bottom right in the bottom left we've got temperature food water i don't know there by the looks of it you have to manage those i guess you could loot those vehicles it does seem it'll have a day night cycle too crossing over this treacherous bridge here i just absolutely heard myself over that i wonder how long the day night cycle will be though that's a question that i would have to ask well they're getting out again they spot a barn what we got there's no one there the lights are on though you're gonna go closer yeah he's getting back in or maybe they'll find some better loot here or something here we go i like how in this game play demo they don't have the fake comms that they had in the last one you know what ubisoft always used to do in their trailers they don't have it in this one sunrise farm a bit of destruction there for you and they've got destruction it seems or a little bit on that fence this wheat and barley here some nice physics there too you could stealthy way in i guess if there were some enemy players in that building hopefully they wouldn't notice it moving and a voltage system there they're just showing off all the mechanics here really aren't they i got vaccinated did that cause the zombie outbreak i'm pretty sure if you get the covered 19 vaccine he wouldn't turn into a zombie oh that remains to be seen there are some zombies around this is stealthy element of the gameplay i wish they'd have uploaded this in 1440p or 4k because the bitrate is just awful it's good enough though isn't it you can tell what's going on i think nice little vault there's a big windmill in the background there can you loot that box yeah what did you get a camera it's like an old 1980s camcorder i wonder what you can do with that maybe just sell it junk or something or you could make your own zombie movie in a zombie apocalypse has anyone done that film yet that's a good idea that get jj abrams on the phone what's this it's a mannequin as oh they've tripped the alarm i see that's kind of faded what one three four eight so you gotta guess what it is no they got it wrong oh here come the zombies nice interiors here that's banging the door these zombies aren't that stupid are we going to see a hoard or something [Applause] that's kind of like how i am when i play with the controller oh zombies in the barley oh the guns do sound really good though get through that top window maybe they could lose it now there's going upstairs i don't know what all these mannequins are about though what's that there's another one there grandma what it's a bit narrative or something nothing in there i saw this nicked a police car not very inconspicuous in a survival game really is it but i suppose you do always get players like that right remember when h1z1 added the police car i was absolutely mad i think these guys have been alerted by the shooting in the alarm maybe oh they've not noticed them run away [Music] yeah they've gone in [Music] and the bunker's got a lock on it didn't this guy yeah he's gonna be able to open it isn't he got the key card thing at the gas station or whatever so they're gonna escape while that other team checks the building it's a massive underground bunker oh is it the witch from left for dead no that's the end that's it cool well that was fun i enjoyed that let me know your thoughts down below guys thank you for watching this was a quick look at the brand new
