all right let's try that again shall we so hi guys and welcome to call of duty warzone season two we're gonna be live today playing for a couple hours with study tactical brit and westy really looking forward to this one we've got some big changes to the game balance across the board a couple of new guns as well there's some new pois with like ai and stuff that you can mess around with so i'm looking forward to it it's gonna be really good fun of course we've got a new battle pass as well here some new stuff in the store if i even bought the battle pass i don't think i have [Applause] claimed those bad boys and we got to tier 17. i think that's based on how i did last last time i can just skip this can't i there we go um yeah and if you guys pick up the battle pass or buy anything in the store do consider using my creative code jack frags add support and i'll get a bit of kickback from that um it's a great way to help support me also a big thanks to call of duty for sponsoring this one i am a cod partner so i think what we're going to try first is vanguard royale because they've got bomber planes and there's like this new weird gas stuff this yellow gas and like gas ammo there's a ton of new stuff i haven't played it yet so it's going to be real interesting to see like how it actually plays what the new stuff is like in practice how it feels are the new guns any good did did i even get them then in the battle pass we've got level 15 so that's one of the new ones the kg m40 and where is the next one it's that one isn't it the whitley so we'll take a look at those after this first match what's up kid hey kb hey garrett hey santiago welcome guys thank you for coming along hey check up ali oh yeah guys by the way if you do use my code in the store tweet me a picture of it or send me a screenshot and i'll include it in a video in the future hello andreas what's up jeff sam [Music] welcome guys thank you for coming along it's my first game of the day as well that was going to be interesting hey fubar from orlando looking forward to the new season what are you most looking forward to i think really the balance changes are the most interesting thing to me [Music] where are the new locations oh the okay so is it the yellow see these little yellow things on the map it might be those don't know it's all it's all new this is genuine first impressions i haven't had early access to this i haven't played it at all today oh yeah first game nick thank you for the five chris thank you for becoming a member hey kyle what's up hey kid what's up i leaf guys thank you so much for coming along today appreciate you all being here you're all absolute legends i think tomorrow's going to be playing with like stone mountain and acolyte later tonight maybe but we wanted to start a bit earlier because it's gone live like what half an hour ago i like the new music as well we've got new music it's banging hello we're going for the airfield the you want to go and get a bomber straight away or try soon oh yeah i think it's going to be everyone there fighter plane fighter playing fight they're all fighters they're all marked as fighters guys it's quite laggy i have to be honest [Applause] a couple of people need to just pass away and it's fine have they changed the lighting becky can you drive can you fly under me and pick me up yeah yeah hang on hang on there's someone here though um yeah they've changed the lighting guys the suns.com there come on look come pick me up the sun has gone the sun's like way reduced can you oh yeah you can look straight at the sun yeah oh my god i'm gonna do that in real life no no dude i would not advise doing that in real life in you jack there is people in the forest yeah well i've got like it feels like i've got 500 ping right now so yeah it does feel that way doesn't it yeah yeah i can't see a single bomb maybe they spawn in later i've got the new gun here guys i think the servers might be a little bit uh strong a bit short jackie [Applause] so they definitely reduce the sun but when you get in a plane it's like the map is in dark mode actually you know this this uh mg feels pretty good you know just a ground loop build as well like it didn't have any recoil on it at all i was married this is really strange i tell you what though now you said it lucky the colors looks way better yeah it's way more vibrant isn't it the colors look a lot better the goo lag is not laggy i can confirm it's absolutely fine in the gulag but not on the map already already on green yeah they changed it didn't they come in is this so that we all die instantly i'm on a redeployed balloon down oh my god no the redeploy balloon launches you i can hear them underneath it launches you up in the air no no i mean it like physically propels you in the direction you're looking oh well so when you get to the top you better be looking in the right right direction survive yeah they'll rejoin you yeah completely change the lighting it's fascinating are you guys in the bunker are you not i'm just above it i can go in right hang on a minute there's the load out here i'm going to grab this new gun i think have they oh no there's men on the loadout men men yeah that's right count the loadout boys camp it fascinating oh hello i'm in the bunker so they've completely changed the colors i've got this pds thing guys i've got the pds oh you've got the personal defense thing oh nice that's cool right i'm just going to grab my gear oh god i'm dead so this is a completely new area yeah all the bunkers well they're underneath those uh little like the metal lids that were all around you know the video that geeky pastimes did yeah showed you where all the locations were how do you get is it up on is it close to the airfield jack or is it on your side it's not yeah it's not where you are now cam [Applause] they didn't mention the lighting in the patch notes no they didn't maybe they've not mentioned it because i mean i've got nvidia i've got my what's it called control panel stuff on um it's a pleasant surprise but there were men around here jack yeah there was none i'm on the hatch now i got a kill with the new gun no it's fine now i've not had problems with ping now it's not laggy anymore yeah it may just be the very start of the match they've got some problems the host do you know what this is giving me this is giving me vibes of the uh oh what were they called uh not the bunkers the silos on the dansk that's what it reminds me of and there's a guy here mark they've completely deleted all of the haze from there's on red marker red marker they've just raised as well right now right in the open trying to find my way that teacher than me anymore nice you guys can help me sir when you're not busy yeah are you in the middle over there yeah 120 fov on cons on ps4 and ps5 allegedly i don't believe that oh no they wouldn't they wouldn't do that it's a bug that's not true there's no way it could be a bug right jack was it a lay on purple they're in the compound sniper armor yes uh study for the pdf we need to wait for that oh i just found someone this one sick i finished your one thank you so much loving i'm so confused about the lighting change why i mean i've got my nvidia filters on and it looks like it's so good it's like two hundred percent vibrancy it looks incredible i can actually see people i wonder if they did the same thing they did on rebirth they got like one team to just go over the entire lighting for all the map and stuff maybe the baked lighting oh yeah that's that's what it looks like they they fully cooked it yeah it's half baked before half baked off more contrast and more saturation and less shadow yeah i can see everyone in the plants as well like really easily i reckon they've done it so that you can pick people out in the skin sits your skin blends in quite well jack the bunny right next to the trees yeah basically why is it pinged in the sky though as well they redeploy balloons do you want to try one here oh yeah let's do this yeah we're gonna go there you wanna go in look towards it when you go up the balloon because it will throw you off at the top where do you want to go no anyone can go oh it's a zipper oh god whoa we can just land you can just land on people oh there's people down here people down they're shooting at you i can't mark it because it's putting my ping in the sky for some reason and i've got no plates so okay maybe that was a bad idea i'm sorry sorry that was good i'm coming to you you're having people run over towards you where you're from uh like i can't get they're just on purple jack on purple only play it your parachute moves faster and you can cut it later now yeah yeah later too oh god i don't see them unless they're in that building they may well be in that purple building jet okay yeah he's just opened the door he's just opened the door and he shut it again yeah he's looking at me out the window he's got combat scout i'm on the way over boys yeah i'm going to need some assistance another one in the building yeah i seen him right here nice one nice one he was not happy about that the new assault rifle is not too bad even as a base thing you know it's not too bad it's all right did you make a build for it no no it's just literally like level zero jack and i've got a couple of kills with it already it's not too bad if you go up the top of here and look around look how many balloons there are there's mentors there was loads of people by the eye on us here could we look at that balloon over there imagine getting on that one and there's one a peak as well miles [Music] image oh nice one jack well played i'm going to use the balloon to go over and kill him again well there's another one in here maybe is there one more am i going crazy let's go baby it's actually quite cool that's actually like throwing yourself across i've thrown myself off stud that wasn't a teamwork so i don't know move it was it not i don't think so also did you guys see the change of the sideways parachute it goes much further well no forward parachute is now the same speed as sideways so you don't need to see the sidewalls anymore oh that i mean my life is very high quality i know just pick somewhere let's go i just want to like explore soon there's a lot of new stuff do you want to see if we can find another one of those bunkers there's another one over here somebody in my chat said that this is what calvera looked like when you played with hdr on so he's suggesting that they basically merge the color setting they just figured it out did they they just they just did it there's something there red marker hdr don't climb the rocks though yeah i was asking well we can go up this next balloon and we can carry on shooting our way across apparently it was a team wipe sorry cam i've got it wrong my channel is really good at correcting me so that's fine i think they're really good at correcting all of us chat we're just terrible at what we do did you know the [Laughter] i love this i think the kill records are going to be like broken aren't they with these oh yeah yeah for sure because you could go anywhere could you imagine standing next to one of those sniping somebody 300 meters away and then immediately just switching going push kill oh you can get so close to the ground now right okay hang on a minute come up to the top of the hill with me it's up here this is where you get into the bunker it's a little bit naughty this i'm enjoying this the update yeah yeah yeah the balloons are a big w already i mean i'm liking this right way down oh that's a bit of a drop it's fine oh yellow oh no no you land wait you land on this mattress and don't die oh what yeah you can just drop down and look you land on that mattress mattresses studs is [Applause] goes i haven't let us down a rabbit hole i promise can we like activate the gas down here oh no that's a different place isn't it it's the factory that you can do yeah come on down one go we're all gonna die when we come out the top stunning it's fine no tag it's fine it's fine i've gone with lackey oh okay instant pains of east bounds one down one that was playing oh drop down if you need to let me drop down if you need to it's too late it's too late for me not actually seeing any of them he's killed me yeah yeah they they spread out they definitely spread out right did we finish oh no wait there's two of them down over by the swimming pool there's only one left as far as i can tell are we sure i could take a spare yeah i've gotten on there thank you i mean you know john's going no just throw it if you got stunned yeah ready okay so it's not have we already had fun no it's not just hide in a hole and hits no no they'll be looking at it though wait wait there's two of them down by the swimming pool go for lucky there you go behind you jackie one pick on one trick no no i couldn't say i at all that shot you started he must have just been hiding there so hang on a minute is there only one in one out to all of these bunkers no no there was the first one we went in there was another way right okay so some of them will probably be one in one out jack already with the 10 kills soon enough you know i mean i'm going to lose the school like is everyone dead oh yes the pressure's on now isn't it yeah you'll be fine don't worry we all believe in you all believe uh clutch or kick jack edition anybody else anybody else's game running better because i would say minus mine's running oh well better no just the same i'd say we've seen about five to ten frame increase [Applause] i mean is this war zones operation help health [Applause] mid hiccup i don't know obviously they've just announced war zone 2 so we fixed the current one yeah but not moving on coming soon if this doesn't work out and they make some changes that people don't like we have a fullback plan uh well i i like the color up that the the mac color update looks pretty awesome yeah i don't know why they didn't mention it maybe it was because they didn't want to be like oh look we made it better because some people might not like it so they've just left it out and just left it as like a yeah we did it here and you're ready for the battlefield lose and your fight is over fight your way out of this or capture the objective ah i'm lucky dude unlucky and jack's first death my updating playlists why is there an update already probably there's probably something good jumpers he's back if maybe they've got a little bit they probably forgot to enable something and they've just turned it on or they turned something off that was causing that lag spm what what rank am i i've got a new a new barrel for the uh assault rifle but it's all about i aim down sight speed i don't really want the first attachment on the lmg is uh there's a firing booster lovely i've got the sakura 40 round for the new assault rifle poggers let's go i'm definitely not playing with hdr on because i disabled you just you disappear well it wouldn't work with my graphics card whatever you disappeared it quite a good sound that when you go through the battle pass ranks yeah i like a little bit naughty in it do i have enough are there any blueprints in the store for the new guns no there's a valentine's day one is that one of the new guns no unfortunately not it's all owen gunn and type 11 which seems like a bit of a miss valentine's day [Music] hey special holiday commercial holiday what's the point of it well money jack yeah but for that for the corporations i mean yeah of course sainsbury's 12 quid for six roses 12. well here's the thing right that you've spent your whole life getting like oh 10p off here 20p off here and then sayings we're just like we know you need this now is the time you're spending that money that you saved over the last five years shopping here i ain't spending any time on it i ain't spending any money on it it goes much slower when you uh buy the tears you don't get a sick beat there's a new watch yeti is going to be a yeti easter egg probably there's a lot of there's a lot of um yeti references i put some double xp on so i can grind the new guns i'm actually really liking this i'm quite impressed with this i mean game one didn't want to make me you know in fact although what i will say is quite strange is that they seem to have added a lot of the competitive settings to vanguard [Music] did you look at the patch notes lackey it did say they wanted battle royale and vanguard royale to be very distinct separate experiences exactly but surely you'd want but why would you add bombers to vanguard royale if you're gonna make that the the banter space but also delete stuns i don't understand the the method behind that yeah it's a it's a bit strange it's a clamps andrew but they put weapon inspect on yeah yeah the weapons have got inspect now all the vanguard guns my streaming pc is like a bit laggy today i don't know what's happened i haven't changed anything i hate that like sometimes computer hardware can be so finicky like you don't change anything and then all of a sudden pain it looks fine like it looks watchable it's just like dropping frames every now and again so i have to look after that look into that after the stream hopefully it's fine though guys hopefully it looks okay do let me know hi jack from your basement thanks cameron i don't have a basement you're in the wrong house what's up blondo i feel like we're seeing jack behind the card yeah when my streaming pc all of a sudden just decides to ruin me yeah i mean you know it's live the gas [Applause] the early bomber on the map as well yeah isn't it the lighting looks so much better yeah it really does it looks really nice they've just deleted all of the fuzzy haze it's so good anyways a bit i think if we want to get there it was forwarding sideways it's the same now isn't it yeah yeah i guess well do you want to test it i'm gonna go sideways okay i'll go forward pull parachute let's go baby you don't believe me we are going i think we are going to the same speed look west yeah we're going exactly exactly the same speed stuff where are you yeah yeah same speed let's go with us he's gonna shoot you yeah yeah yeah we're just gonna keep going you're gonna fly because we can't keep nothing keep cooking keep coming you get a little bit further when you cut yeah hey matty what's up vendetta hello mass reuben what's up blitz alicia thank you for coming guys the distance here landing to pick you up is going to be i think these guys aren't going to make it they went too low yeah there's another team they're trying to i think we've got it right you're going to get that first lucky i think you are yeah yeah yeah mate my flight path skills are yeah so can we get four people in this i think we can let's find out wait jack you want oh god i'm in i'm on the front gunner all right i'm on the back gunner yeah we're all in oh yes oh god the camera's ruined oh god there's an actual bomber screen that's wow that's what you could do a carpet bomb like it yeah yeah yeah yeah i could carpet are you guys all in gunners yeah oh there we go wait wait i thought yeah i can't see anything oh you can escape all the bombing the bombing run with lackey i'm going to take us over b destroy the vehicle boom boom boom nothing phenomenal yeah it is yeah yes it recharges unfortunately this takes a boatload of time to turn it's fine no this is this is how it should be well the mouse is really weird it's not too bad because they jacob underneath like sometimes down and down let's get ready i get like a uav yeah we all get a uav oh sick okay on the air let's go baby i can't see oh oh god there's so many people right [ __ ] my right is that another bomber i mean it's got like no splash damage oh my god this under this underneath gun it's not the one let me tell you oh my god the plane can i can i hit that plane find us a vehicle we're gonna take the other bomber boys get ready directly ahead yeah that's it tail enemies on the tail i can't hit the bomber it won't hit it it's got like massive drop off there we go there we go ruining legs disabled he's out there out rune is fun yes although they're moving off on there's a there's a fighter on our tail oh yeah do something oh he got out he failed he checked it out this is insane i can't believe that this is in warsaw again i'm watching and watching what's in the bombs a disabled vehicle oh you didn't get the kills now okay fly over airfield what i'm going to do boys i'm going to land what are you going to get i'll get the repair tool out how do we there's no repair lucky wrong game oh we're getting our loadout no no no no no yeah unless he can do a flyby pickup once he got it into everyone it's i can see the bombs come out it's great i've just destroyed some i destroyed three loadout drops no oh yeah you can do that i've just destroyed three load out drops i made it oh my god no wow it's an a truck okay let us know when we need to bail lucky you can see the health of the bottom cam oh yeah you can probably little icons they're like you can only fire the bombs when the plane is level all right okay so you have to really commit to it then yes like this truck below us so he's about to get ruined i can't shoot that i get to do like two lots of damage and then we're about to shut down there's a guy behind this for the plane he's been with a plane i could actually shoot the guy by going up over here i was having was that fire that's a fire i think the plane needs a bit of work and i mean it's fun it is live it's crashed my game like the mouse feels a bit weird um thank god he's flying you're supposed to play on controller guys gosh didn't you know no sorry another run bomber straight in front get ready to bail christian bale let me know lackey let me know i don't believe that i blew up three loadouts that's sick i think the gun is actually hitting the inside of my fuselage sometimes should i should i try and blow up a buy station yeah can i bomb this i can bomb the factory yeah no you can bomb the loadouts that are on it lackey [Music] just dealt explosive damage to somebody oh god how we get let's go bell bell garage you can like clip into yourself on that bottom gun as well yeah i i kept on shooting my own window i think maybe that's right it was like i don't know how to deal with this why that was pretty cool though like as a casual experience gentlemen the bombers respawned yes we got a misery spawn we go they respond let's go i mean back to run away come on you're back in the menu right we'll pull out and we'll do this again yeah yeah you hit something i down somebody i destroyed three loadout drops can you come jackie yeah so you need to be if you if you want to be on the back gun or the front guard you have to get a second jack okay i'll take the bomb if it's if it's full pain and westy can have the the back wait hang on a minute i think i've got it a little bit naughty though luckily for me there is another way in through the [Laughter] oh guys um that's a shame i was enjoying that hopefully there's not a problem with the bombers where it makes you crash but there it is [Music] interesting i mean i never thought i'd see the day that something like that was in warzone like it feels like it's you know starting to borrow a bit of that battlefield dna [Music] i need to look at the new guns don't i what is this loadout i don't even know why i built that i just built stupid loadouts for thumbnails sometimes [Music] the ball gonna have the highest fatality rate maybe that's why i crashed that's a good one i like that where's that new is it a new smg or was it an assault rifle kgm40 which i've got is it an lmg begins with w doesn't it there we go the whitley capri's curse interesting i'm gonna try both new guns here crash grenade yo but thank you for five huge fan jack is the rumor true that you do not use a cam when streaming because you're that beautiful if i told you i couldn't possibly let you live chicken thank you for the five where's the cupid operator you're still the easter bunny i just spent all my cod points checking check weapons and gear you've got time before deployment i spent them all on getting the battle pass to level 100. enemy dropped [Music] please i thought i picked that maybe i was too late here we go okay that's actually quite a nice build slow rate of fire on that wait so the two new guns uh an assault rifle and an lmg when they both use the same ammo of course that's not bad kind of like that that could be quite good this one it fires slowly now i reckon that probably hits quite hard hey zary is there a heartbeat sensor in the new warzone there is in battle royale mode but not in vanguard mode what's up swag from pakistan how are you doing hey hunter new graphic engine for war zone 2 in it yeah it's a brand new engine for warzone 2 and modern warfare 2. for your team you'll lead them in rush to the safe zone you've got gas closing in will they do it for next gen only though i don't know they have changed the lighting there yeah the light is very different you like the sound of the new weapons valve they sound meaty don't they very good the lmg has a barrel to increase fire rate and still hits hard there's a new cold water assault rifle keanu i haven't heard anything about that hey chris there's a fire i think we're gonna try and go for the bomber again [Music] yeah everyone wants the bomber everyone's firing off their pistols i think we're gonna get it this time no i might get it first because i think i'm the one that's high enough to actually get it i don't know i think starts you are you've got someone right on your tail but you are gonna get it first you're gonna get it first come in how are we gonna switch seats uh i can switch now if you want all seats are occupied you can't that's it we're stuck oh return to combat has got 30 it's got 40 seconds on return to combat in the plane yeah so you've got enough time minus yeah [Applause] keep turning lucky i'm gonna keep turning i'm flying i'm flying oh my god it's really really hard to hit this i'm just not i'm not laying it behind me he's crashing i'm just trying to he's do we want the smoke it's all playing we always want the smoke oh he's turned around he's made a big mistake jack if you um abs in the gunners it's much easier one right for us not on the bottom one camera not on the bottom one oh no no it's completely how do i do bombs bomb the button for bombing a bombing button i don't want to crash again playing right in front it's going over it's hurt hard bro there are three planes yeah yeah another one right in front of me just too much i can't see it they're ruining it they're ruining us that was so close you know yeah let me get on the top of your um plane lucky so you can take me there okay you get in it's two seals i can get in sick all right go all right get my load out right we're at peak we're at peak please come to peak hello guys hello

he doing here he's just camping in the building he's a rank one guys kill him that's why he cop right here is it when you land bullets it drops a lot of gas around him or something basically if because i downed him if anyone went to try and revive him they wouldn't be able to because it gives off poisonous gas unless they have a gas mask one guy dropping on you lucky i might be able to get him standby coming back yeah yeah there's a gun right there it's just dropped off some wow they're still using brands dude still nuts i was using it in the first game it's not it's still nuts i was

to the top right up over to the 60 can we go that way well i mean if you l plus ratio someone might see anything you can oh god right okay so now you can go up here you can now get up here really fast and then use the next balloon to get out of there i feel like the player numbers are going to drop off quite quickly once the sweats were not oh stop the trick shots off the top of this surely well you only get like a couple of seconds but yeah it'd be possible it's possible we could go to factory from here yeah the new one the new the new factoid what is it down there this way that looks angle central there's a guy here left handle angle angle angle if i can be oh there's a horrible sway there's a guy here isn't that ai yeah there's a guy right there in red marker i'm in a chimpanzee you can get inside him if you want yeah i'm inside i'm inside the chimney i've not re-chambered [Applause] smash cam he's down i couldn't cut my shoe again then that was weird i cut it like two or three times then it wouldn't let me do it again if i go down this chimney do i just die like you ran out of rope jack you're just like no he tested it like you take damage when you go over the chimney no no i'm in i'm on you blow me i haven't got inside the car never steps on inside me like oh my gun's not reloading again jack can you can you help me inside me oh wait wait wait hang on i need you wait someone's dropped on us someone's just dropped yeah why did i just get an advanced uav well that was stupid wasn't it i thought there was only one guy in there because the uav but they all had ghosts galaxy is the best chocolate ever j-pop galaxy is pretty good enough i'm quite a big fan of the mint chocolate arrow though like big fan blando your knife got too dull to cut the shoe anymore maybe it was that yeah i was way too uh aggressive there i didn't even flash a grenade or anything i just thought it's just one down there [Applause] almond rocker hey squeaky what's new here we've got two new guns they've changed the lighting they've done a load of balance changes there's a new ammo type there's a new location at factory which i was just about to go and explore but i'm an idiot there's ai at the factory that you can kill there's new bunkers there's new bombs there's a new bomber there's a device that will let you survive in the gas and also help you stay alive from nebula gas which is the new yellow gas so there's a lot of stuff like lots of balance changes with the guns as well nurse buffs all that stuff yeah so you're looking at some true first impressions here this chocolate bar is a double decker double decker's a pretty strong choice danny the thing is i think it depends if you ask like europeans americans asians uk everyone's gonna have a different answer aren't they right what's going on uh lots of many many levels of pain jack well the way i would describe it jack is that we're absolutely farming it oh my god lucky the guy ran through the smoke how do you pick up an mp40 there we are oh god i swear they've made the gas yellow as well there's a guy behind him it's really strong yellow now lucky's dead i'm dead he's been he's been immediately killed um maybe they're all dead jack maybe just like yeah grab that hoddle is that a good idea i mean maybe there's people here i mean earlier i did i did lead you into a one-way exit bunker i trust you explicitly i'm gonna go check this out thank you please i'm coming there's a bounty there i do an svt jack cash i can't see the balloon on the big map snatch snatching sanchington bear they'll have to add that that's a good feeling quite mental this so far i mean yeah starts got the cash you could go get that balloon oh yeah that was the plan i mean this is absolute mentality yeah it's quite fun nebula rounds again for jackfrags [Music] i won a game using the new rounds nebula the daughter of thanos these new rounds this is a marvel i did it earlier i can't do it no we can't get that balloon now we're ruined running but you can't go on the balloon in the gas where's the nearest bar oh yeah i don't remember the bike i mean the loadie on the left jack jack [Laughter] don't engage all the snipers have been buffed quite substantially i feel bad less sway more accuracy so jay let me just clarify the nebula rounds when you shoot someone and down them it makes a gas cloud around them well it basically means that if you want to try and revive that player you need a gas bus right okay so it's like area it's like a denial of gas so they can't be wrestled they they fly out like helium balloons if you're playing trios and you see hit markers coming in from you're never inside this building there's two people there i feel like there's going to be right yeah there was a man on the roof over there give the cash to jack pop the airstrike use his cover that's okay should we not clear it first like oh just ask easy clap okay right i will air strike it to make sure no one's around there we go go for the buy [Music] go go we can still get our load out like we can alright [Applause] you can honestly pull your shoes so late i love it you really can yeah this bunker's still closed you start saying you can't hang on can you is there a problem and there's no prompt to open that one let someone break something here okay can i have a touch of cloth that was me earlier after my second coffee place please please i haven't had coffee for a few days oh yeah you're on the tea it's because you use the code start on chica [Music] yes [Laughter] there was people on that building to the northeast of this so i mean basically whoever offers me a split i'll show your code more uh lucky one of my five percent i'll take it that is from the roof of the building across the way to the northwest they are in that building they are in it can you do whatever you want baby oh yeah it's cool let's not do that again over here they've got a really good position on us i got the power one i've only got 40 40 ar bullets only only legally with code west no nobody code nobody oh wow wow there's no one out there i can shoot huh there's no one out here nobody i've been looking oh oh that is a horrible part the only spot there in the cover is blue south i've just been shot south the only cover is blue by the way we're actually in the entire time how are we going to cross um we're going to have to kill these guys and win the fight possible basically jack we have to ratio them and help them help them help them fall off help us we literally have to push them off and ratio uh get gas masks if you can because i think you're going to need them for this fight if you don't help us race if you don't have a gas mask you are pretty ruined in this way no then i'm already ruined mate we'll buy one get all these deployable covers pick them all up everybody get a deployable cover i'll take it are they still on the roof i have the contract yes weston we can make a little code speaking what are you shooting at he's got that i need some players man i should have bought some plates get them out there thank you hey i've got i've got the straw here someone just died here that's a nice spot actually lucky we might go to lucky spot go like i'm ready sharing them go to lucky spot yes drop more shield smoking smoking in front smoking in front everybody drop a shield please i'm gonna have to run through the gas i think okay we're being shot from up here by the way on red marker careful yeah there is a team over to the west [Applause] oh my god oh god shots from behind uh to the south mean stunning stunning resin i'm being shot from everywhere the deployable cover is coming in clutch here [Applause] they are running in the gas maybe i have no idea edge he's down him lucky you have to stop saying this i'm sorry this can't be coming down it's dead this can't become a thing wait this is good this is good they have the they have to run through us they have oh they did what um how was that our first win of season two the most chaotic match you've ever seen i don't know the only time i've actually used the shield as well in like two years of warsaw mental nobody nobody nobody nobody that's great guys ggs what a great game that's fine wait jack that's a really cool skin why are you going to get that huh nobody bloody hell wait all of our skins are wrong okay well mine's not mine's the white one like the white okay it's because jack's oh it's because jack's wearing the donny darker skin so he immediately gets it switched out give me a defense plate uh updating playlists again again can i just have can i just say i i wasn't a fan of vanguard royale in season one i'm already enjoying it more it was great it's a lot more fun doesn't it more sandbox yeah it's a throwaway banner mode isn't it i think you you were absolutely demolished by those planes too many times even like never again yeah exactly you think people are still going to use them for the kill races well they're just too weak now ah they'll probably still use them people no no i mean you can get a couple of cheek cheap kills at the start of a match i guess so people will probably still use it um i've got my assault rifle to rank 24 already yeah they increased the xp didn't they i should put double xp on that's what i'm doing i've now i've i've got 10 attachments on my new assault rifle already can someone put a car 98k from vanguard in their second class and they're ghosty yeah i'll do it level up and i'll never do it without it double weapon xp targets what i i don't haven't either never got that minute yeah jack i had like 41 hours worth i don't know how i've got a lot actually yeah i didn't realize i just didn't use them never use them don't you like i don't know any good builds really for like vanguard guns no i start i haven't got time to do the car 98 meme nobody i will do it i will do it for you the next game we'll just i'll have to find the build that i'm supposed to use banter royale my chat saying it's got fun in it i mean you know [Music] i mean you know yeah that's a good uh victory there guys hope you enjoyed that one pretty crazy at the end there got intense i wasn't sure if we're gonna win because it was a really difficult push ray showed him camden now i'm gonna have to stop lucky saying that on the road see you later wings hey gabby what's up carnival thank you man that's very kind nice to say that the wing suit is so much fun and the smgs are fun to rush with are you talking about 2042 wings or they've not put a wingsuit in this [Applause] i mean would a wing suit be good in warzone maybe what do you think like there's a rare pickup you could get didn't that would be a good idea or a bad idea [Applause] [Applause] think of the children jack what the ones that we're killing in this game keith is that what you mean the graphics look nice well the colors are nice the graphics don't look nice so i play on everything low but that's so i can get the best visibility and performance training's over time to see what you've learned what's up kelsey thank you is that a picture of your shark in your profile hey tabby james what's up eden i wouldn't say it would be great on caldera i'd have to take some artistic liberties wouldn't they because they didn't have it in world war two but i suppose it doesn't matter if you just do the normal br mode you kind of use the parachute as a wing so yeah i guess i love the new soundtracks and he's all ready you want to just go factory let's go to the meme go to like that side maybe yeah they'll go straight to the me it's going to be hard to see these ai boxes hello oh there's one here you found one can we name it i don't know i'm gonna try and kill him come on jack get him get him melee he doesn't appear to he gives you a uav why did he not shoot me or do anything again i think he came up behind him jack corbin luckily for me there is another way in through the back door right i found a bowler the only person who got killed pain there's supposed to be a red button in here we can like flood it with gas or something it might be in the main building jack unless it's up this ladder i mean could it be up the ladder uh ginger craig is out of fuel returning for real what we got here um that looks like a control panel but other side maybe oh hello redeploying to the other hand lasted ages [Applause] is yeah over here i don't know if i'm being shot by players or oh they're in the tower they don't take they don't take much they don't take oh blame hello i'm actually just taking control this this server's so dead i'm literally just framing across the place at like stop motion speeds it should sort itself out in a minute i so this will provide us cover in the zone and if we get gas okay well we need to buy laki back so there's another one i've just picked up another one yeah it doesn't hurt me it does now because it's destroyed okay right there's lots of like uh leaky gas pipes and if you run past them it does just like instantly take your help really yeah i wouldn't be surprised and is that the one that made the woo it could be all right lucky i'm gonna get you back and um oh let's get load out and then come back okay i'm gonna use the balloon comes isn't it yeah this is a well gun ground loop welcome it looks like a budget cooper carbine he does so somebody forgot the barrel on it oh no that's not what i wanted to do he thought about it and he's done it in the wrong order this is really sus [Applause] so i mean to be fair jack you are quite fast sassy jackie suspects let's do my what am i getting yetis [Music] i getting i'll check is am i getting the load out yeah careful no no no you don't have to jack it's free over here yes yes uh lucky i've got seven if you come to me okay big shot he's up here okay headed this way on orange supply box enemy supply drop landing on the right that's literally right next to us you should probably get we should probably get that can we shoot [Applause] damn it nobody the gun sounds insane because i haven't got a suppressor on it right what we got oh yo there that's right pop it open it right now let's go baby they're pushing over they're pushing over i'm running up there now my trousers down and he's pulled them off literally off under the bridge yeah sound one if this guy's smart he'll run away and that is exactly what he has tried to do sad exactly we got we got a man a man here i tried to steal it but yeah yeah it starts just too quick on this um the pinging doesn't work like properly like it's put my ping in the middle of the sky i can't mantel any of these boxes oh there's another satchel there lucky oh good i'll go get that let's see if we can find this hey hang on there's a guy in this building oh there's another button this isn't there on that roof lucky there's a lot of yellow stuff here okay like i've killed a man i've killed a bab it's going to be somewhere deep in the factory isn't it jack did he go underground well if he goes underground that's the most likely place for like a nuclear button or something i keep finding these nebula i think if we go downstairs we might find a nebula bomb as well wait we haven't seen the armored cars yet oh bomber's coming in be careful there's a bomb it's looking at me [Laughter] oh god i was gonna i was wondering if i was gonna get instantly sound of that jesus luckily uh okay i'm down low head shoulders knees and toes right and there's no no obvious buttons here there's another control panel on the control panel so we all have to look for a sus button a sassy button let's get myself res from this boy underground way in here okay this looks a bit control room here is that looking a bit more control room jake okay i found like a board room here this is this is definitely not it there's a telephone [Music] uh more oh jack i think i found it yeah i found it oh yeah check it out yeah come over here it's a it is a big red button it's a it's just a big control button there release nebula v gas so we can basically make factory area of denial factory edition liverpool nobody did it right there boy do it yeah go for it oh oh oh no no no [Music] you could land here straight away and just like gas everyone down there you get the kill so do you get hit marcus yeah i think so let's see why you wouldn't i was kind of hoping it would engulf the entire factory you know i was expecting that which is why i ran and he's run okay so it's it disappears after a while or does it carry on got cash for today uh okay so it's receding now it's receding and it and it's gone so can i activate it again or does there a cooldown i can activate it i can i can activate it again there you go does it come up here now it only stays on that ground floor so basically i think it's like yeah if i go in here i start taking i start taking damage it makes your vision go quite blurred it's a little bit different to the normal either it's only that one room so if people land on ground floor and you land on the roof drop straight in hit the button gas everybody yeah you just ruined it you can shorten the time to kill by gassing them okay that's pretty cool though there's a truck over here moving up truckee yeah over not on orange hold on here we go around that oh wow the phone's bouncing away we could maybe go for the balloon i don't know if i can see you guys want one of these little personal defense systems you can have a yeah hostile vehicle okay oh there's a lot of crates around here ginger crate here uh armor box how many how many people do you think they're gonna accuse of um stim glitching um on jackie's building what the hell jackie has killed the man wow see the gas started coming off in there oh you had the nebula around though as well oh because you were quite close to it i'm just gonna jump off this ladder boy you can't see the balloons on the main map only on your mini map yeah they must have damage maybe they'll update it in the future there's a balloon in front of us down by mines so we could go and we could go to my house um if we find more of those bunkers as well we should go down because we could find one of those bombs this guy here i'll finish him well there is a bunker if we get on this balloon towards them i see the nebula so do i take damage no i don't take that i would though like that's quite a while that does yeah apparently um it lasts up to two minutes on the big bomb the big the you know no the big nebula bomb that goes off uh that that gas hangs around for two minutes apparently oh there's a bomber bloody hell you have to leak because otherwise your gas mask is chalked i hit it oh wow the splash damage on that bomber is large uh oh i thought it was coming oh wait there's a man he's here i flamed him hard flash nothing like my comment section he's flamed him hard he's around here somewhere he's in the tent he might be he might be sachi here for anybody who doesn't have one you may well be in that in that i'm in the area of nice should we should we just saw him here moving up he's moved away just running i guess do you guys want to test this uh pds thing you guys someone saying now residence mates too one's coming in putting an air strike on the building just in case he runs that way [Music] i'm going to run into a team here do you want to keep going up the hill rather than being down low yeah i think that's a good call mm-hmm we can come we can cut up here i think i started wondering if you guys wanted to test the little pds thing on the edge of the gas what's the videos uh the person will detect yeah it you pop it down and it blows the gas away that's basically what it is it's just like compressed air that blows the gas away it's interesting it does uh you can't see it on the map though like it does visually show for everyone yeah it does so people can't just hide in the gas well i'm sure yeah yeah i'm sure they can be destroyed as well yeah someone else can shoot it uh men here i've seen these guys one where you're going to hit it this way here you go look if we just go up here as the gas comes in wesley let's do all the buy station you guys give me cash i'm going to get my loading okay yeah we're gonna do that oh my god yeah i think we can do it right okay we've got fifty got a minute got a minute all right i've got my pdfs i've got a gas mask as well so i can run it into the gas put it down right next to see what the range is like come right ready here we go right ready are you ready ready uh i am very small it's a very small radio i'm on the i'm on the buy there you go take my gas mask off the lackey by gas mask and that's pretty cool oh it's gone so it's literally a personal one it seemed to be yeah that's not there is a car 98 on my ghost build although it's probably it's probably not very good i just need something i just need something just gives you an extra option doesn't it if you're out of luck yeah i mean it means you can now run into the gas and three bullets is that normal uh yeah it's got a three-round mag on it didn't have a chance to change it i mean this isn't exactly a world record round for me wesley so that's needed level up so that pds thing is like the blue zone grenades from pubg but kind of not because it's not a grenade oh yes it's the opposite of a blue zone grenade right okay it's like a aps for the gas perfectly all right okay smaller choices in that parachute i like it how they're grounded in reality and it is like you say you can't just compressed air like it's something that could exist oh there's people above us see this here there you go look at that how do you know increased mantle height cod partner oh um yeah yeah god partner mantle height i can't do it okay lucky go off your king i'm sorry that came in a bit late do you want to use the balloon it's right here what do i oh you can destroy these balloons can't you yeah and then you can reinvent them by spending money okay uh where's the next one there's another one in front of us it's gonna be a ruins finish we're gonna get ruined there's a recon here i'll check here there's going to be a new way to fender now isn't that even more so than before we're going to see lucky a thou a thousand meters away [Applause] it actually throws you up a little bit as you deploy off of it uh just go right up right up here i mean you know i couldn't destroy it in one mag okay so we would need multiple men shooting at it the multi-man ah there's men right here would you what about a second i need that i'm oh i've been ratio l l lackey took an l i've for free wow really not a fan of being shop sideways i know i forgot yeah exactly uh i can flank all the way around and we can get lucky at this by calls right i finished your down lucky oh baby all right let me let me get on this bike let me let me let me let me get on the bit let me get on the bike let me no one's used it so don't forget the free self-rest boys uh i'll hold on to a prestige and i'll buy a buy an armor box why not they're sliding downhill here guys [Applause] oh yeah that's the plane that was the plane [Applause] well that's uh oh nice threat two on me there's a precision on me position on me okay thank [Applause] properly kicking off just kicked him out van tan lucky that guy on the red mark did you kill him yeah yeah he just got finished off he killed dickinson on my screen he could stop people up on the hills [Applause] [Applause] the big ship you want a big ship he's in the plane yeah he's smoking oh no 3 30 30 on the hill on the hill pogba's out for the plane they're coming they're coming they're coming [Applause] i counted their cluster with a precision [Applause] they're probably close to seeing that i'm just gonna play ratty if i am yeah yeah [Applause] i've got a record breaking two kills this game boys that's a bang of westie [Applause] the destroyed ship it's closing in hey i'm coming in move to lucky son and they're on red markers i just think it's a good this is a little more built up i like it you can take one of these buildings lastly i'm gonna have to quickly go to the loo but yeah i'm done with you here well there is a balloon here it's right in the middle and there could be anyone in these buildings like it's quite ratty it's quite right here it's still up there stud yeah it's fine i'm gonna hit anyone with this but he's quite are quite good positions i love that hilarious is sharp he's broke [Applause] nice shots that brenny yeah bunny boy really central britney central yeah you know we've got ar ammo they could spare please yeah thank you [Applause] are you sniping before yeah it's not going great right i'm back i'm using there's a supply drop coming in here as well okay moving up there [Music] [Applause] that's where he was on that on those rocks there's a load out there that's why um anyway he's gone now contact lucky's murdering fools i'm trying to the other one the mg40 thing mean yeah you add uh increased rate of eyes for this thing it's quite beamy i haven't quite unlocked that yet i will have unlocked it by the time we get back though to the lob to the lob quite a small zone really 1980 people on blue i saw people on blue have you uh have you ever had a finish over here guys because it's a bit mental i don't know the area at all yeah this is a mental finish area [Applause] closing relocating this side people to the 120 on the hills on the hills i don't really know what a good position is we've got to move anyway to the beach buildings right here yeah well i'm i'm thinking yeah where blue is where that is blue is yeah there is that's where we're going i love that i love that i love that let's just beat him up yeah that's rid of him can we drive me people uh yeah they can be i mean he's not wrong there he is whitelisted now and there's the pog 20 it's fun i gotta say i gotta tell you i'm probably dead it's big trout yeah i do have plates yeah i've got play blocks oh i need playbooks playbooks stop it we're we're not in a good spot here we need cover do you want to take blue then i've got is it not an area no no because they can shoot us from there because we've been dropping this off shed shed shed shedders shed champ they're gonna have to push that now oh look they're down the hill they're down the hill on that road on the road oh yeah [Applause] down there and that's the death now these are dead a little bit normally that little bit i'm gonna hold out these guys okay yeah i can cover you jacqueline there's more down the hill behind that red mark just saying you know now you have to see that's gonna be okay [Music] [Applause] there's another one here somewhere i don't know where he's gone i finished that guy on the hip bridge jack you may have dropped down low let's be lower to your left you might have gone through those doors at the bottom there's a bunker below guys we need to take the shed we need the shed oh the problem is but the problem is hold the shed if we if we hold the shed everyone will run at the shed at the same time that's fine uh am i right jack there marker red marker remarkable broken another one there westie's taking a local drilling in our no flash nothing nice is that there guys no no you're all right you're right i'm flashed that's too many do you come back back there's too many they're still shooting from red marker as well [Applause] i can go for the self don't worry about that can you finish yourself in a sec do you just keep focusing jack yeah yeah thank you nice job with you jack's using his whitelist assault rifle nice [Applause] i think he's ruined the name don't you dare finish me it's just a scratch we're okay thank you i mean that was quite a slow game to start but then he picked up at the end didn't it lucky picked up an 11 kill win i don't know how you found eleven kills there okay um well basically i would like to take a little sweat i would like to see the kills i've already acknowledged that i am just a filthy little swat so yeah i was the uh w anchor the w anchor westy do that little car night yeah number four yeah uh have i got low fps yes i have low fps put that little car 98 number on forum is that back-to-back boys i think it is i don't think it is yeah you have to give me a set i've got low fps so i've got to do a hottie a hot a hot resetting casting there's still the old memory leak in the game love it oh god i've got an annoying thing now where i have to leave the party so i can get back into the menu oh yeah i have to do that as well yeah sorry sorry about that one guys so i saw your full last thing yeah um and i've simply ruined it all anyway illegally legally like apart from the brennan mp40 what are the good vanguard guns uh well the new and the new uh like what smg no what's it called uh assault rifle is pretty decent yeah let me just see why can i modern warfare is sitting as a background application using seven gigabytes uh and he's got what's happening that hang there was caused by modern warfare sitting as a background process using seven gig of ram not closing properly even though i clicked the quit button yeah that happens to me quite often oh that's here it's annoying how quick how much it happens i feel like that's a good cooper build coupe have you used the no recoil oop jack um well maybe i don't know i don't know uh i i've i've probably got one i can share mx silent i mean i've got it leveled up i just you just need the you need the build i need the uh the cheat sheet uh let me just open my own video i have to do it on my phone because you know logged in uh where's the build it's going to sound stupid jack but here we go um g20 g28 compensator compensator okay yeah uh 22 inch cooper custom got that slate reflector okay remove stock remove oh cam come on no no no trust me trust me um the skeletal under barrel yeah 60 round drum nine millimeter yeah uh compressed rounds compress yeah one polymer grip yeah polymer grip and then the perks tight grip and fully loaded yeah i've got those too right it look it looks mental but yeah give it a go give it a go i'm going to keep my longer range scope on it though yeah yeah put like a 2 3x or whatever i've seen um i've seen a couple of people are um a couple of people are saying the ps5 version of the game and ps4 version are having less issues oh good what is the xbox jaw what's going on probably still yeah they were having tech issues weren't they they don't have the they don't have the tick uh stop doesn't have the tech to get in the party yeah when you add um the uh increased the rate of fire to this um cheeky bad boy right here how do you do that lucky the sakura 40 round mag increased rate of fire yeah and then there's a 720 mil barrel which massively increases bullet velocity reduces recoil yeah uses sway have you got that cheeky karna yeah west is it is it built trying to build now no he's built different actually oh wait is that two lmgs they added uh no one assault rifle yeah it looks like an energy though it looks like a side mounted one i must have just scrolled past it i don't have an fg42 in this game they don't why bloody hell oh there it is what barrel lucky on it uh the 720 mil rise door i'm not unlock that yeah what what do you want to do i can give you a variable 4ax [Music] you probably don't want that it's not fast to say the sp didn't i for one love pain i love it i'll put surplus on it for you stud no no i'll put surplus on it because it'll give you extra xp when you use it guys thank you for tuning in what's up scouts yamasa mark adams you've experienced issues with flickering low fps since the recent update what platform are your mark i'm interested to know valkyrie what's up hey jack can you play using only rpg and get the dub i don't think we would get the dub if i played using only rpg honestly i think that's quite

valentine's day lucy i'm sorry man that's uh that's a wounded right there do you mute yourself when you talk to chat yeah they can't hear me and i can't hear them at the moment hey tobo uh what my graphics sayings everything is just low uh 240 hertz 1440p and then low very low low that's high because you get more frames per second if you put that on high it actually clears up how the particles look as well so just keep that on high and then everything's just disabled you want to enable these cache shadows and sun shadows yeah i don't play warzone valley looks [Music] donny darko where's tommo i think tomorrow's going to be playing with stone and acolyte tonight i would guess hey jason what's up good to see you again i do what's up man i haven't missed much the first game was mad and we won the second game and then that game just then um i failed a clutch at the end i didn't win the 1v1 when we came second but to be fair i think we did well considering the position that we were in and how bad the game was how does the game feel after the update omar it feels good for deployment take this time to ready up uh max frame rate settings i think i've just got that set to 240. i know just unlimited hostile dropping into the area watch the skies if i can drop jet engines i will this is the gun that i was using that video i did yesterday you remember it's got no recoil well it has recoil but it's just like so easy to control it you just like pull down very easily super easy and then the swiss is like clearly the best sniper in the game [Applause] yeah you just pull down on the mouse you put all the bullets in the same place you look at the recall it's almost straight up and then it goes off to the right a little bit so you just pull down first like 10 15 bullets then you pull down a little bit to the left good to see studies back on battlefield sorry good to see he started his back on war zone and done with battlefield yeah i mean i i don't know how long started his going to keep playing war zone for but yeah it's it's good fun to play with him again you know we've got really good teamwork and banter and what is warzone 2 um warzone 2 is a brand new game built from the ground up with the new modern warfare game on a new engine it's going to have a new play space it's going to have a new sandbox mode and it's going to be disruptive and innovative that's what they said about it what's up tilbo good to see you man set a drop point team soldier also in the title guys it says warzone season two it doesn't say warzone two let's go baby have a little yeah a

fun yeah and it's randy orton slithering around do we go grab a uh a balloon and go kill the bounty ooh nebula rounds let's go boys come up for the balloon come on they're not ultra has anyone seen the dead silence so far today yeah no no no they've now been they've been moved to legendary status rather than epic i mean so it is legendaries it's rather it's rather legendary [Applause] on the balloony boy yeah you can destroy the balloon which is how much it costs and then i'm gonna see what the animation looks like again just closed i think no yeah we crashed cool oh jackie jack whenever i want to see something new it crashes hey jack have you do you have an aces motherboard yeah oh watch it blue or sound fight this is just what worked for me by the way which is when i was crashing every day um check your sound you know when you go to sound options right click the little sound thing yeah if you have something called sonic whatever just disable both of them on recording in sound audio okay so i just repaired the balloon jack it's there's no animation it just instantly appears and it costs five hundred dollars okay i think it would be better than that hold on it was a dev error 6068 ah okay um that's not good though that's i've had that dev error a long time ago like back in the modern warfare days what did you say again start going control panel right right click right click the sound thing and go to sound options and then you'll have you might have on an asus motherboard you usually have things two things called sonic you've got enemies there and they'll say sonic when you're recording and your um outgoing devices you know where do these come from completely where they come from okay they got diamond guns so they're absolute demons on the onboard audio studio be one of your in going out if it's not there then you won't see it i'm sorry but this one gun is insane it's lovely i'm not seeing any of these guys yeah this one gun is cracked out of its mind i've killed one of them no i don't think i've got it instead yeah that's fine it would be it would be a sound device like a going quick rails lucky lucky sorry guys that's all right it's your fault obviously gosh should we get through ourselves i'm lucky then yeah it always straight in the deep end mate all you can do yeah just re rezdy res me i'll i'll throw myself in the dvd what oh stop todd's still going sideways no no i was getting some ways to look he's on purple yeah he's on the truth um that's fine is that fine you that kill cam is dude it feels like uh vr quality sweaty boys that's the first video i've seen in what uh what 2022. eons well ricochet you ricocheted yourself off the game for a while that's his first game and i was probably his first kill right there as he was level one literally just got in um the owen gun build i have is um ridiculous [Music] let me know um yeah do you want it i mean i wouldn't say no okay that's good um so i've got the cheeky uh young watch caller the mercury silencer yeah the gain win shrouded yeah carver foregrip yep seven six two seventy two round garenko although theoretically i guess you could go nine mil yep actually you should probably go nine mil well the 72 around nine mil well yeah i just realized because the nine mil adds no uh it well but you don't get the fire rate increase oh right yeah okay in that case 762. yeah ammunition okay rubber grip yep slate refractor yeah brace and quick uh where's like brace what about the stock i left that blank there are some options but like i feel like they have more cons than pros in conclusion it's a scam it's a scam all right i'm i'm trusting you i mean i felt like i was deleting people really quickly it's 500. for a repair yeah the repair is 500. you'll be deploying soon oh i have no sound i can't wait for the first warzone pro to get accidentally one shot by a is that possible he's on like one tick health and a box to shoot him oh yeah you know in a really serious tournament yeah i can't wait to see that pain yeah try try that let's do those spots basically don't do anything at the moment like they're just nothing they're truly ai maybe they've done it on purpose [Applause] so many people disconnecting yeah transmission errors and stuff or are they just cheaters being booed from the lobby maybe i saw someone getting the actual ricochet meme where they couldn't hit anyone i'd like to uh experience that [Applause] oh oh no it's it's the servers they're being hammered tonight so uh vladimir it's asus aces strix 39 pretty much the best one you can get at the moment i don't think that would happen joe if spm is working correctly no one should ever play against us in our first game unless it was a cheater with like really high stats or something approaching your position get to the safe zone do we land on the roof or do we not well the roof the roof together you about to feel pain it's gonna be quite hard i think oh yeah that's pain right there no no no no you bastard literally just landed on a purple mp4 and a satchel and i got drilled [Applause] [Applause] little train car here that's not going well for you um yeah i mean i was playing stop-motion gulag yeah it is a bit stop-motion if i'm nice i think i'll die if i fall down now the uh yeah the mice on the wheel on i'm doing a good job at the minute sport found nebula rounds over there take those mine left the deadly okay spot to scope what's the point of that people jack did you not know says it on the tin oh god it started in stop motion stop motion alright lucky i've got the cash for you that's good i think you should waste it on me i can't get out the building on the roof human he can't see me at the moment if he drops down i might i'll be able to see him pushing if he does yeah just ran past the gold crate around hold on stay there what the hell you know he's not pushing it right i don't think so he should be safe as well okay hold on i'm on the reef me if you can i'm trying to see where this mountain thank you stud they're pushing you they're bridging us no not we're not really pushing as such [Applause] one down one on the chimney up there okay

long range there me on that guy oh you've done that man careful i still got long range damn one this one just nothing but head shots there man car crazy you get to redeploy [Applause] it's starting to get sweaty now boys no thank you for the fire eric considered playing red dead redemption 2. i did actually play it on my own um but i didn't complete it [Applause] just a bit too long really [Music] that was uh you could possibly come down and get yourself track i think because i killed the one of the guys that shot you i stuffed it you could use that insane film yeah there is up on that roof where you know my [Applause] [Applause] i got the guy that um originally shot earth jack that team i picked up all this gear i mean there is there is someone basically on you there i killed one star that wasn't it was it an orange skin no okay so that's not the guy i saw he's picked up all my gear line start lucky what i thought it was behind started it sounded like footsteps okay and get lucky i do love using that shop venue i can't wait in fact i can't wait to die we got that second loadout with the car uh this is normal quads jack so yeah you can get heartbeat but that's secondly that with the car isn't that uh yeah i've got the ghost load out with the car it's the heavy heavy car so like proper long range the one you actually want to use car oh yeah are you ready to die on an open hill i'm not going to get out of this factory place i have to be honest it's angle central yeah there's almost like too many angles then your frame rate disappears look towards factory frame rate down by 25. yep i'm not even kidding yeah look away 180 look at it 150. just the amount of geometry there yeah right we're going to make a a shifty didn't realize geometry wars was in bullseye go to the big city area what's that called um citadel capital like my my frames die in that area yeah capital really it's a frame muncher oh yeah we had to win chris already we had a good good victory and the second place he's been some good games tonight getting my balloon marble said the local clown i dropped today uh yeah i'll grab that i'll grab that i'll grab your cluster grab that auto five crunchy nut cluster someone's sniping behind me jack what are they shooting at you i don't think so no oh here jack they're running they were running down the hill with their trousers down no that is a heli smashing they're running down right high enough on a balloon to see for a helicopter probably if the helicopter was in the right position yeah i don't know yeah they'll probably be they'll probably be like they're on green or something uh they're fine yeah i've seen it where do you want to go do you want to dip behind on the line behind them on the top of that [Applause] nice shots jack working here don't run well they didn't down a single one of the enemy players so they all lived and they all looked at me and i died instantly what so they didn't they were fighting another team where are you wasting and not a single one of them went down look me and lackey were pushing a man and uh where are you yeah we were pushing a man and it turns out he was a demon oh my god you can parachute insane there was a whole squad there yeah there's a whole squad up on on the top yeah there you go all right jack i've moved away i think they're i think they're looking for me i can maybe res with a bit of cash if i find some should we not go there i feel like they're gonna just ruin it yeah they they are gonna ruin you so i mean it's up to you we can go down the bottom of mines and just like meet us like down here maybe find me and jack on these hills where jack was okay one was to the north one was to the south to the north oh that geezer is loud a very loud geezer someone has just sniped at me i mean that's usually cause for concern it's wow lovely you guys have the hiller shooting me now genuinely balance your teammate they'll fight for a chance to although all the gods are in uh all the gods are in this mode at the moment because it's the only normal version you can play which honestly aren't that good so i think people forget about it anyway i'm just trying to get away [Applause] it's made fascinating there is i'm just collecting i think i have now got the i've got the cash all right i've dropped in i'm dropped in he's fallen off said baby dropped his guts oh there's people landing on this buy there's people landing on this buy in front of me and there's two cars there's two cars this is it's going to end badly i think i think it's going to end badly and they're coming for you wesley you got pro in your name mate okay they jumped out they are on the tents down there should i come to you guys yes but just be careful they're being beamed um there's a team yeah there's two teams fighting it's just that you know i don't think i'm gonna go back towards that compound is trying to flank you as well here look this guy's trying to flank you see what nice watch out there is a whole team pushing you from that red marker as well now isn't that oven going a bit demonie westy that was very strong okay just probably got teammates here i'd imagine so i'll whip should we go for the balloon and then i can i can hit hoon off bahoon jackie mark here where i can't mark them they're too hard uh north west on rocks do it marked i'm going to go keep marking you just let's get them target location he's only 80 meters away from the side we might get down there this guy on the other side of the wall [Applause] easy skills on a service thought yeah would they kill you i know i had a bit of time but i'm gonna try a risky strategy they're going up the balloon yep is this life for everyone sure yeah this is live buddy like you've never played a single round of war zone or any other br well it's not to everyone's taste mike is it target right here it's a very you know competitive game isn't it i think it wasn't was like really at its high highlight when it just came out like the first six months were incredible because it was very sandbox and a lot of people were playing it people were using different guns trying different tactics using c4 rocket launchers you helicopters have that awesome sandbox feel to it [Applause] but the problem with br games um if your casual gamer i would say is that the longer they're out for the more difficult and inaccessible they get because you know there's a lot of like hardcore elder players on them still who only play that game so if you try and play it casually it can be a bit difficult it's a difficult problem to fix but i think you know when war zone 2 two's out you know you're gonna get that six to eight months ago where lots of people are just you know playing the game again back into the sandbox elements of it for the fun rather than just pushing the matter and pushing to get kills and wins all the time what's up kavindu what's your all-time favorite fps and why is it bf3 i don't have an all-time favorite brock i think the game i played the most is counter strike like beta to cs 1.6 like the amount of count like i played thousands and thousands of hours uh lots of battlefield 2 really loved bf2 i love 1942 although i played two more than 942 bf3 i've got like 2 000 hours i think on that game bf4 i've got about 2 000. golden i was also a great fps i played a lot when i was a kid but that was you know before mass online gaming became a thing i suppose what is lackey doing here nice he's chalked up was just a random guy like oh what are they doing they just stood there [Applause] they don't know where he is [Applause] all right one left reload look what's he doing he was looking at nothing that guy's self-resting behind him i don't think he noticed he's going to be shot in the back [Applause] because they've all just bought them that's why because they're all free [Applause] all of you i was just watching that with the discord i was like what is going on all right yeah i can do it i can do vanguard trios yeah see you guys tomorrow morning yeah i'll be on tomorrow lucky i still think they need to rethink the self res i think everyone was had himself because the fire sale just started so everybody dropped on the buy and bought got a free selfrest why did it take them about 20 seconds to figure out where he was you know none of them really had guns i had it earlier where someone was shooting me from that point and it didn't show them on the minimap either so if they have subsonic ammo they don't show up on the minimap so that could well have been it yeah because he was shooting an unexpressed gun i was like what's going on doo doo doo doo doo doo we got one or two wins it's not bad near bad that's not bad [Music] [Music] dun dun dun dun what's up stark jack why did you kill hakkon oh you mean dying light too dude i just felt like it what's up richard where's tommo like i said earlier he's probably playing with stone and those guys i think the first online fps ever played was on the tournament yeah man i used to play loads of unreal tournament mainly against bots because i only had a 56k modem at the time but i did play it online but what i would do is i would just load up facing worlds it's the map that's in space and there's like two towers opposite each other and then a long path in the middle and i would just put like 16 bots on the enemy team and just get the sniper rifle and just practice head shotting i recently tried to play and i used ghost operator but it made me play as one of the default pacific operators yeah if you play vanguard royale that's what will happen so it's gonna put us in vanguard rail now and i can't play as the bunny and cameron can't play as captain price it will change him into a default vanguard skin it's to try and keep the immersion i think you know try and keep that this playlist here vanguard royale to world war two joshua that dying light 2 we could watch it from gamepl bbc there's a live stream of it updates good so far carbon i have crashed twice though but i don't know what's going on with that could be my pc i need to check but it's been pretty stable on other games so i don't want to ride it off though hey use this time to train a bit we'll be deploying soon jack if you have a streamer mode enabled and you win will it show your real name on the windscreen i think it shows your real name if you use the voice comms chris but if i don't use voice cons i don't think it makes a difference i've gone both on there so it should hide my name what's for dinner tonight i don't know chris um i had some like little hashbrowns earlier but i'm quite hungry so let's find something [Applause] this sounds good now doesn't it recall's pretty nasty on this build though lots of horizontal recoil i think when you get the unlocks for that it might be really good yeah bf1 still got a lot of players especially on pc [Music] did you want to do more bunkers whatever yeah if you want i'm good with one we could go to the one that's near resort okay i don't i don't know where the entrance is i think i think it might be like over here maybe aaron green there's a little something there maybe that i'm not sure it's somewhere around there it's somewhere have i don't think there's anything but i don't know where the lubunku is there's people on that roof now i don't see the entrance i can hear crates under the ground so it's surrounded somewhere um i can't see anything no you can't see the exact hatch location oh here it is there it is oh jackal over here oh the jackal i see the rattle i see it rounding around then you can see the rounds now oh yeah there is there's a crate there that you can't open moving up oh is it stuck in the arms because there's a box on top of it who's done that where's the secrets then you're good it's just the bottom of scissors is down here i haven't seen the um the hair nebula rounds i haven't seen the nebula bomb yet no i need a revive we haven't seen those armor trucks driving around yet though they're mid-season cam moving right okay so that makes more sense apparently those are the ones that drop the bad boys the bad boy the bad boys yeah the boys are back in town so a lot of these bunkers look the same that right yeah it's pretty much the same i guess okay nukes in them caldera gets nuked it's there that's great what an original storyline it's dead it's dead then my fps is already dying and we're not even in the town yet enemy uav don't forget we get our loadout super quick because it's van guardians yeah the van guardians of the galaxy nando's seriously yeah i think so just ease you know just easy contract update new objective identified either that or am i going to plan don't your original thing though is it's so expensive considering what it is how is this yes three philly yeah and you can get a double cheese for 169 and get it would you get three nice it's really nice as well no i didn't like them a plant it's not for me [Applause] i thought it was a bit gross all right had a funky smell to it and the texture of it i just couldn't get on board with uh it's threat two on me boys good and then my fps is delicious thread three and that's a grenade instant grenade on me um absolutely wait they knew we were here he's a rank one striker [Applause] oh apparently i wasn't fully plated either brilliant brilliant fire down one over here where is he are we playing chairs of course yes there's one left somewhere he's over there i am struggling i'm struggling to understand what just happened how oh his aim assist read it yep okay yeah i forgot sorry i can help you now jack i'm gonna push them together wow cooper carbine is pretty nice at all ranges i'm in severe pain um you can you can have them i was about to say i i didn't realize yeah i picked up i am in severe aid [Applause] have you tried the impossible whopper at burger king no no no no sorry oh you're you're cracked crack frags crack frag [Music] no no i'm looking i'm looking [Applause] studio oh wow this is okay it stops breaking armor after a while this thing for the koopie yeah the koopa the copium card is in the bunker the copium carbine yeah yeah yeah they're in the other probably you need plates you should go around the bunker and you can flank it yeah [Music] stuff see the clown hopefully he's not sitting in that little little button i don't see no he was in this bunker so i don't know where he's going directly below you can obviously have they got their loadout now well we heard a loadout but you know there's not one here though um can he watch the buy from somewhere just look straight down at it is there like a door that you can look through i don't think so i think oh he was here somewhere yeah he was literally just there on the other side of one of the fences yeah i see him i see him i see him he's down there daddy agree marker drag reminder [Applause] what's he doing stop hello i think he's dead quick yeah i'll just know if there's more ah never there'll never be more don't worry about that try oh we can get a load out as well jack a few minutes ago okay what is money money on the bike i don't trust this place i feel like there's still someone here maybe i don't know i think that was the guy that i shot on the cave entrance um give a snipe question i do not on this class no did someone just throw something yeah they're very nice i mean yeah it's rude you can push icon because obviously i just did you see this no i can't at all i can't see him he's out of uh out of range i think you've got it controlled up there thank yeah oh god oh god he is cracked i didn't have any plates so he's around the other side yeah watching i'm watching i'm watching right that's the same guy that you guys killed earlier so he's come back already i have no spikes careful okay around we're good do you have any plates though i i love how no one's using the bombers or the planes anymore like immediately they've just stopped immediately everyone's like and that content's not worth it it's all right i mean i guess it's like a bit of fun isn't it but vanguard has been doing this pretty well today it was really nice it's been fun yeah vanguard royale's not so bad they've injected a bit of sandbox into it yeah is that what they're going to do in war zone 2 with their new sandbox mode alongside battle royale i don't know just maybe that's where they go yeah well that's what i'm thinking like is that their idea like create battle royale but have so much casual stuff in it secure that position that it doesn't really matter so i literally there's more plates over here as well you know yeah i only play plunder like to level guns and certainly he's moving i play plunder to get um yeah i mean it's it's good to have you have to wait five minutes for a loadout so that you can get a thumbnail yeah that's a good point [Applause] if you ever need sniper ammo just say stop because i'm not using them oh i'm good for that i've got 14 right now there's a truckee with a king in it oh there's a man he's dropping him back over at south pennington there he is it's a weird scope very thin did he go oh right i think he's going to be this side jackie maybe i don't think he had to break me he came in for his loadout he came in for his loadout there's two right there did you fight then oh that that was something oh no no it's jackie i was jack that was jackie roof oh there's a man coming in hello oh he's going through slowly i didn't hear a single shot then i only hit them because he was just like falling in the sky and just like right easy kill still breaking yeah he's underneath somewhere get rid of that get rid of that bad boy i know it's the same guy again maybe he's wearing the um the map of the blue mario blue mario is that what i am he's like the right the right no he was the ryan gosling blue ryan gosling let's go gaza oh yeah this guy had all the gears i don't have a satchel hey should we go get that supply drop yeah why not it's only out in the open i mean you know we've got 25 seconds to get to it so got a bit of uh weapon xp for completing it oh yeah yeah i make sure i have that kind of yeah yeah get that get that new gun out boy we might not make it you know jack we might not make it that's fine five right i love that i love that oh the guy looking right at you yeah yeah yeah that's um don't become prey not good supply box well no longer [Music] [Applause] there's another one here it's not as though shall i get it yeah where are you are you behind oh god maybe we should provide jack with some cover hostile dropping um my gun just stopped working that way how many people jack [Music] he's right behind me in the building i can only crawl at half speed he's pushing me yeah he's killing me uh i had no idea where he was but he could see me because i was wearing a stupid white outfit and grabbed my gear away jack where is he you still in the building blue building blue building oh orange marco yeah where i'm at okay well that's where my leave my leaders yeah he's he's over there with an stg he's seen me straight away in the air and he's shooting with her cool just see if he peeks again because if he does i can beam him jack's reverted to the brain bang you put an air strike on him if you wanted but oh he's in the building in the building yeah right okay i'm putting that i'm pulling back you can put an airstrike drop down maybe then yeah i've got no plates yeah if you go down uh just here you know just pop a little res don't see this just keep pulling back just pulled him off it's annoying like i broke him twice but just gonna get the finish ah you've got the lovely bren blueprint jack 16k as well yeah you get another loadout if you want to but we'd have to be quick for the nurse that's so weird man what are you doing there as well yeah get that and then pop uh now unless i'm just seeing a king shoot a loadout drop inbound oh lovely um there you can grab it do you want to get you want to use the blue just through molly someone just doing molly oh no i don't know where from can they get behind us um he's right about there i'm going to air yeah and i'm immediately going to get there they're just running we need to go left i guess because we're going to get shot no matter what come this way this is going to be a pretty nasty exit no enemy hits on that one i'll go right you there is a fire sale though so you can attempt your 17th res of westie this round [Laughter] [Music] is there one in front of us here again bye uh yeah in the car park over here another one and you have a king up there i don't know another balloon in front of you though the fire so lovely i think it is you need that loadout that doesn't matter i'll get another loadout later on surely oh there's a full team here with you [Applause] hit one yeah there's like people looking for me can you move further left back right now you've got five seconds left down two down one down one down i think you might be able to push it i don't know i'll try you can you can maybe res whilst i'm or i'll try it's too late you won't make it you won't make it we've got enough money together so hold on they're on me now [Applause] [Applause] i can't go because the cluster is going to kill me gas as well going for westy you haven't got enough studs i thought it was oh because the fire still's over yeah you haven't got enough ah oh that is fun this is the guy from before man yeah ah god lucky unlucky jack still cooked survive we're getting some good players here fight your way out and you return well it's just later in the day isn't it you know i mean this is the thing fight your way [Applause] our first few games will have been you know only the people that have updated as quickly as possible so fueling up now have i got any options here maybe get the truck drive out of sight get that and then go and res men spotted once oh man how could someone see me there i think it was a stray bullet i think that was a stray bullet what should i do i'm drinking goodbye just be aware people will come up the hill from your east from behind you they'll probably come up from there yeah you've got a dirty angle with the brand when they go if someone comes to the buy which they probably will you always lose loot the building see oh they got on the top of the hill yeah i don't want to peek though i think you may have seen me there yeah just wait for yeah wait for him to come down yeah then wait for him to get real close to the bar yeah then no no let him use it no no because you'll spend money [Applause] he raised a mate he literally managed to rest someone in that time is there not mates near him probably wait it's controller in the wesley insta mr uh he needs 300 if you lose the rest of that building you might get the 300 you need [Music] may not come back i wouldn't drop immediately straight wouldn't drop immediately sure you wouldn't want a warm beer would you there you go you can get it you get a cheeky res uno res all right so you've got men here jack on light blue i might actually be able to
