welcome to blood hunt this is a free-to-play battle royale game set in the vampire the masquerade universe and recently the developers shark mob invited me to jump into a few play tests with them to experience the game first hand this vampires obviously abilities guns ai to fight for loot melee weapons and more guns so i got to play the squads mode in trios and also a solo match which you're about to see and in the pre-alpha here i could choose from three different clans representing unique play styles and each clan has two archetypes with unique abilities so there's a bit of asymmetry in the lobby a big thanks to shark mob for sponsoring this one if you're interested in checking out the game for yourself there's a link down in the description below with that said let's take a look now leave a like if you enjoyed the video and let me know your thoughts on the game in the comments right where should we spawn we've got high tier loot here at the disco there's a little uav there you can actually see other players that have picked that look oh my god you can see the whole map there okay so i'm quite central but might be all right um i want to play as the siren so i've not tried this one before and this dude's got a projection where you can send out an image of yourself and then if you want to you can teleport to it and he's also got a flashbang kind of thing that just like blinds and damages people that are near to you so it could be good fun it's good that you start with a pistol got a little pulse here as well so i can see npcs that are around and loot i've got some armor nice so you have to apply that straight away i think i've got three there and then if you look at the bottom left those are all my ability levels and i can boost those and in the middle's my skills right the double barrel is pretty good so this npc is going to give me minus 10 cooldown on my purple skill so the more ai that i feed on the better that's gonna get well that was just a normal npc there but you can use those to get health back but if another ai sees you feeding on someone you're going to break the masquerade and you're going to be hunted and all the players in the lobby can see you for like a minute or something oh it's an enemy i can climb walls too where did they go another armor there is that them on the left there on the minimap maybe they're just up here what was that dual crossbow or something i'll keep you okay for now yeah so the gas in this game it doesn't work like a circle it kind of moves in different quadrants so ow i thought that'd be an easy kill did it finish yeah they hit me with a nice snipe there when i jumped across not down here got a pink npc here 4.5 hp per second there blood bags get some health back if i need yeah try not to step on the cars because they do set alarms off this guy's bloodhound broke the armor so they're not blood hunted anymore it must have just been right at the end i got good aim though nice movement i'm a bit concerned that i don't have that much ammo as well for my assault rifle so maybe i should just like disengage from this and get a bit of loot although there is someone fighting around here i was hot there he is i was hot on this guy's trail and i didn't see him for a while i think they're healing for that double barrel is that baseball bat what is that yeah i didn't have much chance there lady come here in that blood that's orange i didn't have one of them people always stick up on the rooftops you know you get that high advantage i think it's a really big deal in this game actually got to use the teleport there which was nice that was the flashback i didn't mean to activate that then but at least you got to see it what are you running from i don't see anyone there look at the max pen slide there ow i'm not trying to use the flashbang here [Laughter] let's get the finish nasty i'm creeping vampires do all right surely i've got this guy oh i missed the roof no i missed both damn it okay i think i actually got there with the the flash i didn't realize it does a bit of damage although i think it did say that didn't it maybe you've got to be like uh super close was that a purple ak that guy had maybe i should um switch mine out there we go apparently you can get a minigun as well because in the social herbaria at the start there was there's like weapons everywhere and you can test them and one of them was a minigun that's supposed to be super rare and there are like rare boots you can get as well that let you double jump and a few of those super rare things like that so it's not just about the uh the guns as well hmm should i just chill here for a bit wait and see if anyone moves there's a guy that's hunted down here it's pretty visible that was like perfect timing with that ability i don't think they knew i was there there got it i take a lot of bullets when they're down i suppose that's so you can't just like instantly finish someone love that effect as well when they get eliminated just turn into dust proper buffy the vampire style eyes or blade whatever your preferences 10 left alive what do we do let's see how the zone's moving on the minimap it's weird it's kind of interesting they've done it that way i wonder if it's based on where players are as well or is it just random there's a guy over there right here footsteps then i'm not sure oh no whoa okay damn i just got absolutely annihilated there we came seventh not bad for my first solo match although we will spectate the guy that killed me just died in the zone i kind of feel bad about that four left we're spectating fenister nice jump they've got a tummy gun and a samurai sword on the back yeah it looks like the zone does a load of damage when you're in it it pushed into this construction site here two enemies up there see that little wall run there you can kind of do wall runs if you're in an alleyway and the buildings are quite close to each other you can like jump from wall to wall and do a little wall slide i spotted them a bit of damage underneath there trying to get the angle four players left now find the right okay they're just healed oh i've been shot in the back now slide oh my goodness going at it with the tommy gun though i think they got the knock there yeah they did those those boots i was talking about didn't pick them up maybe they've already got them that zone just absolutely kills quick kill here from the blood bag all the two players are fighting i wouldn't have some big damage there without tommy gun got the knock okay see that gas cloud there i think that's one of the abilities of the other players that they're up against right now yeah and that player i think that's the siren that's the guy that i was playing as but the other the other one they can use their abilities when they're not so they teleported there 1v1 now fenney has played this really well so far i think picked up the boots as well so they can double jump now where's that last player and you're right was that behind you oh up there oh charles came out there very aggressive here fenney that was a boogie dude he's above you oh maybe i couldn't see him and the finish as well the execution to win the match that's ball well played so there we have it folks thank you for watching as i said at the start do let me know your thoughts down in the comments
