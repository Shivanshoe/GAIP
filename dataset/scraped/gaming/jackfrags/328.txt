can we just appreciate the 80s soundtrack for a second here guys listen how funky is this i know a lot of people turn the music off for warzone i put it on today and i was treated with this i like this it's good reminds me of test track you guys ever been to disney world epcot test track got kind of similar sound to it [Music] oh yeah digging it anyway sorry today we're going to be doing spectating solos in warzone shout out to jay god who i think popularized this and i asked in my last cod video after i was watching tim the tatman stream on twitch doing the same thing i thought you guys want to see this and a lot of people said yes in the comments so that's what we're doing today we're gonna spectate some solo matches and see how it goes and if you enjoy the video guys leave a like thank you okay i'm in the lobby nice healthy mix of players here lots of pc players love that i'm recording this at 4pm on a sunday so this is uk europe lobbies so it should be quite a high scale match i'm looking forward to it all right then let's have a look at the zone okay that's quite a big zone i need to get myself killed don't i so where should i drive fast get to the superstore no one really goes superstar anymore do they i'll just follow someone who wants a free kill you want free kill free kill this guy free kill that's the babbler skin guys hey free kill three i'm just gonna stand here and clap all right lads let's free kill free kill there you go good job high speed is really i'll play me there whoa that dude was all over the shop okay right now i have to die in the gulag are we going straight in literally just gonna stand here here we go sort them out there we go okay mister baxter did a little tea bag at the start there as well it was good very good just stood there clapping right let's spectate here we go he's marked the most wanted i'm dropping over by tv station you can hear the footsteps so it's been a bit sneaky this is a level two oh no instantly deleted there by the rpd lnsr95 fair play i mean that clan tag and that name that's just a a global best really isn't it you can't tell what's going on but this dude he's got one kill spotted an enemy player oh spike two enemy players gets beamed instantly by charlie hello charlie little fight on our hands here charlie's running around the back i think got the flank he's picked up another kill okay this guy could be decent to spectate two kills in the bag already from charlie level two to six nice little sniper emblem there i'm liking it i think they can hear a crate yeah there we go there it is picked up a plate there although they've already got a satchel oh hello big kill here with the ak got some damage on aggressive i love this dropping in there on the babbler skin lc10 this dude knows gas goes in close range smg i love this don't run up the stairs oh my god oh my god yeah you run into your own gas but you've got the kill anyway charlie that could have been really embarrassing for you charlie but you killed tb steve three kills on the board playing back up six thousand dollars in the bag now let's get a bit more cash see if you can find a loadout oh someone's dropping in that's a goo lager fresh spawn charlie can smell the blood oh hello someone behind him gets him no way was that the guy that dropped him i didn't expect there to be another one there who killed him was it super elven sure that's a weird name yeah it was super alvin sure sexy contact very nice this dude's also got three kills though located the bounty contract mark the bounty interesting we might be looking at a really aggressive player here this dude's level 566 as well pro war zone player right here i only got 200 though oh man circle one 330 left crouch sliding i mean you didn't even need to crouch slide there but you did it anyway i'm impressed so we're gonna go for the bounty mr mark angel z24 your time is numbered super elven shut is coming for you let's see what happens there is an excessive amount of crouch sliding here i think he's actually crouched sliding so much that he's going slower than he would if he just sprinted for a bit [Laughter] [Applause] he's pushed up to the bounty i think the bounty is just chilling on the rocks there did you see you did actually see a bit of movement there from the head for some reason look look you see him super alvin you can see him oh god he went out in the open here yeah just had no cover there was that mark angel hang on we've already seen him haven't we right we're back on mark angel then rose skin got their loadout as well what we've got an ak ak's will meta at the moment got that alien skin use code jack frags in the cod store i'm sure this guy did that and i can get that third golden yacht that i've always been i'm just kidding but do use my code in the god store if you buy skins all right they've just gone prone in a bush it's a rose bush see what i did there i don't oh no i thought we'd gone afk there for a second another three killer heartbeat sensor i want to see what this dude's second weapon is what is it show me mark angel [Applause] again an excessive amount of crouch sliding i really don't think that's necessary some people do it they're just addicted to it you know what we're gonna buy mark we got recon online okay cool uav already got that self res take a look at the map what do you see can i actually move the map in spectator mode yeah but i don't know if that is just for my client and i can't see any dots so maybe there just isn't anyone around picked up the dead silence there creeping through the door i don't think anyone's here though just in case you know this player is very cautious playing it safe solos can get incredibly campy just checking out the window i'm going prone i'll be back a heartbeat no there's no one around literally every single door this dude is cracking it open [Applause] oh my god you don't need mark come on there's no one there [Applause] running into sweat still now though i hate switchboarding solos i cannot stand this place there's always like two people camping in buildings up in the attics or in the bathrooms although that hobby center is gonna come in pretty clutch here of course people could be running ghosts and you just want to see him on it but better safe than sorry right oh taking some damage there from the big building how they're gonna react to this though a couple miss shots there that was quite difficult player running on the top there this building i suspect there's someone in here as well although no one on heartbeat are they going to challenge that player though they look like a baby skin but you never know right skins can be deceiving you can purposefully pick a default skin or a bad skin if you want to try and mislead people make you look like an easier target scoping out the green bowling last time he saw him they were up in that little bucket there and they've gone prone that isn't a great spot to go prone to be honest because if there's someone in downtown looking at you or upon bank really easy to be taken out there didn't go for the shot on rambo there no interesting i'm hoping they don't just stay up here for the rest of the game right here we go taking a shot they've got the default reticle though oh nice shot there from mark angel can we get the finish i don't think so oh he's trying a different angle though that guy's on the right though come on oh he missed the money shot yeah i cannot stand the default reticle on the car 98 see where the next zone yeah okay he's got to move now looking at the map i guess doesn't have to move that far to be honest but let's have a look what's the best position here oh hello suppress sniper shot they've come out of the cover again not a great position to stand if you're not wiggling you've got to be moving in those kind of spots otherwise you're just an easy headshot oh hello attacker over there nope doesn't want to give the position away did notice that cross be going okay they're sending it now just checking that bucket again i like that not much cover here is there for the cross and we're going up to the roof okay get the high ground then you can parachute off to the next zone i reckon that's what they're thinking oh rumble's right there in the other bucket we're dropping down those took a bit of damage here look rambo's pushing i think he did hear a couple footsteps there heartbeat now figure out if he's there i think he's got ghost though yeah he's got ghost oh tricky situation here for mark john rambo the man himself is hunting him down pop the daddy though get away i like that smart thinking rambo might be sticking around while you mr mark can get yourself a nicer position oh rubber's moved he's on the outside wall outside wall dude do you not they don't see each other look he's right there surely he noticed that movement he did he did oh slick rick they just weren't noticing each other i mean mark here is in a row skin and when you buy those bushes you can kind of blend to the shadows a bit slick gets taken out though marcus calls up another kill already got satchel already got a gas mask looking good checking out burger town oh it gets railed didn't spot that guy on the left play it back up more get your sniper have a look i think they were over on that back building by the tack rover of cover here oh okay right this dude's on the ball that's an amax isn't it oh that's the guy from the bucket he's cracked him pushing him with the semtex not going for the kill though playing it safe we're gonna play up mark's got the advantage now mark's got that head glitch the dude's in burger right yeah on your left in burger i think mark's got this one i reckon he's got it if the aim is on point i don't see how that domino skin is going to beat him here because look at his head glitch [Applause] he's just chilling in the burger sound dude they've got to move though because the gas i think the best play for this guy right now would be to get the attacker over oh no he's just out in the open belzney you can't ads like that out in the open you got to keep moving in a situation like that you knew that dude was there mark angel picking up another kill though this dude's playing pretty good so far although i hope they noticed that truck that just pulled up on the left let's take a look okay right so they've got quite a way to run up here not great cover i'd be pushing up the hill maybe coming around here or i'd get that tack rover switch the suv maybe and then drive to the north vehicle here okay right so he's pinged the vehicle so mark realizes that that thing pulled up there did he see the movement there just on the right of it yeah that's the guy downed i think that was on bang he spotted him now surely he went for the jump shot oh that's a nice shot it's probably a con oh he's on top i don't think he meant to do that 498 go for the attacker over more no go for the tack rover dude now go for the tack rover no man i don't know if they've made the right play here unless that other one just moves away well they could send it yeah okay that ray skin wants to kill yeah selfrest you've got time it's gonna be tight he's coming over in the truck i think mark is going down here you stand out like a sore thumb there mark can run you over very easily jump out yeah faze mark oxley there hungry for kill six kills from mark oxley level 140 rocking a ppsh i know they just changed that didn't they it's a lot better than it was and they fixed the iron sight on it too so ppsh bit of a metal weapon now for sure i didn't see what the secondary was though this guy looks like a hunter why are we getting out there mark yeah okay what that's a really bad place to stop controller battery dying maybe something like that could be so mark's already got the gas mask he's got satchel got a self-rest 6600 i'd be getting an airstrike maybe i reckon uav at this point in solos pretty useless enemy running there are you going to attack mark you've gone in the building we're checking out notice how like everyone runs heartbeat century solos okay that dude hasn't got ghost swiss i like it that was a sniper shot to the right that may have been the gun heartbeat though scoping out a little fight that went down in the shed there glass break behind your mark taking the shot oh you got a lead a bit more than that mark come on i'll do better let's go oh hello yeah that's the sniper and he's also got someone on the left in that building unless that sniper killed them but the fact that snipers looking there means that there is probably still someone on the left oh you break the glass yeah yeah okay oh okay glass is gone now no mark he was on the right is he gonna push though there's a lot of people around to be a bit risky wouldn't it alright those two are having a fight well those three maybe yeah he's rushed him oh nice play from twin there was that the guy that sniped him twin also has a ppsh and no head interesting yeah does that mean you can't headshot him another swiss on your right yeah okay that dude has not moved pulled up in the attack rover got out okay he's on the roof ball tactic nice shot this is good 370 beautiful from twin there gets the finish notice there's someone in that window but you've also got yep someone behind you and tracker was that oh come on come on come on control the player i think has he not noticed him and that guy's running deadly i think oh close fight i think he's got him i think he's got him no he's gonna fall back and heal and he ran out of the building [Applause] quick reload burnt through those thermites there the dude ran outside didn't he i'm pretty sure we opened the door man oh checking upstairs yeah it was the same guy he's jumped in the range he's off he's out there oh hello that was close take a peek yeah he's right there you saw him you saw him oh he's fighting gets the crack steals that kill the other guy has just been knocked i think but he's in the gas so surely they're dead there right yeah it's gotta be dead yeah there we go a couple more kills for twin there eight players left surely there's still someone up ahead of him here sniper shot was up the hill there yeah look they're fighting up the hill could be someone in here no they've moved watch that left hill twin non-heartbeat although that zone pull that's nasty man it's right in the middle of the airfield not much cover there although you do have the dragon's teeth he's there he's there you can see you can see him oh i missed the headshot oh so close what's the play get the vehicle [Applause] they're not moving fast enough there's no way i'd be strafing like that end game makes you such an easy target when you move like that hey you got to get zoned play for zone oh man i don't know if this isn't looking good for twitter good work okay take the shot yeah he's getting in oh god what are you buying what are you buying tell me that was an airstrike three other enemies in the game can twin take this one eight kills not a bad performance at all enemy airstrikes coming in there there is someone up ahead of him here i think probably behind the rocks yeah right there dude you see him you see he's literally there twin he's oh my god did he not see him he's dead he's done for he touched him taking him out with the xm4 i can't believe he didn't see him although we used the dark wraith skin there so it does blend in pretty well here call 98. itachi looks good man 10 kills do they know there's someone over there behind the truck yeah i think they just fired at him right yep okay it's a snipe off attach he's got the zone though oh no no no he's running dude beam him he's got no cover air strike that's why okay oh he's been cracked attachy why isn't this dude beaming him i'm gonna hear this actually you've got a hill come on surely he's got the kill the other dude's got no cover just peek just peek he's run to the right captain price oh he's gonna try and get the head shot attach it it's just one bullet dude that's all it takes use the knees nice shot attaching takes out good guy panda oh he's going for the takedown lads oh my goodness hey touchy insane rubbing it in at the end there that was really fun i actually really enjoyed that i'm just sat here with my arms crossed
