so they kind of fixed warzone temporarily they released the patch a couple days ago and it introduced an old bug where you could crash a helicopter switch seats at the last second and then become invisible and invincible at the same time so in the meantime what they've done is removed the helicopters with the guns on from the game again this happened before so obviously if not actually fix the bug but you can play warzone now without any invisible or invincible players which is great 10 out of 10. now in today's video we were playing this earlier today we had seven or eight matches and we won four games it was just going really really well and i was using the growtzer groza grazer i don't know there's all sorts of different ways you could say this probably none of them are right but grosser there you go this is actually competing with the ffar now and beating it in some circumstances because there was a few changes to the attachments here and there so i thought i'd give it a go that's my build wasn't using the suppressor for a couple of the games and it worked out great also the spr now there are some absolutely disgusting spr shots in these three matches i just felt really connected to the game today hitting the shots the flick shots getting my lead and drop right and it just went absolutely swimmingly it was really fun entertaining to play in these games and i hope you guys like it as always a big thank you to anyone using my code in the cod store if you pick anything up use my code jack frags in all caps and i'll get a bit of kickback on that purchase with that
