fairy no eren pick up your axe um [Applause] [Music] [Music] good [Music] yes what the hell is that i'm seeing two different data streams overlapped in the same dna not sure why fix this or pull me out i can parse the streams with a filter hold on okay we're good are we i don't know what happened but i can work around it you'll have to pick a stream to keep things stable there's a third option too i can let the animus modulate your identity based on signal strength it's up to you wow that was quite the intro and that was cool so this is the animus i suppose so we can choose female male or just go random we're gonna go mail all right i'll lock it in and push ahead to a time where these streams are more synchronized how long have you been chasing me wolf kissed 17 winters 18. do i now haunt your dreams do i warm your loins you remember this ah your father sacks the weapon of a coward a scorn snake ah few things would please me more than to kill with this blade but i know you would define me to the death fighting for a glorious end that i will not allow you will live your final days enthralled as a slave humiliated your death would be a lonely one kill the rest of his crew make them suffer evil wolf us no more that name is dead to this world you will be worth your weight in silver pull the shape to the shape not had a good time has he [Music] you move and i take your eyes you hear me wind's blowing from the south we can tack north then cut west he's gonna break out of there now what did i just tell you [Music] jeez god we will skin you alive you will never never leave this it's john wick no feast for you all right here we go find and rescue your crew i need to reach them i think we can get some berries here get some health back better what's this i feel better stronger eat all the food save that for later let's go i'm guessing we've got to get to the top of this mountain here get a bit of an overlook you can pretty much climb anything in this game read jeff lee was that good pronunciation or bad guys are there any scandinavians watching i kind of like that you can just climb anything though it's cool all right here we go at the top of the world although that peak is much bigger over there it's synchronized [Music] is holding my crew over there somewhere right here we go into the water oh hey there unfortunately is that a bad guy down there looks like it pretty sure i should have a bow and arrow yeah here we go over the headshot straight in the back of the head no one else around but looks to it [Music] get some arrows back i think we're good for health as well looting that's what the vikings did isn't it really it's the viking way all the things these snow effects are pretty cool leaving a trail behind me use the raven as well to do a scouting fly around mark things as well that's cool [Music] it's a camp here but i don't see any enemies around some treasure in there maybe have a look yeah losing is what we do how do we get some iron ore and leather okay we can read that as well prepare the child of baron for the slavers i don't think we'll be doing that today cute vest warriors i should stay out of sight best not to draw attention here that's really cool two guys back there you can just avoid them though i think getting to the crew is my top priority right now it should be just over this cliff here a clash of iron there's fighting nearby there's a scrap over here yeah that's one of my men you old hound you live i do slipped away in the sword clash and what have you kyoto tried to sell me off a mistake he will regret not today he won't i saw him board a ship at davao's nest not long ago sailed east leaving our crew behind there will still be time to save our men i will fight them you ready the longship you glory hounds you would take the rescue for yourself so the victory song is written about you i could storm the beach then slay two dozen men seize our dragon boat and hoist the sail in triumph up to you no no i will take the beach a far more dangerous path you search the long house for our crew oh and here this corpse will not have need of it hey go i will meet you by the ship okay we got a shield now battle for the northern way it's a gorgeous environment this isn't it equipping gear so we've got made hand and secondary hand if you've got a two-handed weapon you can only hold one of them but bows as well so i think we can put the shield in that one there we've got a bit of a defensive capability now and here's where we are at the moment see i wasn't expecting this norway area to be that big well that looks quite big to me it could fit all sorts in there right so the crew's in there somewhere cuteness warriors crawl through aval's nest like lice if i use the main gate i may attract attention okay it wants me to go inside i think is there a little entrance here zoom in guide me there's a couple of bodies i think that building is where my team is all right this area is off limits going in oh there's loads of buddies there the crew should be inside i mean i don't want to get spotted here do i is that guy on his own there there should be an opening in the roof let's go up there hopefully that dude doesn't see me sneak in it's firm like that and my axe will miss your knack unpleasant for both of us if i'm to die i want to make a mess of it all right we'll jump down [Music] let's go [Applause] all right mate it's me oh come on you coward unbind me and stick an axe in my hand i owe you nothing raven [ __ ] yours is a clan of brawls and peasants you lay that axe aside or die by mine you should be on a slave ship to ireland wolf kissed but if you wish to be my first sacrifice odin will be more than happy to receive you you just killed yourself you want something right so we dodged with x we've got a light attack heavy attack shut your hole and fight you can't dodge the red ones you can't walk give up maybe you could parry them i don't know yeah those are them apples yeah all right let's go in combos here we go stamina stamina is consumed when dodging or missing an attack and out of stamina you can't dodge or block until it's been fully replenished and we can get stamina back by landing light attacks okay so being aggressive is quite advantageous in this game these weak spots through his arms oh the hammer smash what was that crushed his head dude brutal father you should have held on to this until the bitter end if i give my life will you spare my clan no pick up your axe kill them all some kind of vision who's that guy where are we [Applause] [Music] able are you bewitched unbind us what oh yes of course what was that who's having a vision well the person playing as his memories was having a vision when you think about it like that even if your wits were somewhat rattled listen here if you can breathe you can fight now come we take back our ship you do not need to tell us twice grab yourself some weapons let's get out of here yeah oh we fell down i didn't see the hole there get those parries in i love the stone attacks that's cool oh no no not the face what's my back oh they got me so we still got this here this is the weird animus section got a hell of a beard on him doesn't he look at that it's nice tattoo and barbershop there would be some customization as well listen here if you can breathe you can fight now come we take back our ship oh we got some armor didn't we yeah here we go look at this that's cool is that i didn't even equip the axe either we didn't get an extra bow nice okay now we're looking more like a viking a helmet as well no no helmet sadly right that's better let's go this time oh that's wing attack big aoe there that's cool keep waiting for the shield bash all right let's go gotta get out of here and get to my long ship a couple of things here that we can steal a loot there we go right down to the beach here we go hit him all the way down some nice reflections here in the water ready grab yours the whale road leads us home away we go get that sail open on the open seat anything to save for the mess you let us do we suffered no losses in this fight and the men who humiliated us are dead what does that say oh something like i was stupid selfish reckless blind bone-headed and i smell like blood and [ __ ] i like my version better it's all peaceful now i wonder if the xbox series x version has someone who's setting up an outpost on that raytracing gnawing at any piece of open land like dogs worrying about even with you half in the grave we could easily take them off in the grave right it's our first rage [Applause] raid in time i've got some battle music as well i feel like that's a combo when you do the light attacks and then the heavy attacks you do three light and then one heavy you do get more abilities as well of course throughout the game oh my goodness ruined one guy left follow my lead quick shot we did it right now there should be some treasure in here that we can take everything's on fire the bone biter what was that check the inventory the bone biter that's a two-handed axe so i won't be able to use my shield but i'm guessing that will do a load of damage so we're going to try this out all right good raid lads 10 out of 10 would recommend hotel travago take command of the vessel vehicle reversing yeah we don't have an assassin's blade yet dutch raider i'm guessing that we'll get one though this is really nice run off the sale [Music] i've played part of the game before but it's the bit when you're in england you've never done this norway bit before and stronger than before no surprise there this war spun on for three generations i hardly expect him to end your hatred for that man burned bright wolf kissed i could warm my balls on it would you not prefer a pair of seal skin [ __ ] just take care abort it's not a tmi there isn't it careless what he did to your father he did to all of us you are not in this fight alone well fps in my game it's locked at 60fps i think okay on the series x i haven't noticed any frame drops yet but this is just the start of the game so i'm sure it's going to get crazy at some point nice little ramp up tutorial to the game you for setting out against his wishes of course you will is that not something you worry over i worry only that our king will not see that i'm right until it's too late what about sigurd what would he say the sigurd were here he would be sitting beside you wiping the blood from his axe and smiling into the grease sigurd was the guy at the start right that wanted to give the ring to his dad or the king will you tell our king about this misadventure only the truth that he attacked this fortress killed his men and weakened his control of this land will you mention the parts where you lost your crew and were nearly sold as a throw will that be part of your saga if there is a skull to dare sing that verse it will be his last song there's an arrow in the side of the boat there all right we're gonna dock here duck the ship here we've got a new fast travel boy cool there's a bit of v-sync tearing there well well the feather of ravens returns and not half dead we thought we had lost you a war for good this time a warm welcome as always landry he looks like cassandra [ __ ] what happened nothing to crow about except to say the man who delayed us are dead and how are you well enough though i have spent many times some days calming the rages of our king he is not happy with you i expected as much and what of cigarette has he returned from his raids my husband should be home today the last we heard he was approaching stavanger good to hear we have need of his courage sigurd will not save you from his father's wrath evor you should know that by now did your raid not go as planned they rarely go as planned but we killed many of kyoto's warriors and there was this my father's axe among the dead ah after so many years you should take it to gunnar he will give it back its edge good idea after i see our king that i do not disgrace not yet he is meeting with a messenger from the north i can wait a cloud hangs over you there's something wrong seeing my father's axe after 17 winters it stirred something in me a feeling i've not had since the day he was killed since the day i got this memories of past agonies of sadness and pain i should speak with valka she could help me make sense of my feelings take your time getting settled i will see you at the longhouse i think you have lost your edge avor just like that axe maybe goodnight can help you with both i will let you know he looks sesame then viking is suspicious welcome home why does everyone just say that i look rough all the time all right we've got skills okay here we go choose a path stealth range melee i mean with it being a viking game i feel like you've got a lean heavy into the melee stuff right surely cool right so this must open up big because you can zoom out all the way there they're constellations aren't they [Music] it's cool [Music] family matters [Music] all right we'll track that one see what's going down with this i returned a nice place like the music welcome back goona i have something here you might like to see thunderclap of four is that your father's ex i have not seen this beauty since well he's in a few battles doesn't mean i forged this weapon though still looks good one of my finest i think it has a blunted plate but it swings well can you sharpen it i can give it a better edge and reinforce the handle and as luck would have it i have one ingot left for the job are you sure the fates have will itself but in future bring your own metal ingots i cannot forge them from empty air enhanced gear rune slots okay it's kind of like god of war then yeah i don't know if i have any runes though at the moment cool check out in the inventory anything else that's all for now return any time dialogue options there right inventory here we go this one wasn't it ruins empty rooms oh there we go we do minor rune of rage what's 2.4 attack socket that bad boy in there i didn't get to use my new big axe did i although i think that's a single-handed one so we could put a shield in there now there we go upgrade complete like it roots can be found in chess in the world she doing [Music] working on some leather hide or something cassandra they must be finished now if you have any other business i mean running to do it now let him cool down i could speak to volcker first get this weight off my mind the king is not going anywhere cool see is solace the sea lives in the mountains north of honduras a little dice never caused any harm no i'm not playing dice no no no no he looked up towards the mountain didn't they we got some bonus content there what is this berserker armor what why do i have this that seems pretty overpowered look at this what why have i got this stuff it's got room as well that's a cool looking axe berserker hood sweet oh come on look at that it's a bear it's perfect show gear [Laughter] oh dear here we go oh yeah well look who it is it's bad dude practicing your wordplay elvis ah avar the only mouth in midgard from which i fear mockery you taught me the art of writing poetry old friend it is only natural that i surpass you soon how about another lesson then a quick flight right here right now yes do it let's try flight viking rap battle i always put a few coins down as a wager most of those who enjoy flighting have an equal fondness for betting but today will abstain let me begin i'm ready inflating it's key to match cadence and rhyme it's as much about sound as it is about time so be careful in choosing the words that you say i'll recall what you taught air i enter the fray a fine answer perfect rhyme and a lovely cadence to match my line now let us examine meaning in flighting you'll need to be cutting and keen it's about wielding wit more than venting your spleen if i tell you you're foolish and stupid and dull then i will spit in your face and i will bash in your skull not bad not bad the rhyme is there the sound is good but consider that i said you were silly and you told me you would kill me at times it might be best to remain on theme something to consider last one so then and conquer the world with your wit go be clever be quick show your spirit and grit i look eagerly forward to seeing how you fare i will fly to you with flourish and best you with that's it got it perfect yes nailed it you could destroy me with such a line your fighting's astounding you're worthy of praise you swing a fine axe and you turn a good phrase thank you all this i'll take the lesson too hard there you go charisma so i've just gotta just gotta do rap battles against people and get charisma okay come and drink let us amuse the gods you want a drink all right tackler i'll out drink it hey it's a drinking game apparently alvis tells me this brew is too strong think you can handle a few rounds yeah easy oh no it's dance dance revolution gotta time it perfectly gets quicker and quicker the better the timing the quicker it goes down i miss that one you have to counterbalance it we're sweating all right last one oh we got it oh close oh you just won like odin mead is my lifeblood oh dear that was well drunk well done well who are you hi can you point me to some good hunting ground hunting i could but i don't want every iron foot with a bow scaring away the game bring me three dear antlers to prove your skills and i might just have a story for you a worthy challenge i will see you soon okay i wonder if i can customize how my either looks don't know there's all sorts of stuff around here [Music] okay we've got to go to the hut where is the hook is it at the top of that mountain someone in your mouth horse if you could please horse i think the horse is stuck yeah i think we just have to start climbing i mean this dude is brave right just doing this no fear no safety harness straight up the mountain let's go i am glad that there's no stamina either you know like in breath of the wild oh man it was stamina in this game i think i would hate it i think they've had to map out this mountain as well what is that not a puffin nothing offensively hey we're up to something why aren't they what were they doing are we doing something over here obsidian where's that oh there we go so this is like crafting materials someone in the chat just asked can you get higher frame rate by lowering the settings like on pc no i'll show you the graphic settings um i think the only thing you can do is you've got hdr brightness and contrast you can turn off the usual stuff you can put guaranteed assassination mode on as well which is always a one-hit kill like the old school games but it's not the way the game was intended but there's no graphic settings no where is this place right at the top we've gone on a little adventure here up the mountain there's a zip line there i don't suppose i could shimmy across that could i i'll just walk across it yeah look at that now it's assassin's creed when we get to the top we'll have a look around see what we can find in the distance was that i just heard a weird animal then sound like a deer may have been a bird collect all these things 170 meters oh look at this something here cheeky slide there there it is just fire we took the scene at route balkan's hut big old map isn't it follow the stream big statue yeah knock knock anybody home i need silence to hear the songs of nature [Music] she gives praises and she is greeted for your hearing i hearken oh ancient ones great odin great freyja i give you thanks for your gift of sator she gives thanks and she is blessed avor it has been some time what brings you so far to see me i i have come for your advice on a private matter come is your mother well her mind is a jumble she speaks to spirits i fear her final winter has come but she has me now let her speak to your needs i have had a vision a powerful vision it may have been my lust or delirium caused by the cold but describe it for me after 17 years i saw my father's axe again and when i touched it the vision came on fast there was a wolf howling in fears and then a figure a gray beard in a cloak with a single eye he bit me follow him ah the high one he calls to you perhaps he means to speak with you deliver a message only through sator will you see more clearly and unravel the threads that sit tangled upon your mind this will not take long hmm do we trust her have you used this sort of magic before i have no fear it was not my seder that made her like this her condition inspired the elixir did it help her for a time it opened her up to visions strange unreadable things then she returned to her current state i think she's gonna be crazy drink if you seek true understanding open your mind oh no what oh it's not good for the stomach that gonna need some pepto abysmal after that one i think we tripping out again there's that weird dude who is it i saw nothing vulcan felt nothing harvey brother when did you arrive just disappeared is that sigrid the guy from the status what the hell that's creepy man i don't like that yeah boy wolfy what are you doing brother what is this there was no other way javi what where's your arm gone oh fates are fixed sight [Music] he just dropped his hand off what has happened this was not for you [Music] javi whoa as giant wolf what was that tell me everything i i i i was on a mountain in a violent blizzard climbing toward the summit following a wolf mm-hmm odin and the narnia were there was it odin i saw odin and the nordna spinning the threats odin's a god right they were watching me not watching they were showing you the way forward your life your path what lies before you and where it ends and the wolf was eager for my attention as if it were beckoning me to follow you are the wolf kissed fated to carry its mark for life in this case it might represent your ambition or your fear i saw the gates to odin's hall of slain champions they opened for me shades of valhalla for which you are destined i do not know what else to say my memories of faint hasey did you reach the summit of this mountain i did yes sigurd was there wounded in pain his fighting arm was missing then the wolf reappeared the size of a dragon twisted and terrible it fixed his eyes on me and struck then i awoke the gods favor you abor we always have you will have your glory and you will earn your place in valhalla but these portents carry a darker truth the missing arm the trail of blood the beast you will betray your brother segurt that is the meaning of your vision that cannot be right i would never betray sigurd he's my brother my family the north near have spoken and this is their message no this is wrong or you misunderstand that cannot be right you will betray sigurd odin fought against his fate it can be done she's so sure i was the one that had the vision as well [Music] should never have come here there's nothing but pain oh we got some skill points though i'll take it back right hard into melee that's what we're doing stomp love that that gives you a power level as well so i think we can we can fast travel back there now yeah looks kind of badass doesn't he what would you do if you saw that running towards you in real life in 2020 i think i'll just freeze it's snowing a bit heavier now they must be finished now the king has called for his best meet so the talks are concluded it should be safe to enter i'm ready to face the thunder i will speak with the king now excellent king stephen i will take this perspective to my nephew i believe he will see the wisdom in it good it is all i can hope for may the wolf kissed may the winds favor your voyage get homer evil come forward and explain in plain words why you have willfully disobeyed my commands do you mock me i do not mock you king i mean to embolden you against your enemies and your own poor judgment you know nothing of my judgment you know nothing of my plans and strategies sigurd would agree with me my son might agree with you but he would obey me he knows his place not as well as he knows his father imagine you are harassed by an enemy with warriors that vastly outnumber your own what profit does open war bring would it not be better to work quietly through diplomacy gaining alliances waiting until the day our numbers outweigh our enemies and our victory is guaranteed hmm works smart not hard [Music] do we have any allies to speak of or is that your excuse to do nothing your confidence blinds you to so much in plain sight table day and night i toil to forge ties with clans to the north very soon you will see the fruits of my efforts only then will you understand is that all i'm at a loss with you ava when i took you in as my own never did i imagine such disrespect from the child of aaron your father was a fine man just and loyal to me he died bravely so that we might live he died a coward lord a fate i will not mirror why do you carry such a useless burden let it go think only of the days to come of your future and the victories at hand my honor has been stained until it's wiped clean i want nothing else [Music] i refuse to looks like he's gonna cry but if there is something that can chase these shadows from your thoughts [Music] sigurd has come down at the docks his ship is here so from what i know about the game the choices that you make in those conversations can affect things like which characters live which ones die different story beats etc i think there are multiple endings as well it's cool that you can affect the story a little hey careful with that one avon ah look at you blood so drinker have you been worried without me oh you salt cured by ginger i smell the stink of a dozen kingdoms in your beard just to start brandley my dear wife your husband returns bringing gifts and riches to share and new friends i see yes basim and ivan we met in making all day her buried secrets assassins we are great for his invitation and eager to pay tribute to your king my brother is always very careful with the company he keeps if you're standing safely beside him he must like you ah that's maybe nostalgic that is the introductions until our bellies are full i will see my father tell him of my time away this morning we traded with a ship passing south they told us ava the world kissed was captured by curtis man they must have cut the tail short i killed my captures and recovered my crew and for that your father scolded me you know where i stand brother nothing sean of war will dislodge curtrey from our lands but he disagrees i know i know father thinks too much and acts too little today that changes see you again i promise you by the winter's end the name curt with the crew will be a curse on the lips of a drunken fool it's cool to see them my son welcome home father tonight we feast and celebrate your return sigurd the tables are laid with barley and lamb breads and mead and no more i beg you i want nothing you would not serve a thrall let me be the one to honor you i bring gifts and tales from far away lands after two winters away i am full of with both very well very well come inside and when we are fat and satisfied father we will talk of curtre and his clan shamed us for too many seasons i know this avor knows this it ends now yes of course when the time is right through roostland we barreled down the volga river raiding as we went shadowy tribes hurling spears at our ship at mclargart we saw men protecting riches as vibrant as the pivot itself these we took for our troubles of course we sailed to rome then africa past oceans of sand warriors of all colors and beauty the eyes must weep to behold and now i have returned with riches and glory to share with my family my friends my eyes fall strange so take what you desire from my horn for this this is only a taste of things to come tomorrow the ravenclan starts a new skull sigurd skull and you able come i have something special for you you're all sorts of stories you give the weights or a gift he's got my christmas present this way you give the weights i thought long and hard on a gift worthy of you you've snared my curiosity brother what is it not yet drinks first to my first night in fornberg in over two winters it must end with me soaked and wall-eyed shouting at the shadows of trolls and you want me to sail with you in these honey waves yes you are stuck with me drinker now drink he's teasing me you would put thor to shame forgive me on your first day back i should have let you win gods you should have let me start [Music] it's good to have you back yes i've missed this terribly when i first met bassin i regaled him with tales of our homeland and it was then i felt a hard longing to return once [Music] this brings us to your gift these excellent men were my shepherds through much of their homeland the abbasid caliphate they are a clan not joined by blood but by a common idea a brotherhood of shadows executing their own form of justice in my time with them they shared many of their most hidden secrets for which i am grateful and now i gift one of these secrets to you there it is for the finest warrior i know [Music] beautiful craftsmanship what kind of smith makes a weapon like this it is less a weapon than a tool one we have used for centuries to fight injustice and evil mentor i must protest this is deeply unorthodox or wrist played as a sacred will not make a fetish out of cold metal hyphen what matters is the mind of the one who wields it please try it on the blade should ride on the underside of your arm to conceal it from your target i have no wish to hide this and i would rather not make the same mistake you two wearing it on the outside like a boss i like it this is no mistake this is a voluntary sacrifice to prove our devotion to a good start evolve but you must learn how to use it effectively [Music] outside this is not something for all eyes lead on i'm an assassin now not in the creed but an assassin nonetheless this clan of yours it has a name indeed but among the tenets of our creed is a vow to never reveal too much to outsiders in time you may learn more but not here where the walls and trees may have ears i look forward to it train with the hidden blade let me lead you through our most basic techniques wielded with skill and care our blade delivers a singular killing blow as you near your target find your window to strike timing is essential good day to use like that excellent i have not seen a blade so sharp some targets are trickier than others keep that in mind before you strike a decent attempt take that one down from one bank everyone we're gonna do yes love that ledge assassination how about a challenge yes okay down upon that target from above exactly just like that i'm really good at killing dummies use your surroundings when possible strike from that haystack for instance exactly just like that you wheeled the blade well thank you let us need able to enjoy his gifted peace come avoid let us walk to the docks and take in the night here let's go what do you make of my new friends i like them they seem generous and menacing in equal measure i know what you mean they have learning too they wield numbers and writing as if it were magic vasim has shown me so much about the world all of which i will share with you when the time is right oh i miss the smell of this land salty sea have you returned for good what do you mean to join this shadow brotherhood leave all that aside tonight we are family again the here and now is what matters our kinship our clan our glory i missed you brother your clear head and your courage we have not had enough of both in recent months you flatter me wolf kissed keep it up from here to valhalla i will always be on your side secret always this fjord has grown too small to contain me or i too large there is so much more beyond these stony fangs that rides around us england ireland franchia all greener pastures ripe for the blocking tomorrow we make new war on curtis and reclaim the lands he took from us and from there we build a kingdom for us i'm with you only say the word good get some rest and return here at first light [Music] okay you think the brother could be a templar sam maybe the north near have spoken you will be traced no this is wrong that cannot be right odin ford against this fate it can be done you will betray secret almost creeping [ __ ] cuteness warriors what's this dude doing [Music] oh i could test out the blade on a real target well this one would not have come alone i should find the others around here somewhere to get some skill points as well that's opened up a load of stuff though now i've got the hidden blade i'm like maybe i want more stealthy stuff what's in this bag oh my god collectibles that's that's way too many things different type of arrows as well i suppose that might be around here somewhere i like to know who's a bad guy use the raven what do you see oh there we've got a little cam okay good job that ravens about [Music] the raven just put the mark of death upon you i suppose i can climb this oh yeah hey sneaky bakey whistling yes something going on something going on oh that guy's really posh come on i'll drag you in here what you're dead that all of them tell me what you see and how many they did a full reconnaissance mission on us but some people in the chat were asking if this is the next gen version of the game yes it is so i've been given a code of the game with the next gen patch so this is 4k 60. there's a couple of other graphical upgrades as well i'm not entirely sure exactly what they are but this is the next-gen version and i'm playing this on the xbox series x i specifically clarified that as well before i started just in case i'm stronger i speak as your we do not have the men to storm kyoto's fortress the losses would ruin us the losses have ruined us father until we cut off this serpent's head it will poison us day by day drop by drop the poison has already polluted our waters god savel what happened spies in our camp three men sent by kyoto to kill us as we slept i returned the favor there you see this is what waiting brings we must answer this insult they came from not full that wailing village on the kyoto is control we hit him there burn it down before cureful learns his spies are dead he may have sent more i can search the village while you round up the crew no need i will send heidham to search the area you can rely on him while we are away we do you mean to join us i have not been bred for valhalla like you but this will be far from my first battle i do not like this but i will not stop you hmm i got beef there is some screen tearing in the cutscenes as well i don't know if you guys have noticed that do not lead my son into the same storm that follows you gotta go get the supplies you coming with me lads yeah all right oh he's stuck you're off yeah the ozark lads i think i have noticed some real-time reflections as well when i was away far from these frozen shores wondering if i should ever see home again i grew afraid afraid i would not return in time to see curtwest and afraid i would not see him bleed out like a stuck pig in a drift of snow but here i am home in time to join those i have missed those i love in this glorious fight today we cease not fall from kirkway tonight his heart will pose with worry tomorrow it will burst from here he will beseech the gods for eight for they will be death to his christ and soon the ravenclaw will feast on his death you know these isles best bulkists lead us to victory i will show the way but you must lead us there oh hey lord i missed having you at my side how i wished i could have taken you along on my travels stephen did not trust fate with both our lives we have no reason to fear together we are unstoppable these northern lights are pretty aren't they i think it's that settlement over there that we've got to get to we're going to do a raid here i guess all right this might be tricky yep it's a raid get ready here we go [Music] yes it must be scared of me wearing this giant bear on my head [Music] nice lots of explosive barrels around that dude's on fire ah go up damn you i'm on fire time for some looting i think smoke grenade what the hell i think if i draw can i light that on fire yeah look at that oh extra damage nice i used to be an adventurer and then i took an arrow to the knees there's another one here watch your back you want to watch out right you're a bit too close there are they our ships or enemy ships i'm not sure that dude just fist pumping it's a bit of a cabin here check this out wait that was an easy one wasn't it collect the book of knowledge oh throwing axe fury cool right so these are the abilities on the bottom right you can use these in combat but they take a little while to build up you can't just spam them over and over again what button should we put that on why i feel like you want their own axes on y you can change it if you want give me the loops i want all the things not fall was it not foul i feel like the frame rate's dropping a little bit here i don't know if you guys can pick up on that on the stream most of the time it does feel like a solid 60 though i've got the game on pc as well so next stream we do i might continue on pc just as a comparison kind of thing but i mean it's doing fine on the xbox i think animations are a bit glitchy at times though but i think that's the game name yourself i know his face he met with your father not long ago i did indeed i am guthorn uncle king harold i speak for my nephew when there is need this is not king harold's land why does he send warriors so far south you may ask him yourself my lord hmm thank you uncle and you are sigurd of the raven clan is that right king harold son of the wise king stephen looks like the guy from skyrim and you are standing on his land king harold land we have reclaimed with blood and steel that i see and i honor it for i have not come to war against you but for you at the request of your father the canny wolf was this the plan he spoke of i offer my support with my warriors your ravenclan can take curtway's fortress and settle this rivalry for good this is good news ivor the wandering king will tip our fortunes hmm any man who wishes to see the enemy i can't raise a friend i'm going to agree with him we thank you king harald your trust in me will be repaid this blood feud runs deep king harald we welcome your help but i must lead the charge i see is this a question of honor it is many winters ago cut we broke an oath to our fathers he betrayed a friendly piece slaughtered many i understand sacred yard will lead the assault against cutway and his clan give him full command of my ships and my warriors when your victory is in hand cigarette find me at al rextader and we will celebrate together [Music] i want to be that big one though our men will gather at florida near the mouth of the fjord north east of here will you join us almost a moment you captain our longship aboard meet us there and we will claim curtis head for the gods brother i have waited too many years for this day when kyoto stands before us give me the final blow you will have it ivor you deserve it um disapproval avail give us a hand it is not the way of this generous with his troops more than i would be i cannot fathom his game he's either a young fool or deceptively wise whatever his reason i have a good feeling this war is near its end such a strange name isn't it the man that slayed my father are you out so good open the tower careful of the assassins no guys can we can we go nice i just want to go across okay there we go hey vore you missed the opening act kurt way's forward camp melted like a spring thaw at our approach is it from here we launch our attack we do indeed and we are ready to fight king harold's forces are well in place only give the word i will but before we strike i have a request name it the neighbor may give challenge to curt at the gate of his fortress a battle to the death in single combat 1v1 yes is this what you want yes cure to erupt my father of all honor and dignity i will win it back when honor is at stake let none interfere and if curtis should die before the battle begins all the better for our chances today my blade must do the work of school's sharp scissors and cut short the cord of cuteness fate well said my shout-out warrior scout may we all live to hear that saga some avor a word basim i them this feud is not yours yet you fight it all the same i find that strange you find it strange because you are wrong our clan the hidden ones have been fighting with kyoto's order for centuries you came from miklagard to kill kyoto yourself we did or rather we came so that haitham could kill him my apprentice has been studying this target for many months is kyoto's reputation so great outside norway not his reputation alone but the order to which he belongs something of a rival clan to our own hyphen i mean no disrespect to you other hidden ones but kyoto he's mine my family's honor is at stake i understand all that matters is that chortle dies this day on that we are agreed kill kittfer everyone wants to kill kirta [Music] oh dude sick huh [Music] gearing up for the raid brothers slink around my walls like a thief in the night face me here now the fight is mine killed me secret is only here to watch me feed your innards to my raven look at this once again abel wolfkist appears to take a swipe at me this this is my father's shame today i take back the honor he lost i call home gang here against the oath breaker i will make you beg as your father begged wolf kiss squeal as your mother screaming melee combat hand to hand you destroyed my life i will take yours you are weak like your father was hold on just just wait a second kit but i just need to spend these skill points okay way of the bear right have i got the right stuff i feel like i'm feeling pretty good right now i can take this dude that's better than your fight that's a good opponent right there i need no weapons but these hands dude right you cannot avoid your death i want to avoid death that's not the right one he's good at uh missing they're dodging me i'm really bad at dodging him straight for death uh what oh i've accidentally gone into photo mode okay let's take a photo put that on instagram oh god my blade will drink your blood your flesh will feed my wolves i don't like this at all i could parry that one i mean gotta make sure i keep hitting him with light attacks i'm out of arrows as well nope he's fine oh my god no no where are you going with me down in the mud no don't do it don't do it it's not dead is it he's picked up the body you are your father's child yes suck on that sweet revenge let's go wooden what do you want with me you won your price we've kissed the glory of my death all for this now the childhood father this empty sacrifice the harvest of three dead generations all their names are known it all means nothing no my plan will not be forgotten i fought as i did as hard as i did to survive after i know what awaits us in the end only darkness what is going on i'm so confused ravenclaw your lives are forfeit come forward if you must into the crucible of your doom your father is dead gorham be paid open the gates and you will be spared wallowing [ __ ] wolf kissed archers take aim ravens show no mercy i was just about to say they used to have those kind of cutscenes in the original assassin's creed games when you assassinated your target you would have this moment which was like an outer body experience but that seemed different that was like i don't know it was weird it was almost like it was a different realm or something online service error okay i can keep playing right i think we just gotta get up there then find out oh come on let's just do this you're finished i'm kind of surrounded right now the animation is sick i like that a lot it's cool right okay so we've got to open up the gate so the boys can get in here get in lads did i get a new helmet i did didn't i think the one i've got on at the moment is better though i'm gonna try um 55 damage 45 i don't know if i should try that new axe i'll keep this one for now i like having the shield get over that wall and take down the gate take down the gate and these waves are kind of cool you choose death you choose who are you you're a big lad aren't you you just cancel my attack get that ruined your stamina you've really got to be aggressive in this game whoa ow a whoa bringer that's a pretty cool name dab isn't it i have the wall ringer i wish i could have seen that but the camera kind of glitched out anyways right let's go unlock that gate i think that was a bit of a mini boss there that i have to get past one hit kill okay uh we'll go around this way i climb here yeah look at that it's a bit tricky sometimes to get the lock off the opponent these enemies aren't attacking me either they're just like one of them [Music] see that is sick some of those animations are really cool [Applause] oh my god headshots everywhere attacks as well right we gotta go get gorm hold up in here somewhere flying pursuit of vengeance has made you predictable you are a shadow of your father gorm weak and witless and you will leave this place as ashes on the wind no is he just setting everything on fire escape the building that was easy the coward gone flees he's off his father dies twice today what are we gonna chase nope taking it for ourselves your place fortuitous [Applause] we have the day let the coward go the lighting is a bit weird at times doesn't it everything looks black and white strange i know it's night time but i feel like there's something not quite right there [Applause] the breath of battle rises from my brow the skulls will sing of this night we have won the day but gorham escaped he's led north to king harold's domain let that bruce piglet run where he may his father is dead his clan is no more we are the masters of ria vilge a toothless cup may grow to be a dangerous wolf aywood stop and listen you have reclaimed your honor enjoy the night's victory tomorrow we will celebrate you're right brother
