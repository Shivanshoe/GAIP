hi everyone and welcome to vampire the masquerade blood hunt a big thanks to blood hunt for sponsoring this live stream and video the game has just entered early access on steam and is free to play and if you're interested in checking out for yourself there's a link down in the description below and we're going to be playing tonight for a couple hours just solo but you can play squads if you want as well you can switch modes there in the bottom right trios or solos at the moment and this is my character i mean not the prettiest vampire you know does the job though but uh the game has a battle pass you know with that free-to-play model all that good stuff in there plenty of customization uh but the coolest thing about this br is that you are a vampire which means you can do crazy stuff like climb up walls do big jumps and you can also pick from at the moment one of six archetypes and these guys have different abilities for example the brute you can do the soaring leap it's got true grit as well replenishes up to half of their health while not taking damage and they've also got this big shock wave punch which is really cool for like smashing someone back and then blowing them away with a shotgun these are different bands i suppose of characters in the game so there's two bruges two nosferatu and two corridor i'm really bad at pronouncing this but i'm gonna be playing as the prowler and i did put a couple of different things on no i don't like that one got some customization options here too now i haven't played this since the last time that i tried it which was a capture event and i've already done one video on this and it was just like a cut down highlights of a uh a solo match so it's gonna be fun to get back into it now that it's uh in early access and it's released see if they've made any big improvements to it or whatever well thank you for joining in and see you guys in the stream right now what's up matty hello pro beasty x factor brandon what's up man how you doing first first time here where's the ucaf i don't this game has a u-cap brandon hello paddy cameron what's up soupy a dark side protic stan what's up there's a couple of really interesting mechanics with the game as well when we get into the the match with the the zone i suppose you know how typically vr games have a circle zone that uniformly pushes in let's say something like apex or warzone pubg this alters based on the number of players left i think and it changes based on the position of the players so it's kind of different every time it's a bit of a unique spin on it without further ado let's queue up for a game it's my first ever match by the way on the early access version i literally haven't queued into a game yet i just installed it set up my controls and everything can we win the first game or will we get annihilated i imagine we're going to get annihilated what's up carlos hey killer potato drip bg welcome to the stream guys alexi what's up i think we're going into a game here we go now there's also ai on the map as well and you can do various things with them they give you different perks i suppose based on what color they are based on what type of blood they have and there are ai that you can fight and you go and fight them and they guard epic glute basically like the good stuff hey joshua i'm getting a minigun as well which is like you know one of the best things in the game but it's super rare i've only had it once when i played hey chico alex child lonely pilot what's up don't know if this is just still loading oh there we go right so you can pick your spawn as well and it will show you who's nearby so i go to the harbor the little vampire uav oh my god there's loads of people there i'm gonna go there instead yeah i didn't want to spawn there maybe the harbour's a really popular spot i don't know honestly and the prowler i think is what i wanted to play i'll stick with that hey moose what's up stud no it didn't hey better hey lacy love you sir is jack any good at this game probably not defeated it's my first match so i wish i'll see we shall see what's up uh from amsterdam how's it going my dude it should look really nice as well on the stream 1440p super high bitrate as well on youtube vampire uav unmanned aerial vampire i like that evan i like that a lot looks like voldemort yeah it's a lady though it's a lady vampire hey riley why does she look like my nan you know you've got an interesting nan that's all i'll say hey martin is it on console as well yeah and it's cross-platform i think what's up crispy baron greetings from slovakia taking a little while to load and we're in you start with a pistol i'm gonna eat you now if i get seen when i'm eating someone [Music] i essentially break the masquerade and that's bad because it marks me on the map for a minute i think i need to find some loot i've got nothing that's a red guy there probably won that don't i do slide these as well so that's gonna increase my melee damage not that i'm gonna really be into melee that much i don't think i will usually in the back of these vans you can find good loot what's that double barrel shotgun oh this is the zone here can i open that no just climb uh sergeant match thank you for becoming a member that's how you heal you get little needles and you also get blood bags it was a sniper rifle up there dual crossbows i'll get that sniper rifle it's like an svd or something some more loot down here it's a trap yeah i'm sure there's already a meta in this game i just don't know what it is i mean there's all sorts of crazy strats because it's been a couple days now in early access is that a bad guy i think that is a bad guy right so i did get it down there there's another one but what happens is if you are down for long enough you actually get back up see i just got another two there so i think one of those is the one that i downed i'll finish him off get some of this blood bag ak i'll take the ak instead of the sniper oh there's a blue one there nice head up to the roof three kills on the board already guys that's not bad is it oh i didn't did i not pick up that ak or i switched it there we go got an ak and a shotgun now i'm getting away there i need to heal how do i heal again is it g yeah there's a way that you can switch the consumables there as well that dude nearly killed me then i think you see there's an armor thing there too i think i hear them i've got this little right above me this guy's hunting me maybe i should just go i don't want to come up against some kind of pro vampire already you know in my first match excuse me dude it's just me i'm a vampire chill oh that's good though i should eat that one [Music] it was a misfire i'm sorry chill get back up to the roof i think i'm out of consumables here to do some heels that's the blood back there give it to me what's that a crossbow ak there's someone down here i think they just had a fight but i can't find where they are [Music] what the hell maybe over here that red marker on the mini map yeah so you see that guy there he's blood hunted right now the ai's just killed him i think they just got killed by the ai i know they're being uh chomped what the hell okay we got him oh that was close that guy nearly killed me i think there's someone else either because the ai is shooting at someone that god oh they're gonna kill me if i'm not careful no no no no quick i wanted to get up this way oh there's a guy up there no way look at that i'm on that tower i'm jumping down on a hill i can't heal and the zones come in oh you're right there oh my goodness that guy came out of nowhere i'm on the ai can protect me yeah say i protect me protect me i'm gonna be in the zone though i'm not

him oh you escaped this is unreal unbelievable where's the first game in the bag yeah you can heal on npcs as well if you run around and you find them on the street i was just in a bit of a sticky situation there i reckon 10.44 that's first game in the back what do you think guys what do you think a good evening to you anton what's up from jordan uh lawrence did this come out already yeah it's in early access uh the gunplay is pretty pretty fun yeah hey yankee what's up sean is this game made by a czech developer no it's made by a company called shark mob games i think they're based in sweden oh a new studio they actually have a couple of ex dice developers working for them which is interesting oh yeah it's free to play it's early access on steam if you click the link in the description you can uh check it out you can slide a long long way can i do oh yeah you've got the sarcastic clap i like this one can i get other people to flap with me no they weren't interested in clapping with me can you play with the controller yeah you can oh you can still hear me clapping you hear that the vampire will just be clapping forever it's fine if i was a vampire i'd go for people with potassium in their diet that's interesting calor why potassium they have energy rtx on i don't think it has rts arthur morgan a problem i reckon you could get really good with the melee though super overpowered what's up azik christian hey gabby dubsy what's up still clapping yeah forever forever clapping who knows teddy who knows eat more bananas i do like a banana thomas yeah i do enjoy an occasional banana the thing is with bananas right they've got to be a little bit green still and they've got a sweet spot they've got like two or three days in that sweet spot and then after that they start to get brown i know some people like it when they get brown in the spots on and everything but that's not they they taste like a science experiment after that you know when they've got a bit of green on them they're still nice you know a little bit fun not too sweet not too bananary perfect sir scored yeah sure welcome back well welcome back i didn't go anywhere we got here we got helpy oh she's a lot taller than me there's lord voldemort there's lord voldemort with glasses there's lord voldemort again as loki maya hello stranger hello i think you do missions or challenges in

volunteers to head into old town and kill any anarch you find there they're like little in-game challenges [Music] fun games pretty quick that statue was weird did you see that for a second dude was

bread banana pudding um banana milkshake banana banana you could also try banana banana banana banana ramen that's good and you could also just banana but once they get past that point i'm not interested i don't think so straight into it again uh so we spawned down here last time so let's go uh let's go up here the sky bar a debuffed kratos maybe bernard maybe oh i've got a lot of people to my east my prowler again i want to want to try like a couple of matches with each archetype intron are you okay no i'm not okay no i'm not is anyone i mean that guy is blood hunted already same as last time is that a secret oh my god uh another gun what the hell yo this this guy has got a poisonous crossbows on there what the hell's that about please give me a break i need to find a gun uh what do we get there tommy gun okay should we go third party some people there's a guy above me i don't know if i've got time to do this is that guys right above me doing the same thing we'll say got him i quite like the gun playing this it feels quite quite nice oh god there's someone around me i'm trying to armor i think i can hear someone [Music] that little mp9 or something oh that looks sick check that out pogba automatic oh it looks like a bar what the hell are there above me all right let's go get him stick that in my neck let's go reminds me of the specialist this game it's probably it's a really really old reference that but there was a mod ages ago for um half-life what the hell i don't have any ammo left guys it was a mod for half-life called the specialists and that was sick and the skis again i think i'm dead right above me [Music] oh you didn't heal why didn't you heal maybe i can get some armor here yes thank you very much uh arm is there put that on what's the mouth hey dep you can slide and shoot as well yeah but the specialist had like the matrix characters in it had die hard it had all the action movie stars you know from like hong kong cinema that kind of stuff you could dive through the air you could do slow motion slide that was sick man all right so this is the ai but i don't yeah i don't i don't think i should go there to be honest dude you nearly killed me oh no there was another player the guy that i down's gonna get back up no you leave me alone you stay away no you stay away no i said fighting to the fighter and the ai does not mess around [Music] kind of gross that you just stick blood into your neck but i guess you are a vampire so makes sense right i don't like that oh it's done for there oh my god dude just let me eat people in peace is it that difficult your pistols are pretty sick though i don't know if they're any good in terms of damage though what's that i don't know what that is that could be a respawn for squads you play squads sneaky bicky what's up bloodbag i feel like i should get an ak though i should replace that but then i've got an ar and an smg which is a nice so i like the idea of that we head up to this roof here um there's a lot of ai down there there's a purple guy i don't have any perks really i've got one orange perk which was the cholesterol right cholesterol i don't know if it's cholesterol what's it no it's color colorate hey boys no there's no way that's where i almost died before uh pg thank you for the two how about instead of gas it was dawn approaching be an interesting concept wouldn't it like you're you're a vampire out in the night and then as the match continues the sun starts to rise and that's the danger man where do we go sniper rifle will be perfect here wouldn't it you can get mad distance as well if you do the sliding jump like that didn't quite make it was that a guy there oh well played he's a good player there i nearly had him though i might spectate this guy for a bit the shadowy spots of safety huh oh they've got the blades as well come on it says this guy has zero kills how is that possible they just killed me that can't be right yeah there's no fall damage at all sergeant ttk is quite long if they've got armor animal yeah i want to see if they use these blades you can like deflect bullets with the blades and everything kind of cool hey geeky the kill count is bugged in spectate okay thank you good knowledge this guy's probably on a 20 bomb or something i wish i could switch to the next player i just stood there hey mr pickle great name by the way mr pickle well it's me mr pickle nice to meet you that's how i imagine that you sound like these blades let you lunge forward yeah i want to see some slicing and dice in there come on endo let's do it down below i think oh man that was kind of crazy i think this guy's played a lot i feel like he knows what he's doing nothing there that you want oh big fight here big fight oh no he's lost him he lost track of him he's going for him with the blades [Music] you're finding it right [Music] you take a lot of damage there in the storm oh 100 hp get a life still there maybe from something get him picks up some armor there a method i want to see if this guy wins he's the dude killed me i tell he was a really good player by the movement random screen [Applause] uh elite ninja thank you for becoming a member you can now join the discord pro gamer move right there here we go big fight get the blades out get the blades oh no he jumped off he jumped off third party let's go i'll play some blades oh dude that was sick what the hell did like a leap sliding attack there i'd love to know how many kills this guy's got audio is really chunky hey steve is it solos only no you can play trial as trios as well socks i i nearly said triola's or like triola's that's probably not a real word is it and he's coming out on console eventually i think yeah this is on steam early access right now on pc oh someone's taking part he's cracked he's crack sleepers cracked on the vampire cracked on the teeth i think you would say i see the map inspector fiola is a candy well there you go equalizer i didn't know that oh no no they lost a lot of health there on the open here taking cover drink that blood drink the blood being pushed though using the ability to get away oh no they might lose this one last player one versus one oh endo got down they lost it [Music] raggy mcrage face one good job right raggy mcrae's face bro gamer complete some challenges i got a swanky new jacket there living the dream so i put my new jacket on uh it's 1440p ml good morning oh good morning i think i'm playing it all on uh i graphics yes 12 as well resolution scale 100 amd fsr i don't know what that is it's not like sharpening or something it's all on higher lots of customization i think it's on real engine ue4 it's quite a nice looking game what's that new the classic leather should we go for the classic classic leather there's never any remote for how i feel though so no no no no you think i could get people to sit down in a big conga line if i sit here come sit behind me come sit they're not interested guys it's their own dlss by amd oh i see right yeah i've got an nvidia card so i don't think i could use that anyway i will try a different archetype this match if you use your powers in front of npcs you break the masquerade but you look like a literal walking corpse that's kind of cool hey tommo what's up you don't like the motion blur thomas i thought i had turned it off maybe it's just turned it back on or something it works on all cards i don't think i need to turn it on though because my frame rate is nuts anyway jump slide shot like always you can okay it works on nvidia but not as good as dlss in general right you guys know way more than i do about this stuff antenna rooftop restaurant no i don't i don't want to spawn by anyone construction site there's only one person that we've got to kill here did you guys see the bf 2042 warzone collab there's no way that's true not in a million years um i'll try i'll try playing brute maybe this match uh mr j thank you for becoming a member mr j that's how you know their mates when they pop in their buddy's stream me and tommo played a really interesting game last night with uh acolyte fogle and stone mine [Laughter] it's a third person shooter vince yeah what happened to the term dolphin diving i don't know but i mean people don't really say that much anymore was it purple [Music] hello it's me your friendly neighborhood vampire thank you for the blood so where can a vampire get some loot around here a mega jump i i think that's just a normal npc is that an enemy there did i just see an enemy maybe i did laying there and try something [Music] well that didn't work oh you can do you leap backwards that's kind of cool they weren't in this oh look at that it's a sniper rifle what the hell that seems pretty marksman rifle you coming in there they go there's a helipad where'd that guy go i don't know bang it's not gonna do damage when i land a spiked bat oh scourge blades stop graffiti that's illegal i don't have any armor do i wait that's illegal go up i'm trying this sniper rifle there's something there though the crossbow is amazing is it really geeky i mean most times in uh vr games or pvp games crossbows or bows and arrows are kind of trash but i'll uh if i see it again i'll i'll pick it up and i'll give it a go i'll take your word it would be cool if you could pick armor up and just like have it auto equip you know that's a blue crossbow i'll leave that one more armor there what if i could snipe someone from here oh baby the big map isn't it if you want i can i'm just saying i think they're behind that vent there i mean i'm too inquisitive like i have to go and see 80 damage that dead there's someone down here a few moments later all right i can't go down there and and diabularize that guy because i think there's too many ai down there oh he can that guy just did a bit an ability while he was down who's that someone shot at me from over here what the npc npcs are going crazy guys the army back on this gives me batman vibes i guess yeah i mean like upon arkan [Music] asylum chilling i suppose you could use the ai to identify where people are this weapon has an ability oh that's it i remember in the other build of the game that i played though like they weren't very good so maybe they buffed them because that guy i was specking last match actually used them and got a few kills with them that's a better sniper rifle okay there's a gunshot down there i don't see anyone though i'm just in the new zone here music's getting a bit serious guys i'm scared i'm scared for my life i don't know what's going to happen i want to snipe some people but i don't see anyone where's everyone out there's an orange one down there i reckon i could kill this lady here oh she think towards me she wants it hey digi what's up from fiji how you doing i feel really vulnerable when i'm down on the ground though like this you know there's an enemy over here [Music] what if i can surprise this guy [Music] i'm stuck i'm stuck dice oh my god [Music] i've got time to do things i've got to get away get away got more armor that i can put on there was a dude chasing me there [Music] they're climbing up [Music] oh yes i nearly lost that one that felt i felt pretty good though i enjoyed that outer space god oh god i kind of want to keep the current set that i've got i actually couldn't vote over it wouldn't let me vote i did miss the powerful attack as well unfortunately it's definitely a different take on br this isn't it i don't think there's anything else like this someone fighting down here there's loot there so they're probably around here somewhere i can i can hear them [Music] [Applause] yo the fights are really interesting you know oh no [Music] i'm dead i'm dead [Music] i'm gonna stand that roof and heal i'm trying to get away here come on come on come on are we safe i feel like we're safe damn that was close where'd they go get back in the zone [Music] i pushed him in the zone there [Applause] i'm gonna eat you oh man i'm getting fired up i'm really enjoying this this is good fun oh gold mp7 sick what is that red gas i've never even seen that before the hell grants 10 seconds of red gas immunity that's interesting so i can just [Music] it's like a gas mask basically i've got no armor though i think this is bad zones oh hello oh okay [Music] that guy was invisible but i hit him i didn't think it was gonna hit fire axe no no no no i have eight spectators what why are you spectating me stop spectating me i don't like it i like you guys watching though but not you know not the in-game spectators i'm not about that life there's not much zone left is there really i'm gonna shot in the back four of the people left where are they guys i don't see anyone any armor no i don't see any all right guy just jumped over here they stay on the roof yeah i'm gonna punch him are you going for me [Music] yes i mean it's getting real real small now it's getting real small how did i go down so quick i just feel like i just died instantly then what happened i don't understand how it went down so quick then what did he hit me with that's a good game though enjoyed that i like that class can you just push people into the gas so like blow them away from you and then shoot them [Music] [Applause] [Music] obi-wan got me man i i even had the high ground ruin gold gun i had full health and full armor and i just died instantly even though i like i pushed them back into the storm did some damage then i just died i don't really understand i'll have to watch that back maybe it was a shotgun it just blasted me could have been the gas because it's like end game but i mean that did a lot of damage if it was just the gas right might have been a crossbow okay well this dude's got a samurai sword he's got the katana he's got some kind of like proximity mine is that an ak i can't tell because they keep going invisible that's the little tray isn't it it was almost like i got one shot this is so sneaky oh there's the last guy over there so this archetype when they crouch they go semi-invisible they're not completely invisible you can sight you can kind of see them shimmer like this right but it's a really neat trait to have especially in a situation like this towards endgame i this other player has no idea where they are if he has a sniper rifle the crossbow okay it was a crossbow then i mean that crossbow ruined me i don't think there was any guess there that's the bar uh coleman thank you for becoming a member oh my god what can i just do in a moe oh you're in the gas obi wan the sith coming in clutch well played use the sun gun what's that can i just like leave this bit do i have to wait no it just skips yeah you guys can watch that back on the stream you know if you click on the bar at the bottom someone go back and watch it and tell me what happened let's break it down for me challenge completely so i get new challenges now here come oh my oh those are my dailies i say there's a minigun around here somewhere yeah this statue is a bit sus i mean come on went back to watch it it was a crossbow with gas that knocked you down to 25 percent health as soon as he came up fair enough bit sauce isn't it really that's a fun game we had some really good fights there pretty intense you were hit by your own fireball can you i don't think you can do that matthew fireball fireball direct hit with the crossbow and he oh okay thank you geeky yeah i read what zachary said as well yeah see you later ryzen thank you for coming along elson [Music] 2042 i can't read that what's up cool hey mad dog you like the invisibility poke because you can blend in with the surrounding area around you yeah it's interesting pain well you know you live in your life what are you dying to learn hey david what's up it was a gas trap prepped it looked like and he shot you plus stone but that was little i felt like i died instantly david uh david sterling who's in the chat right now he's one of the lead devs on this game by the way really nice guy all right so i spawned at construction didn't i what about the divine disco should we go there the divine disco bit of blade is it venice no it's uh prague say in prague um so i haven't played a siren or muse i'm not sure what these guys do i think they have a flashbang giga chad yes indeed what's up jack stevens how are you doing huh you want to no i'm not one of the developers no i couldn't develop a game for toffee if i made a game it would be awful i do have some ideas for games but i don't know how to make them i can make 3d models animations uh but i'm terrible at programming and like design documentation stuff like that i'm just not good at it uh will crispin thank you for becoming a member is very kindly man any tips for a new wannabe youtuber personal pigeon oh man i i would not want to be starting from scratch today let me tell you because there's so much competition so much saturation um any tips i would say use the tools that the platform has given you and promotes actively like for example with youtube if i was starting new i'd be making a load of shorts and i'd be doing a lot of live streaming right now that's what that's the matter i know it's really weird to say that but that is that is the meta oh can i go in this disco is blade gonna be in there oh my god i don't know what my abilities are that's a hill obviously i'm not going to go should i take them on i'm going to say come on where'd they go oh yeah i can hear someone behind me that's a teleport that's cool it's like on your tournament oh i thought i was dead then for sure foreign i've got the moves i've got the moves boy nice try uh what's that double barrel purple double barrel i just want to go in the disco [Music] why is that dance what is that i hope that's not mocap though no one actually did that that's cool [Music] it's mom [Music] i may have heard someone then [Music] i want to go i want to go want to go so it was agatha all along [Music] i like this smg it's cool dude the gun playing the movement in this is actually sick it's really well done like from a mechanical perspective it's very good i just wish i could dive through the air like max spain i didn't expect that i just came out of nowhere 10 seconds no you're always so close always so close yeah i tried to throw my teleport up to the roof there but i missed it and i hit the side of the building yeah that was um that class is quite interesting i think like that one would be really good for trios if it's an aoe heal and you can heal your teammates like that'd be so [Music] is this the guns it's i mean it's got similar kind of gameplay to that bg that's it how do you remember that game man i completely forgot about that game uh yes game i am going to watch the playstation showcase it's going to be interesting i'm really looking forward to it because um you know sony haven't done anything like all summer like when was the last time that they they did something right so i think they're gonna show a lot of gameplay hope so maybe i'd have had a chance to revive where have we not been we've been in most most places like we've been over here the antenna maybe not ak techie bear thank you for the five how do you feel about the recent moves of tim the tatman and dr lupo coming from twitch to youtube i think it's great techy yeah i think they're going to thrive on youtube like for live streaming youtube is uh it's massive it's growing it's getting a lot bigger and i i just think it's going to accelerate and uh the best thing about youtube for me personally and for those guys is the vods like after you do a live stream you can just turn it into a vod straight away and people can watch that um and it's good from a growth standpoint but also an ad revenue standpoint like uh live streams turn to vods monetize really well [Music] obviously you know they'll have been paid to come over from twitch so it'll be like a minimum guarantee a minimum number of hours probably like two-year contract or something like that but i think you know it totally makes sense for them at the moment yeah it's cool the times are changing i think for gaming so i don't know what this guy what have i got here i've got the teleport and i've got the flash so this dude is the same as the last one but i can flashbang people i think as well as teleport apple thank you also the quality on youtube is so much better than twitch like um you can stream in 4k 50 000 bitrate i mean i'm streaming this 1440p uh 20 000 bitrate [Music] and here's someone over here i think youtube needs to work on his chat a bit but apart from that i love it i think it's really good i'll put that there in case i need to fall back only someone else here try this flashbang here they go i'm kind of screwed now okay i need to get the high ground oh no i'm dead i'm dead that's really poor trying to figure out where everyone was there but i think it was just more than i realized give again i don't mind youtube's uh chat steve i don't mean the the quality of the chat like is in the context of people watching the chat brilliant it's just the layout of it i think they could improve it in certain aspects what's up cinderella thank you for coming is it just third person yes it is uh i noticed your 4k vanguard stream that was nice image quality yeah thank you kyle if you're an established content creator as well like if you're already on youtube and you haven't started live streaming yet you should just do it on youtube i don't think you should switch platform assassin's creed battle royale kind of yeah not trolling or upset the slide vibes grew up on those games they're cool pudge you play dota pudge did i ever play prototype yeah i did it was uh was it just single player and you were like a mutant and you you had all these abilities and you could jump up i kind of like this game to be honest it loot i'll go down there then yeah a lot of people have said that it reminds them of this game i'm gonna play the first class that i played one two three four people here uh was it prowler i feel like the prowler is definitely the best class right now like because you've got an escape an invas and you've got a a wall hack basically if you put the bats in the right place prototype needs a new one or infamous i wouldn't be surprised if we see a new infamous game to be honest that was quite a popular ip back in the day yeah i made i'm going to watch it yeah i've got high tier loot down here well it's ai so i need to figure this out like is it even worth going after the ai in solo matches i don't know that guy didn't notice me i'm taking him out with a pistol but they've got a gun now you kind of float in there as well prosper that's an explosive crossbow i've got low ammo guys i'm so you can't go in the water uh guys you can't go in the water i did not know that well that's embarrassing it just insta kills you i'm not sure about that you should have a chance to escape at least wasn't that a proper wilhelm scream as well no it wasn't it was the um it was the howie scream okay vampires can't swim well you know i haven't seen twilight so you know maybe i would have known that if i'd have seen twilight maybe it was a shark yeah it's a good point in tron vampires should be able to swim come on there's no wooden stakes in the water i mean there's no garlic it was the willow yeah it was really loud as well that gave me a jump scare i have to be honest who says vamp holy water yeah but i mean it's just a it's just a it's just a canal in the in prague i mean that's not holy water you need the vicar you know sacrament all that stuff they swim in twilight zaid thank you see i've not seen it so if i'd have watched twilight i would have assumed i would have made the assumption i could go in the water and i would have died rest in fish they can breathe they can even breathe under the water in twilight dark red there you go i feel like i've been cheated there the dock is made of wooden stakes no is it it's a dark is it it'll make docks full of wooden stakes imagine how dangerous that would be for people if every time you went on a dock you could die because there's just snakes everywhere and you might trip up could have been a holy shark howl yeah that's true the entity obviously christened the canals that's the law behind it isn't it david yeah right there he's done me there maybe it's garlic weather could be well the holy shark is the most promising hypothesis and i agree with you steakhouser is this a twilight trivia stream i hope not kyle i don't want it to be that uh like i said never seen the movies so some people like those movies just saying i'm never going anywhere near the water again i'm just gonna start the last round what's this helicopter doing what why were the helicopters there in the first place what the hell oh that guy's blood hunted already okay we go get him we'll go get him we'll try even though i don't have armor they come this way i'm here hey sorry guys sorry it was me [Applause] just your average run of the mill vampire no biggie lots of damage there it's low rate of fire lots of damage can i eat this lady without hey can you can you can you go so i can eat this lady because if i eat the lady you see i'll be hunted and i don't want that what if we just dance [Music] i don't think she's interested in me guys yeah you messed up i just wanted to dance oh my god she's mounted up um there's an orange ladder over there are you special no you've been you've been turned none of you are special i don't care for any of you i don't care no you're not special [Music] it that's it go away go away go away she's being quite aggressive i like the orange it looks like antlers or something isn't it hey hey don't go around the corner meth is a hell of a drug [Music] think of how many characters you could bring into this game yeah i mean there's quite a few options really am i i was saying uh i was saying this yesterday imagine if they did this game in the marvel universe so you could you could be blade or like you know blaze vampires or something or what if buffy the vampire slayer was hunting you like an ai mpc that rose around the level trying to stake you but if you kill her you get like a super um buffy the vampire slayer perk how about that yeah game designers come to me i've got all the ideas it's bounty contracts for vampires i stole it from warzone come on can i go in that church i think i've got one do they hit so hard oh what is that that was cool you could be mobius yeah you could be you could be giles angel morbius is a marvel character so yeah is it yeah it is right i think someone's down here i'm going to attack that this new rifle that's the burst rifle dude that is sick that's unfortunate for you mate well i mean hulk isn't really a vampire character is it now guys come on i wouldn't that's not gonna work is it a purple sniper rifle and the blaze of destiny i'm gonna call them the blaze of destiny i'm gonna go with that there's a guy right next to me oh that was my kill where did that guy go oh i love that i'm still up here fine oh i hate that thing so much actually sucks i've been revealed though because i'm near the bats but i mean the aoe on that is huge 50 live steal on melee so you're saying i should mail therefore [Music] i'm a bit wary of this guy above me because they sound like a demon i feel like you're encouraging me to melee people there david funky sounds in this game someone up here let's go have a look you're gonna hear me well that was tricky man that guy did not want to die well this guy's blood-hunted so i think i should go for him i've been annoying vampire up to no good [Music] i think i killed them i'm gonna draw my bass [Music] [Music] i accidentally killed a civilian now i'm revealed dammit oh no you're on the roof oh okay okay

slide i serve myself up like a hot chicken dinner on a sunday like my eyes have just been assaulted i my heart is pumping i don't it's my it's madness like what is what is going on actually just right there chilling [Music] i thought they'd be on the roof we tried so hard guys jack fangs i love that that was a great game though i mean i think that really demonstrated the uh the craziness that this game can be you gotta really concentrate hard though i'm trying my best to keep an eye on chat and concentrate and play the game at the same time a good evening to yours are it's a bit difficult yeah james it gets intense man so i try um i might try group see what groups are like just play with some randoms i bid you farewell i nearly killed that guy as well right like i did the slide i think i'd i broke the armor maybe it wasn't good enough though you know second place not you don't get a gold medal second place sorry star wars knight to the old republic remake no way is that real or is that is that troll this is multiplayer stephan now these are real players robbie what's my texture settings everything's on high uh thank you chauncey hello tv groups start out absolutely mental then get slow near the end okay um yeah whatever we'll go here i don't care thank you james awesome jesse but have you guys seen what what we do in the shadows the movies and the show is so funny i would recommend very good that'd be the brute i'm playing vandal have i i've vandal i know he's playing bundle all right i'll go oh my dude's got some sick customization now under brute edu route here we go first group match so someone just said in chat that this is crazy so we'll see [Music] um yeah this game is coming to consoles as well but at the moment it's early access on pc that's an enemy i'm not gonna run into an entire team here and die probably my teammate if i am who are you fine are you sure you're not lemon zest lemon zest but you know what i'm gonna try this crossbow saying his geeky said it was good let's put a trap down there oh there's some armor here bro i'm gonna need that see if i can eat anyone no no no no no no no no no [Music] okay you need to you need to relax tennis you just need to relax just chill everything's gonna be okay i've got a crossbow i would like a better other gun though you know hello that'll do big that'll do [Music] i mean you might as well pick up the melee just in case last resort oh look at this is that a chest it's the first time i've seen that dual crossbows i don't mind if i do my teammates are being hammered right now are they they're exposed [Music] i'm out of ammo i'm in the zone and we're all dead i completely forgot about design [Music] you can't be revived naturally by yourself when you're in the gas i think [Music] yeah there's no way this game needs werewolf characters i'll be interested michael well that didn't go very well did it 10 out of 12. awful so those little dual crossbows are explosive who knew zombies yeah it could be the zombies could be the play i'm going to try another group match use in case of emergency um this is uh that blog from fantastic beasts as well as loki oh john paul you were lemon zest you're from wait you're you're from south africa but you've got a european server that's crazy oh yeah gg i mean i know it didn't last very long but we tried can you invite friends and play together yeah you can uh my friends tommy bong and hans were playing together in a group earlier they weren't like five games in a row or something am i watching what if yeah i am it's really good ballistic you know it's uh it's a different take on everything that they're doing with the mcu and it just allows them to make some crazy stuff that you wouldn't see in the movies it's good i enjoy it how do you connect to eu servers though from south africa did you just pick them or something where are we dropping boys as drake would say okay hey daniel williams what's up daniel williams we don't have local servers oh i see right so you just have to deal with the ping that kind of sucks is this free to play yeah it's stupid link in the description if you want to check it out uh bear thank you so much you've been watching for years thanks to the entertainment no problem i'm proudly clearly the best so we're gonna go with that again yeah the latest episode of what if was uh was cool with the zombies and the one before that with doctor strange that was like pretty dark i like that kind of stuff though do british people turn off their accent when no one is around what do you mean do you think we have a secret accent that we never reveal to the outside world how would it sound all the americans think that we speak like this like mary poppins don't they you're from london then are you yep whenever i've been to the u.s and i get in a an uber or something or i'm you know in a bar or a restaurant and speaking to the staff or just random people you're from the uk huh yeah yeah yeah uk so whereabouts in london are you from well you see there's there's more small places in the uk just it's not just london it's not just one giant city someone once thought that i was from australia but i know a lot of uh non-native english people who don't speak english as their first language they often get british and australian confused but i don't i just don't like australian and english the accents are so different to me can i have a bottle of water uh they say that as well yeah well i literally there was once when i was in san francisco it was the first ever event that i went to for battlefield hardline they had like a capture event behind the scenes and i ordered uh a water at the hotel bar i was like could i just get a water please and the um the barman was like what i was like a water he couldn't understand that i was saying water actually happened and then i i said it the american way and then he realized oh you want water two crossbows i'm taking that jokes are bad is that enemy i can hear over there i haven't been to this area have i i think there's an enemy there oh no no no i'm gonna be killed for those there give us a bit of intel if they come over oh no sliding [Music] oh i'm sorry i thought that was an enemy healing i'm an idiot i've just screwed it for everyone i'm a fool everyone can see me now on the whole map it's like a wall hack [Music] i yeah i accidentally shot that dude i thought it was a bad guy healing alas it was not it was a humble npc living the dream in the construction site at 3am when there's a load of vampires out having a bar royale what was he thinking what was he even doing there that's not my fault that's not that's not my fault so this guy i think these guys can revive me if they get to uh revive it can i see the map i can't view the map around you can do parkour in this game english speaker always think i say australia when i'm saying austria yeah i mean no they sound pretty close together don't i should have made better life decisions and yeah so should he and he wouldn't be dead so do these guys know that they can revive me what the odds chat what do you think um can i type hi guys please revive me thank you i've not seen anyone do this yet so it's not really explained okay there's literally i think there's a revive right in front of him guys help wasabi that's it mark the location toggler what the odds guys in chat what do you think that's a res that's a res that's lit i think that's a res is that not a reza [Applause] i don't really know um i would like to be arrived please we'll love you forever your best friend maybe they've got a friend called i mean it's world war three down there don't think i should do that on this stream stuff maybe you know maybe if i you know just play by myself maybe but it's an interesting interesting proposition you know maybe it could have worked my dad works for the game company and he will ban you if you don't revive me right now i don't think they would have bought it to be honest good morning right we'll switch we'll do one more solo no one more solo there we it's go fun guys guys come clap with me [Music] clap until next time nobody ever claps why doesn't anyone clap is there ultrawide support i don't know masha i presume so with it being unreal engine i think it should just natively support that your teammates were mad at you for killing that npc maybe that was it tell them your dad is mr nintendo and he will shut up on their games console computers that would have worked wouldn't it bj that would have worked did i disable super chat no should be there rudolph what is that rudolph's from the hell no voice chat yeah there is voice chat but i turned it off because like i don't know what people are gonna say and when i'm streaming on youtube that's really well when was this release couple days ago zachary uh royally thank you for the five did you ever play 2142 yeah i did loved it titan mode it was brilliant got crazy when you got inside the ship at the end and it was just grenades bomb but it was a really interesting concept for a game mode i love the mechs goliath tank some great maps in 2142 it's not as iconic as uh you know some of the other battlefield games but funny 2142 had its perks rue dolphinum is the center of prague there you go voicer coming in clutch i've never been to prague as you can tell you can probably tell that free to play yeah it's free to play josh hey stealth hey chad good to see you again did i ever play battlefield vietnam yeah i played all the battlefields jonathan vietnam was cool like you airlift vehicles and um there wasn't much like map variety though in vietnam it was a good game the only battlefield game that i didn't really play in multiplayer was the original bad company because that was console only uh but i did go back and play it on piece no sorry on xbox and i did the single player but that was a couple years ago so i never really played the first bad company multiplayer i wish there was more loot on the ground you know a bit more incentive to stay on the ground maybe i'm just not finding it well so oh there is a chest that's in the same place are they always in the same place well i like that i think there's someone around me [Music] oh that was last bullet literally my last bullet there that dude had a shotgun a berry thank you for the two already at full health of course yeah i just minced him yeah it was a bit risky that fight because that dude had a shotgun sniper rifle what's going on there all the vans are your friends yeah that's a good point i don't check the bands enough i'm scared though i'm scared i'm gonna be killed someone fighting around there there might be a chest there oh a greenhouse there's a van there okay what's that pump action shotgun did you get your armor did i oh look at this [Music] the old antique store [Music] if there's any easter eggs in here it looks like the kind of place you'd get an easter egg above me maybe what's up nova watching at 3am from vietnam wow thank you for coming along i'm sure i heard someone above me i like that sound effect that's full asmr vibes that is come here is that michael myers on the wall i don't think they've got that license all right last game i'll try and win this one before i die straight away [Music] oh damn it she saw me i didn't realize there was another npc though i got to get high now because if i don't i'm screwed 40 oh man it's so long as well it's a full minute i feel like that should be shorter i understand that it's an action that you do yourself as a player but maybe you know scale it for solos so it's a bit shorter in solos feels like such a long time whatever i'll just camp up here and chill i'm so dead it's annoying [Music] it is what it is you know it is what it is it's all good a guild thank you for the 10 love the content jack your crack like chapped lips but we're shooting any video games yes interesting andrew thank you for becoming a member can you hear enemy footsteps yeah you can spit fire yeah that was my own fault there because uh i i went to feed on an npc but there was another one there that witnessed me that i didn't see and then everyone in the whole game can see me maybe 30 seconds for solos will be better i don't know anyway guys um i think that is going to be it for tonight thank you very much for tuning in and also a big thanks to shark mob and blood hunt for sponsoring this one pretty cool game i mean mechanically it's very sound very fun i like the sliding and the shooting and obviously the
