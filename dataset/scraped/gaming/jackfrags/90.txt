now when i say to you that this is the most broken thing that has ever been in a battlefield game in the live multiplayer environment i'm telling you the truth this is the spas in bf3 porcelain tdm oh my god with the frag rounds it's a featured mode at the moment and for whatever reason if you're on this side and you pick the spaz with the frag rounds it appears that it's firing 20 explosive one hit kill projectiles at once this is worse than the usa12 with frag rounds from bf3 look at this look at the distance that's a that's a shotgun what this is worse when we had the underslung was it the m26 dart bug on the g3 a3 he's carrying a rocket at me dude come on i got an explosive one hit kill shotgun what are you gonna do i'm only posting this because dice have been quite reactive to broken things in this game so far they've obviously built their technology in a way that they can just remove stuff like this from the game oh man so i fully expected by the time i release this video it's probably gonna have already been removed but as they say make hay while the sun shines so i'm gonna play one round of it and that's all can i kill that guy over there oh there's a sniper you got a sniper don't matter i've got a shotgun i can outsmart the snipers it reminds me of again early days of bf3 is there another sniper though where you could put the slugs on the shotguns and put a sniper scope on them and literally snipe people across the map i think that guy's using it as well maybe come on yeah so this is only on the vf3 spaz 12 like i don't think you can get this in 2042 i don't think any explosive rounds or even in 2042 please correct me if i'm wrong but yeah you can't do this in the main game but seeing as it's a featured mode on portal this is ridiculous all right mate oh he's off to the moon i want to see like what's the longest kill i can get with it so it just it appears to be hit scan there's a bit of splash damage but it looks like if you just directly hit someone with it it's always a one-hit kill no matter what distance no matter how far away you are all right yeah goodbye i'm trying to hit fire with it because there's usually people camping down there there's one yeah hip fire seems to be the same even at distances that works well some more victims here let's not hit fire boy you should be dead no guy yeah you can be so pinpoint accurate with this put that red dot sight on it there's another one there i'll go fishing there with the hit markers i think i've got a little flank here surely not oh my god it must suck to be on the receiving end of this that's gonna blow up as well anyone over there oh hello what are you doing there [Music] even you yes even you they must be like this guy's hacking this guy's cheating for sure little head there sticking up reminds me of playing unreal tournament instagram when i was 12. that was at the feet ah oh you don't even see him oh straight in the head on the left it just deletes people man you kill them with this and it uninstalls their game or something [Applause] yep as i expected oh someone oh there's definitely more people using it now come on dead oh rpg fair play sir the rpg is the only way to counter the broken spaz 12. he tried to jump over it that far away okay i think that's the longest one yet this far away that's the longest one honestly i think this is worse than any gun bug we've ever had in a battlefield game seriously i'm just uh i'm just kind of glad that it's not in oh my god it's not in all that warfare because if this was in all out warfare then the servers would just be ruined today until they are fixing but i really think this will be gone soon let's go on the roof here is that lossy uh lossy i'm so sorry i feel like the terminator right now look at this is this what cheating feels like but the game like aims for you as well i'm going behind these guys try it hit fire here yeah rpg again this dude man resume resume resume revenge yes he got me again yeah maybe this should just like make this into a permanent game mode where everyone has this gun just give it to everyone only this gun low gravity maybe get one of the smaller tdm star maps and yeah we can jump around and murder each other with explosive sparses from way too far away two guys there three oh the triple am i gonna get banned for this i hope not goodbye it's stupid yeah okay so what if right what if they made a game mode that looked like it was going through the air conditioner then you go on the right there hold on let me just reload my explosive spas yeah so what if they oh my goodness what if they make a game mode where it also damages vehicles so it's just a normal round of conquest but everyone has this and there are vehicles and it's just just absolute chaos oh i'll be down for that are they all down here i don't think i can hear them yeah strafing it out oh my god five that was fight no six kills there's more here look it's just a grenade you want to face me let's go 1v1 a 2v1 come on this is a proper dice please moment oh man i know there was a patch recently this must have just slipped in accidentally he's behind the bloody electrical box thing rpg i'm gone he's right there did you sh he just shot the box no one's seen him this guy's gonna raise me i'm gonna shoot him inside there it is there's the revenge there's your back ruined and that's the end of the game there it is that is i'll say it once again that is the most broken thing that's ever been in a battlefield game in a live environment i think like i don't think anything surpasses that in my opinion but fingers crossed it's gone pretty soon i think it will be thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike see you next time bye
