and plenty of kills i think you're gonna like it using the pharah today the meta is shifting so fast in warzone because they keep changing stats all the time but the pharah is absolutely the best gun

i haven't used that in a while [Applause] oh a satellite well i didn't call that in but [Music] i'm going to steal it i'm in that kind of move mate i've got your satellite car i was hoping it would be a loadout but not bad i like that dmr though is he coming up there hello no they just run around coming back don't expect to hop that early in the game it's still going i don't know how long it asks for i feel like it's two minutes or something [Music] how can i get to kill me [Applause] a lot of health though so it should be easy peasy that one i drill you no i drill you how about that i need to find a bit more cash get that load out someone outside did they know i'm here though is that bait what are you doing mate why were you shooting no one else here is there i don't think sir that's right

got out and then got back in and started driving away unforgivable how much money did you have for me and a bit more so we can get more uavs that'll do i could get sulphurs oh hello i swear this pharah it feels like it's got negative recall on it sometimes but it doesn't go up it goes down you have any time request recall flyover you want to be entering the ao did not strike as well where's the slob there he is i'm not going to say it anymore i just like airstrikes okay be advised but you made me self-conscious about it so i'm not going to say it anymore i may have even said it already this game come back john wayne get off your horse and drink some milk i swear to someone here there is there's a man that's not my bounty still there not paying attention it must be in the little dip here then oh what did they hit me with that maybe they were looking at my bounty down here somewhere hey this barry is disgusting come on it should not be allowed that's a daddy there i swear dead silence is just everywhere now yeah i feel like since they reduced the amount of stopping power it's just been replaced by dead silence everywhere it's quite annoying they should just take out the game that sniper was over there somewhere i think [Music] oh there we go oh you know what it feels like it feels like the kilo remember when the kilo was really okay that's what the fire is like now incoming knife again we're gonna make this horrible cross now i hate this part of the map that's why i died here the most if there was a graph what's on this guy right now [Applause] always happens though because there's no cover is there you gotta buy it there shouldn't be anyone else behind me then if they were there not the best position here [Applause] six other players i've got seven spectators i hate that it makes me nervous if i just make this my home now everyone's going to go i mean i had that uav don't think anyone was on it [Music] see the corner of this building isn't up here why would you do that do they like do they even have an angle on me though this is clear i think yeah i can hear him up there i'm good though i don't have to move yet all right so that dude doesn't have ghosts but they've got a good position just waiting to see if they uh i'm gonna peek the roof just put another airstrike down how have they got so many airstrikes what i'm gonna have to break some glass here yeah i just tuck it under the building maybe that's such a good position [Applause] i'm sick of this dude oh someone just got killed i wonder if it was [Applause] nobody's about there i've got no idea where the other two are and there's one what are you doing oh my god i can barely see you okay i'm ruined the gas is on my ass as well where did you go why can't i see this guy what that one uh i died so fast then what the hell was that what gun did they have [Music] i hate cod i know i'm pretty sure it was i was like full health and four players as well well fair enough gg
