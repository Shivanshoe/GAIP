hi everyone hope you're doing well today we are back with call of duty warzone it's been a crazy week with the release of cyberpunk but next week is all about cod warzone is getting a massive update in the form of season one and this is a cross promotion i suppose with black ops cold war as they're getting a load of new maps there too but really it's the war zone stuff that's the most interesting to me because there are some huge changes coming to the game that will have massive implications on the future of it and i'm really excited for the new stuff so with that said a couple days ago activision and cod released a huge blog detailing what's coming next week and we're going to take a look at the most important things in that right now so the biggest news is that of rebirth island and this will be an entirely new battle rail experience within cod warzone and they've done similar alcatraz maps like this before in blackout and mobile but now it's coming to warzone and the description of this is that it's a soviet base that was raided and shut down by the cia in 1968 but then the facility was taken over and rebuilt and recommissioned by this character stitch in 1984 with the purpose of creating and testing the nova 6 gas which is a key part of the black ops cold war story and this area is a lot like a prison there's often references to alcatraz because it does kind of look like a prison island but it's also part chemical bioweapons manufacturing and a testing facility and the entire island has loads of different locations to explore including laboratories barracks decontamination areas and of course the prison block on top of the hill cod said here that you can expect intense close quarters action with a similar playstyle to warzone's mini battle rail mode so it looks like this will be a separate playlist that you queue into so i don't think it's an addition to the existing war zone map like a new island off on the side rather it's its own playlist where perhaps there'll be 75 players instead of 150 and when it launches it will include trios and quads so it's a smaller map but because of that let's hope you get a lot more action and intensity i'm expecting faster rounds and insane kill counts it's going to be good i'm looking forward to dropping in there and checking it out and they also said that in this new map there are 16 challenges for earning calling cards charms emblems blueprints etc and also additional secrets to uncover i'm imagining that's some kind of crazy easter egg that we have to solve and it will probably tie into all the stuff that's been going on in the dansk and there's two new gulags coming to the game too one for the main warzone player list and also one for rebirth so if you're in a normal warzone match instead of going to the normal gulag you'll now be dragged into an interrogation room and strapped to a chair in that little cinematic that they have and then you're thrown into the level it's still a one versus one so all the rules are similar but the arena itself is completely different it's got this secret training facility vibe but the design is almost to be a super mini version of the original nuketown map so the layout's the same but obviously squished down so there are some interiors and backyards which are barricaded off and it focuses all on that 1v1 fight in the confined central area but there's a bus and a truck in there so you've got a bit of cover and plenty of sight lines to try and pick up your opponent it's a different layout to the current gulag and i think this will make for some really interesting 1v1s of course there is a flag too if it gets into overtime first person to capture it will win and the second gulag experience is exclusive to rebirth so if you queue into the rebirth playlist and you end up dying you'll go to the gulag and you're taken below the surface and dragged into a brand new area and in this area they did experiments on inmates that were there so it's a bit creepy it's got a black ops vibe again there's a central chamber and plenty of pathways and routes so you can flank your opponents and hopefully win that 1v1 so that's awesome the next big news though is that there's a new vehicle which is the attack helicopter and this will be on the dansk and rebirth island and it looks like it's similar to the regular transport helicopter but on either side there are belt fed miniguns and you're now going to be able to rain down minigun fire from a helicopter of course you'll be quite vulnerable if you're on the side there and it'll be really noisy but i imagine if you've got a skilled pilot and a couple of decent gunners that can aim you'll be able to do some serious damage with this thing of course you can't repair vehicles in war zones so it won't last forever but if you want to do a quick strike take out a squad and fly out there fast this thing will be awesome i can't wait for the names and the next biggest thing over 30 cold war weapons will go into war zone and this is massive because this will create a huge shift in the matter of war zone so 30 weapons will be added into the game it does say that some of them will have a particular challenge needed to unlock them but the implications here are that the meta will completely change and warzone for me it's been a bit stale for quite a while now just because of the kilo mp5 kilo doofdoof meta so this will be a really welcome change for me and i'm looking forward to experimenting with all these new weapons and seeing how good they are we've got new snipers assault rifles smgs and you can see in the screenshots that they released these are from warzone the new loadouts will be crazy i'm sure there'll be some kind of overpowered combinations and maybe they'll have to patch things see how it goes for me really exciting 30 new guns crazy it's gonna be great along with that we've got new operators which are from cold war coming into war zone 2 and also a new game mode which is launching on the rebirth island that focuses on respawning as the key to victory so you still drop in you loot boxes you gear up as normal hunt down enemy squads and focus on killing everyone else the gulag is closed so if you die you'll be spectating but there's a couple of twists after you kill an enemy you gain a moment of extreme clarity it says on where the rest of that enemy team is located so i imagine you'll either get a ping on your uav which shows where they are for a second or perhaps some kind of momentary wall hack i think with how warzone leans into the realism it'll just be a couple dots on the minimap that's an interesting mechanic and we'll promote aggressive play style but with no gulag how will you respawn well there's a timer called the rebirth countdown i imagine that it resets every now and again but if that reaches zero you will automatically respawn and drop back into the fray so that's a specific game mode called resurgence again sounds like it would be really action-packed can't wait to test that out some unique blueprints coming to blah blah blah and i did see this screenshot too this is a new character on a motorbike and what's interesting here is that on the stuff that was just for black ops they just have the black ops logo but on this one they put the warzone logo too so it might be that we're getting bikes in the base game as well or perhaps in the new rebirth map and of course they'd be a really interesting addition to the game if they're super fast imagine the jumps that you could do the mid-air snipes from the back of a bike could be sick so a massive update it's out on the 16th wednesday i'll be live streaming it for sure probably wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday just because i can't wait to get back into playing warzone again and i'll be covering all the new weapons as well the most interesting new loadouts and attachments all that good stuff so while i don't think this update will change the base map that much maybe there'll be a couple new pois but i do think that at some point in the new year there'll be a huge map change for call of duty because i do feel like the map's getting a bit stale now and you can definitely feel that sentiment in the community from social media reddit posts all that stuff so a big map change and overhaul is definitely welcomed at this point but i do think that the addition of all those new weapons vehicles that's going to ignite the fire again and warzone will be incredibly popular leading up to the new year but with that said thank you for
