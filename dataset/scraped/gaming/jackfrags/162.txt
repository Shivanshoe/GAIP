i'm going to see if i can trick tom and connor here i don't even know if they know about this thing so here we go there's guys right here this guy's right here i'm not kidding over there north west he's chucking dynamite that's what that is i think that's blown up there's three looking at me let's fight them let's not let's not extract i'm seeing i'm going on a deep flank is he in the bush you seen something it's a decoy dude do you oh my god jack he got it he got us totally and oh my god he got us good all right let's fight them then i've never been had so good in my life legit the last thing i expected was that to be fake oh my god fully juved so i won't do that again that was a good one i'm just glad we all got outside you know yeah we knew we didn't we nearly died if i seen one of you in the bushes i was in bang you did i was looking around it's like that sounds awfully close he's gotta be in the bush shooting and then i see these little sparks coming from the ground it's like how can we possibly walk past that guy hunt showdown i've been playing it a bit more again recently i think it's excellent and still one of the most underrated shooters out there i like to take breaks from it though i have hundreds of hours on it and i can go for months without feeling like there's any new content for it but then when i jump back in i just get sucked into it again on so many levels even if not much has changed apart from a couple new guns perks and gear changes what draws me back and keeps me hooked is the gameplay and the atmosphere there's nothing else like it on the market and considering it's been out for almost four years that's impressive there are some similar games out there but i think it's a testament to the developers that they've stuck with their core gameplay philosophies and expanded upon them it's still a tactical extraction pvp game at its core with permadeath where any bullet to the head can kill you in one shot you could lose your favorite character as quickly as that but it's still disguised behind this awesome late 19th century setting with monsters and a variety of ai that actually impact the game and you have to worry about them and deal with them as well as other players admittedly i'd love if new content released more regularly for it i'd personally like to see a new map with a new biome and a different ai set but i've heard through forums online that the dev team for this project at crytek is quite small and of course kryzek will have other new games to work on too please release ryerson of rome 2 already but ultimately the playerbase is solid for hunt with 30 000 people playing it each day on steam alone it is also on console too but i don't know how it plays on those platforms or how popular it is there regardless if you haven't picked it up yet it is regularly on sale on steam at the moment it's 50 off and if you pick it up just know that the learning curve is steep it's not the most accessible game but when you start to understand the world you learn the maps and the mechanics one day it will all just click and you'll have some of the most intense pvp fights that you can have on the market with that said today i wanted to show you guys some recent highlights that i've been collecting and a bit of chit chat on the way too i hope you guys like this if you do leave a like and a comment below thank you for watching sit back relax and enjoy wait aren't we being surrounded right now not in that building though i'm gonna die here's to the back just outside with the wind fields you can get me up i think he's on the corner here adam nice i'll come get you something quick revive the lovely born and shut that jack that's your it's your bread and butter that ball in a minute it just works this one kind of like here i heard just like more yeah 75 do you want to stay in here for now or should we be [Music] stay back where is he's on in this building is that how is he not down man can we just rush him is it one that's perfect tom he's dead i was talking here on the roof yeah don't see the guy on the roof but he was peeking the route he was like just peeking it on me there's a guy firing me now what both on me both with me coming coming whereabouts outside basically one's outside they're underneath this yeah underneath that yeah [Music] oh yeah the other guy's falling back he's sniping from far away i think that was shot at me then the drop down haven't got eyes on the sniper nearly hit me oh one down inside here nice job i played oh that was close should we do this he's weak to shotgun as me so i'm working him down yeah i've got it oh so it's still there i've attacked him twice with a spark so i've deleted some of his regen it's absolutely mad lad he leaves these little fire balls around now yeah it's annoying it's good though it makes it more difficult it's nearly that this fast is always a bit of a cakewalk wasn't ever not anymore i'm being shy in that window now lovely that's lovely guys oh god nice shot don't watch those windows they're just watching all three they get slammed down dude yeah i couldn't see him there's slap peeking like somewhere into the windows so you can't see him i'm watching the door i mean i can throw a dynamite in see if he comes out he's in there tagged him he dropped down then he must have dropped down [Music] he's dropped down right has anyone got dark side left nope on me dead this guy's a real problem man what if they do hunt showdown 2186 like future hunt showdown that'd be sick i'd love that yeah like you hunt down aliens same you know same mechanic so it's pretty hardcore and everything but you're in the future there's totally different uh problems the guns would all have to be somehow western future eye future westernized guns instead of bullets you don't want like rifles yeah if they were to make a sequel to this they probably would have to change the setting well what if it was like energy weapons where you fire it and they have to go like in um yeah like minority yeah that'd be cool do you want it to keep like nods to show showdown but things like that like nano beads also you could just literally like keep the western like feel but just future western yeah yeah like color like neo tokyo they added a perk this patch where if you're poisoned and then someone's got poison sense they can see you in dark side like you would you know that the dark side bouncy and poison answer is the only way to actually instantly get rid of poison otherwise you just have to wait so you can tag someone with poison and use dark side if you've got that part yeah yeah people have taken the poison bombs and the hive bombs the ones that throw the bees because if they tag get attacked with it you can just use dark side and trap them from it unless they've got an antidote oh there's another group now coming from the northwest so it's everyone it's literally everyone look at your dark side i mean come on yeah three on that side oh my god i mean we just stay in here and just let them kill each other it's fine is he behind the hay oh that fires yeah there we go there was the dead guy right now surely that's got him are we gonna go we'd stay in here are we we can't do anything jack we're surrounded like a young french dog well he's a frenchist of dogs i've got my feet this is dangerous yeah it's just been revived i've got dynamite get ready get ready to pee dynamite damn one yeah he's behind the big tree i think there's just one yeah one guy left just one guy left shotgun behind the big tree i'm outside now guys oh my aims mad i've hit him twice three times now i'm gonna push him follow him nice job do a scan as soon as you get a dark side nothing so clear why is everyone playing as this lulu lady this is the new new skin is it worth me pushing up with the grass or yeah let's go let's push i tagged one here one other one on the road one behind the rock here i'm just going to stealth it through the grass no i pushed right up i'm gonna get in okay i'm down reloading i don't see anyone next to me now there was definitely two here there was a ronin start like a japanese guy okay okay what about dark side you can get dark side back off the bodies where is he here somewhere tom yeah well that was pretty successful double bounty a good day of hunting for sure dynamite what ow i'm good watch out
