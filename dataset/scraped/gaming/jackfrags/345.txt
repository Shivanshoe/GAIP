i don't often fly in bf games a lot of can there's always been people who are a lot better at it than i am though this thing's a monster hey we got it epic prince goodbye oh do you just love the aesthetic on this game it's brilliant i'll try and get that a there whoa that was close we got another strafing run down here oh they popped abs i think he's off i forgot inventory on the ground there with rockets that things done for i think oh no there's a jet in the sky now oh no no right i've got competition now but i could try and help this get here i think that guy's a good pilot turning much quicker than me although oh we got him nice i didn't expect to win that i have to be honest with you guys any more vehicles oh the artillery piece get it yeah this is going way better than i expected it to we managed to get full kills so far when's top gun two out by the way look at this cockpit it's nice oh man go on the top here yes oh that was close man this is so much fun i haven't done this in ages to be fair though i'm not getting harassed by the enemy jets really all the anti-air which is quite rare really and this might be one of my only ever gameplay introductions on youtube go for this boat yeah boom i do use space as well to pitch up by the way that's the classic for battlefield games if you're playing on keyboard or mouse just hold spacebar and i don't i mean there's people who are like a thousand times better than me in jets but i don't know the correct turning speeds and all that stuff you know like there's a way that you can do it so you go a certain speed you see those dials there i think it was 300 for the perfect turning speed i never mastered it i don't know what it is aps right now go away for that aps and then go okay that's an aaa firing at me i think jack that was perfect time wasn't it i opened the chat jack frags are you the real jackfruit well you'll never know yeah we'll go for this boat boom got it that's a squad wipe too nice if you enjoyed the video guys hit that like button thank you 14 damage i might get locked on yeah i'm now take a hit here unless i can out turn it up nope fair play epic prince from on top of the hotel puts an end to the kill streak well that was a bit of an explosive start to the game there wasn't it both sides of the hotel have already been destroyed too oh come on come on come on yes oh the s rule man this thing is amazing i can't believe they've not put something like this in war zone yet by the way i just don't believe it laser guided rocket just a bit low isn't it quite difficult to use really because the the timing of it and it's difficult to see exactly how far away the rocket is the depth perception on it isn't great hey i've got the acwr i've got a suppressor on it suppressing this game is great for keeping you off the minimap but it does actually know if you damage a bit of range come on come on come on oh he just dodged it dude no way it's a sniper about somewhere am i i've got a sharp knife let me tell you swear there was a sniper here there now you've seen me yes i told you i had a shot knife let's get rid of this spawn vegan ow full damage in this game is not the one uh dice why did that rock again nice where did that rocket go that's two rockets sort of just disappeared spot bonus cool should have been my kill sick of that there's there's another round you think if i don't move as long as my squad don't spawn on me no no no don't don't move is it still there i think we actually killed it well it turns out my squad spawning on me there was a good idea as they say teamwork make a dream work i'm gonna wax that for i'm gonna wax you should i be saying that probably not yes this gun dude brilliant love it they cut this back quick but we're gonna get it back here i reckon with that tap fire all that tap fire this game is squad just spawned on him i just don't have the accuracy though because that suppressor i'll rely on my snipers nice good job lads mobility hits you serious uh hello oh my god there's so many people there yes i was getting crazy in here i mean the mini map is really difficult to read on this game actually when there's so much going on at one time oh yeah they can get up there can't they now the building's been destroyed they've got all these different rat roots in interesting although i can use them as well right i could go under here is that grenade what is that smoke oh my god i can't see anything nice cool they're coming in here come on oh i missed it too many there too many there i won reload oh man i'm screwed i'm absolutely screwed right now there'll be someone there too a grenade in me oh nice grenade well played well that was a spawn and a half that was lucky i think they just walked up on a boat or something there's one more over here sometimes the game spawns you and you get instantly ruined sometimes it spawns you and it bestows the gift upon you they're pushing this point hard this is going to be fun i can actually get under this thing because i spotted then surely i was spotted watch your back watch your back oh no i couldn't save him oh i wanted that just flew behind the ship though oh hello yes always always always remember the right height for that kind of thing like riding a bike you're dead are you sure you're dead hold on any more here no did we clear him out then no way oh heavy suppression heavy suppression what the hell was that chill here for a sec reload that's more i was nearly toast then this guy with the right shield are we going up are we doing this let's go oh man i think they're just camping up here aren't they gotta be okay okay okay it's clear i didn't expect it to be but it is uh grenade where's that come from i don't know but i want my sniper back oh they're up there that was ambitious wasn't it so was that rocket from that dude oh you have to unscope how far away is that 300 i'm gonna zero lead a little bit perfect absolutely perfect that was did the other guy hide behind that i think he did oh are they up oh man you want some goodbye get out of here i think that guy is still hiding behind the rock there maybe yes oh damn it 300 meters again a little bit to the right because it's moving difficult to hit oh helicopter again is that the same guy oh man look at the map all right we're safe lads four corners they're gonna be waiting for us down here are they oh god oh god oh god it's fine it's fine oh we're going back up okay okay can we get some heels elevator party let's go oh man there's rumbling i don't like this insane absolutely insane what is going on i should not have done this maybe i should right now we're dead please let me let me equip it nice yes got him again sniper somewhere ah almost one suppression grenade die hit this guy like four times i'm coming for you sniper are you dead someone killed him okay guys we have a bit of cover inside the building i don't believe it it's the only breather of the entire match well it's been a great game i know results are fun still more people over here somewhere i feel like there is there's a spawn beacon anywhere one of those little things yeah this game's just just fun isn't it just pure fun good game i think we're gonna get the win as well dude here isn't that you're dead son yeah you're dead well gg well played guys thank you for watching oh that would have been perfect
