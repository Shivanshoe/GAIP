they've added a red card gesture and an england football kit to call of duty warzone this is perfect timing and i'm gonna play as a referee dishing out reds see if i can win a game i hope you enjoyed this video guys if you do hit that like button below let's get it so england are playing germany in the european cup today and i think this game will determine who's going to win that match in real life i'm pretty sure that's how it works two players over here having a scrap that's against the rules right here mate that's an easy red you just killed someone over there didn't you that's not we're not allowed to do that on the football pitch and being a football referee is pretty tough oh someone here [Music] it's a central attacking midfielder clearly offside get out you're off side bait you're offside oh illegal use of a parachute on the pitch [Music] just gonna check the replay yeah that's definitely the same guy no you use the parachute again sorry mate you're done no red card for you parachutes are not allowed on the football pitch the players are now using recon equipment to attempt to locate each other pretty sure that's illegal oh no that guy doesn't have a license yeah i've seen him before no license incredibly dangerous and irresponsible you can't be doing that i mean cars on the pitch it's definitely worse than parachutes on the pitch so that's a straight straight red from me there was a guy that got that loadout over there that's all above board nothing wrong with that oh god i'm gone illegal use of a ladder you're done didn't wear safety equipment as you can see there's a very dangerous ladder here and i'm just going to double check yeah no safety equipment no harness no helmet red card mate get out now this is storage town i've sent off many players at this part of the pitch before looks like we've got a new one here up to no good oh it's a rose skin as well okay so as you can see these type of players they'll foul other players and you try and send them off and they just don't cooperate so i'm gonna back off a bit and sometimes just got to be patient as a ref enemy uav over here waiting for the perfect time there's delay though just going to check the ar it's definitely wrong skin here we go mate illegal use of a rose skin you don't even have the license red card throughout the game back to the change room disgraceful behavior other people have to play the game as well you know hey hey hey hey intimidating the rest that's not on that's illegal got people driving without licenses got illegal bounty hunters this has to be one of the most foul-mouthed rude players i've ever come across on the pitch and they're shooting at the other team this is unbelievable no no no continued abuse of the ref this dude doesn't have a license either like this is what kind of a match is this no one's playing by the rules i'm in trouble i don't know why there's a bike on the football pitch but i need it right now oh god that's the wall sometimes you know the referee has to pick up the no my god there's still home to me sometimes the referee has to use the bike deal with these uh rowdy players this is the illegal bounty hunter i need to put a stop to him no unbelievable red card easy red that's the easiest way i've ever given hunting the ref down for multiple minutes you put an airstrike on me you shot me in the back you should be banned from the game you know cars on the pitch are one thing but trucks big dangerous vehicles take it out unacceptable so i can wait for the shot you know what referees do have some tricks up their spaces every night again hey oh a double kill we'll get one down you know we've got the the baby monitor we've got var precision air strikes from time to time red card he was the guy driving the truck just unbelievable especially at this time of year as well you know in this type of weather gas everywhere doesn't respect the other players or the fans at all shocking baby really well the zone has treated me quite well here because i can stay up on the high ground there's no one behind me i reckon there's someone in that building i haven't seen any aggressive players in the last couple of minutes no one's trying to foul me or foul each other i think we're looking good right now calmed everyone down got the players to start respecting each other a bit they're not going in with two feet anymore you know hang on [Applause] now intimidating the ref you're coming up behind me and you've disconnected from the game red card oh you know i'm going to give a double red card is that even a thing it is now gas is inbound no ref's got to go down there just going to check the left hand side see if there's any deviants over here oh there is okay you got a right chill player come to think of it i recognize this guy from the last match i did give him a yellow warning you know using that rod shield got him yeah mate that yellow you should have thought about your actions red you're off i don't want to see that right shield again if you come back to one of my matches and you've got that right shield i'm just going to send you a straight away mate i'm not having it now i've sent that many players off that there's only two left on the pitch apart from me so the fans aren't very happy with this one it's it's not going to be a great game it's nil nil no one scored i reckon both people could be in that house because i'm located one on the top one on the bottom maybe the ref's got to do while rescue i do you know i've got to keep the game fair the rules are there for a reason and they're not to be broken i'm gone oh handball yeah definite handball there we saw it oh well i forgot to get the red red card relocation throw the whistle again bad referee in there oh he's broken glass misuse of public property he's coughing ill on the pitch this guy yeah gotta send him no red card for you mate unacceptable behavior get out well nobody won the players were just too dirty they couldn't stop fighting each other scrapping on the pitch mess with the ref you get a red hi guys hope you enjoyed that really good laugh that was for me don't really enjoy playing that much i can only
