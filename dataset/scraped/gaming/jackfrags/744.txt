hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're taking an updated look at warface it's a game that I've covered a few times on the channel before but recently it's seen an increase in player numbers and popularity they've even just finished off an eSports tournament with a prize pool of 86 thousand dollars first up a big thanks to Warface for sponsoring this video and if you're interested in checking out the game for yourself there's a link to play it for free in the description below now Warface isn't a new game in fact by today's standards it's been out a long time originally released on PC in October 2013 and in 2018 and never tably it released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one after all there is a huge player base there who are deeply invested in multiplayer first-person shooters first of all with two dish year though 2020 and warface believe it or not is now available on the Nintendo switch in fact the developers believe that warface could do really well on the switch because of the overall lack of online shooters on that platform at the moment and the switch version includes all of the PvE missions as well as 5 PvP modes three story centric Special Operations and all of the content from the latest update called Titan more on that in a minute so last year black wood games took over the development of Warface formed from the original developers that worked on the game at Crytek Kiev now there will be plenty of people that aren't that familiar with this game so let's just touch on exactly what it is the first thing to know and arguably the most important to a lot of people is that this game is free-to-play and at its core Warface is a first-person tactical shooter and its content is split across story based co-op missions against AI and multiplayer PvP modes against other real players it also supposedly had over 80 million registered players across all platforms so it's fair to say that the game isn't doing that bad for itself war face is a class-based shooter and currently there are 5 classes in the game with one of them being brand new you've got the rifleman medic engineer sniper and then sed all of these classes had their own benefits as well as different abilities and primary weapons rifleman has either an assault rifle or a machine gun for their main firepower and their special ability allows them to restore ammo to either themselves or teammates medic on the other hand well it's quite self-explanatory medics can restore health and revive teammates or utilising shotguns as their primary weapons engineers while they have access to submachine guns and while medics can offer up health benefits for teammates Engineers of replacement armor as well as the ability to deploy mines they can also plant and defuse bombs 50% faster and can revive fallen sed teammates now the sed class is essentially a giant Terminator class and as such a medic class wouldn't be all that useful for reviving but the engineer would it kind of makes sense and the sniper of course well you get all the big juicy sniper rifles and you can deploy anti-personnel mines but it's the sed class that's the new addition in the game and we're going to take a look at that now SC d stands for synthetically engineered double and this is essentially a tank class you come equipped with a heavy machine gun that's got no reload and unlimited ammo but it does overheat if you fire for too long the interesting thing about this class though is the difference in health and armor compared to the others all of the other classes in the game have 110 armor points and 125 health points the sed on the other hand only has 30 health but a whopping 300 armor this means that they can absorb a ton more damage but when their arm is gone they are incredibly vulnerable so team plays important not only that book because melee attacks ignore armor altogether if an enemy player gets in range you're definitely at a disadvantage sprinting speed is also reduced for this class compared to the others you can sprint for slightly longer the other benefit of the sed though is that he can perform double co-op climbs on his own and what this means is that in Warface there are certain vaults that can be done with a teammate so you can get to higher to reach places but the sed has the benefit of not needing anyone he's a one-man army so to speak and can just do it himself taking a look at the PvE I think it's got a lot going for it and interestingly there is a bit of a difference in player preference across platforms PC players prefer to play PC P in fact roughly 60% whereas on console it's the other way around and most players prefer the PvE aspect of the game PvE includes co-op based missions that you can play with friends or filled with players that you find by a matchmaking you can play one of six co-op missions arranged based on their difficulty going from easy which to be fair is meant to be a practice I think to ease you in and then you go into normal ardent and on insane which will challenge even the most seasoned players when you start to play hard mode the game will tell you that you will absolutely need a medic and using basic gear probably won't be good enough and I mean same difficulty yeah you're going to have to play the game a little bit and got some of the better weapons and equipment before you tackle that to make it even harder though friendly fire is turned on so watch out for those happy accidents but if you want the hardest and longest missions that war face has to offer then Special Operations is where you'd want to head and these missions lasts a lot longer than co-op and are definitely a lot harder to complete they're a big challenge what's cool about these spec ops missions though is that they tend to be in vastly different environments from the multiplayer as you can see I'm currently on Mars having a whale of a time and you can even go back to Pripyat to and relive some old iconic gaming memories there are some story elements woven in here too you get some narration on the way which kind of begins to explain the Warface law and also some cinematics too every now and again when it comes to PvP there's a few different options including TDM plant the bomb free-for-all destruction most of the multiplayer modes are ones that you'll definitely be familiar with though if you've played most of the modern FPS games just with slightly different names now when you go into either co-op special operations or multiplayer I think it's important to remember that the classes aren't just there for the sake of it they make a big difference in both PvE and PvP when you're playing PvE on the harder difficulties you're going to really struggle if you want playing as a team and that's where the class system comes in you know you've got to have a good blend of damage dealers using the new SCV class but also medics to be able to heal teammates around you when you're playing PvP the medic is also extreme powerful especially in round based game modes where one death can completely change the dynamic of the game so recently as well as Warface being released on the Nintendo switch there's a new update called the Titan update and this brings with it new weapons a new weapons rarity system brand new cosmetics and of course the sed class which we've talked about one of the new weapons that you can expect to see in the game though is the classic sv-98 sniper rifle as well as that there are changes to the slide speed secondary gear slot tweaks and a few small changes to weapon bumps across the board now wrapping things up I mentioned this earlier but Warface is a free-to-play game and as such lots of the items in the game require you to purchase them either with in-game currency that you can earn or with real money I think that's the nature of a free-to-play game that's not going to be everyone's cup of tea in my time playing the game though I can't say I noticed too many issues I definitely had some fun with the sed class and the rifleman mostly and despite my bad consult aim yes I was playing this whole video on PlayStation 4 it felt pretty sharp and I think if you like games like Call of Duty that you can definitely have some fun with the pvp aspect of Warface it's a good thing here though is that there is a different experience here depending on what you want from your game now the developers have said that they're also considering cross play in the future meaning it's possible that PlayStation on xbox could one day be playing against and with each other which definitely seems to be an upcoming and normal thing the games these days or at least something the developers are aiming for I think something like that is a huge plus for free-to-play games just being able to merge its player base across different platforms is pretty huge and that's all for today guys I hope you enjoyed this one warface I think is an interesting game I would argue that it's not that hugely well-known in like a YouTube or twitch Facebook it's got a very healthy player base so clearly more players are aware of it than you might think there's something for everyone from PvE missions EVP modes and a battle royale maybe it's something that you would consider giving a girl a big thanks to them once again for sponsoring this video and if you want to check it out for yourself
