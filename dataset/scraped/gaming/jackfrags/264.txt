reactions playing with study westy and the tactical brit really looking forward to this one apparently it's some kind of pve event based on an armored train so that's where we're at that's what we're

stream or if you watch it as a von hit that like button thank you great way to help support me i mean there's a there's a lot of people in the chat already you guys have uh deployed shortly really coming close for this one double xp double weapon xp and double battle pass xp would you look at that would you look at that and my sensitivity is a bit too high so we're gonna play one match i think that should take us up to half pass unless we uh just get ruined by hackers and have to queue again but apparently the hackers are having a bit of a hard time and we'll see how it goes oh called our haiko sakeeb foxy mac frags sarah g-man ryan jay taylor i mean i can't keep up with the chat guys oh my goodness is popping off right now hey an eskimo zen edgar dragon wow you guys have gone absolutely crazy in here it's always slow mode on as well where's my game just stuck on gearing up i don't know what that what's that about the events live in half an hour there because hitler helped franco in the spanish civil war but then franco was like nah can't be bothered not about that noise that was an interesting thing to a mute too yeah sorry definitely going to be demonetized jack you're in spain without the p oh cool this is going to be great are we really going to drop there yes but everyone's going to be there why don't we just try and win one month there's 80 people there's only two people in there but they're already inside and we already did i mean i'm at the train and it's stuck oh my god it's on fire wow honestly have you got a gun like it could you protect me um i did you can take it man [Applause] just like just like stalingrad yeah this is roleplay then i hear them i hear they made them my characters russian as well jack there were two like jack your name tag quick guys quick flat way i don't know where the is there another one did you kill him your name tag covered one of the enemies i was probably better off just not picking everywhere going down place here so does the recon just form there over and over and over and over and over again i believe it does i don't does jackie weaver have any authority here though i don't know i don't think she does honestly i don't know what she was up to in world war ii jackie weaver yeah maybe a small child well you know you have no authority here parish council does look you know in its 99s well at least we've done the training illegally illegally right let's go babylon i actually hate this ground loot em too like it's the most hated thing ever in warzone for me what why is the abs so slow i don't know i think because the iron sight elevators that'd be the worst challenge wouldn't it trying to win a game with the ground loot em too solo match oh 20 round mag that's all you get the grey one the grey one fun historical backline to win again trying to have fun still isn't it why is it prototype lucky or whatever yeah it's a prototype for what is now the la 5a2 i mean it doesn't really look much like the la-5a2 it actually does when you leave the two side by side there it was a rifle designed for if the cold war went hot and britain had to get involved but then we joined nato and then we moved to nato standard guns so basically we said listen they're russian lads we can be friends no i don't want any of that smoke said in the fact yeah that's what church that's what churchill said to starlight he said boss man you don't want none of this um we're from london mate he said he said he won beach south london uh well there's fighting at factory but there's no buy so superstore if you need equipment oh we can we can buy now can't we just need to go to one buy now yeah invest in stoddium today do you guys reckon the vanguard trailer is gonna play or something and then it's gonna be like pre-order now we all get dmca don't think that's gonna happen front page of the screen pre-order now pre-order now pre-order now please pre-order please please please just like how they shoved cold war down our throats so you have to buy our game i'll collect if there's plunder i may i may just send it in the new card yeah flanders why do you care about the worst game mode ever released yeah i mean it's good for the casual players i think like leveling up their guns and free to play players i think payload or the other modes are way better but i i would what do you want ego i would rather play plunder yeah than start coldwater.exe okay i would rather my hands then [Music] [Laughter] let's get on with it when i think about playing call of duty cold war i think i'd rather be in the trenches triple threat i'm running away guys bye for watching oh you come back this way i don't know where we're going did you get anything on heartbeat cam i didn't even bother as soon as the

it there's rocks in the car is there oh there was we're making it across making my way now to the atc to the dog now remember what happened the last time we all went up the zip line at the same time there's a guy with an mp5 at that we literally we're literally just going to camp up here for nine minutes and quit the game yeah yeah okay welcome to how we play the game all right how many snipes can you get in ten minutes do you think i could show um your like the bad faction in world war two the red card advertiser friendly guidelines get downstairs boys we're gonna die imagine if it came

amp pistol it's my pistol chest is he still on the roof this time on the other side yeah there's still three of them on the roof somewhere no they just hide they're just thrown behind their clothes i was being sniped from behind my time has come no no i'll be there wait wait first step underneath maybe yeah right now people yeah it might be on the road i think they can get here by the way if they they parachute right but we hear them it is possible to parachute inside i love that sniper emma i'll be back i'll be back can i drop 10 no i was wondering cameron it's you you're old model oh [Music] [Music] thank you when you hear that sick quick scope with the lee enfield he's one he's where did that guy go he's a dog oh he's uh he's perfect i mean this isn't gonna die well for this guy it has not gone well there's an airstrike coming in i'm all dead oh close the strike lucky lucky no come back oh there's a lot of people on heartbeat right now yeah let's do on the roof but i think they move because that cluster probably scared them away guys my time has come why are you going down there you're my absolute madman by the way there's still a guy above it there's still a guy above us on the roof i want him to think it's safe let us know if he's coming out he's thinking about it i think his mates are on the roof above us oh yeah we're all gonna die when we jump off this we're all gonna die but we don't have to well we could just quit the game in five minutes [Applause] a whole team below you yeah listen there's people they're gonna go for those loadouts and we can snipe them i think you should all attempt to 360 before the next four minutes one on the hill down broke that guy on the red mark bounds one click i've got one shot left okay jack your time has come no go down the zipline it's a gratifying form of self-sacrifice i mean they're in here honestly don't do it there's one in that window listen we've nearly got to quit the game anyway so wait i'll wait until the gas is hitting me and i'm in mid-air and then i'll be like well would you look at the time a hundred gifted subs if you hear 360 jump out here no okay i'll save my last bullet and i'll do a 360 and then hit the floor 100 gifted you know how much money that is sniper looking at us from the heli what do you see jack it's 100 gifted i mean to be honest you know if i hit a 360 off the tower then it's 100 gifted subs from uzbekistan are you going to vpn no that's me out of ammo it's gone 360. how can i hear 360 with no ammo do you think there'll be the lift now i feel like they might do a spin and then
