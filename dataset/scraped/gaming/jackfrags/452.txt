you want you you can do so you you do you could you you want you want to do you so much you could do anything yeah today two warzone matches for you a max mp5 the loadout i'm using at the moment working out really great for me that a max really packs a punch at medium to long ranges and up close mp5 still shreds i might do a more in-depth look at the amax in a future video though because it is just very strong in the current meta both action-packed games in the first game i learned about sea shanties and in the second match we got one of the rarest drops in the game an actual juggernaut event drop which i've personally never seen and i haven't used the juggernaut for ages fun to go back and jump into the suit though i think you'll enjoy this as always thank you to all these lovely
