finally released now free to play and a big thanks to them for sponsoring this video today we're jumping into a match with acolyte and tommo it was one of our first games on and we had a blast with it the cut to the chase this is a battle royale game set in the city of prague and you play as vampires with different classes and abilities you can also level up specific attributes in game by performing certain actions like munching down on civilians lovely juggly the gunplayer movement requires some skill and finesse though and it's very fast paced they will soon be adding a ranked mode too where you can spend rp to enter and rank up with specific rewards and there's a new blood hunt mode soon catered to new players featuring comeback and respawn mechanics with that said link in the
