apex is on a bit of a wave right now they just launched a new season with a meta-changing legend and a new gun that actually slaps i haven't played it much recently apart from when the new lane focused arena's map came out about a month ago and had a great time with it however over the last week it has boomed in play account and the number of people watching and streaming it on youtube and twitch from what i've seen online a lot of this has come about because of burnout with warzone and the amount of cheaters that people are experiencing there and so fans of battle royale games are looking for alternatives right now and apex is an excellent one so myself and tommy decided to check it out again jump back in and play some ranked matches it's always an interesting game at the start of a new season as the ranks get reset slightly and everyone is thrown in together attempting to grind those ranked points and we had a lot of fun here it is a baptism of fire though if i have to be honest with you and i've got to get used to the aiming efficient looting shield swapping and movement again in apex there's a lot of nuance here firefights last significantly longer than warzone you've got a longer ttk healing takes ages and there's always the third party ready to jump on you there's a bunch to think about and with that said i've got highlights of three matches for you here and i'm sure that we're gonna do lots more as well i'd really like your support on this one guys thank you for watching and i hope you enjoy it if you do hit that like button it's a great way to support me leave a comment down below and pray to the youtube algorithm gods sit back relax let's get it have you nearly got your tongue i would see at ninety percent yeah whack that down straight
