of nuts i'm gonna get another loadout okay oh they've got ready the confirmation yeah okay be careful because there is a team coming down nice one you can't ping it anymore no they've changed that as well you're not allowed to you can't live ping it and every time you get kills is the most wanted if you're marked as most wanted you can um if you get a kill it knocks 20 seconds off the timer if you open a crate it knocks five seconds off the timer [Applause] so you can basically get most wanted in a completely unlooted area run round do loads of crates and then just be like those guys get broken i broke the most haunted that's hci is like the intervention of modern warfare 2. it kind of is it's a classic i think they'll bring that back in the intervention oh yeah yeah oh for sure dude yeah

it's that latest gators lighter skater in a wild cracker dial there's um some graffiti on the cave here of kong and godzilla having a fight you said that no kong is flying through the air about to smash godzilla in the face do you think it's representative of what might happen during anything there might be a kong vs godzilla event in the game and i have the proof omar i think you're a compulsive liar you made a video and you made a warzone video called the end and since then you've made warzone videos so i did yeah but what i meant was the end of the year but you should have said that it was my idea though i was like so finally we're here it's the end of 2021 no but then how are people gonna know that if you don't put that in the title ah it's called clickbait westy right okay as long as you're as long as you know what oh so you admit to clickbait you know what you're engaging in for that one video here's a hearsay [Applause] hey say your honor but it's your question [Applause] oh god yeah i forgot that was a uh one hit one three one hit one oh hello from downtown did they even have one hit i don't know it might have been him broken you're gonna do them quite tom

come up yeah look they're right above us [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's like i think he might be trying to get up here by the way so they're going to try and get height on us before the circle collapses hey guys two one two on the left on green one nice you just plastered me [Applause] [Applause] and one further down on the hill he's going back on the road behind the rock here i've been beamed on the left brother jack can't see him throwing thermites [Applause] guy in front of me i can't get around the tree i'm dead i'm dead where's the other team [Applause] they're further down the

team will be down below you i don't think they're going to be above you [Applause] oh my god he headshotted him whilst he was falling into the where though dead sounds sick great game pod game hi guys so i'd had a little bit at the end here thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed those highlights some of my first matches of season three i didn't get a chance to play yesterday as i was out most of the day but i hopped on for some earlier and it was good laugh i like the map lighting changes in particular there's no excessive bloom anymore making visibility better there's some new pois as well new ar is kind of okay but it is may 11th for the new godzilla kong event so that's going to be like the big draw for people i think the sniper changes though that's going to have the biggest impact especially on caldera and so that means that the hdr the ax50 zrg they're back they're now going to be the long-range snipers of choice with the nerfs to some of the others so i'll be using the hdr again going forward for those modern warfare vibes and speaking of modern warfare call of duty just officially announced modern warfare 2 with a teaser very nostalgic loving that logo as always i
