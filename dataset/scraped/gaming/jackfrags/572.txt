kill confirmed have you ever smoked a cigarette stod did when i was a kid did you die are you were you okay um did you die no i didn't that's good have you tried him chris i have not i've never smoked maybe nauseous yet nauseous what kind of a cigarette was it tobacco in general just makes me nauseous yeah like when you were younger and used to go to house parties and the smell of smoke was just everywhere yeah and then your girlfriend done shoe and you have to walk home by yourself in the rain i'm glad that that's just bringing up the memories i just made it i just made it i i actually got dumped because i went to a house party and i got really drunk and i put bread over my eyes and put holes through it and when when when she when she gave me bread to sober up oh that's brilliant stud i mean okay i mean you just wanted to break up with it didn't you you thought that's a good strat this will work no no she broke up with me because because she said she was embarrassed by me which is fair enough yeah but it's not you you're just having a meme aren't you trying to make people laugh exactly bean the bread guy she she passed me a piece of bread and said you need to eat this because need to sober up and i turned around and put it over my face and went pogba i did the same thing except for it included a whole lot of projectile vomiting oh then she married me so you know there you go there you go oh do you like the vomit people are sniping their orange headshots oh here come here what he is not down there we go i was gonna say were you riley reeds in every game something about it could be both you all make me nervous gotta explain things to the internet when you start talking about that i had a guy uh who was playing with me the other day who got a texture glitch that had like no walls oh that's not i'm not that level yet nice and you can just beam straight through the walls or nope he was just like running into buildings and running into walls and running into cars and it was awful it's the art i know with both dragon's breath and dismemberment rounds so they will blow apart and catch on fire what is the meme with that dragon's breath is it broken or is it just good i'll tell you what's annoying about it jack when you get hit by it your screen just turns into the sun right so that's why people are using it i think so yeah it's just disorientating as well it has a dot on it right with the fire effects it does it does 32 damage total but it also does that thing whenever you get stuck by the the fire it makes your vertical recoil jump up so you go ahead guy here go here on the right all right i'm fine just find it back hide behind us there we go bozo yeah oh they're doing a sun god jack they're asking for it oh little four-year-olds adorable right do we have another uf no i wasted a precision strike is that like a uf kind of but more deadly it's like a big uf so the guy is dropping in there marked that's good he's down he's dead the rest are in the building i guess they were very upset with me for doing that by the way are they still in the morning in the hangar i think they have to be they shot me from 290. i don't hear them one of them was in the hangar i think he's in there no way no way i love it it's so good i don't when you kill a uk guys was that ah and then they're always from yorkshire as well yeah yeah every time chris boris
