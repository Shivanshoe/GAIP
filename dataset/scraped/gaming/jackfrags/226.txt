hi everyone and welcome back to more battlefield 2042 so this is the last chance to play the game right now the open beta ends in i think it's like 11 hours or something 8 a.m uk time and i'm not going to be streaming at 8 00 am in the morning i can tell you that for a fact now i've purposefully not played much of the beta because i didn't want to spoil myself for launch i suppose and i think if you play the same map over and over again you just get sick of it like i did it with bf5 bf1 and i didn't want to do it with this game so i've only played for a few hours really but i thought that seeing as the open beta was ending pretty soon fire up a stream give it a shot and see how it goes so it's going to be pretty chill stream pretty chill video today guys thank you for coming along if you're watching this live appreciate you being here and if you do enjoy it hit that like it's a great way to support me thank you very much matt thank you for 11 months that's just crazy so today i have to say a big thank you to nvidia for sponsoring the stream and video and today on 2042 we'll be using nvidia reflex and this is a really really cool function of specific nvidia cards i think all of the rtx cards have it and i believe it's above the 900 series they have it too and this is in lots of games valorum apex couple of other good examples there that's where i use it but it's also in 2042 and it's going to be there at launch as well and we're playing in 1440p today and this is basically a low latency technology that reduces the time taken from when you click your mouse to an action appearing on the screen and if you know me i'm all about trying to get that competitive edge optimizing my equipment and if you've got a lower system latency it's gonna do it's gonna do stuff like you'll be able to acquire targets faster the game will feel a bit smoother and it will do stuff like mitigating peeka's advantage so you'll see players a little bit sooner we're talking milliseconds but you know every millisecond counts here and in 2042 there are two options for it you can set it to enabled or enabled and boost enabled is the typical setting for this game and this will reduce latency in gpu bound scenarios and on and boost that will help to reduce like an additional small amount of latency when the cpu is heavily loaded so i just leave on enabled i feel like that works best for me but you can put enabled and boost if you want so once again we're using that today and a big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this one and there's a link in the description if you want to learn more about that technology so without further ado ladies and gents we're going to get into a match here as i said i haven't played for a couple days it was the live stream that i did when was that was that two days ago on the sixth it's the last time that i i really played and there's already been a meta forming i've been watching some streamers and it's so funny like some people have played this like 30 hours already it's insane absolutely insane uh falc is definitely one of the meta specialists along with mckay because you get that grapple hook i don't really see people playing as casper unless they get the drone and put the c5 on it and fly it around and blow people up obviously boris is great for camping so it doesn't really suit my place all that some people are into that though that's the ak alternative not great compared to the m5 a3 the m5a3 in this game is essentially the m4 you're good at everything assault rifle it's like the m16a3 from bf3 really if you remember that wba thank you for the five i currently don't own a next-gen console or pc so i'm having to play it on a ps4 okay well how's the experience been on ps4 uh schlager said i've got 16 hours 25 hours dave dave that's crazy man i mean fair play to you like if you're enjoying it that's just mad uh this is the meta as well so you take falc and then you pick the armor plate and hopefully i can demonstrate so the thing with falc is like if you put this armor in that gives you 20 extra hp so immediately i mean you've you know you've got a bit of a competitive advantage there haven't you and with the syringe gun you can do a self-heal so if you hold mouse 3 if i'm hold on can i actually like injure myself without killing myself is that going to kill me a bit closer maybe don't kill me don't kill me okay anyway you can hold mouse 3 it does a little animation where it heals you it takes a bit too long what you can do instead is you just fire the ground and run over it and that heals you so i think there's a lot of there's a lot of balance issues so far with the specialists that have uh hopefully become apparent during the open beta accuracy well i never know which one to pick between these two see projectile velocity like that's pretty pretty important dude that was sick that was actually really impressive he just grenaded someone so here we go oh i was gonna try and demonstrate the heel there but didn't manage to do it any predictions on a kill count this game oh man i don't know it depends like if i'm try hard in do you guys want me to try hard or do you want me to just have fun like what's what do you want from me with these craters in the ground you can make those as well they're really cool yeah there's a lot of great details in this game i was thinking about doing a video which is like i don't know i don't want to do it straight away i'd probably release it in a few days get the res you're good you can shoot they're gonna teammates as well and and heal them try hard have fun i mean it's a 50 50 split right here guys uh so before anyone asks we're playing on a mix of medium and high graphics today i felt like that's the best solution for the open beta a dice did say though that this build of the game is about two months old and that they've made several optimizations to the performance and bug fixes and added features since this build so i'm hoping fingers crossed you know that the um the performance will be uh a lot more consistent let's say when the game releases but i think i'm getting about like 100 fps right now i'm jumping this where other falc is going to take us it looks like minecraft i don't you must be playing an insane version of minecraft there peter hey what you got double rtx graphics or something i mean what's it going down a gpu is a 39 you forgot my name one two four i love the that's great forgot you forgot your name and you missed out the three that's impressive you've really leaned into the character there there's three people on this point i mean there is a giant tank you can actually damage the tank with grenades how many grenades does it take to kill a tank oh god okay that's friendly now one person on this point over here dead i wonder what happens if you hit the enemy plays with the surat does it heal them or does he do damage or just nothing what happens is someone else here i love that it actually tells you how many people are on the point where's that player what do you think guys one person here jonathan thank you for the five do you think dice need to remind people about portal so they won't worry so much about balanced vehicles and specialists looking similar um i don't think they need to remind people about it so to speak i think a lot of people know about portal is that guy really still out there i mean i'd love another trailer for portal and hazard zone you know i said this in the last stream we we haven't heard anything about hazard zone is this thing doing but yeah i was thinking about this i know the the specialists like some people really don't like what's happened with the the classes and the specialists uh a lot of people are fine with it they quite like it and the freedom of choice 50 50 split i would say at the moment in the community but one thing that's great is that with portal in theory what you could do if you didn't like specialists you could make a server that had all the 2042 maps on it had the six remade maps from 1942 bc2 and bf3 and you could have bf3 soldiers and classes on it there you go you've just made a classic battlefield version of bf2042 you could have all the guns you could just have 2042 weapons and equipment you could have a mix you could have everything if you wanted so i like the fact that we're going to have that flexibility there you know i think that's going to be a key factor in letting people customize and enjoy the game how they like kartik thank you for the 100 that's very kindly i hope they bring back rush maps well bc2 i mean i hope that for that portal stuff they've got rush mode baked in already and i think they even mentioned it on one of the blog posts so it might be official that rush is in portal to some degree i don't know if they're gonna do rush for all that warfare in 2042 i don't feel like that's happening because they've just said that it's breakthrough and conquest right so i reckon that's all we'll get for 2042 at least at launch you shot at me then all right okay my my plate is bugged and i can't there we go i couldn't actually put it in then there's still someone there i feel like the revive animation is too long as well like i would go for a revive on that guy but it just it just takes so long and that's one thing i've really noticed you know when i've played this game you don't get revived very often especially if you're playing with a random squad i don't think it's going to be an issue if you're playing with people that you know because then you can just stay on comms oh you know come and revive me or whatever but i found that playing with randoms in this game you just you just don't get rest it just doesn't happen i'm gonna run out of that also see look this this revive should be way quicker i think when you're playing this valve she's a medic class right so it should be bang europe originally they designed it so that pistol this surrep pistol you could fire it at people and revive them and perhaps they decided that maybe that was a bit too powerful but i feel like in terms of team play you know falc is you know she's got gotta have something more with that res in my opinion anyway uh scott thank you for becoming a member it's very kind here jason thanks for the two you can set the pistol to a three round burst press v do you mean oh the secondary that's cool i didn't know that thank you that's really interesting i don't know how often i would use that though to be honest there's a guy right here somewhere they're parachuting on the roof too this is really risky what i'm doing here i do really like the gunplay though i think it's very satisfying killing people in this game what's that doing there something beeping over here dave thanks for the two i just i'm not used to it to be honest dave i do it sometimes when i remember but i'm playing battlefield you know like i do it all the time in cod because that's that's just what you do in card and war zone isn't it you you double spin you tactical sprint but when i'm playing battlefield it's just a behavior that i need to learn because i'm just not used to doing it i'm going to go on the roof over here these are really uh buggy as well you coming in he's going to fall into the floor watch bye still there though just not you know he's there but not what the hell i mean this is pain up here as well i'm gonna die but let's do it anyway get that armor back in a winter thanks for the five it's very kind humor you see i'm a bit i'm a big fan of the time to kill as well i think it's quite i think it's in a good spot i feel like at close range it's quick enough and then at medium to long ranges you can survive if you need to get out of a situation like helicopter okay we are trying hiding right here feel like there was a bit of loaded damage there yeah i mean the the tactical sprint other games have had that in the past yeah but i think modern warfare and warzone have made it popular that's what i'm trying to say i'm not saying that like cod invented that because they didn't but fps players are used to it now and they're used to it because they've been playing a ton of warzone and modern warfare that's what i'm trying to say they popularized it connie is the most popular fps game so whatever it does will have a huge knock-on effect uh winter sun wolf thank you for becoming a member playing with controller sucks ivan i've heard that you know uh my friend lachlan tactical brit he plays on controller um and he's a very good controller player but he said that the default controller scheme for this game is a bit weird and it might just be beta things and you know like we said earlier they fixed it up for the full release of the game but apparently it's quite a bit janky so he was messing around with this thing called ds4 i don't think you can do this on playstation or xbox because it doesn't have ds4 but you can mess around with the response curves on the controller and he found some settings that work really well for him but you shouldn't have to do that of course you know default it should just feel good yeah we could do some drone in c4 in a bit zero g could be a good laugh that i'm going up screw it i'll take one for the team hey cheese what's up gary jack you wish there was some background music to break up the sound well that's three enemies at the top of the zip line not much i could do there was there there is zero aim assist it feels like austin is that true is that what the problem is do you know the build of debate is claimed to be from several months ago that's what they say vault yeah that's nice keep saying that typically in game design as well they branch off the the game at one point let's say they have like a demo whether that's a beta or a demo for gamescom or e3 they will branch it off and just pop like polish it um that's not an unusual thing so when they say that it's probably true i didn't realize there was an elevator here you know first time i've seen this [Applause] was that enemy trying to get in there what is it oh that goes right up to the top i mean that guy is still down there are they going to come up the elevator i don't know i want to go up i've seen people grappling onto the rocket as well you guys seen those videos you can is it opening oh it's opening up so in six minutes it's gonna launch what people do is they get up here they get they get mckay [Music] and as the rocket is taking off they grapple onto the bottom and it takes them up into the sky that's so funny can you get on those things that there you can cool sound that is there's no timer though i can't time it it's unfortunate can you show your mini bird skills i mean i did plenty of uh flying in the previous live stream and video so i don't know i think like they're really fun to fly around um but i think just watching helicopter gameplay can get a bit boring even if you just you know you're getting a load of kills i mean it didn't let me deploy my parachute then are you doing that a really laggy helicopter oh he's trying to blow it up me i'm you know i want to show people what it looks like when you grapple onto it it's going to blow up [Music] get good guy was talking about the lack of aim assist okay what do i think about the armor plates i don't think they should be in the game sale i don't think battlefield should have armor in the default game mode i think it's weird uh i just feel like it's going to be a meta where everyone takes it and that's going to diminish the team play even further so if it were me i would take it out but the problem is you know the specialist system it may have traits and and gadgets based around armor so you know i don't know if that's an easy fix please teammate shoot him come on i think my grenade got him yeah dude some sniper gameplay hayden yeah we'll do some sniper gameplay later for sure uh dave thank you for becoming a member the little bird is really fun yeah the rockets are quite weak against infantry though but like i'm kind of okay with that i don't want them to be too powerful against infantry in the little bird if you want to take out infantry in a helicopter you take the attack helicopter that's traditional battlefield really although the little bird in bf4 and bf3 was really good against infantry these guys having a fight down here now they've got a res it's funny how day one everyone was just playing as mckay and then it switched to foul because people have realized that she's just got armor which is more hp and you can sell feel hmm i'd be interesting when all 10 specialists are in the game though what the matter is because hopefully there will be a bit more team play when all 10 are available bro does bf2042 feel similar to bf3 and 4 um in in terms of the sandbox nature of it yes it does uh in terms of the gun play i would say it's closest to bf3 look at this tunnel this tunnel as well everyone just like friggin comes down there it's like pitch black though so you can't see anything horrible lord bucket head lord bucket buckethead run for the local elections in the uk it's genuinely a thing as a guy who dresses like a knight in shining armor and wears a bucket on his head and people actually vote for him crazy your head bobbing off um there is there is a bit of bob yeah a bit of bob tro bob um not much so i mean you can turn it you can turn the camera shake down but not completely off i just wish you could turn it off yeah i'm a big fan of the gunplay i like it a lot trying to figure out where the enemies are here dog didn't seem to respond to me i'm gonna raise these dudes you can prone as well and res useful tip sean thanks to the five see now they're all down here i'm just gonna throw a couple nades i saw some guy get 16 kills they threw two grenades down there i've got 16 kills it's insane you guys seen that clip crazy i want to get behind them here this is really stupid just running across the open but whatever does this seem to be a clear matter yeah at the moment's fault what's the lag don't kill me don't kill me don't kill me try and get behind all these oh my god clean up on all five thank you very much it's clear boys we're good we're good you can go in now oh my god all that was just a simple flank if i'd have been killed running across the street there though would have completely stopped me in my tracks and the tunnel is going to provide so many clips yeah it is none of those were bots craters they're all real players you just look at the name ai have a different skin and they also have a different name they're all real players just a big flank that's all none of them were paying attention let's go ah hiding behind the vent dammit hey josh hey evan gunn what's up can you change the green hood color you can put colorblind mode on that's it at the moment like i'd love to see hud customization when the game comes out because there's so many things that i would tweak like this um this bit here you see where i'm pointing i i think that's so unnecessary it doesn't need to be there all the time and it comes like way too far across the screen for me it's better to shoot the ground it's way quicker daniel yeah they did destroy the rocket [Music] there's a tank here can't do much against that can i okay that's really broken i wish there was an option to have first person takedowns as well it's not a deal breaker for me but i think it would be cool if you could choose but the thing is animation work like that like it's takes so long so expensive as well just be nice to have the option you know how was that trade kill uh you don't like the neon cyan hood elements i don't like the glow super d is this guy going to rest oh just stand over me thank you oh they got sniped no i everything has a glow to it i just i wish i could turn that glow off i think sometimes dice still favor art design over gameplay trying to throw a grenade dice it did i just got hammered there more down here [Music] someone felt cheap oh shot in the back none of the guns in this game have recall i think some of them do self wave it depends at the distances you're engaging out though like this gun that i'm using here at medium range it's it's okay but i mean it does bounce up a lot it's just this is a problem that the game's gonna have because of crossplay okay so on mouse this gun pretty much just goes straight up it has a lot of recoil but it just goes straight up so when you're watching me shoot people i'm doing a lot of recoil control but it's not difficult like it's literally just pulling straight down on the mouse that's a lot harder to do on a controller so they can't really balance that because the crossplay could you make the recall i i'm not saying they should do this but is it possible on their engine that you could make the recall of one gun different on pc if you were playing with a mouse compared to console i don't think that's a good idea but like is that a possibility i'm not sure yeah it's just like this gun is literally just straight up it goes a little bit up to the right see it starts to kind of go very similar to the old m16a3 actually that's a good game wouldn't it 48 kills not bad only five revives failing as a medic rainbow six did okay why does webster mckay look like woody from toy story i said this steve as well he totally does uh rocket fish thank you for the 10 that's very generous [Music] jld thanks for the five yeah yeah you could you can just it's got like 12 shots in it or something will you get an adder lake cpu i think so thomas yeah they're coming out in november right the new intel cpus is that right any news about bipods for lmgs i don't know abbas i think that would be good though right looks like jake gyllenhaal i've heard that as well yeah most people say it looks like jay gilnear what's up jazz dickinson how you doing hello daniel burks yeah you can jason yeah on your secondary you've got a few options any news on dlss uh curtis yes so dlss is actually coming to this game as well it'll be in the game at launch uh this gun's got quite a bit more recoil maybe i can show you so it is an nvidia partnered game so they've got reflex which we talked about at the start but it's also going to have dlss and the lss is great i love it i think it's brilliant it basically means graphics good frame rate good that's it uh rooney oh thank you for the five mckay looks like luke wilson you mean owen wilson's brother wow wow wow uh monk thank you for the fight well thank you for becoming a new member boris cheers for the one why is maria falk's appearance changed i don't know or dwell they made her look older in the early images they released she was a bit younger but now they've made a lot more like a grandma i don't know um who knows see the ak and that's a look at that that initial recourse that's quite a lot look at the first and second bullet bounces right up i mean compare that to the m5 that we just had what if i put the um the other magazine on so that one doesn't bounce quite as much but this gun's got substantially more recoil than the m5 does it do more damage though i don't know how did you make the flag so bright i can hardly see them on ps5 are they bright i don't i haven't changed any color settings it's just all default maybe it's because i'm playing on pc g soup i'm not sure that's what they were going for bro let's chill try to get a defib kill you can't do that though in this game can you john because you can't get your defibs out unless you've got a dead teammate so how would you get a defib kill hello eastwood take off the underbarrel i mean that's crazy what though what's that one there oh that's the hybrid i love this system by the way i think it's cool i have found myself using it as well more than i thought i thought it would be a bit gimmicky but i use it quite a lot the average player though you know maybe they just build a loadout and then that's it maybe they wouldn't use it that much i don't know what do you think have you guys found yourself using it on the pistols someone was asking so we've just got i i assume that when the game's out and when all the guns are in the game there'll be a lot of options here and you can pick but this is all you've got for the pistol at the moment einstein or red dot that osprey what about the knife versus defib mode in portal infected army i think what they've done there is because in those older games like bf3 and bc2 defibs were a gadget that you could equip so that's probably what they've done there i'd imagine i never use this either i it doesn't work half the time though in this build the game this dude here quite a lot of drop on that dude excuse me excu what the oh there's a guy right here check that out by the way look at the ground deformation here on the terrain i know it's not it's not really affecting gameplay but like that level of detail the fact there's 128 players here as well you could probably draw some quite rude things as well if you wanted to dude i'm just trying to i'm trying to show cha that you can draw on the ground please give me a break [Music] wow what the hell is this death animation what the hell was that a zen motor thanks for the five what do i think is the biggest net negative of the game so far uh i don't know it's difficult to judge it because it's not the full experience but i think i think perhaps it's lost some of its identity as a battlefield game moving away from the class system it's giving people a lot more choice and creativity in how they play but at the same time it's it's lost some of that cool battlefield identity you know that's what makes battlefield unique compared to a lot of other games it still has a lot of battlefield in it this game for sure like it's got sandbox it's got vehicles 128 players a bit of destruction you know no other game really does that the same but i think losing the classes maybe has diminished teamwork a bit too much than it should have done apart from that it's the ui like i just wish i could change it i still think it's inherently fun and i'm you know i'm gonna play it a lot when it comes out we'll see i mean when all 10 specialists sit in and you're playing with your friends team play might come back a bit but i think for the casual random player on their own they're not really going to get much team play the thing is it won't change i know a lot of people have been saying look just just change change the specialist so that they are part of a class and you have to pick a specialist class to have a certain gadget rather than one specialist gets one unique gadget i don't think that's gonna happen because the specialists are part of the monetization system and the you know the live service and it's all wrapped up together so i don't see that changing this guy in the corner such a weird like just prone like this oh you're dead are you dead oh come on i wanted to rest uh the other the other like major negative for me is that uh the skins and again this will you know giving the game the benefit of the doubt this will be better at launch because specialists will have different skins and there'll be more options there's not just going to be four running around but sometimes it's quite difficult to differentiate between players on your team and players on the enemy team and i think like they need to have some kind of filter in place where let's say see that's mckay so i'm playing as mckay mckay's on my team look like this and i know they've got that little blue light on them but that's not enough like the skin needs to be a bit darker or something or have more red on it because sometimes i mean i find myself like shooting at friendlies let's say a mckay runs around the corner like this it's not evident straight away that they're an enemy so i'd love a proper like visual filter that actually applies a big difference to them someone down there i mean this gun is not made for this range is it leroy i did press spacebar but i just left it too late yeah valerian does a really great job of that i know it's a bit of a weird example as well but i don't put it on youtube but i've been playing a lot of new world off stream and off youtube um and we had a war basically you in that game you take you take territory you play on a server and within that server there are different territories and you go and capture them by um doing certain things and gaining xp and then you can claim the town for yourself you pay a certain amount of money and um what happens is other territories can then go to war with you and you end up with this 50 v 50 it's basically a round of [Applause] i don't know like breakthrough i suppose where one of you holds a four and in that four there is a point and outside the four there are three domination points like capture points and then the enemy have to push in and take the three capture points outside and then they can try and take the one in the middle of the fort but what that did to get to the point it just applied a blue and red filter to each team because 50 v 50 in an mmo when there's so many particle effects you can imagine it starts to get pretty crazy and it's hard to tell who's on your team and who isn't and all it did was just put a blue and red filter on on the characters and it work it's perfect it's the classic blue and red you know it's the halo blue and red it works i'm not saying they should just put like a cartoony blue and red filter on everyone but maybe just make the skins a bit darker or different in some way there was talk about that i'm sure that that's been mentioned before a laughing dolphin thank you for becoming a member we got another member as well uh grizzly it's very kind of my man thanks dude tried to get around the corner hello bloodline good evening to you too how you doing help you just shoot everyone you see well that works but you're gonna be wasting ammo i guess and giving your position away have i noticed there are reused map elements from previous games veto no i haven't noticed any i mean most of the assets seem new to me i guess they could just look similar to bf3 and bf4 because it's a modern game but i haven't i haven't looked at something and gone oh that's from bf3 oh that's from bf4 uh pinata thank you for the five solar stories thank you for becoming a member ah instantly oh i mean i i know this would be like for the super hardcore fans who really don't like the specialists you know how the ai look different to the specialists they just look like generic soldiers maybe they could have a toggle where in the options you select it and you just get two factions you just get the us ai and the russian ui and then all the specialists change to those yeah you wouldn't know what you were fine against but i don't know maybe you might prefer it that way i don't think that would ever happen but an option maybe why did something red come up then on the screen what the hell have i noticed any cheaters yet i haven't experienced any cheaters in my games but i've seen a couple videos on twitter what that guy had a parachute coming up the repel i've not seen that one before yeah i've not had any cheaters in my games but i've seen a couple videos of cheats so yeah people have uh definitely got cheats working for this alexander thank you for 20. is strong marcel thank you for the five i don't really want to go back to that point because there's just so many people not feeling that is that the tunnel of doom there is anyone down here sometimes people play as boris and they put turrets down here i hate it when the lights turn off as well why do they i mean that look jackie's album why do they turn the lights off how do you do that i don't even know how to do that all right can i leave i want to leave i was pulling down a lot on the mouse then to counter that recall oh my god i'm pulling down so much there people in the tunnel [Music] did that guy just disappear i mean what happened then maybe i'm on a u.s server here or something it feels really laggy oh god i get a fake reload then what's this here someone's just got a tank stuck here it's so dumb it's a wildcat i mean that is well and truly stuck there wow i'm flying i move this maybe that's chalked i'm afraid [Music] i get a kill with the chalked wildcat maybe someone can just like see for me out of here that'd be great can anybody help me so broken please nice i'm big is that range what are you doing my mate no i wanted to get a kill oh i'm gone i love that it just ejects you out of it pogbas big pugs buddy mckay hooning around like a jackrabbit i don't have any ammo can you give me ammo no you can't get me out yeah that's a problem with the new class system as well or the new specialists you don't know who to look for to get ammo because anyone can pick it and there are a lot more fun things than ammo in that slot like rocket launchers or armor or c5 need a gun hey maria maria please oh cheeky you're on the back there's quite a few people in here though i think what the hell what's wrong with this door why is it stuck i can't get in good job mckay you just revived yourself what about c c4 isn't in the game they call it c5 it's

visibility in this game in terms of like seeing people the problem is with identifying people that are on your team in the enemy team because they're the same skins the only difference is if you look at an enemy they've got a red dot and a red health bar with a name teammates have a blue dot on a blue elbow with a name that's it lossy made a good video about this beta that's cool yeah lossy's been

of wish you could um don't fire those rockets that'd be cool close the gap on these guys here whoa what's that helicopter doing oh not like this let's see you up there webster mckay if that is even your real name it sounds like a fake name to me i finished watching squid game last night man that hit hard that show hit really hard i hope they make more i don't know if they've said if they're gonna do a series two but i feel like they should like they left so many unanswered questions and interesting things in there you can don't fire them how i mean i'm clicking it's not working what time does the beta end the beta ends in 9 hours and 20 minutes this is fun when you're drunk webster mckay nice to meet you time to go to work what's up moxie how you doing hey guys if you're enjoying the stream or if you're watching this as a vod and you've actually watched this far you're legendary i want to say that hit the like button give me a thumbs up leave a comment and then the resplendent holy youtube algorithm in the sky will shine its light upon me in a favorable fashion and boost this video and live stream into people's recommended feeds and for those that have subscribed but not ding the bell isn't that so weird that that's where we're at uh morley i'm playing this on steam i think i don't know i downloaded like three builds of the game i think actually no it'll be on origin because um a couple days before the beta went live we had a preview event and i downloaded it on origin and then when the beta went live i didn't have to download anything else it was just there straight away so i've got c5 so i told you it was called c5 you didn't believe me did you time to go to work no it's casper we're going to play his casper friendly ghost what is this but i'm trying to go to work here i was thought that i could put the c4 on the drone and then fly it right like that's what i'm trying to do maybe doing that from the roof isn't the best idea i'll try put it on here let me get out dice hang on parachute people are appearing is that one on the ground bro just okay fine fine god i'm just trying to have some fun here wow medic maria maria no don't run away grandma please come on i would raise you grandma grandma don't get shot in the back yes no grandma grandma are you going dude you were right there she was literally gonna do it and now it's too late i i i don't know what to say i mean grandma betrayed me on many levels jesus this is not a good start to the game if i can get that tank okay okay that's all that's all three on it here we go big rain time it's rewind time no no no this tank is dead i'm gonna emp it disabled it jump out bang yes yes that's how you do it get the c4 on hit him with the disable with the emp bang it's simple although i don't have c4 anymore now i'm sad how do i get ammo there should be a little like ammo station in there maybe at the bottom yeah that emp is great by the way i don't know if you've realized that but the drone has an emp on it and you can hit any vehicle with it you right click left click and it disables it for a few seconds really strong those don't these guys see me ah i i turned around i was like i'm sure someone's gonna fly away and they did i should have followed my instincts yeah i mean the ammo thing for me it's a it's a little bit of a concern because like i said right let's look so when let's say there's 10 specialists in the game 10 specialists you pick any one that you want they've got their unique gadget you've got your optional universal gadget you can pick ammo you can pick medic crate when the c5 explosive and rockets here and armor which is literally more health are you really gonna take ammo and health over that i don't know i don't think most players would so i think that's gonna be a problem so what i would do is just increase the ammo pool if they're gonna stick with this system i think you've got to increase the ammo pull when you spawn in players drop ammo when you kill them but it's only like a little bit it's not much hey what's into that grenade i don't want to freeze this is why i saw that clip where's the tunnel the tunnel okay so i've got 16 kills with two grenades insane absolutely crazy i want to do that i want 16 kills but two grenades great i shouldn't have shot them get myself away that was my bad there's gonna be a specialist that will drop armor and ammo i hope so ghost i mean that'll be good okay look at all those enemies there there's a lot of enemies i like that hybrid it's cool not dead what the hell lads you need to kill you need to kill the guy over here yeah someone got him i think i just killed some leaves there they were trying to get their photosynthesis on and i just promoted them in their prime someone else is trying the drone i've got a drone on my own i'm gonna put some c4 on it light up there murder everyone ding dong what they're not work why aren't the elevators working well um ian is it ian a latin thank you for 30 months love to see you play 2042 thank you how do you toggle hybrid you just right click and press f melee key there's quite a few people on the roof you know is that three oh that's right oh it's so that's so satisfying something so good about that do no no no no no [Music] oh no what's up star wars hq how you doing man good to see you oh maria i love you no no no no no no no no oh i got c4 back i've got one c4 back where you are i was looking at chat sorry have i seen the new bond movie yet no i haven't i really want to go see it though i just don't fancy going to a cinema right now you know because of the deadly virus and everything maybe like this point i barely ever come to this point ever yeah the hybrid doesn't work when you spawn you have to take it off and you have to put it back on and then it works pain why is it why is everything exploding oh i'm lagging hard what the hell grandma came back for you she did grandma loves me she loves you as well mister thank you for the 10. happy dude what do you get if you cross steroids with mr frags really jacked i'll see myself out that was good at star wars thank you for the 10 that's very kind keep up the

you're into star wars and star wars games by the way go check out star wars hq on youtube i made some corvids um i think it's i think i put the wrong magazine in i think that's what's happening there

going again here we go oh oh please stay up there no stop zipping stop it zippy long stockings oh there's two there might be more oh no no no i got one the other one's gotta be light to be there

imagine though imagine was it 1670 i got to two kilometers in the air there's a helicopter there that's no problem for me he's dead what if i had a stinger no it wouldn't lock on would it it's too far away can you do a rocket zook maybe uh tom t thank you for the 20. i don't think the rocket is even making it to the ground from this high guys i i just think it despawns let's cut the chute terminal

of water today actually um i went out earlier went shopping to a giant mall there's a massive huge shopping center in manchester um called the trafford center it's awesome there's not there's nothing else like it in the uk it's all like themed and extravagant loads of food there they've got arcades bowling alleys vr stuff great shopping great restaurants and i was there for like five hours and um

water i feel a lot better now though i was just dehydrated i was just turning my my body into a prune you know it's a normal thing to do on a saturday evening just prune yourself you've become a prune just as i anticipated it's a guy from game of thrones talking about prince just the kind of thing that he does 41 rounds oh i've got bar i didn't select boris did i uh should i make it my mission to get one kill with the turret and then uninstall boris forever okay kill that was me useless fun thank you i talked about it a bit earlier time i don't want to go into it again because uh the chat just goes crazy i will say like to just summarize i'm i'm having fun with it i think it's an inherently fun battlefield game with a load of sandbox moments but i think there's some problems with team play ui and enemy acquisition it's a quick summary for you is everyone down in the tunnel already i mean i said this in my in my first stream like what i think about the game is irrelevant you know it's up to you you decide if you like it or not everyone's got their own opinions about battlefield it's very subjective that's with all video games you know damn it i missed that spawn uh mike thank you for the 19 months that's insane support man i really appreciate that it's very kind i want to get revenge maria there was an enemy down here oh no oh no no no i'm lagging i can't i can't move guys what the i literally couldn't get oh my god please dice i'm begging you also the pitch black corridor i mean that's got to go isn't it surely what's wrong i need to clip that flank that i got earlier in

do is no no no dice why you shooting at me there's about 1500 enemies why me oh no i should have stepped back and reloaded there was so many kills there look at this i mean i could you know i could do

going to stay down there i've got to do it i need to get the i need to get the meme that's c5 spawn here go in the corner the drone out the end thing one two three by the drone they just can't let me be can they i just you know i just want the memes to occur i reckon that was like at least 18 kills that would have beat the clip what the what the hell what are you doing up there lads maybe they're still there though on that point gotta go from a bit further away maybe why is my drone still alive oh it's not it's a fake fake drone uh one of them missed didn't it then i'm wearing one two will be

today we were playing with nvidia reflex so battlefield 2042 and other games support this and it's low latency technology that basically reduces the time from a mouse click to an action on the screen and that means that you can acquire targets faster you can mitigate pika's advantage and just improve the overall aiming it just feels a bit more responsive it's good stuff if you care about that kind of thing you want to turn it on and it is available on nvidia gpus from the gtx 900 series and up and you can just turn it on in the menus if you want to learn more about that there's a link down in the description below hashtag add thank you very much nvidia cool right nvidia are really good to be honest they're great to work with very good to me um we do a lot of good stuff together cool i'm
