April the first is always a dangerous day to be on the internet with all of the April Fool's jokes that usually do the rounds and of course video game developers and publishers like to throw their hat into the mix and apex legends today have introduced wall-running and Titans now I'm just kidding but come on how cool would that be respawn please maybe just let us try that for a bit but know what they've actually added is golden Mozambique's logo this bad boy what gold Mozambique digi threat shotgun bought it's gonna be good fun now we all know how much of a meme the Mozambique is when the game first came out it was practically useless and you would just pinger Mozambique on the ground to get a laugh out of your teammates since then it has been updated a bit and you can't put hammer point rounds on it which aren't bad really but I think overall most people still see it as a joke but no longer as of today the golden Mozambique I don't think this is the permanent addition to the game because it is completely mad if you find one of these it's got nine rounds in it it's now fully automatic and it's got a digit so so it just shreds and they've increased the shotgun stacks to over 40 so you can have a ridiculous amount of shots in this gun so I've been playing a few games with the two angry gamers today after we just basically were running it as a primary weapon because the DPS on this thing at the moment I reckon maybe it's one of the fastest killing guns in the game at close range you can just chunk people with this thing I mean look at this oh my god what's that yeah it's funny isn't it oh is it dead it's absolutely crazy and at times we becoming up against people in casual matchmaking who were in squads but they were running the classic meta at the moment Peacekeeper are 99 but the Mozambique they just see you with it and maybe they don't know that this has happened they rush you and you just send them to the grave it's great so hot drops at the moment Oh mad if you hot drop somewhere and get yourself a Mozambique you can just shred through people and of course if people are attacking a building that you're in it's a good idea to try and let them come in and think that they've got the advantage but oh no no no you're carrying a golden Mozambique and you will destroy them if you do hop on apex today like I said I don't know how long this is going to last for maybe it's just for a day because I do think it will actually mess the game up quite a lot if you just play it casually but a word of advice would be just hipfire it I don't think you really need to aim to be honest and when you're aiming because it fires so fast and there are so many projectiles it actually looks really messy and it's kind of hard to track the target but if you just hip fire generally speaking you won't beat most people with this it's a bit of a meme for the day I suppose we did end up winning a match just by using mozambique's earlier - with that said thank you for watching guys I hope you enjoyed this one just a little update video for you because I thought this was quite funny but I'd love to see what's the highest number of kills someone could get with a Mozambique in one match anyway boys and girls thank you for watching leave a like if you liked the video a dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one you got feet boy you got feet [Music] [Music]
