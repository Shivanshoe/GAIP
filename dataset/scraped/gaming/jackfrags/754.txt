Counter Strike won't go away I've been playing it again recently enjoying it which I never thought I would say again and some pretty crazy stuff has occurred over the last few weeks like this clip for example see if you can work out what happened before I slow it down and explain just watch this if you didn't figure it out I threw a grenade towards the guy with the oven mitt but a split second after I threw it that all / fired a shot at me but the shot actually hit my grenade in mid-air now I've played CS since it came out in the year 2000 in 20 years that has never happened to me I've seen a few clips online where it's happened to other people and where it's been tested and I don't know what the chances of this are but maybe I should go and play the lottery this weekend but that is hitbox gold right there and sometimes the hit reg is great and you pull off something like this that's the guy over home you guys want to go just one cc1 haha although ourselves other times those stuff like this can happen bait for me now hold on there that's it Oh Oh will you watching my screen then yeah I was watching a screen can you explain that Andrew yeah will count straight disgraceful you know that you can mess around - I don't want to go through I just want to look at it that's what she said but corpse is coming for Chuck what's the back home what's this guy doing they talk about my want apps why have you done this Adam yeah well she's supposed to do things Charlie let's make more yeah come on guys we get some guns in the pile come on yeah how many guns in the power SS nest more guns all guns no no why don't they add to the pile no no pile of guns b1 this gun goes in the pile yeah more guns in the pile all hail pile that's a lot of guns and occasionally clutch you must win first by round on T side inferno sight one by one the turkey dinosaur walked into the fate [Music] yes jack ass there's really two here enough oh I like router Oh get out of town it's a fake you give up on real ginsa questions feels good man I just don't get that rush from any other game still and yeah this is all just from matchmaking we're not pros but counter-strike for me it's a game that I grew up on and because of that when counter-strike is mentioned I personally always think back to the older versions probably 1.3 or 1.6 but if you ask most younger players about counter-strike nowadays they will probably be thinking oh you mean csgo and that makes sense considering csgo is the current version and it's still incredibly popular of course counter-strike started long before csgo though back in the days when games were still on CDs in fact when I played Counter Strike for the first time it was a mod for half-life and I got it off a CD from PC gamer and there were actually two versions of the game at one point either the mod version or the retail and you had to download update files manually off file sharing websites what a crazy world it used to be depending on what version you had dictated what update file you would have to download when the time came and back then on 56k modems or if you were lucky is the end you didn't want to download the wrong one in today's world of course we're always looking for new games and even within those new games we want new guns new maps new skins all the time we always want more expectations are through the roof back when I was first playing though things were different you had a few select maps played with the same weapons and yet it was absolutely fine that's just how it was I'd come home from school not do any of my homework and just play CS all evening and never get bored it was the same at the weekends too some of my best gaming memories are from those days and going to LANs and tournaments it was arguably a much simpler time now skips are today counter-strike go I found a bit of a love-hate relationship with this game I played so much of it when it first released and I did go to a few LANs with friends but at a much more casual level it's gonna keep clicking and hopefully runs into my bullet and I stopped playing it regularly about three years ago it just became a bit more of a chore for me to play because when you start ranking up everyone is not only really good but everyone wants to win and I understand that but nowadays I feel like I'm at the stage where csgo is much more of a social thing for me and I load it up when I want to have fun and sometimes that can be a bit hard when the enemy seem advancing a smoke grenade off three walls London get in your face and then 360 opened you through it while planting the bomb one-handed so the game has been out for a long time now and people are very good at it and it's definitely evolved and changed a lot since it launched the good thing is though that when you don't play for long enough you lose your matchmaking rank and because the game gave me one back that was much lower than what I had before I've slowly been easing my way back into it recently on an evening me and some friends will just hop on CS and play a few games it's nothing too serious it's just for fun none of us are Pro CS players but of course we would still rather win than lose but like I said for us it really is just a social thing now get together in the evening play some csgo and shoot the breeze maybe that's because we're getting older it could be but for us it's kind of like going out to the pub we catch up we laugh with each other and just have a good time CS is the backdrop one of the other reasons that I stopped playing about three years ago was because there were so many cheaters in matchmaking and I'm not talking about oh that guy's a bit suspect every now and again I mean the rage hackers which are 3/16 around the map and just one-hit killing you those kind of cheats is I would come across those quite regularly especially in the high ranks of matchmaking and when you get so many of those in a row it just demoralizes you but I have to say that coming back to the game in the last maybe three or four weeks or so plenty of games are matchmaking and I don't think I've played against the cheater at least one that wasn't making it obvious but it probably does help that everyone in my party is in prime much making but reflecting on this I think the more that I've got back into csgo recently the more I realized that there simply isn't anything like it on the market stuff and I will caveat that in a minute but when you get that clutch play or you land that epic one big get a quad kill an ace whatever it might be you still get that feeling of satisfaction that you just don't get from many other games you've got games like siege cod or even player unknowns battlegrounds that have really high skill ceilings but some of them are in different ways I think sieges immensely skillful but the majority of that I would say is math knowledge peaking in general positioning of course you still have to have a good aim and all of the top level players do but csgo I think is a different beast the top level teams all have insane strategies with set grenades but you also have to be able to aim immaculately for a large percentage of the game and control recoil to make the right decision when there's 15 or the wrong decisions to be made and probably the only popular big-ish game that I can think of at the moment that has you controlling recall to a similar level maybe it's puff G but of course me and my friends were not at a pro level we're just casual and I haven't bothered learning any new grenades although I do remember a few basic ones from my time playing before and we don't worry about serious strategies when we play yeah we do simple things like split a fake B we might push down banana on Inferno occasionally it's nothing advanced and yet we still have so much fun with it it's part of that though is that we do have a selection of skills and ranks in party usually and I think the matchmaking is actually doing a pretty decent job at putting us up against an equal for equal ish opponent team I guess what I'm trying to say though is I don't think counter-strike will ever go away it will always be there and I don't think any other first-person shooter has been as good of a competitive or eSport title than this one it's just not being beat from what we've seen online recently in the last couple of weeks maybe Riot Games project a could be a worthy contender but of course we'll have to wait and see with that said I hope you enjoyed today's video do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below are you still playing Counter Strike stopped years ago but is it just something you hop on every now and again a big thank you for watching if you enjoyed this video leave a like if you
