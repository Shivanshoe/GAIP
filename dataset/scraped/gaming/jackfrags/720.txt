hi everyone and welcome to some more Call of Duty warzone I hope you're all doing well today I'll be joined by study and tomographic couple guys that I've played with before they featured in a few videos with me and in today's stream or video if you're watching this as a vaad I wanted to try some new guns because all I tend to use in war zone typically it's the mp7 because that's just an absolute monster at close range sometimes I use the m4 and then for sniping HDR I think is probably the best so I've actually built some different loadouts here with some other guns that I wanted to test so when we get the loadout drops tonight that's what I'll be doing so I've built myself a growl this bad boy here I haven't leveled it up completely but a lot of people say that the growl is really good and it's just a gun that I haven't used that's called great grout job guys who sees my mastery of the English language and puns we've got the RAM 7 which is also supposed to be pretty good I have got that too level 43 so I've not looked like a lot everything on it but I don't think I've ever used this gun in warzone but that's how I've got it set up and the other one that I'm probably the most excited to test in warzone is the mp5 this bad boy here I've got the tiger skin on it and I got the little ghost charm on there too but I've decked this out because I think I've got this almost max level and level 52 on it the only thing I wasn't sure about was these bike I think magazine size in warzone is really important because you're dealing with multiple opponents especially in squad so I think for squads I reckon maybe the 45 round mag is better but I did consider adding the 30 round mag with the 10 millimeter because like look at the stats for accuracy damage and range when you add that so I'm torn between these two to be honest I don't know I think I'll try 45 rounds to begin with and then we might try the around 10 millimeter afterwards so those are what we're looking at today if it fails miserably it fails miserably but we'll see so I'm just gonna mute discord and we'll speak to study in tomographic and hopefully yet in a lobby together the world a man whose Lobby are we joining we're joined on me I think you should because we're in tamos lots on me sweet well I'm ready to go ready to care cool so a lot you guys thing about I was just saying mp7 seems very popular with the with the stream why do such a streamer exclusive it's like every streamer uses the mp7 or like the all of the American streamers they will have mp7 classes and maybe a growl but most America the American ones yeah the mp7 I mean it's probably one of the best guns in in war zone though isn't it yeah really good at medium range as well though stud I think you mean with at long range recall on it just goes up into the right as well so it's very easy to control it you just pull down to the left like do you remember the m16 yeah oh yeah exactly the same guys so I just actually changed there while I was speaking to the higher damage rounds because a lot of guys in chat said try it out so I'm gonna take your I'm gonna take your feedback on board and we're gonna use those more powerful rounds edgy boy let's see I see the circle shows the flight pattern but it doesn't so just show the first circle until you actually in the game press em now you can see where the planes flying do you think it should show you where the first circle is yeah I'll just not much done it is it done it in other videos it might as well like I mean yeah yeah there are a couple of others that do that what's the difference between seeing it here and being in the plane really there's not much is there I mean it's just I guess it's just easier for people that know cuz if you didn't know you'd be like other that either way it could help yeah just gives you a bit more time to plan I suppose but thank you for coming along to the livestream guys I am looking at the chat so if you've got any questions feel free to ask and hopefully we can get some good games in today Oh Mike Kiran buna Lewis Alexander was a scar Sagittarius a ham Connor how's it going guys thank you for coming by then why do you want to go wow look at this circle definitely gonna need a minute yeah yeah that's a nice little secluded town that's cheeky I mean I always gave the scavenger contract I don't know if they're better than the flag ones that I think I prefer the flags when it's lit yeah well the search ones are good for the initial money but dangerous yeah I think that knowledge is just so important these ones are just easy to get army yeah I usually fill yourself up with armor plates too in the bunker I like this mp5 I think that best to do off the start of the game oh because they split your team up with how far away the scavenger boxes actually go you gone down spike yeah I went down to the wall area then I have to go up again there's my first game of the day I don't really played any games today all to be honest I was watching one of my friends play Resident Evil 3 remaster that looks cool graphics on that red stain apparently it's only like six hours long though so I don't know if I'll play or not probably not a legend everyone I hear where it's sending me going for it but I'm going yeah yeah see they keep these one split the team up so much you know I'm risking it for a biscuit but I will say why does it so it's quite good yeah I missed out on the Resident Evil games when I was a kid Oh Saint the Tommo Jack is my mic on discord really low quality it sounds fine to me does it sound bad it's fine when you talk when when like we're not talking as well it's one I want to edit I do notice that this chord if I'm if like everyone's talking at once the quality of the people go below your maybe that's how they do it because they can only use one going or something for the all the audio they come out but whatever works we got money in this shop this one's quite out out there I feel like people wouldn't be looting all rights go what made you ask and we stood someone bringing up so the thing with Resident Evil is when I was a kid I never had a Playstation from my own the only PlayStation I had was when I would borrow my next-door neighbors and they let me play games like Metal Gear Solid and grunts Turismo so I never had Resident Evil but I did play Resident Evil 4 and 5 and they were very good how many guys are down there I see two can my I'm submerged odd it looks like they've got that loadout room that's what I'm more concerned about okay and they're gone if they left there one just run to the riot squad line this is rather don't tell how far [Applause] because they're trying to be me from like 300 meters away with that yeah mg or something actually you want to sack this off and go to a different buy it seems I've got more range than this that's for sure yeah there is a tacher over over there so that we could get okay what's happened our PJs and see fall and your the problem with the RPGs Jack never saw a room it now the RPG it's ruined thank you for the five I'll do that was dices fault that wasn't my fault yeah yeah was guided by dice and to this day they still never changed it I'm sure they nerfed a little bit and they didn't they you half the number bombs they had they half the time they doubled the time that it took to you yet the bombs back right but the the strat now is to use the bombs and then the pilot jump out kill the plane respawn in the plane with the bombs it's a classic people are still doing that yes absolutely yeah pretty mantle I mean you want to go for this by here and get our load up oh yeah oh yeah we can pull we've got the money down want it no Armour please go inside down run on your

I'd say it's neither RPG I don't think is this effective in squads as it is in solo solos it's just people drive around in trucks I've got the c4 as well if I need to deal with the vehicle c4 I think one-hit kills any vehicle in the game you managed to jump over that yeah you find a way yeah those proximity mines you can prone and you don't take any damage yeah I crouched underneath there you'll still take damage for the one I think in the multiplayer how was you doesn't it if you stood up just an instant kill you can Crouch and take less damage I can get prone avoid it completely yeah it's like the AP mines in five four five yeah I mean I'm pretty good reaction tobe spawn right here movie yeah monster chrome fact broke look for the respawn areas there you go around the back of the house

was guarding up with the broken machine sorry sorry about that I'm ready yeah good to go I'm searching what the little dog oh it's so adorable what's up Don how you doing ah fie McGregor avid watcher first time I've ever asked a question have you tried using aim trainers like csgo aim training I did back in the day yeah I used to do a lot of that stuff when I play CS competitively but not really anymore I don't bother with it anymore and I just used the same sensitivity in every game if I can which is my old couch strike sense Shabba Dabba do man this game brings back some pub G vibes yeah it does is the UMP in this game Mac it's not called the UMP I think it's called the striker 45 it looks like the UMP but I don't know if they've got like licensing issue and they can't call it that maybe the striker 45 is just a different weapon entirely but I think it's the UMP Oh Dark Stranger how you doing [Applause] Luke Swanson what's up from Nebraska how's it going man [Applause] and p7 is just the base oh good [Applause] what's the CEO done Prabhu how's it going man Tyrell do I like the mp7 better than the mp5 to be honest with you that's the first time I've really used the mp5 so I couldn't tell ya I feel like that situation that I was in there maybe the mp7 would have perform better because there was a bit more range but I don't know it it's all about your playstyle and where you're fighting isn't it because the mp5 up close just shreds people in the main game I mean that's the most central circle you could get [Music] little room okay little stroll through the promenade thro the hill's yes this is where you retire right by the other coast in Russia in a war zone in a war zone but you've got guns everywhere good Doge hope they didn't know if the growl don't think the

dog Oh Linus we've already added dog or take down Nouveau so what type of music do you like jack I like all sorts of music nervosa I don't I'm not elitist when it comes to music I know some people just like one genre and then that's all they like and that's fine that's their preference if it sounds good I'll listen to it all sorts a pop EDM rap classical music pop music rock every metal also it's fun you know variety is the spice of life I do have a Spotify playlist with some of my favorite songs on it's got like 80 songs on there but I can't play that on youtube because it gets copyright strikes [Applause] possibly folly are you doing a and we've talked about the recall on the mp7 earlier look it just goes pretty much open to the right so it's very easy to control it you just pull down into the left slightly and you could get a really nice tight recall pattern like that that's why it's one of the best guns in the game I think because it's so predictable very easy to control I know that versus that huge difference [Music] unlike a trip downtown stud downtown I have to get the snipers on rooftops [Music] what's up shadow my favorite brick to watch on YouTube love your videos and your friends beds as well thank you shadow that's very kind you man going hey Benjamin I'm doing well thank you we've got quite a few coming though from Queens New York on the brave captain dragon gaming what do you use for the ax 50 i wouldn't typically go for the x 50 in war zone you seem almost too confident stud but if I do I would put attachments that give range and deep damage no no no I'm never trying to scare you like I I think you can get the monolithic suppressor on the x v there like you definitely want that it's right he seems to be missing an awful life I did not come with you when you do these [Music] as towards the Oh me or not yeah into the B maybe find a weapon first into the beam the beam the beamers yeah the penis oh the Boomers the 50000 cheaters that used to live there m'kay - this is not a good gun for war zone I think we have to risk it it's not much to look over this end let's do it for a rich table skip oh yeah don't lie rich see that's he boring oh it's such a good dunking biscuit okay all good for a dunk yeah I just heard a door open to my son right I had some chocolate Hobnobs Almighty yesterday blood to Yale Tom Doug yeah sorry to do that to you well the best biscuits has got to be an Oreo though I mean is it a biscuit though I don't know there is it by cake I love Oreos definitely not a cake [Music] we'll call it this year now I believe

that long range really I'm gonna die don't die don't no don't you said to this by station yeah you yes boys more boys oh the brief on this very funny yeah they're on that roof yeah oh they have on a roof on the yellow roof are they covering the bike gonna try and get that or not they can't see the bike it can't see the by their on the police station yeah you seen him yeah him a couple of times once I know that's for sure one on one on ba ba coolies make back oh why can you not get up there yeah I only saw one guy so I'm a box for us [Applause] huh he's left different team different team I think maybe because I was shooting his teammate I don't know what's going on I think you scared him and he panics Oh No heavy chopper was very wet are the guys on the left side broke his armor I'm jumping my - cover my cast someone by the name my name is whirling where's your cash we go this guy yeah I'm never doing was the very um I'm fulfilling but hey DRI his last number huh careful I may have heard another set for citizen okay I'm at the police station for a refill [Applause] is anyone else need to do some play some even cook by ceremony place there are dogs pasta I've got the souks drawn what you want to use the ones I have Jack yeah sure thanks boys boy yeah understood okay you have a baby girl that's probably the boy kind of heading for everybody might be perishing long boy thank you for the five yeah he's gone you think the new modern warfare 2 remastered gunplay is better or worse I think it's worse I I don't think it's as good heading in but I played it on psi on who you do see I can't compare it directly on where we landed above us thank you for becoming a member there's guys behind us holding Mouse wonder stud I was a baby like an inn sounded like it this game needs a rail man Barbie I'd be so fun all that rail gonna be a for was the one yeah yeah then they nerfed and it became useless I know cuz it broke down there and then you couldn't even shoot it was one of the weapons for the gun game so you'd get stuck on it yeah when you killed the hair my god I remember that easily gonna win this one oh it's the rail good yeah yes I'll die I've got this bounty do you need RPGs yeah if you got if you could draw that one thank you contract there we go run a popper you do we have one I thought we used Australian well yeah I wasn't sure funny you guys got one I wish I could see on the bar what you have like just say gas mask three and I thought there was a door there's no if you could press escape like FX does for tab mmm just to expand that information air behind yeah they're like here but well maybe on the top of that building didn't even know there was a window there they're apparently left of that building yeah and that's what I think I could be useful moving potentially away more to his fire station anymore prime location is the station in there at fire station now yeah they probably run it from the threat that's gonna increase need their self advice yeah take this home maybe see one on the mini-map I think we should push him oh it's a haze Daisy you see him in the top and it broke God's perfect the perfect one - [Applause] then that's - let's go see that's up here as well like in this run seven a jhanjhar is the one box john Camarena the Guayana yeah thank you for becoming a new member wait was there oh my god Matt I think so underside body it was there's disappearing that's what it was oh good yeah I like it got taken by one of me it looked like one of the ghillie suits going prone when it went down no wait if you're the last person to take it then it disappears like that so far they died yeah it's all right got c4 back but once they get gonna get wrecked by the circle and we're gonna be running through urban areas surely not it's a vehicle on my left yiii unless we take the 105 station the truck is the truck at least would take one hour here zolly a blue a blue car can take one RPG it just disables it can it yeah okay we still take drug baron yeah trucks out there yeah but it's a truck yeah disabled after one know how quickly you can reload RPGs you're basically dead anyway if you don't get out yeah he's our driver I can you're the only one with a license Todd that's great should get place when we can and the other but could I buy for other stuff hey are you gonna be in this basin I think do we drive past them or run them all over and die who's run them all over store oh they movies are they in a vehicle or cuz they jumped by a lot then maybe Emmy yeah yeah do we want to get set central circle it's best we can maybe mm-hmm I can see him on mini-map now I know where yeah yeah they were in that sucker over there in that Jeep there's a jeep further along my over there now I think this could be a good one for us the guy behind us as well and that was then you know he's not racing any problem with that place the flankin ink yeah beer free is amazing right it's great so we have three is a timeless game it really is so good oh just not no no it does that it's just stops driving he isn't inside the vehicle time in antibiotics inside the vehicle at all times what's up water how you do it

additionals here you are the best YouTube but well I don't know about that no yes plates out somewhere I'm currently a live streamers so it doesn't count [Applause] and it's subjective as well isn't it like everyone likes different things there are some people who probably watch me and think oh I hate that guy you know different strokes for different folks and all that I'll tell you what guys I watched absolutely then coming back to you stud I watched a crazy movie last night called the lighthouse if you want him if you want to watch something that's a bit messed up that's the one it's by the guy I think he's called Robert Eggers he also made a movie called the witch which I really likes a horror movie but he's new movies the lighthouse has got Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe in it

you beside it I had this exact same vehicle in blackout didn't they remember again I did oh well it's when you go to the front yeah there you go look the Sun in the middle it's been bug testing now wait a QA see now we are it's been that's like battlefield wait both no dodging no shots enemies boss what's my favorite gun in war zone mp7 is definitely my favorite should we just done hide in lumber or should we find somewhere more central that's it Jill yeah didn't like me lobster that's what like pushes him over the edge I just like to you someones just like to you oh yeah I go here okay salad is raw faraway south okay Wow down the ladder here when you're at the second floor mines his mines in this video oh I'm afraid you'll only get that reference if you've seen the light house by the way mine's on some of the doors it's not that's not a halo spawn there is it it's on a ridge just right here [Applause] the blades are moving as well landed on there right Janna misfired nice life Anderson yeah he's got Joker laughs it was the Russian Chad just strafing belong the roof with his giant rocket launcher sounds like a Chad thing today what color tracksuit was wearing he had the the blue and white stripes and cause that's traffic on drone it's a staple he's in recon drone I miss my Shawn him right so the heli has no one around it we're pretty much good Oh two guys in there three guys in that building I swear the Chad was a chance you just pick the door there there's no one in this town oh there's one guy in this train carriage there oh it's a vehicle there you go he knows I'm looking at him run across tagged hey on ladder down there he's driven off in a vehicle now there you go they're gonna fight each other I think these two squads are you sure yeah okay they're running into the building that they're in oh I'm a broke on that one right one push right okay watch out cuz we could get flanked here yeah I've got mines on some of the doors recorder ever wearing any warning why just spilled your beans go and grab my explosive just in case someone does push we got time though I did check the area right they shouldn't be able to push upstairs without us knowing about it but mm-hmm I could have got a very easy ID shot and I go up the ladder I had seen The Vanishing not the lighthouse I'm not seeing the vanishing acts actually a sonar thank you for the Syria it's very kind ye mp7 with silence that the sound is so good Henry's yeah it's very good a marrow thank you very much for the $20 sub reverse very kind and Boaz for the 60 euros dude love the stream what do you think can be improved in war zone doesn't it when you're in the road what do I think could be improved in this game I think the footsteps need to be way louder it feels like sometimes they just don't play all I think loadouts need to be a bit more expensive maybe 10,000 I think some of the rocks when you're trying to climb up like they need to be fixed like sometimes it's like impossible to climb up rocks and stuff what else man I want more like weapons in the loot table but apart from that I think it's a really good fun I just hope that they update it regularly changed the map introduced new weapons and things to do new contracts it's got it's got a lot of legs yeah you remember where Russian Chad was he's still there sniping it yeah well I might tagged in brokers Alma can you wall back now yeah you can you can which one of us is gonna get lucky then it's probably prone is me yeah so I'm thinking any would have me Oh Holly Holly what's he doing it's not apply he's not bowed before we get him I'm sorry mad lad just spray it spray it bright lights in the side I don't know with a heli the stunt pilot what's our plan for the future let's think again think it here temporarily until the next own and use the cover that's alright can we get a mortgage then invest in some stocks and shares maybe put some money in a pension every year yeah I'm down for that you made the annoys me lick of paint and you give me the details you know he spied there solo okay some of that pink is completely wrong it was there sorry at that wall vehicle truck mini-map are we gonna move out of here now he's gone though we should go now yeah yeah he's coming east away still around he's two stops right here again as people on the on green I saw him in a farm and well there's the truck up in Europe okay it's just one guy chard is one guy unless his ghost solo Chad he's a solo Chad it's gonna move in a second he's out zone or he has already moved by says he's above us I don't like staying in the same building for too long yeah the acceleration on those things is insane it's crazy and that's something else I'd like to see changed in this game I think the trucks need less health and you should be able to shoot the driver more easily because in solos everyone just drives around in a truck and just like bumps into each other it's really weird there may be no if the HP of the vehicles a bit not too much gonna be ruined by the next one and we have to run across the open we got smokes I have one and one okay nice to have two if we go now maybe we're need him really where that was not really any nice cover what's in this area John Green and a guy do working in another one in the truck on the drop it only took me four shots Tom oh well I managed to get the guy in the back of the truck while the guy who was driving it and I think you kill this teammate you just you like then ya find us behind us start out gonna flank left oh my god that's them c4 easy play more play more you get in did I hit me to one in front of me here guys down in this one I think I'm sad on me I'm low I'm Oh guys I've got no I'm over ago he's in the smoke about gas line you guys got any

same bit of cover I'm alive I'm keeping the heads down or trying to and he won't got any spare place no no okay he has to run as well remember is the only seven that wait yeah yeah when is that I think it's one of the Russian Chad do it bounce no something white Oh lovely Jack uh have you guys got any more ar mo dropping now Thanks we run for his body we yeah I think we maybe push for bus no no no no it's done gone it's gone okay being a bit more passive though cuz we've got no place now I do have a gas mask I've got to borrow it wasn't it yeah it's done it pick Y up ed can we get to the boy station you think already the squads over there mark mark Jack Jack as founded before he s like running somewhere and it with my eyes done meant boys he's behind that chief right in front me the airstrike on our brother yeah start myself rows pushing you there pushing you odd I'm down again I said I'm looking to do a previous fight screwed us in there yeah it really did hey I mean you don't often see a precision airstrike end game by that as well that was clutch I was a good one it lost all place in our previous engagement and the guy we killed that none of them am I just first place second place not bad yeah no bio Fiji's how did we do then not bad I mean not that ending was really really sticky for us cuz we had to cross that open area Tommo and staad lost their plates and i got killed by the airstrike happens you got win a morning Sulley that's not the hourglass is the RAM seven I was using then Isaiah how you doing was that Samuel for Gera 227 minute q what for you to get on this game you cannon that's crazy I would just try and relog in again that doesn't sound right to me I want die donate 6 pound do you have hope for battlefield 5 ah man I'm not optimistic about battlefield 5 to be honest with you I feel like if I was if I was dice I would want to just focus on the next game now because they've got more time to make it and with the next gen consoles you know it could be really big for them if they get it right but bf5 it's just had so many problems I don't know if it could make a comeback at this point to be honest with you the Pacific was really good but then they just kind of undid all that with ttk 5.2 you know it just ruined it and there's been no new content for ages I think with what's happened as well and everyone having to work from home I think that's definitely going to have a big effect on future content for the game I'm sure we might see a couple more new maps maybe some new guns but that's it I'm not expecting like a bigger expansion pack or anything and I'll you know what I would rather that they focused on the next Battlefield game because they've said that there is one coming out fiscal year 2022 and that means they've got so much time to work on it so you would hope that that will be full of content and it won't be as buggy but we'll see you know only time can tell but for bf5 no I'd it's gonna be really hard to maintain the player base I'm sure they'll be fine especially on console but yeah it's it's got a long it's got a big hole to claw its way out [Applause] [Applause] wait Louie you've got 914 minute wait you serious but that's got to be bugged that's crazy [Music] a Simon what's up I love about full five but with war zone on the market I just don't see a reason to go back yeah I mean this game is so many battlefield moments my HD game and what's up man how you doing mad that you're online with the blizzard connection issues is there a problem at the moment I did start playing like two hours ago so maybe I just got lucky and got in before I had no problem thanks you'd go bones then or maybe no bones on it let's go bones on all right it's got bones on yeah all right so there must be a problem then there must be a login bogus on then there's no way the queue is 600 minutes I can't be right that's got to be a bug are they getting ddos Dave is that what it is what's three or four squads come on with us oh yeah we've got one on the right there yeah there ahead of me - I couldn't I don't think I can even get to the scavenger box before they can yeah they've swam out of it okay

sir brief a cleave archit there on the roof left of the ATC down low yellow building or the white one why one it just looks like ice cream guys on my game like it doesn't load in the LOD I think you if you moved 10 meters in front of where you are you'll see it this looks like a triangle it's made the cave there outside arrived gasps about to run out of here I can hear a sniper high up the hill as well fighting this guy's gonna panic now oh I just got absolutely big round even see the knife is bad he's dead he's dead then I got one down across the way okay it's a revolver oh you know how it

building Jack into the building we don't know if we don't need to fight this I'm gonna push gone obsess down in it there's another one start you over you're there he just let me just on of me got him clear yet we're clear I'll play instead give you I don't let me get the Scully boy though died down to our north he was on the hill you need plates jack I've got to I've got five I can drop some noise right you need to try and take this bill than if you can't I wasn't saying I I didn't I mean you pretty much clutch that then start well played hey it's night that buy an e vrv miss I'm inside we need to move then we love the vehicle as well it's coming to beamed and they're pushing us for some reason they're looking straight for my pelvis my building what the hell oh why don't you get it why [Applause] if they die stud no they're just running around left okay they go you kidding me this one behind me no way what was that guys still doing in the gas Ted that was crazy I was very stressed by that one I mean they did us their dinner yeah we got did one more fool oh yeah yeah well that was unfortunate the problem that I had with that fight from a personal standpoint was that I had no situational awareness because I've been brought back in that's one thing that I struggle with in games it's if I'm new to a situation especially in about a rail game I I struggle to keep tabs on where everyone is I mean that got a bit chaotic at the end right but I I was just gonna play it sneaky and hopefully the guys in front didn't see me I was nearly in the zone but unfortunately I didn't check my six campsite yeah you're right I just assumed that because I'd been in the gas for so long there wouldn't be anyone behind me but as some shoes get you killed can you show the attachments on that mp7 yeah I've not been really using it I mean I didn't get any kills with it and but that's my mp7 build I think that's the best build for it in warzone the store is currently unavailable yeah and a lot of people can't even get on the game right now and can't like if you restart you'll be stuck in a queue that is over a thousand minutes long yeah yeah some people in my child saying there's like a 1200 minute queue to login yeah I can't be ridiculous I ain't restarting to find out no one else can get on the game at the moment some guy said yeah CMD poles she felt Oh 2200 minutes that's not too bad actually I think it is it's worse I think we got lucky we did I'm right is it just before it broke by the looks of it the solution is to swap regions our brownie right there you go guys if you watching and you can't get on try swapping regions 2200 and then it waits on [Applause] what's up Sam Witwicky from Transformers right how's it going with Optimus Prime have you sided with the Decepticons now looks and has at 1,300 minute cue a Dulles why is the ax 50 better than the HDR um I actually prefer the HDR I think the h scale is way better for war zone cuz it's got a faster bullet velocity I think it seems in a bit faster as well I prefer the Scopes on it too I know that the ax 50 has a faster cycle rate so it actually has a slightly faster rate of fire but I think in war zone that doesn't really matter that much for bolt-action snipers so I would always use the HDR in war zone personally based on the stats you know I've seen all the stats through I'll try and go mp5 this game is that's one of the other new loadouts that I wanted to try so cool um oh that's gonna end up in the water yeah do you feel it or downtown yeah get on a roof yeah that's one thing that our happiness in this BR I think it black out that both than me and it was right down the middle of it I guess no need for a boat though if you don't have that river like what's the point yeah cuz the dam is another game actually had a flowing river where this one has just like a dry aqueduct didn't they do a thing in that where the dam broke and it flooded the level in blackout they did it up day forever yeah remember that it changed the map like most the map was flooded I saw the they did like a Asylum one with the zombies hmm as unlimited respawns wasn't it wasn't quite BR I thought blackout was great fun I lay that was I played it for quite a bit but I think it kind of died off what an old it they did enough okay too fast enough yeah live events and a time stuff the time to kill Nick was quite long as well there was here I think maybe that put off a lot of cod players also not for you to play not stand alone yeah I've really done a great job of this game I'm pretty sure you you up you do go faster going sideways in your parachute it tells you your speed though yeah if I go sideways to go slower five speed goes down if I go sideways Mythbusters let's go I'm just a visual thing looks faster your hair is very like it seems fine for me oh yeah you're right plates were really strong in blackout it was so I mean they're pretty strong in this as well but in black eye in particular you could repair them couldn't you right you don't find the contracts up on that roof I think there's on earth so a ladder anyway okay and then there's any stairs I worry that if for a capi flag [Music] [Applause] my name is Cappy [Music] oh it's right next to JJ Sam you went from 1,200 to 20 minutes in two minutes so you actually logged in after two minutes I suppose you just have to wait maybe Todd I'm gonna give you a gold star for that if you look outside I've actually delivered it this is the Aries he's made one what do I get with the atoms a gold star lollipop and all on parents evening I'll make sure that I tell you mom and dad you're a good student amazing yeah I helped stolen I forgot the experiment some chadley how you doing okay almost forgot then what we're playing with war zone so
