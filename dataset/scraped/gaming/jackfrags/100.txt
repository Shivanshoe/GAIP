the hell gust it does look very hell gas doesn't it okay this looks like it might be functioning now so that's good it reset has it yeah the the engines are no longer scuffed in all regards oh wow there you go i mean can you walk around this there's a lot no not the whole city there is something like there is a lot you can walk dude that's nuts we won't go too fast through the city i don't think so what could happen if you do we'll just crash and die oh no one's just gonna start shooting at us no i mean this looks incredible it is running at about 30 fps though landing on here and if you want have a look around landing gear engaged i think this is is this illegal i think it's fine to park here isn't it open the ramp just don't don't fall i mean it's guaranteed isn't it yeah yeah i see helmet here oh my god you can wipe your visor careful i can't move properly man yeah i'm really slow for some reason is that the wind blowing us right on the edge now tom oh we're out ready we can go in here oh my god oh it's a pickup there's a drop off and pick up point that's it god imagine if this was a completely playable space like uh you could just explore it and fight in it i just want to jump off and parachute you know i'm just going to see what's there i would absolutely not advise jumping off careful i mean you can walk around than that but obviously you can't go in any of the buildings you can walk around the streets and everything but what you can go down there yeah you can walk around there's just nothing to see there's nothing to do there all right like there's no all the like shops on that are inside districts you have to go to looks like a castle up there as well on the hill yeah there's some places cool all right i want to go to the pool and go on the metro to

any human nah you'd be right would you i mean well it trains pretty quickly i think it's this quick well no it's quite difficult to control [Music] i can't believe it yeah it's certainly certainly the speed of the vehicle um can i revive you or anything no i need to come back really and find my body don't i ah you had a terrible accident you want to do a mission travel to microtech and locate the infiltrated 890 jump what is that is it a ship yeah the 890 jump has been intercepted at microtech and boarded by outlaws the first project we clear all outlaws as quickly as possible so that a recovery team can be dispatched to return ship to the owner the longer the outlaws have control of the vessel the higher the chance that we lost so recommend you acquire a team this outing to expedite matters though someone's ship's been hijacked sounds like a clean sweep that he's the end easy out i'm not very trained for this jack we'll just have to wing it like we're always there we're careful because we need to leave oh my god all right to the spaceport you are cleared to launch are we going we're off by new babbage thanks for the bike ride that killed us both yeah i really enjoyed that

enemy down here all right i'll come with you there's two got ways yeah two dead i think the other one bled out in the corner that's a teammate oh right i've got crime stat that's the security i didn't even kill him dead oh just because she shot at him that's and that's crime stop found yeah i know he is dead see he's a friendly i think he's pointing his gun at us son he's aiming at me i know he's taking cover i don't think they're going to shoot us yeah they're not shooting so they must be through here i've been shot from behind they're in the elevator i just got shot no tom they're just

feeling he's mincing around oh i've been shot he's at the top here i got him don't die you kill him we got him nice mission accomplished 22k for that jack is that a good amount of cash i think so for for a little mission isn't it obviously you could do it on your own and get 45 but it splits it right a successful mission tom it wasn't successful let's get back to the drake oh we can just go look we'll have to fly out won't we oh hellos look cool yeah that is an awesome show look at it crazy luxury liner mental oh am i upside down yeah get in oh [Laughter] tom we've got a bit of a conundrum here haven't we because you killed that innocent man you've got a crime stat so can i accept the bounty on your head and just kill you and then i get the cash and you'll lose the crimes that go to jail yeah basically just go i'm just gonna go store my ship and all my stuff and set my spawn point and then we'll do it find and neutralize tommy rage well i think you know exactly where i am well you want me to do it now now god no we're gonna go on one of your ships and you're gonna fly me out and do what you need to do okay then you can log out on your ship you can just go to click the bed and click log out this is easier than doing the whole like crypto card thing that we did last time right uh yes and i'd have to get a crypto card i'd have to go to one of the places faff around yeah i'll get it i get it literally never seen this before it looks like it's got guns on the front that's cool can you get into the ship wait oh no let me inject let me in open door it's so scuffed there's no room tom yeah i think this is like a single person ship is that okay i know i can lie down it's fine here we go look i'm just waiting [Music] where do you want to go just go out just go pat out a bit until we've got the guns activated and you can kill me guns are activated now all right um well jack let me stand up you're just gonna go out into space um but you don't have a suit on does that matter wait i can't stand up you know you have to kill me you have to get a gun out and kill me what just while you're in my ship yeah okay i didn't deserve this we did a good mission any last words hits [Music] i can't shoot you okay wait i can go up wait what wait what you've disappeared wait what you've disappeared jack i'm in space where all you did was stand up where are you tom oh you're on top tom i'm on top of the ship quickly shoot me with you shoot me with the lasers in the car of the ship hold on i'm incapacitated no i can't see my body wait it's too fast i can't see you i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead so i didn't get the bounty then no because i killed myself i tried to step so i love it i'm in prison now where i belong good good good [Music]
