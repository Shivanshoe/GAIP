today we're taking a look at the stoner or is it the stoner i don't know but it's another gun with a weird name that i don't know how to pronounce and this gun is easily one of the best to come through from the cold war integration and i wasn't too keen on it originally but i leveled it up yesterday and westie said try it out with the cavalry lancer barrel and as if by magic it's very good for warzone and a great wingman for a sniper or an smg it really surprised me actually how powerful it was so here's the build that i went for that seemed to work great but you will have to level it up to get some of those later attachments totally worth it though in those 120 rounds before you have to reload go a long way in sustaining continuous beam like fire the bullet speed is very fast on this thing so it's quite easy to shoot targets further away when you have to lead a bit i'm playing here today with study tactical brit and westy we had some brilliant games the teamwork and comms was on point and also watch out for those flick shot spr sniper headshots yeah it's not hitscan anymore like it used to be when it was bugged but it is still one of the best what's dog water by the way i hope you guys enjoy this if you do leave a like subscribe for more let's get it on the roof looking at roof now don't see him i don't know nice jack that's the guy we've down like seven times i think
