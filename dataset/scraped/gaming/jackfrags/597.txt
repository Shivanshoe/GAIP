today i've got an absolute bang of a warzone game for you and i think it's the best game of war zone that i've played so far it's definitely got the highest kill count that i've had in a solo match and there were just some really interesting fights and scenarios here the gun that i'm using in my loadout later on is the ram seven this is how i've got it built do not sleep on this gun it's an absolute monster especially in solos and you'll beat almost every other gun except maybe the foul that you come up against it's amazing trust me with that said if you like the video guys leave a like and subscribe if you want to see more thank you that's a great way to support me so let's get into it sit back relax and enjoy there's another guy as well right next to me somewhere rytek look at this i enjoyed that one i'm gonna get killed by someone hiding in a corner come on watch the skies [Music] no you all right in the middle of the pitch loving it where the hobby sensor where is it give it to me i need it now i want to see the heartbeat i don't care if you don't have a heart to be the dal what you keep saying for narnia in the chat what does that even mean i don't know what narnia is but i mean what year is it 2001 like they're not narnia movies are just that's dead isn't it like narnia's done look how slow this zooms in ah guys hold on there's a target here let me just yeah oh there actually was yeah i could just spend the entire day here this is great don't try and drop shot in warzone it doesn't work okay it works sometimes i admit it works sometimes a few moments later ten thousand years later three million years later one eternity late okay that guy's gone it's below me yeah it definitely improved the footsteps yeah this stadium is sick on i've done such a good job with it oh this site sucks is that guy just gone to that buy enemy uav overhead enemy uav overhead did you have a gas mask yeah you did hey look everything's fine i need recon on my position everything turned out better than expected this guy up here on that building there was in that building right there oh man you probably heard me uav is out of fuel returning to resupply it's fine 50 remain cast again i'm not taking that [Applause] you can stay there come on you gotta go what are you doing i'm waiting for you what was that bullet about then i don't like that that screams hacker that does just a random bullet that came my way then all right there's a guy up there all right okay hopefully i can uh count this and go don't shave me don't shoot me don't shoot me it's fine it's fine don't head shot me just don't hedge on me as long as you don't hit me in the head it's fine just please don't hit me in the head okay it's fine there's a guy there this guy above a guy there somewhere you see forward my quad bike kind of in a bit of a bad position here because that sniper is still there on the right it's fine it's fine watch out for that sniper he's still there i think yeah i guess he is did you have m4 p90 i don't like this i can't forget to use that airstrike either because that could be really useful i don't know why that dude pushed didn't have to push watch the skies all right mate and there was a sniper out there still i don't know where that car 98 shot went by the way that i fired because it was right on him it just didn't didn't connect for some reason we could just be patient for one second before we see where the next circle's going and then i can make up a plan figure out where to go oh man those buildings twins is looking good right now but twins has got a repel now so it's not as defensible anymore respawns are off now so if i die i'll die that's a bush there's always a bush that looks like a player isn't there or someone right here okay so i think that's that little excursion gone these guys don't ax-50 okay i'll take target areas okay he's putting c4 on the stairs now this is a really bad position to be ideally i'd like to have been on one of these twin buildings right now there's a guy there there's a guy with right shield there oh man this sucks i don't get caught in my gas mask animation either this yeah i know someone in here can they get to the roof i think they can right i can get around the back here if i want so i do have an out just going to play this really sneaky as sneak as i can this is quite a good angle here this should be in this cover unless there's someone in this building you just in a here of plates there i could get only five left okay come back to me circle come back to me oh no it just it just gets smaller in this game mode oh oh this is bad this is bad i kind of want to be in the building so that's where they all are none of them have got ghosts they really all in the building look at this look at this they're all in the building all right they're fighting this is good one left i think he's above me trying and stay as central as i can i think he's right above this is coming down to the wire he's outside it's a mask off yes oh my god jeez i i need to know what my heart rate is right now i need i need to know because that is that is an insane game right there that is a crazy crazy crazy game oh man i think that's the best game of war zone i've ever played honestly i think that is the best game of war zone i've ever played [Music] i'm so happy that i won that theory dude that is a book clencher if i've ever seen one [Music]
