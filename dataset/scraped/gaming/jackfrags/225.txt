the f2042 beta has finished we're jumping back into warzone new season a couple of new things to check out also i've become a panda i've got a little panda backpack not the most discreet skin i have to say but i just wanted to be a panda for the day you know so apparently the crates you know those things that are making noises all right these are supposed to be the bunkers the world war ii bunkers and it goes all the way down [Applause] do i hear someone i think i did what skin was that i don't recognize that skin enemy soldier they got the iron cross there too if they are they change the ui as well you see how it's kind of black now right here so it turned out that the noise is just that big drill up there i guess it was just drilling down into the ground well i've looted everything now so no point staying down here if i can actually propel her hopefully there's no camping here nope that'd be a really good spot to camp though i think we're clear that's shooting a attack rover down here in that building i kind of like the ground loot now as well they they uh they appear to have changed it most of the builds are pretty decent oh never forget the ffar recall nothing was stupid broken way too long way way way too long i finally caved in and watched squid game on netflix everyone was talking about it and i just thought yeah okay and i watched it with the um english subtitles are you the guy hunting me oh my god i don't know maybe you're the one hunting me my jeep just pulled it yeah i was a bit dubious about watching it with the subtitles but they're not really good this dude's coming up the stairs they've mollied why didn't that do more damage i think it just hit the roof okay you're just gonna come up right that wasn't the bounty though [Applause] that's another different guy but the guy that's hunting me must be in the building because it's a triple triple threat hmm what shall i do whatever stalemate to be honest i'm just going for loadout i don't think they've got an angle on here and the bounty thing will take a while to update them [Applause] man the mac tenders just doesn't hit the same like he used to ow [Applause] this guy i'm sick of him i'm just gonna face him he's dying already final boss just being the final boss that dude was so annoying just really wanted the bounty thank you for the gusmas yes quick game was really good if you do watch it though where are you going if you do watch it i'd advise be advised watch it with the subtitles and i have the original korean audio you just really kept driving towards me because i uh i played the first episode with the english dub and it's not it's not great so yeah i'd advise uh get the subtitles on whatever your language is and leave the original audio in because you get a lot of the actors emotions coming through you know hang on what that just dice please come on i can't get out the window yeah did not just make the armor break sound but it didn't do the armor hit marker where are you going [Applause] hello little rose getting there this guy is really scared like they've not even peaked once moved away as well oh my god the game is just screwing me today i can't jump over anything trying to get this bounty i think watching squid game as well finally got my butt into gear and uh i watched another korean movie called train to busan he was right there shouldn't i miss that target maybe that wasn't the wisest decision there they've got ghosts as well so i can't even see him on the uav you know trying to busan was great really enjoyed that cried several times zombies on the train is all you need to know lots of uh [Applause] looks like tension firefight right here i've gone down here did i just see him there behind that they're here what oh [Applause] he's right there you're kidding me [Applause] just let me live thank you [Applause] what are you doing out there huh see him behind the rock that is some random position right there this is what solo has become i've got a runner i feel like i could easily kill this player because they're not like they just run away they've either got goats thought they've moved [Applause] i'm not sure about this graph it feels alright but doesn't seem to oh my god game just stop yeah it doesn't seem to really pack that much of a punch apparently you can get different um ammo ties for it though this is a joke look at this please another one here go away mate you'll get the thumbs down sorry i'm so annoyed by those rocks just i swear if the new warzone map has rocks that you can't climb up i'm gonna i'm gonna be really upset but i'm gonna buy a load out here and get ghosts because end game i think you really need it we've got 14 other players left there's a truck behind me and there's an attack rover up there i hate trucks in solos i know they've reduced i mean they did reduce the amount of them but you know you see him occasionally what's this guy now all right they're just gonna wait at the edge i'm gonna push that because i feel like i should clear out this guy did no one shot there so probably the only one here don't hear any footsteps just lying there the big chunk is in his natural habitat this is a bit dodgy probably people in there maybe in the red as well going on bait could be a good spot say one of those houses mate what are you doing there safe zone relocated that would have been a pretty nasty surprise for that guy i think [Applause] i'm close to that house because if there's someone in there they're gonna have to move happy maybe i went a bit too early there there's a little sliver of this building that's in i'm gonna wait here for a sec three targets remain there's one okay let's come to me again i could stay i don't see anyone on that right side just in case oh damn i think i'm good to push [Applause] oh maybe not oh oh i'm an idiot that's my poncho aggressive play there that's a good shot to be fair i just wanted to get that finished i thought it was clear on the right i thought yeah i swear i checked it should have just stayed shouldn't i oh man never mind let's see if this dude wins that kill me mark target for airstrike oh nice shot again is that it yeah he's got the dub well played oh i'm such a dummy like why i was just going for the kill trying to think about the content rather than winning the game oh well i'm still gonna post this anyway you know it's a good return back to the game i mean season six just just a couple new guns some map changes that's about it really i'm looking forward to the halloween event though that's gonna be good and then the next big thing is obviously the the new map some people reckon that's going to be end of november december and that's probably right as always guys thank you so much for watching and if you buy anything like the new battle pass or skins whatever it might be consider using my code jack frags in caps and i'll get a bit of kickback from that that's all for today guys if you enjoyed the video leave a like subscribe for more i'll see you next time [Music] you
