hi everyone and welcome to some more battlefield 5 live gameplay commentary the last video actually did really well I was quite surprised apparently you guys still want to see the f5 so I thought I'd jump on again and play one of those maps there I'm gonna really cover that much bit a little bit but not that often and today of course as you can see it's Panzer storm I've gone for a condo yet I fancy doing some long-range sniping and someone over there where are you there you are a line of those headshots I'm sure there was another guy there is afk maybe Karn ITA I think it is the best long range you're an enemy I think it is the best long-range sniper but again maybe duck next time I'm glad that I could help rebuild your head by patting you on the shoulder a few times look it's fine it's there I'm glad that you guys enjoy this kind of stuff oh my goodness that's the problem with planes you don't even hear it coming you just delete it instantly quanta gone thank you for the rest as I was saying I'm glad that you guys enjoy watching this but bf5 isn't really again that I play that much anymore but I don't mind hopping on it every now and again you know there are some good qualities to this game in my opinion is there any heads that I can blow off here just waiting there usually there is oh there's a head we can blow off see what I mean they're always there that's one thing I remember about this map it's my V boys I love it and love this war crazy support on the videos by the way recently like I'm so grateful for everyone always tunes in comes back and watches that's some great support I like you guys a lot you know it's it's cool I've come back to D because it would appear that this is where everyone is and it is definitely it's definitely quite battlefield those Tigers hang so huge is that one bigger than normal it's nothing normally that thick I don't know that one just seemed excessively big I'm going crazy out it there's a little about there and my grenade go in the right place it did I think it would have killed them hey I can raise you it's fine don't worry everything's gonna be okay oh man they're really pushing this now on they're gonna move get a different angle here hello damn thought that was a head shot for sure I can hear someone what is that skin it's that weird Grim Reaper thing with the hood isn't it now where's this guy over here let's see what they've gone there found the head in the end oh man this is bad this is bad there's a lot of enemies around I don't think I needed to use my sniper there but make sure we get the job's done hello is someone here still care for small good idea is it a Russian man right here come for the rest I love this little Walther PPK think I'm in trouble now I'm gonna be running into the enemy should have picked up an SMG or something love lining the first headshots come on we're taking the point now this is good ow who was that right I can't repeat that shelled by a panzer 4 just chill it on the edge of the point you hate to see it you hate to see it what are you doing people look go far there is this Hank on the point if you look at the mini-map what's dictum Hey I think it did yeah I did put a couple of those in why not I don't think I've got to kill with this yet either maybe you want to use it on like operation undergrads is that how you gotta kill with this weird device oh nice bombs there let's have a look on the walls there we go now that's the flag that's a tiger tank yeah let's move for some reason be he's really busy right outside can I get to the top before they get me are they chasing me though throw it out down there I think there's so D down there hey you gotta kill got that why not I might get my first ever kill with this I kind of want them to come up are you coming up I can't tell I think so there's one anyone else smoke I can just about see through that it didn't really work very well up here the Lighting's kind of busted come on climb up I dare you I think a hero that's the same guy this is my tower boys I'm sorry this is my tower I'm great you still owe me now I'm a tank Sahir I am the lord of the tower oh I know nice shot you got his revenge well-played there is not a bomber I don't think I've used this plane oh let's crash my game that's not good I try not bomber and it just crashed my game I'll try and reconnect well I think the game was trying to tell me something then don't use planes especially ones that you haven't used before that was a full hard lockup crash they're in my task manager' the usage for bf5 was very high and he was taking up slack off of my memory so that did something really bad getting in that plane I wonder if it's like trying to build the shaders for the first time or something and it's just broken well I think this is a different server but it's a similar score so I'm gonna stay on this one spawn at a nobody there now the surface area of this flower is small although someone did just running through it there two pigs there damn it well the guy was kind of in the same spying in that building maybe [Music] a little dead they're all dead good dump and we get to hear that awesome music again I'll be working on a video actually where I talk about the soundtrack for this game because if there's one thing that bf5 got right it's the soundtrack there are so many absolutely gorgeous audio pieces in the sandra little bits here and there little stings various emotions that you can pick up on it's very good get out here because otherwise I'm gonna get murdered by tanks aren't I let's have a look that tank wants me oh it's a you shoot through that I don't know got his head on the reload I'd be annoyed I'd be annoyed at that that's the one up there I see an enemy Scout up ahead oh I thought that was a hit I'm sure there's one like here as well I almost didn't see that guy oh the car nice yes chip piece isn't it so satisfying the sniping in this game very good wasn't the headshot but still counts you all hear the sound this is bullets whizzing around everywhere people over a missed again someone's got my number now get my head down we can get these kills we can do this quick we reload where are they nice kills that's the guy they were shooting at me before no no don't oh you're friendly that's okay Arius trade kill yeah it was it was a trade kill I hate that hostile spotty oh that one wasn't a trade girl my friend got the revenge on the respawn oh yes that's so satisfying oh god hello I missed that one go ahead snipers got mine on but I had to fall back a bit there where are you where of this trench I think this trench is one of the ones that they added they changed the map quite a lot change the load of cover hello not gonna miss that one all that one there's another one here oh we are rocking boys we are absolutely rocking this but watch out for that vehicle what gun did you have I can't see it I kind of want to get that guy's gun whatever it is I'm cleared to flag there that was good where did that one go I'm sure I should have been a head shot guy is this good ridiculous I love it humor oh that sucks could be a lot of fun this map just concentrating on these three flags here see you DNA kind of running in between them snipers quite a Bible faster what did you have all the time to a we don't talk about the types way we don't talk about tanks either yeah get him hit him okay I've got friendly sights on top of it not quite sure what he was doing good of a distraction now I assume oh the tank battle I'm just waiting for someone to spawn on it I don't know they're gonna before the round ends come on hit it keep hearing it your bullets don't go through it no their artillery ring get as well artillery is that word artillery yang artillery is that even a word I don't know but that's gonna get us the victory I think we've done it that's a really fun to games scene as I crashed drop the GG in the chat gee I can't there we go GG well played not bad yeah enjoyed that pretty chill love that sniper very satisfying with that said I hope you guys enjoyed this let me know your thoughts down in the
