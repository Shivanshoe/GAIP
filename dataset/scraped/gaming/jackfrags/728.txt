just happened I think somebody tried to land on me yeah and I knocked him out you knocked him out by into the truck as soon as I got into the truck he landed on top of me and then it ran him over those guys are over here vehicles are so crazy in the game he'll be going to celebrity on z1 I know I just lived it up okay let's shoot out of that team so there's probably one more somewhere I will be pissed that's for sure so two are dead the home he's right behind me that's the last one on me he's dead right yeah thanks all right no pressure stone you gotta win it though can you go to that uh scavenger thing man just finish that yes never lost oh yeah Oh plus I do it on purpose of course but some other people win every once in a while we don't want everybody to quit the game ed ball thank you for the 15 did you get the gas mask on the guy that killed me I didn't loot him yes I got the gas - thanks all right sweet I love getting these when thoroughly because this is give you stand decently these search contracts right gonna get the lowdown we got them by station right here I don't like this area yeah I know this freaks me out I'll get that load out Connor okay I'm gonna grab some armored plates or something yeah sure thank you hmm I'm gonna try and grab this Jeep and I'll rally up oh man it got rid of my stopping power cuz I dropped my weapon oh that sucks if you pick it

don't remember where that gas mask was though it's an overhead oh trying to rest over man an amazing fire you're fine I wonder if you can do the old battlefield thing where you like jump out the car then the momentum can kill your teammates you know I don't know about that oh we tried that earlier oh did you because my character was glitched and I needed a push yeah it didn't work here lock up the other vehicle so ed thank you again for the 15 you've been watching since 2012 and after serving in the United States Marine Corps infantry even your call-outs when you take contact makes me wish you were in our squad well I mean playing video games I'm sure it's a lot different from the real thing right but thank you I really appreciate that how do you become a member so I think it's $5 to become a member I never asked people to become a member but if you do you get the soap icon and a few emotes and stuff like that it's a great way of supporting me thank you and Daniel thank you for the 21 and the big fan keep up the great work what's that broken how you doing Abbey McFly mp7 better than the algae I don't think it's got as much range but it's certainly fun to use up close like I'm just trying to make the most of it you know [Laughter] can you buy a UAV David unless you were to go on um here's a bio station here we're shut up myself res though oh I just saw somebody on the moon yeah ma'am you may be older a prison what are they oh okay that's interesting okay somebody was on our map to the west though do you want to go for them in the prison the bouncy or should we leave that it's gonna be quite a little rough yeah it's outside the gas as well soon I got a package coming down in the middle there yeah they're gonna have to move we can pinch them out yeah let's do that it's a good idea it's already coming in its the mod max : boy right here if you do flip it it will eject you out of the vehicle how's it it seems to just react to itself and come back on foot back over wait Katty I love the vehicles in this game another physics are a bit wack but it's really a little I don't know I enjoy riding on top of the cars to you they're just fun to drive around yeah I'm gonna get this a cargo truck if you want to take my Jeep no three vehicles deep here oh yeah why not no for sure let's go we can be his bodyguards Connor we must protect the truck at all

kill contract now let's focus on getting you in first I must run with that after there was a station there I don't know if it's risky outside of the zone because I think if you're if you respawn outside of the zone or you try to it randomly spawns you don't think we can get on that like on a song by the way yeah we have to go to the right I think [Music] so blurry when you drive there like it just adds this motion I don't like that I'm a kind of goes flying it's like on anyway oh oh how do we go yeah yeah oh there's no like this thank you no I'm out here right the wall here hold on I got

of destruction in this would be cool we were talking about this the other day like me and my friends um like this game write to me at least it feels like if battlefield 3 had a battle royale game because there's a lot of stuff in this game the you know you could do in battlefield 3 which was out in 2011 like parachuting shooting people with rock it's hitting vehicles using javelins c4 jeeps you know long-range snot Snipes all that crazy stuff TV he shot at me done so on the roof of orange sometimes it just kind of feel like sounds fearful battle 3 Royale booster down one like the last couple battlefield games Barfield 5 and 1 they haven't really allowed you to do that kind of stuff because of the type of gameplay in the time period I think maybe that's why a lot of people have gone off the F maybe recently and a lot of battlefield funds are playing this now because you can do that crazy stuff you know where its first date night yeah oh yeah just one in and I think you got out yeah you got up but did he go you say two of them two of them to him oh boy I meant to ping not shoot we can't there we go orange ping outside the building outside both right oh all right it's the

therefore the RPG get that a time scope UK lockdown isn't for lockdown is that what's happened Boris Johnson has done millions of Britain's with a momentous and tough lockdown announcement to tackle coronavirus stay at home will face a fine all shops apart from food stores and chemists must close immediately meeting friends will be banned one form of exercise a day is allowed lockdown will be enforced for three weeks following growing pressure in recent days from the government's top medical advisers and senior politicians for a lockdown well that's crazy nothing like this has ever happened before luckily gamers have been practicing this for years I'm where we've been practicing this for years it's easy we got this but this is what they're doing they're closing all shops selling non-essential goods including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries playgrounds and outdoor gyms and places of worship stopping all gatherings are more than two people in public excluding people you live with stopping all social events including weddings baptisms and other ceremonies / excluding funerals it is crazy like our lives are just gonna completely change despite mind a bond for he kills total challenge I don't know if we could get 40 I think we had 26 then [Music] Chaffin I don't think you'll find a girlfriend in this channel my friend sorry how you do demo you just want your first solo game critics right on where to lumber and farmland area yeah house boneyard for loot I can't remember bundles pretty good but it's messy Hales I think L Z's bad for this plane yeah let's do Hills okay it's got some good spots there [Music] coliseums coming in from italy it's been a while already yeah I've been seeing on the news man I hope you hope you holding in their crazy thiam's crazy crazy times are you guys in full lockdown mode where you live yet or not no no I am yeah I mean I could still go outside and you like and you know if I need to do something mmm it's not that crazy but like we can't have you know more than ten people or whatever in a bank and I like I went down to and I just went out for a walk and everybody you know just gonna stay away from each other and whatnot but yeah apparently like it's not learnt following the rules here so yeah they may start initiating a lockdown they've just done that in the UK like right now they're just announced it just now yeah yeah the Prime Minister did a speech full lockdown like everything that's non-essentials closing you can't go out any more than Greece to people unless you're like family it's crazy man yeah it's pretty wild what's going on okay so it's almost unbelievable it definitely is man I mean it's it's trippy everything's closed like the gyms the malls all that's closed I mean my normal one certain lifestyle is called quarantine so yeah you know that's definitely a strong way lifestyle choice it's definitely you know not a big adjustment let's just say that we're needing to make here yeah like what even is outside it's super weird I'll be geez - good I have to keep it but it is strange yes we could pull and get D load up do everything perfectly need some plates tech sure thank you oh yeah there you go you take that I'll buy some more here as well yeah I'll drop my money Oh or should I get a box the dogs get a box first take my money Stone armor down I'll get another armor if this bounce isn't in Spain we've been this way for a week my main your is in lockdown - wow that one how close are these guys these guys are not sure they must be somewhat far I swear like the audio is so messed up like you hear gunshots that sound like they're right next to you isn't what do you have your audio settings set - I think mine's home theater okay is that what you use no I use it the boost just normal boost does it kind of come from the audio mm-hmm some footsteps sound a little bit louder I've seen some people using like boost higher boost low as well I don't know all the complete difference is about it but yeah boosters seem to amp it up a little bit I think it depends on your headphones or your headset like minor have a height far more towards the higher frequencies mm-hmm so like boost low would probably work pretty well for me because I don't have a lot of base in my headphones that's pretty much what it does it focuses more like boost low would focus more on the low frequencies and then high is the higher frequencies it's all preference though you guys agree that there's a problem with the footstep oh dear oh yes yeah I see if anything good I would just be happy if they crank it up of course not one has like no dramas yeah it seems like it's random yeah I think it is random Oh team white on one guy I got the guy that was that the outhouses one just wait a second ground for orange yeah I heard him break glass he might've jumped out back no inside bread Gilly there's two there two there one run across the street to you David broke his arm around me the other ones inside hurt kind of got orange he's out by the ammo nice nice oh that looks painful thank you a lot of people here yeah a lot of cash is all perfect your

bought you some llamas late though it's done gracias right here I'm gonna go back up that way positive who leaves like the engines are always on these cars one likes so bad for the alarm yes I was there a little bit quieter I've seen a mom sometimes they still show up red even when you're not in it I don't know what triggers that - I've see four oh I have my throne as well we're here join us someone want to pick up my c4 then Joe alright how are you people oh you know what - Jack have you seen anybody putting c4 on the ATVs and then just driving them going you know letting them launch and then go throw up other classic battlefields go some classic battlefield on yeah oh it's super viable in this because when you get out you can go you can be going full speed and get out and the Jeep will just keep flying below it these guys must be a little far oh there's a loader drop uphill that means there's people down hill hmm if we see them we can just fall back real quick and then try to set it out so you think they'll be down there there's somewhere that low that was yeah I was told that they drop it drops between teams right so I don't know how directional that is yeah that's got a couple of a are rounds you could pause yeah you cannot Bowl mash-off dropped a couple you bomb full you wanna keep it you know a sniper there we go deep stuff what's up Timmy how you doing Declan

yeah if you're watching guys as a stream or Avadh I hope you're all doing well taking care of yourselves everyone's probably feeling a bit cooped up right now but I know man you gonna try and make the most of it make the best of it while you can we send in it well I don't know so he's sorry he's like yeah you know it's not just you I'm getting it as well right what don't work around hey Ben Montgomery someone fires showing us who is that yeah that was from superstore roof of superstore Oh with flying [Music] hey flex what's good about supersaurus whoa yeah don't mind me and crazy driver

to come in and then when they got to be coming in yeah oh yeah and then we can fold wish you open this roof here and we can pop the drone and pop yes if they come this way which is you know a big if true I don't think they'll come this way by station right here do we could even just wait for them to use the buy station that's gonna be this gonna require a lot of patience so well with c4 on it oh no I mean we take the drone we put the c4 on the drone yes fly that bad boy down mean you could put c4 on the plastic so could do that to a parachute just came in there that goes down practical thank you for this a nice it was an instant love the stream video post keep up Thank You Man the only thing I'm really scared of is that they they airstrike I swallow me in the drone I won't be able to do anything she's gotta make sure you're indoors I guess someone's doing a secure area over there another parachuter same spot you know I hear someone then yeah lucky oh my nickel yes and yeah we were

him again next own is a little ways away down to the second one we should drive the vehicle over yeah put some pressure on him oh there's somebody else drive just got armor up he's one driver out yeah I don't think they're gonna have any armor what you had Dec was close anybody need to share by the vehicle one he's hurt behind the rock here wiping Splendor homes there you go vehicle strats holy money thank you there's an airstrike here is that vehicle and a hell that's about 85% this one's three-quarters ass better a fingertip Phil yeah a half-playful under I'm not a big fan of it to be

though again yeah no I think once you're out you're out sure cuz then you can just recycle it I guess keep doing it over and over take the fuel watch out for not building that are you bringing the Jeep yeah I always like to make sure we have some sort of transportation in sticky situations mm-hmm go further in the zone is it stuck yeah we have Hill advantage mine's right now [Music] okay maybe we just try to take those buildings Oh mom is still 20 people I think we're gonna run into a fight here extragalactic you're right yeah behind us a nice time I thought I heard a door open did you not

sorry technical people are shooting at me like I feel like there's there's been no game where I'm like rule like making you know like those sigh oh my head's trying to spin out of my own body what if you could buy a really expensive item like a helmet that stopped aim punch but it can crack well there have been there have been perks in the impasse balls ago at e3 same punch three to our vehicles yes we should probably hit the buy station if we can yeah nevermind fine yep I'm not safe let's hiding on that we cannot combine back yeah yeah my background back don't know where this guy is he was at the close water beyond her building it was 20 meters away [Music] we can't get over here we just run run after foot it what we go around I'm just worried I don't know where this guy is dropping on

there's so many people alive I do not know this place actually I don't get upstairs I was gonna just do it to try that nope is there a ladder on the outside maybe this is like there's like the pub G pool building mmm it's the one from they're chasing get up there I'll call him in the name of that place that was like the nuclear explosion she knows they hmm and the cod4 mission all Gilly look looks like Chernobyl yeah the same pool oh I think I'm looking at a sniper blue ping there yeah there's there's the all three are right around that corner subsonic Kelly yeah you didn't yeah they know we're here hopefully they come oh yeah I'll rest I'll rest okay okay don't have a grenade I mean he just ran to an absolute wall of bullets oh this one time a different scene behind us I'm gonna hate that damn [Music] this is ridiculous on the bright side of it I found the way to the roof oh yeah yeah it's on the oh yeah there's a lot of left side yep on the outside oh gosh so we were being shot from like every angle then yeah we were getting pinched it was a sniper that killed me from the other direction their sports blue m4 dude this guy's golden it are you safe to actually come back oh I don't know that I stone said there's people over at blue you could get the thing on the roof maybe they were mm let me see get a little closer here is that I go down there yeah there's a guy on ping here okay hello let me see one yeah it's twos two they're pushing in as well oh okay oh trying to get out of there where's the drop maybe I should just go for that yeah I'm gonna get to the fire

team is dead at least a 1 B 2 right now I meant I mean Dora I feel like I should go and avenge you guys that's up to you I don't know I mean there's two teams fighting there they're gonna see me on the radar you don't have any armor you're not yeah either I'll get out there somewhere else we can turn it around with a truck you can do anything it's true I think we came back worse today that's not a window what is this place yeah hey yeah check the records here everything's in order see where they stash the money they're hiding the money somewhere only need 200 get one of you back my check this building check it would be cool if there was some sort of little Easter Egg written on those you had to go to certain spots to read all the coordinates or whatever yeah maybe that's what the code these people are getting evicted I think that's what's going on here it's letting you guys know that you're gonna have to leave your place because there's a giant war zone gonna be coming in yeah sorry about that there we go so I get one of you back now but ago that way anyway what's up super committee how you doing you know it's not a big thing but I love the vaulting in this hmm oh yeah it's fluid it doesn't take too long well it's a lot of it's like very speedy like apex almost where it just gets a lot of the momentum it doesn't take away from the gameplay experience alright see if I could not die now oh okay crazy hey fresh prints how you doing man much love no problem Brody oh do we know if that shield stops vehicles it does it does yeah okay oh man remember that in blackout yeah it would immediately stop it looks so funny I'm not playing dayz in a one-pager been ages why would you need some hay oh um I got sixty error in the pocket so I'm doing okay I'd say that uh we could get if you dropped your money Dave and I'll go and get oh heck yeah comment back [Music] he's back in the game he's back feel like I've seen this deploy screen too many times hey but you got 2,000 bucks to because you technically completed that contract as well that's a pocket hey yen's against how you doing we gotta get know how it's going there's a guy in the yellow thing he's got a sniper very very far yeah I don't have a single load out this game yeah we might want to go back to that box that's in storage it's still gonna be in maybe a bit risky the bed those are still there the bodman we're over that stone mmm this is true knowing this game probably yeah they're just sitting at the station the by station waiting by find this crate yeah Martin I mean we've played mian oculi have played together once before in war zone and also once before in a game called war z we did a video together hey it's a good good dude so stone we don't have a vehicle though huh so we would have to foot it over there I'm sure we'll do way more stuff together oh all right then we can get our load outs yeah I think it's worth yeah I think we do it we don't really have much right now okay I think the plan here is to go for night know what I do see them where's that loadout marker wasn't so large what some fatty cakes walls those guys good I can go bait cuz I don't really have much I'll even drop you my money how about that all right let's go check and see if it gets really sour just leave me I think we've won more from you here though three games already as far as sniper shots that

star Barney there was a gas that I miss I missed it too then how much do you have one of us could buy itself at this other red station or this other by stationary I can you someone there I don't know you guys got having an armor-plated super Alma I'm gonna go get my load out here that's a laugh I'm popping this oh hello hello boys is a routine okay on our level now Connor watch out right in front of us okay there's no window though on this side right now not bill there's also no solo on that that bill Jack Jack come with me come with me look you want sneaky we can go on through the roof Oh guy in the oh my god oh okay we can go sneaky can we how do we get this there's a ladder right at the bottom of yellow they're going up oh yes I didn't pick me at all oh I see one right there I got thinking have looked at me hit'em armor I'm a brook on a vine from behind for mine I don't know where though he was inside in the window the building that were on he was no window no one here I don't know how we got an angle on me though that was really weird what I got left David yeah I think we're gonna have to put a cover here by shooting at you ah still got that precision Jeff yeah I want to forget about it where is that one Butthead hey David the gas station wait for it wait for it to close and then just call your ear straight cuz they're gonna be out I got one in one on radar in that building there are on a heartbeat it's a bit of a bad position right away my nice another on heartbeat ahead of us 250 in the gas station the right here to the right where you got the only one coming along the wall down them start out gas station novena five others popping you maybe green gasps the others over there it's all accounted for that's all count afford comes behind the vehicle there s try going in you've meant to the right he's behind knockout I think we rotate to the right here yeah well we in here actually yeah yeah yeah I think we're barely in here this little wall being us okay there's gonna be three in the building's there and then one off in the woods to the right okay you've got me ruckus yeah I got for there we go stop I'm covering you brother go for it front of me one that hurts it that one slicing reloading to get onto the right ah nice try Don that was spicy how did we do - so close oh so close there was one that ran out of what they were all three on a team there buddy one of my killed who's instance he might but that was just a song that was difficult yes fun did you call your airstrike in I did yeah but didn't get anyone I think I maybe used it a bit too early like if I had it arrived at the end no I think that was a good play because that at least forced them in I think I might have helped us with a cross I don't remember but oh well that do we know if you can can or cannot call it in after a certain point or do you think it's just a glitch holy i never yeah yeah because the first game we want remember you called that in and that was the final zone yeah that one was getting pretty small no no man I was unlucky very close I don't think I needed an Al there really person I think maybe if I to save my airstrike repositioned a little bit instead of just going prone that's good fun I mean you can't win them all good to come up against some good players my semtex as well actually crack the arm of one of those guys is that semtex would have been a down maybe I'd have gone differently but I mean they they played that really well to be honest because they had that little side skirt on the road there which they could use as cover and the guy that I almost downed went prone behind it and then I just couldn't hit it hit that guy that's fun game J whip mp7 or al Glalie I'm enjoying the mp7 what's up Jimmy Jimmy how you doing hey

really fun I'm not making any complaints but are you serious you don't often speak to people you know but I like being able to go out how'd he do that now I think it's gonna be a long time - all right

bottleneck - when you come out on the other side want to go get the load ups we have enough already oh my gosh have you guys been liking the pacing of the zones in the scam I've been okay for how many people are in the game mm-hmm yeah but in solo it's good so last 18 people seem to sit in buildings a lot more so you kind of have to go for the kill contracts and all that yeah I mean if you want to play that way like the very end zone I feel like it's been pretty good like it keeps moving at a really consistent pace there's no waiting around I guess the time between zones are like very quick a power strange thank you very much thank you for the 11 pass range I really appreciate that really enjoy your content will you let's play Doom eternal would love to watch greets from a sealed-off
