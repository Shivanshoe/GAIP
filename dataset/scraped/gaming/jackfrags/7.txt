one of my best mates tomorrow asked me to play a battle royale game with him and he didn't tell me anything about it apart from that it is the weirdest battle royale game ever and the goal is to collect the rose in the castle before anyone else does i accepted the offer and while it definitely is the weirdest on the market we had a lot of fun and there's some good solid mechanics here i hope you guys enjoyed this as much as we did if you do leave a like and a comment below thank you this is very odd trust me on this one all right a horse is here do i get on yeah i mean you can you can drive um five you don't drive a horse you can you can drive but you do drive this horse jack so take shelter at night so uh just hold space for me [Laughter] uh the longer you hit a drift you'll get a uh a nice a nice red speed boost which is the maximum amount of speed so it's mario kart then it's mario kart drifting yeah that looks so dumb am i going left or right where am i going that's the wrong way jack turn around you've got to follow the uh you do have a map stop eating the grass get off the grass hold on let me just do a sick need for speed drift around this game there you go here you go here you go there it is oh crap there it is oh no he's cracked i'm not very good at this song you're actually doing surprisingly well doesn't matter so instead of the zone you just go on the racetrack with the horse um well you see at the very top of your screen there's like a dial yeah so we're currently in um afternoon and then it'll it's slowly moving clockwise um we're about to hit dusk now town nearby come on there's a race not going fast enough tom i got no idea what i'm doing i'm sorry god it's so bad okay let's stop stop uh in this town somewhere so because there's so many different trails leading to the same spot another team will probably be here soon the game will let us know when someone's close but you take this time to loot uh bandages weapons you might find a loot chest that you can open bombs which are on your number two that you throw out bandages are five that's a bandage i think yeah what's this why do i have a horn well you can um signal you know if i was a if i wasn't communicating with you right now you could signal uh danger bring your map out you have to drag with your finger to find the rose where is the rose stone what does it look like um get the rose is it the one is it just the rose castle there it is yeah yeah the big castle there okay we need to find better weapons than what we've got jack morning is dawned it's a very fast day night cycle as you can tell so oh you go take this pistol jack it's really really good because that was night time we'd have been dying if we were out of the town yeah we'd be taking damages if we're in a zone of some sort right come on let's go let's see your drifting skills then all right here we go you're a seasoned veteran of nightfall seasoned vet yeah what you want to try and do is hit drifts um just on the straights like this because that's how you're going to get your max speed that was sick dude oh look at that oh yeah i love that i better get a move on i don't like how low down that horse gets to the ground on well he's drifting jack i mean it looks like it might hurt a lot you've never seen a dressing horse someone's here someone's here they're inside there i'm gonna try and bring us around the back they're inside the uh the main church it won it's right there he jumped on the left side yes he's gone into the main it's on his horse what is this good it's a it's a full auto glock jack it's got mad recall on it's yeah yeah yeah it's um it fits the period right medieval period can other players hear me doing this yes we're here bring your uh bring your flag out to a certain dominance it's on six yeah there you go look at that all right hey what's up so weird man in the best way is that the bros castle there on the right um behind us on the right i think it is i presume it's just a giant square castle right yeah i had a thought that looked like that when i was a kid a toy that you had to build a four like a a fourth yeah like a wooden fort and it was in pieces and you had to slide it all together it just meant like you know you on your council estate yeah i lived in a castle when i was younger right here we are this is it so this is just going to be sheer war this is sheer war now okay let's open we'd actually get into more of a fight but um i mean it's straight to the end game yeah but the rose will come down from the ceiling you said see where the beam is enemies enemies killed one this one here though come to so many people oh i've been hit by a bomb should i just go stealth mode and just try and glock him it won in the middle you got your bombs jack if you want to eat some trying to get behind him some you're in the middle there will they hear me uh god there's a lot of people here tom there are there are other i'm going to heal this way go this way please loot this guy anyway um i killed this guy and his teammate fell off this edge uh it's night time is that bad uh we're okay because this kind of counts as a a town he's here jack hey once what the bomb that hurt i've hit him twice i've got one down nice nice nice guy fell off there's one all the way down there he fell off hard oh they're ghosts there goes some there's an ak there if you want it yeah yeah that's that's when they're in their revival state i'm getting hit by fanning pistol right here right here it's just off the edge of it right you send it on him yeah yeah let's go okay i'll run out of ammo tom i'm with you i'm with you i'm trying to buy him i presume he's gone up yeah yeah he's dead he's dead oh my god that was a little nasty flick what the did we just heart shattered into countless pieces as you saw the rose whisked away yeah someone uh someone took the rose while we were having a massive brawl outside so how was your first experience it's interesting i i give it the recoil on the guns is a bit nuts there's a lot more to this than it initially appears 200 megabyte game what was it 2 pound 49 it cost me yeah take shelter at night ride along the road get to the rose it couldn't be any simpler than that could it so there might be players here just straight away yeah see you know right now come on jack i'm tagging him tom there's another horse on he's dropping bombs behind us okay got one down okay one hit one jump off here kill him kill him okay another horse went past this yeah i think they're going to try and beat us to the town to get the good loot yeah i didn't take any hits then that was the half-life noise tom yeah that's some half-life yeah yeah they just stole that then okay not i've gone to this horse and you interact and it just goes not my horse yeah i'm on our horse i would like that horse though okay we're coming up to a camp now they're definitely going to be in here waiting for us come on mate come in one down yes that's fast two down oh my this guy had a car not yet okay oh it's a grand he did the ping tom oh yes not much ammo for it though that chase was cool though i like how they can drop bombs off the back yeah what's this it's like a musket it literally is a musket yeah it's like mario kart like you can drop a bomb where you're sat essentially and then it'll just blow up behind you somewhere where did that ammo come from it wasn't there before this way yeah left yeah the signs will always point you in the right way as long as whatever feels natural just go with the flow of the track like we can't go with the flow of this skin whatever feels natural yeah just listen to your inner voice listen to your inner voice jack you're not a voice you've always heard but always just canceled out when i look at myself in the mirror and talk to you yeah yeah yeah yeah that one yeah just listen to that voice and he will guide you nobody appears to be here there's a chest tom there's a chest let's go i'm opening it tom what's it gonna be covering i'm looking for stuff um a vampirism drain their life while possessing this item okay so that's a bomb that will still explode but it will do it a bleed effect dawn is upon us a new day thomas another day another day to drift around on the horse feels like we got about two minutes sleep jack me every night behind us tom yeah i'm dropping bomb about him should we ambush him jack should we just stay here for a sec okay i've got my little pinky out tom oh yeah oh they're actually they've stopped to fight i'm trying to shoot him with my double barrel at this range he's on the horse again i want to see if they here we go move on nope oh hit him once i've got a heels on i can actually hit him at this range of the double barrel that's crazy why i don't know if i'm doing much damage though again reloading he's galloping towards us now again reloading he's drifting away tom damn it after him let's get after him here let's go a safer route though i've only got four shots left now damn it i mean i'm gonna need ammo that's not normal that's not how horses work that's not normal i'll try again there we go oh that's fine stealth attack on a noisy horse galloping jack we're trying to be quiet that ahead tom just double barrel he's bombed me i'm killed i've killed one okay okay i'm reloading uh they're both outside on my body here okay good bombs nice they're fine he said get me get to me follow me what can you resume yeah yeah oh no they got the rose i think i wasted too much ammo on the outside people you get it though like even even the even the looting even looting the town is like a race in itself because you're racing the nightfall there's some level of strategy here yeah did this release in april this year yeah april 1st yeah they release a new game every april fools is that their entire business model yeah they make it they release a project then move on to the next one this one was made in five weeks by five man team now this is pod racing what i like how it just completely fills up the screen i can't see a good thing it's based on a true story this game isn't it yeah what was the story uh basically there was this um big battle um there's these knights yeah yeah these nights yeah yeah uh and it's basically like a multiverse story where they discovered how to um different universe yeah yeah in this universe um horses drift okay as you can see yep um but they also figured out someone basically came from the future and um introduced guns i used to fantasize about that as a kid what guns being a time traveler like taking a minigun to the medieval age and just be like right who wants to win you know everyone he wants to win come on he's got the most cash who's got those goals i think he just said teams approach yeah they are the other here oh god tom i killed one i killed one the other guy's here on me okay that glock is sick reload dab it reload all right nice okay he's dead blasting him with spells watch me reload watch me really hard [Laughter] excuse me there's a guy here oh yeah yeah another one's gonna hit i know to get closer we need to get closer okay okay okay i'm just gonna nail every turn so sick dude oh they've become us in the last match tom they're gonna ambush us no no no no they're on the they're on the street oh no this is a terrible design for a castle by the way they really think this story didn't they it was designed for horse drifting of course you go down the big run yeah yeah right so where's the rose i'm not even seeing it it's in the middle there's a big red beam if you see it there so it'll come down i see that horse what is the horsey the horse is eating the cement on yeah yeah there's some ammo here i'm pretty low so i'm healing up okay i like how you can hear the horse eating more players outside more players outside are they at the front door two-man team yeah yeah hit one this is a friendly fire it's loads of them fighting killed one i'm just throwing bombs tom yeah ow i've got a hill killed one go go go i'm pushing this tom what's he doing he's here jackie's here careful of the bomb right here how is he alive still i'm missing with the aoe yes what the hell what is the row spawned yeah the rose is there tom do i just grab it like four guys yeah yeah so start securing it i'll cover cover me tom i don't want to die 50 sixty percent we're over here guys eighty percent come get us we're this way i think we've done it done yes hey number one victory royale oh look at this yes jack i will marry you what i did it was all part

because there's an ak that's how they won the great battle in uh game of thrones yeah jon snow picked up the ak and just went ham on everything yeah yeah had extended mags didn't he yeah flight hand as well i think was the perk he was using quick reload so he could take out the night king effectively mm-hmm you had the merc foregrip as well before is now so you got the uh increased movement speed get your head dramatic effect you know yeah yeah same until the very last second what's in my eyes i hear your approach someone's in here tom um someone's in there yeah yeah i'm gonna try and get us
