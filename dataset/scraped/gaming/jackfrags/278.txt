it's only been two months since battlefield 2042 was revealed but believe it or not ea are actually talking about the next battlefield game after this one and this came from the q1 earnings call the ea did a couple days ago and it leads to some really interesting discussion and usually these earnings calls have little snippets of information in about new games that ea are working on for investors and they talked a little bit about future battlefield games but they also gave some really cool stats about bf2042 little tease about hazard zone portal a potential free-to-play portion of the game and about how the live service is going to be i didn't listen to this live because i thought well i mean the game's already announced and this is just an audio call so not gonna be much there but there's quite a lot of good stuff here so we're gonna dive in and take a look before we do that though just a heads up as i did with the f1 and the f4 the f5 is currently free on prime gaming if you've got amazon prime you can claim a key for an origin version of the game for free so if you've not played it or again your cat your dog your goldfish your mom's goldfish your mom's nan's goldfish's dad they need a key well you can go get one for him all right so i've gone through the transcript and i've picked out the most interesting things and there was a bit of an introduction about bf 2042. they said here during q1 we revealed the game and the energy and excitement from fans around the world has been incredible since the reveal on june 9th our battlefield trailers and content have cumulatively generated more than 210 million views to date across all channels these record viewership levels contributed to bf2042 being the most talked about title in the industry during a busy month of june and created a record high sentiment among the battlefield fan community so yeah and is pretty proud of the reveal so far it would seem record viewership on their content channels and most importantly their sentiment among the battlefield community i don't know how they've got a way of precisely measuring someone's sentiment or group sentiment i suppose they could look at negative or positive comments they may have tools for that but generally speaking i'd say my experience of seeing the reaction it's been overwhelmingly positive for the game and a lot of old fans have shown interest and a lot of new people have also come along and gone you know what that looks pretty cool more recently we introduced battlefield portal a new community driven experience in bf2042 this new pillar of the game puts the power in the hands of players to seamlessly create their own experiences from all the things they love in battlefield easily mixing and matching eras maps weapons and unique gameplay scenarios that can then be shared with the community it's an entirely new level of freedom in battlefield and fans have been very energized with the possibilities to create discover and share things that are completely new and unexpected we're poised to deliver a truly next-gen battlefield this holiday with unprecedented innovation massive scale and amazing gameplay and we've got more to share about the game through the summer more to share about the game through the summer at the moment there's a countdown for the exodus video that's a nine minute cinematic trailer and every day they're doing updates on the battlefield website of a journalist who is making their way through the story of bf bf2042 and that's really useful for understanding the law and narrative of the game i don't particularly care about that kind of stuff i'd rather see some gameplay bit of hazard zone but i know that there is a big part of the community that are invested in that kind of content games come online though coming up soon could see some more there now then on to the juicy bits in the q a section so there was a question from matthew thornton who is from tourist securities they're an analyst and their question was somewhat related i'm curious about your thoughts around battlefield does that franchise still aspire to be in every other year release type of a cadence in a normal world so i think what matthew's referring to here is that previously that's how the release schedule for battlefield has worked every other year a new game would come out and before we talk about this let's look at what andrew wilson replied here he's the ceo of electronic arts let me jump in on do we think baselfield will return to an every other year launch i would say i think that is our orientation but more importantly i think you should think about battlefield as a service that we announced what we're doing for the launch of this game is really revolutionizing and reinventing what all our epic scale warfare is in the context of gameplay in addition to that we've heard us announce battlefield portal which really starts to lean into user generated content and will drive deep long-term engagement in the game and while we've announced hazard zone is the name we haven't disclosed a lot about what's going on there and you'll hear more about that in the coming months you should understand that this really forms the foundation for what we believe the future of a live service around battlefield is which over time will include a mobile launch will include some free to anchor components and really change the nature of what happens from launch to launch and every other year launch probably makes sense as we think about it today we're really focused on 365 day engagement in the franchise at a platform level across any device that consumers may want to play on so there's a lot to unpack there if bf2042 releases this october and it's not delayed at the moment ea are planning to release the next battlefield game in 2023 and i imagine at this point they've already decided what it is they've probably started concept work on it as well but this surprises me because me personally i thought that bf 2042 the way that it's been announced and everything with portal and hazard zone and the emphasis on live service i was thinking that this would be the kind of game that would be supported for more than two years which is typical for this kind of thing right i thought in the region of maybe four to five years before we get a brand new battlefield title because the way they've set this up is the live service model they've gone down the fortnite the warzone route where the seasons and new maps new content introduced throughout the year and then if you think about what porcell brings to the table too in respect to that and what andrew said the amount of community made content could be infinite if ripple effects studios who are working on portal start developing more new content for porcell then that could just go on forever hypothetically i mean it's a next-gen engine every time you have talked about this game they've said they've geared it up for next gen it's the latest version of the frostbite engine we know that so it's not like the game is gonna look bad in four to five years if you get what i'm saying it would still look like a next-gen title and probably have the capability to introduce all those next-gen features too so this does surprise me a little bit i don't know if everything that's said here is chiseled in a rock somewhere and permanent plans can change and i won't be surprised if bf2042 is a massive success and there's a ton of content added to it for the next couple years portal gets a ton of content to it it could be supported for much longer than two years and maybe if we look at 2023 releasing a new battlefield game then perhaps that just won't make sense at that time and place we'll have to wait and see in my head i like the idea of dice constantly adding stuff to the game which can then be used in portal they could do world war two packs they could do a bf4 pack a 2142 pack and just have this massive battlefield game which is just battlefield it's everything that keeps getting added to and added to for years and years to come i like the idea of that maybe portal just splinters off and becomes its own thing but from what andrew is saying there at the moment it seems like the plan is bf 2042 releases october this year it's supported for a couple years with live service and then a new game bf7 whatever you want to call it releases for 2023. also i didn't miss that comment there either free to anchor it's a bit marketing speak isn't it but what i take from that is a portion of bf2042 will be free to play he said this right after he talked about hazard zone so i'd hedge my bets that hazard's own will be a free-to-play component of the game in some capacity and that would be a nice way for new players to try battlefield who have perhaps never played it before test it out let them play boost the playing numbers and then maybe at some point down the road they go okay right i want to experience the rest of the game they purchase it when they're in this makes sense in my opinion when you look at the competitors that bf 2042 has they're going to want to attract warzone players fortnight players apex players and all of those games are free to play bf 2042 at 60 bucks for the standard version so this would be a little tease for those free-to-play players who maybe want to try before they buy kind of thing let's just hope to god that the game's got a decent anti-cheat if that's the case because hazard zone could be ruined if it's free to play and there's just cheers everywhere dice please unrelated to battlefield they did talk about mass effect and star wars jedi fallen order and they said that we are continuing to invest in both of these franchises as well as more of our amazing ip we know there's a new mass effect game coming already looks like it's got the original trilogy characters in it too thank you very much and star wars jedi fallen order 2 i mean i absolutely loved the first game if respawn make a jedi fall in order to i'm gonna be over the moon because i think that game just on its own is a great action adventure game but as a star wars fan it just makes it twice as good so i would love to see more games in that franchise and that's all do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below how would you prefer battlefield to go do you want it to be this longer four to five year live service model when it's just battlefield from now on or do you prefer this model where every couple years they're making a completely new game and it will have a two-year live service and that's just how it's going to be let me know thank you for watching guys if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for
