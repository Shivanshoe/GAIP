hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some more call of GC war zone today we're gonna be playing some 200 player quads with study tomographic and Nick Starr and I wanted to use a couple of underrated guns today I think one of the most underrated which we've talked about before is the scar-h and I've made a little build here that I wanted to show you guys I think this could actually be quite competitive in water so we're gonna be testing that out today I've got out my first load out and I've also put like a longer scope on it so I'm gonna try and hang back play it distance I did use a build sim it's similar to this in a solo game that I posted and it worked really well but working quads I don't know I feel like you might need more bullets but go be interesting to test and see and I've coupled that up with the HDR on the side there now it's gonna be good fun like I said we are playing quads it might be a bit hectic I just have to show you guys a message from our sponsors today which are nvidia and pc specialists and i made a little video that you guys can watch it's all about high frame rate and high frequency monitors and the advantages of those so we're just gonna watch today's content is sponsored by nvidia and pc specialists will be playing war zone using an RT x 20 80 TI graphics card to achieve as many frames per second as possible high FPS in multiplayer shooters can make the experience feel a lot nicer for you especially when you team it with a 144 Hertz or 240 Hertz monitor as you can see in the video here filmed using a super-expensive 1000 FPS camera higher frame rates and hertz will give you a smoother look and feel to the gameplay the difference from 60 to 144 Hertz is huge and in my opinion it's one of the biggest improvements that you can make to your PC gaming setup higher frame rates also equal less input lag and that's one of the most important things for me so if you're interested in checking out our TX cards to learn more about this or PC specialists for custom builds there's a link down in the description below we'll also be giving away to lots of 2400 Cod points for PC throughout the duration of this stream and dropping them in the chat there we go that was me from the past anyway so yes like I said it is sponsored by Nvidia and PC specialist the big thank you to those guys frame rates in the top left hand corner and we're playing the game if you want to see and we will be dropping to 2400 cod points during the stream for PC but with that said I hope you guys have fun I hope you guys enjoy this I am looking at the chat so if you got any questions or any discussions you want to talk about bring it up and maybe we can have a chat with that said I'm gonna unmute discord and see if the boys are ready to go still on the a max hello Matt hello jack I was born ready we got a party know all about the Jack yeah yeah Jack's joinable joining in get on me lads alright I think we need to break our record for wins I think we've only got like two or two is out two or three now previous two yeah alright let's get let's get three in a row do you wanna play a quads let's go yes what do you guys think - kinda but feels pretty similar to be honest everyone dies there's five seconds yeah yeah you could be right you could be right it's the drop that's different than everything else seems do I think that is so random I think it's all it all depends on the circles I hate when the circles are like really off to one side because everyone dies just yeah yeah I know that's exactly a person which the old the surface movie oh we're dead we'd ever been but there are so many people then if you happen to be on the other side of the circle you're like well there's no one left in this lobby you're still on the the growl no I'm gonna be rocking around kilo okay but the growl is still early I still didn't assault rifle in the game yeah easily but the key Lyle it can it can compete I would say at this point I'm on the sky race today a bit different you're a brave Maps pretty much mr. Mac sighs I'm not in the twenty five didn't know isn't it a bit more of a sniper well I'm just gonna try and stay back I've got three times on it so it's still kind of moving close range yeah should be good I mean it'd be interesting to see how it performs I'm not really used it in quads I try to in solo a lot but never quads yeah what's it like in silos okay actually because I mean really you don't ever need more than like 25 bullets to kill one person and they it's higher damage than most of the other assault rifles I think the Odin is the only one that beats it maybe the foul yeah pretty good it's an interesting choice really Odin Mac sighs no good day I saw that in the park nice yeah the stock is 25 as well isn't that inside of 20 is it wow I think and then the biggest next day 500k for it might be worth revisiting it then yeah good old out in with with it three times as well of course we drop in there right of course we are yeah it's our thing at this point she knows love if they did like a small map version events like you know they hold on puffy really sorry man one more in here maybe coming in welcome in do Danny come inside chewing the bill okay that's no good
