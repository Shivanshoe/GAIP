it would appear that in the near future we're going to get a new Battlefield campaign it could be a campaign attached to a proper multiplayer Battlefield game like we had in BF3 and BF4 or it could be a standalone single player game set in the battlefield Universe now there's some information that's come out online and this is not based on leaks this is based on facts and that's why I wanted to do a video on this and cover it because it's real and this has all stemmed from a job application on the EA website of the new Battlefield Seattle studio so a bit of context for you in December of last year after the launch of the f2042 a lot of the heads that I stepped down the general manager stepped down and they hired a bunch of new people and they released an article where they announced that VIN sampela would now be in charge of the series if you will they announced Rebecca kutas as the new GM of dice and they announced the new studio in Seattle and that's the important thing to note here they said at the time that this would be headed by Marcus Leto he's one of the co-creators of the Halo Universe and now on his Twitter bio it says game director at Battlefield narrative at EA so we knew about that we knew that they were making a new studio in Seattle for Battlefield but back in December we didn't really know what they'd be working on apart from this that they said here and this I think was open to interpretation so we'll read this it said that the studio in Seattle will be working on World building and narrative within the battlefield franchise EA indicated that each is working on a new experience in the battlefield universe that doesn't explicitly mean that these will both take the forms of games the experiences terminology allows some wiggle room for what they will turn out to be we intend to build a battlefield Universe one with multiple projects that are interconnected with the player at the center and then letto himself said on Twitter we're building a new studio from scratch in the Seattle area so I'm looking for core leadership in many disciplines if you've got five to ten years of FPS experience love the idea of working in the Battlefield universe and want to help build an awesome team please reach out so in December of last year lots of gray areas but we're going to take a look now at what's been updated and this job application that I just mentioned so this role that they're advertising for is design director Battlefield Seattle Studio previously this studio didn't have a name and Battlefield Seattle Studio could still be just a temporary name I'd imagine it probably is and they just don't want to reveal the name yet but for the time being they're obviously dedicated to Battlefield there's a bit more context at the start of the advertisement the FC adult is focused on building Rich exciting stories with memorable characters and Powerful experiences all in the battlefield Universe we're building a new studio in the Seattle area composed of leaders and Talent with a vast array of AAA Game Dev experience as we assemble our diverse Team all who have a voice in making great games together we're looking for a healthy mixture of tempered veterans and young passionate individuals eager to make a difference and then it goes into the role all overview and this is where we get the actual detail reporting to the studio general manager you will manage the design and design vision of a new Battlefield campaign I mean that is pretty clear as you can get isn't it your job is to orchestrate the mission design narrative game mechanics and systems to create the highest quality experience possible you Foster relationships with creative engineering and production to create an inclusive design team your job is to embrace the core tenets of the battlefield franchise and make sure that they're woven through all layers of a masterfully designed single player campaign you will build the Studio's design team and culture and build an amazing campaign from concept through release you are also responsible for leading iteration of the product design based on feedback from peers company partners and team members while holding to the core Vision so there's actually quite a lot to unpack there I think based on that description though and the fact that the studio was only set up in December this is obviously very early days for this game whether it's a campaign for a future Battlefield game or a standalone single player Battlefield game establishing some kind of a universe we don't know yet my best guess here is the this Seattle studio will completely oversee the single player for the next core Battlefield title and that will be used for World building for introducing characters and tying That Into The Narrative of the multiplayer which although 2042 does have some it's not that strong and they've not really leaned into it that much so far obviously the game had a lot of issues and I think they've just been focused on fixing those first and getting it up to speed before diving into the narrative and story of course in other shooter games that are multiplayer PVP and have a battle pass system live service like Warzone fortnite they have a lot of story beats in them and it helps to connect the players to the universe a bit more 2042 hasn't done a good job of that at all so I reckon that's what this is I think in a couple years time we will have a new Battlefield multiplayer game I reckon they're gonna go Back to Basics with it I think they're going to bring back classes I think they're going to go 64 players I think they're going to lean into destruction smaller maps with more of a focus on Infantry but at the same time I think what the studio are developing is a single player campaign for that game that makes the most sense for me at the moment but of course I could be completely wrong and off base with this one the job description continues with some responsibilities a couple of the most interesting ones here to finally the design efforts necessary for creating a best-in-class single player campaign experience and then start with a player first mentality motivated by passionate aim to understand and serve the players who are engaged with the game so that's all so far but this is real and it's essentially confirming that rather than this studio just being an effort to make more narrative in the multiplayer they are actually going to go back and make a single player campaign but it would seem it's a dedicated studio so Seattle focuses on the single player dice focuses on the multiplayer we'll see how it turns out interesting for sure I have to say that for me personally I feel 50 50 about this yeah we don't really know much about it at all and it's just the beginning of it so I don't think it would be fair to be judgmental about this already however from my experiences I haven't really enjoyed a battlefield single player game since Battlefield 3 before that Bad Company 2 loved it BF4 had some cool moments in it the F1 and five they went for the War Stories style and I liked a couple of them but it didn't really have a cohesive narrative and you weren't given enough time to care about the characters because each of the War Stories was just like 40 minutes long and they weren't connected to each other in any way apart from hey it's World War One in bf1 and then World War II and bf5 so it was just like okay I've done this next next next so that's how it felt for me anyway but BF3 if they go back to that kind of style where there's an overall Story and there's a beginning and an end and you're getting to know the characters and you're learning things that you might take into the multiplayer I think that could be call and the fact that Marcus Leto was one of the original co-creators of Halo that makes me think that perhaps they might lean into a more open world approach in some of the missions also please correct me if I'm wrong but I've got it in my head the making single player campaigns for first person shooters is incredibly expensive and I seem to recall reading in an interview somewhere the all Battlefield 4 50 of the entire budget of the game was taken up by the single player campaign which means that these things are super expensive to make so there must be a concerted effort going into this and a lot of money but as a long-term Battlefield fan since BF 1942 I'd love the focus to be the multiplayer first because I feel like that's what Battlefield does best so the fact that they're making this a separate Studio that makes me think that this won't impact the multiplayer that much don't know that for a fact of course and I'm down for a new Battlefield single player campaign I think there's still room in modern FPS games for cool campaigns like that the F3 has as I mentioned a lot of the Nostalgia and fond memories of BF3 for me personally come from the campaign as well as the multiplayer because it just had some sick levels in it and scenarios called military hardware a couple of twists and turns in there the graphics were gritty and realistic modern warfare 19. that's another great example campaigning that was great short but sweet MW2 looks like it's shaping up nicely as well so even though they're expensive and I don't think they should be the focus I definitely think there's still room for those kind of campaigns in primarily multiplayer Shooters with that said let me know your thoughts down in the comments Below guys how do you feel about this one thank you
