hi everyone and welcome to the call of duty black ops cross play beta it's just gone live and tonight i'm going to be playing on pc obviously i'm primarily a pc gamer so this is uh it's quite exciting for me to jump on i've played it on ps4 pro in the past but pc today i'm looking forward to this thank you for all coming along i appreciate you guys being here also today we are taking part in something called race against the clock and this is interesting to me because i've never really done anything like this before but it's a competition where myself and five other uk content creators are going to play the game for 90 minutes and whoever gets the most kills or the top three people will have the chance for people in their community to win prizes and i thought you know what i'm gonna be streaming it anyway let's take part and if i win or if i get top three maybe you guys could win something the full details of the competition are down in the description below there's a tweet that i put out a little bit earlier and i just have to show you this because this is pretty insane okay so i'm just going to alt tab for a second this is the top price it's an insane pc built by nvidia and scan computers and it's a black ops cold war themed gaming pc right how sick is that it's all customized water cooled and it's got a 30 90 in it graphics card it's got an i9 i think it's a 10 900k load of ddr4 memory and you also win an 8k tv if you get the first first prize so if i win one of you guys will win this no promises yeah i understand it's a competition but i'm not going to be sweating too hard i want to win for you guys but i also kind of want to chill at the same time right so that's what we're doing today we're gonna be playing for 90 minutes and my timer starts at quarter past seven so that's in about two and a half minutes and from that point i will have 90 minutes to get as many kills as i can i'm looking forward to this like i said in the description below is full terms and conditions and everything and how to enter if you're interested and one of the stipulations was that this had to be a brand new account so this is a fresh account there's no way i could have done any reverse boosting or anything weird like that so it's fair for everyone everyone starts on a fresh account and i'm just really looking forward to this you know it's going to be good fun i'm going to enjoy this thank you for coming along as well in the chat i appreciate you being here eric thank you for the 10 gamer thank you for the five further ado let's see if we can get into a game and start racking up some kills i mean i don't have any loadouts or anything but it's a fresh account so i'm just gonna go in there with the with the krieg or the m16 is it the xm6 whatever the main assault rifle is or maybe the mp5 and i think we can only play quick play as well for 90 minutes so that's what we're doing we're going to queue in right now and then at the end of every round i've got to make sure to show the scoreboard so the admins who are watching this can like keep track of everything i need to turn off a voice don't i uh voice chat bye yeah we can't be having that can we it's just some dude's static microphone what is that about right moscow miami i think i prefer moscow based on what i've played i haven't like even dialed in my sensitivity or anything uh dawson thank you for this tent i mean dawson it's literally my first match so i haven't run into any campers or anything because i've not played it on pc yet now this is quite a close range map isn't it um so we go with like that smg was really good in the in the alpha wasn't it so we're gonna have to try and get as many kills as we can but i'm also trying to get some some you know first impressions of the game on pc see what it's like i have played it on pc once before in the early access capture event but you know it wasn't i didn't have much time with it there and this build of the game feels a bit different based on what i played on playstation last weekend what's up michael carlin hello kevin how are people already level 26 i guess they've just they've just played the game a lot already it went live like uh an hour and 15 minutes ago all right here we go let's get it [Applause] hopefully the stream looks good should be streaming in 4k today let's do it mtc is live i do know the layout of this map straight up tdm i don't think tdm is a particularly good game mode to farm kills though is it really there's the first one that's what we want to see so i've got um a syringe don't i on this class gotta listen out for those footsteps as well can you get out here you can no one got around me then did they but the frame rate is actually really nice i don't know exactly what kind of fps i'm getting i have to turn it on but it feels smooth i mean i'm playing this at 240 hertz you know it's a pretty solid experience so far mouse feels nice turn motion blur off [Music] sure i saw a guy here didn't i this isn't working did you see me ah so what took that kill we're in the lead out there so i'm thinking that the first game you know this is my chance to get as many kills as i can because assuming that there is skill based matchmaking on that first match he doesn't have any stats about you he doesn't know what kind of player you are so it's my best chance i guess [Music] oh no i didn't realize they could find there i forgot about that i missed an opportunity there for a triple kill i think i could have been big okay gun sounds way better yeah i do feel like they've changed the 50 i feel like they've changed the gun sounds a bit right oh yeah also this stream i've got early access codes to give away i've got nine early access codes for you guys and i'll be dropping those in the chat every now and again so i will just say when i'm gonna put one of those in but so you know what let's put one in now so this is a code for any platform and i think you have to go on call of duty.com redeem to use this code but of course it is first come first served whoever gets it first gets it and then it's gone you know it's not code that you can use over and over again artillery [Music] all right let's use this artillery [Music] i don't know what he's like what's that hit marker that i'm getting so i think we're doing okay so far are the other people involved in this by the way if you want to know uh westy study tomographic sacrile and benny central and there'll be uh all be streaming their povs as well i think tonight it's westby me and westy and then tomorrow it's is it sacrile and homographic and then the day after it's uh studying benny central so that's my competition [Music] are you coming this way no you're coming this way oh nice slide hustle artillery targeting actors love that guy's name by the way 10 out of 10 on the name there's another guy there that's the gas mine artillery gas mine seems pretty oh come on how did it artillery like zoomed into me there i knew i was there aimbot artillery still this 225 no way hey richard dave what's up amanda hey conquer three rain what's up guys thank you for coming along tonight i appreciate you guys being here that guy loves that position i think the stream is being re-broadcasted on the blizzard launcher kind of like how stunned grenades like barely have an effect on this game as well i'm screwed thank you for coming yeah ideally i want to make a build with a uh suppressor i think for the next game oh you're just in the bus i didn't even see you multiple enemies mr century thank you for becoming a member it's very kind of you quite close match this isn't it he's still in the bus so i'm gonna be on that spy plane damn it i want someone spy playing right now multiple enemies can't quite work out this one behind me here oh hugh thank you for the 25 you're pregnant with my child i'm not sure about that i think those guys were all inside damn it into that leo thank you for the five do i know anything about warzone for cold war i mean i don't have any solid information no the only thing i know is that um it's going to be integrated into cold war somehow how that happens exactly i've got no idea the map will change so it looks like you know cold war the 1980s all your ass is back on cia 29 kills okay yeah i think the map will change so it looks like the 1980s the vehicles will change the weapons will change but i feel like it'll still be on the modern warfare engine i'm looking forward to it whatever it is yeah we got 20 i think we got 29 is that a good start i don't know let's have a look at the scoreboard scoreboard doesn't work okay it's not showing me i don't think it matters about the other players but there you go game number one 29 kills oh cool we unlocked a couple classes there uh cut off panda thank you for becoming a member uh louis what's up bryce how are you doing hey sippl what's up jeff what's the gun play like compared to war zones very different gun playing this game is completely different to modern warfare and war zone hey john the irish thank you for becoming a member andres as well and lock is all gaming thank you guys i really appreciate your support satellite's cool chris thanks for the five no i don't hey vadim jacob is the game out now the the cross play beta is out now jacob so this is the cross play beta that i'm playing you you get early access we're gonna drop another code in the chat now as well what's up steven hey reed harley you're the guy that i shouted out on my stream that's awesome man you jumped out your seat wow i think that's good [Music] i could get our second kill what i might do is get out to the desert here for queen country mi6 queen country mr6 don't let us down so i did try a little bit of sniping on console first time on pc here kind of waiting for people to pop up that's c4 yeah little c4 knocking at your door no one is appearing so i'm gonna move in here one hit kill to the torso on the snipers although you do have to aim quite high i don't know where that shot went on the guy in the rock i felt like that should have hit maybe there's a bit of bullet drop there i don't know i assume there is ballistics in this obviously it depends on the kind of distance that you're firing at right oh we clicked at the same time surely surely we clicked at the same time cookie cookie put a cookie monster out there oh it's whack-a-mole i'm losing very hard i'm not sure about that um like shimmer effects i really like that [Music] guy right here i think i saw a head then try and get a bit closer maybe all right i think he's there somewhere all right we might have a little flank here this guy didn't spot me [Music] okay stick that down is that enemy artillery i knew there'd be someone older angle [Music] i mean i could be the sniper guy again out here hostile spy plane established overhead push in a bit i feel like they've increased the recoil or maybe i'm just not used to it should we go around here and have a look try and get that artillery in a second oh no shouldn't have shot then damn it maybe go back out and snipe for a bit i feel like the spawns are flipped again i can get in a nice position here on these rocks only got the tag first time come on peak peak peak [Music] oh i love the snipers very good stop playing games in my heart oh i'm wasting time here stupid stupid hey henry yeah it is it's really different oh get wrecked i need to learn what all the things are man i think unlocking uh chopper gunner as well would be a great way to get easy kills right that might be a couple artillery kills there damn it yeah it's a very different kind of cod game it's more like old school card enemies what was that was that napoleon that was sick although i think it did murder me sir maybe not so sick is this guy again okay that guy is an expert at dodging specifically me this gloss guy is really good at dodging him oh that was close i think someone else got that though ah time to kill is a bit longer than modern warfare so those kills where you're like okay right i can go back in cover now you need to adjust your timings a bit it takes a bit longer to kill i'm rushing that's a nice little head glazer people always do that it's easy to snipe though they go up there i almost got a quick scope nearly nearly nearly as we go around this way i feel like there might be enemies up here there's someone here i just got ruined then dude absolutely beam me road picked up a different gun it's the quick hostile artillery targeting i've got to get undercover inbound hostile spy plane established overhead all right we dodged that one i like this craig you guys know how to turn off the flashlight how do i turn off the flashlight guys on pc does anyone know the bind for it i suppose i should just look in the menu but as soon as we're racing i don't want to waste any time back here again there's captain whack-a-mole again didn't whack him on me that time did okay it's good all the bad guys up here loads of bad guys around the corner yes is that ammo back yeah oh watch out plenty of enemies up here and round here i think ah that was a nice little streak it's definitely not all f4 guys i can tell you that for a fact let's get my uh chopper gunner in as well hey that was a much better game ah we got 39 helens oh the gun pit scan i think so josh yeah i think at extreme distances maybe the dmrs and the the sniper rifles i would guess are probably bolt action projectiles i'd imagine [Music] i mean they they're like that in warzone right so uh scoreboard working no okay yeah that was a better game i'll try miami as soon as we've not done that uh can i create a class now i can wicked right um xm4 is pretty pretty nasty isn't it all right we're gonna drop another code in the chat as well here guys for early access to the beta i've got no unlocks for it of course so uh ghost is what i want when i get to that when do you unlock that level 14. all right all right proximity mine yeah we'll go with this class score streaks you unlock that level 38 okay well i'm not going to get that in an hour and a half am i there's no way uh evan fahl thank you for becoming a member can you give the option to square them up you know i'm not sure i'm not entirely sure to be honest with you i can have a look if you'd like you just played armada five times in a row goated i would leave the lobby and try again what's up famesy from southeast london how you doing man uh yeah i think the beta goes free on saturday and sunday addiction anthony thank you for the fire from ireland by the way guys um i do have a cod creator code so if any of you guys buy anything in the cod store on warzone modern warfare or even if you pre-order this uh consider using my code creator code which is jack frags in all caps other creators have codes too but it's just an easy way to support content creators for free if if that's something you'd like to do how to show fps i think it's in the options hat yeah hey zach located hardpoint wow he jumped up i just got an mp5 to the face hardpoint might be a good mode for kills you know just camping on the outside kind of thing are you kidding me was that cooked that must have been cooked hugh thank you for the five i don't think that's going to happen buddy but i appreciate your your support thank you playing on a 30 90 herbert hardpoint identified not sure about this iron sight lost kind of like you just fell over and died okay i've hit this wet lobbies haven't i i've already hit the sweat lobbies third game in it all goes downhill from here lads it all goes downhill from here am i gonna try this on the xbox series x if it's available yeah hostile spy plane established overhead i'm not sure if it's on the series x i assume it will be i don't know i mean it's not officially out yet though right f's in the chat boys f's in the chat did i get an elimination with my proximity mine there not sure what that was for [Music] friendly's there they're gonna be over here aren't they my teammate just stayed my ass down i think i'd love to be able to mount here [Music] watch my right hard point hostels have captured the hardpoint you're on that fast stolen shocking baby i thought that was a head it's just a weird statue where'd that come from damn it hey milhouse what's up good to see you again milhouse i recognize you from last time how glad that i got that kill right next to me here i couldn't get a second yeah it's quite fast pay stars although the time to kill is a bit longer smoke check what does that mean i mean i even pre-fired that guy and he came bouncing around the corner like a bunny rather hey usmc ghost your first stream really that's awesome man thank you for coming i hope you enjoy it [ __ ] out find finally nah i saw it too late now you can't really slide cancel as well like you can in uh modern warfare warzone thank you for the two greetings from the night shift legend [Music] i want to get up on this chair but he won't let me join established overhead still mp5 [Music] ah thanks what's up jellyfish jelly smish sorry difficult to read the names that fast you know just glance over to my other monitor i think i'm us at the moment and when you crouch walk as well it's almost completely silent established overhead please just jump up i'm waiting for you thanks nice there's a few uh a few kills there okay i might be running the heads come on there we go look at that triple kill with the artillery identified beautifully hard to dodge the grenade yeah i'm not playing on max out graphics either here guys it's kind of like a mix of uh mix of normal and low [Music] drop oh where were you uh cameron thank you for the five um am i excited for zombies hugh yeah definitely zombies looks cool man looser thank you for becoming a new member yeah the campaign looks really cool i've seen some behind-the-scenes well is always gameplay super popular it looks like they put a lot of effort into the zombies as well this year so i am interested [Music] don't think so [Music] [Music] detective that's where i need that site greetings how you doing so this is actually my most eliminations even though it's probably been the sweatiest game for me like i can feel the the level of players uh a lot better in this lobby okay 41. what did we get 49 in the last one was it 39 i don't remember that's not bad it's not bad uh big man tim thank you for becoming a phantom i appreciate that holly thank you for my five it's very kindly ollie thank you i appreciate you yeah i forgot i had a uav then didn't i forgot to use it so i did unlock a sight for it at least that was a cheeky kill wasn't it that was cheeky cheeky ah cartel cool that's the other new map i did play that last weekend though uh right should we do gunsmith if we quick quick.led muzzle break extended barrel i think that's all i've got for it 39 okay cool so that was actually more kills uh dylan thank you for the 20 been following since bf2 love the new content dylan thank you tommy it's already hit the spm m's already here i can feel it in the third game is the car 98 in this game emmett i'm not sure i don't think it's in this build of the game all right we're gonna drop another code in the chat right now marty thank you for becoming a member is this still a lag problem i've noticed any lag so far l'oreal i mean i've only been playing for what like is it 40 minutes now something like that 43 minutes alex thank you the five being a sennheiser guy are you excited for the pc38x you know what i don't know what they are alec i need to catch up on that a clone trooper brother thank you for becoming a member so is this combined arms yeah we've already got twitch streamers in our lobby guys [Music] and if i was being truly sweaty i would leave this match and go join a uh another hard point but you know we're not being that sweaty i'd rather just keep it entertaining for you guys have they changed this bit at all because this bit was a nightmare the amount of bushes it actually looks like they've trimmed the bushes i think they train the bushes guys yeah i have there's less bushes there [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's one of my left ow neutralized me i'm ready for you mate he's in the back of the truck i can't believe it guys uh if you've got lag just refresh the page you'll change the quality there's a couple of problems with youtube right now we're streaming [Music] it's not on my end i haven't got any drop frames or anything unfortunately sorry guys just uh refresh hopefully that fixes it for you we'll change the quality and then change it back i like this perk where i can see proximity mines is even a perk is it is anyone being sweaty and holding this that's it right there that's when you know you've hit the square lobbies mark what do i think about the new shotgun in modern warfare it's cool i mean i've not used it in war zone yet i tried it in modern warfare i leveled it up a bit [Music] but it's basically a better origin 12 isn't it like isn't that the point of it so yeah it's uh probably really good oh second i slid in there kill that guy someone just came through the window the best foot on the map can't throw those back quick bit of a delay as soon as it comes up you've got to hit that button straight away otherwise you're not throwing it back counter spy plane grenade out she sounded australian i quite like this gun now with the red dot sight on it it's nice just missed it is that dude still in the truck i want to go in that truck okay i heard that behind me it was actually in front of me enemy um eight thoughts have you tried um i've had that in the past with modern warfare and warzone and i think it's you have to go and change your controller input in the menu it actually says like what input do you want mouse and keyboard or controller and i think that should fix the problem for you hey bilbo what's up they should do one in china nazi i think for the you know for the time period the game set in cold war like it makes sense doesn't it that it's us versus obvious switching rally points hey fat bernie what's up yeah it's a problem with youtube guys if it is lagging just refresh the page or change the quality should fix it that was a nice throw on the come on slide in damn it the dirty bomb mode is crashing poor performance on pc but it's really cool i've not tried it yet this kill race is uh is domination owner quick play only so i'll be trying that tomorrow basically you there keep getting stunned i completely forgot about this bit just don't do that i always need to use my proximity mine as well come on come on i saw someone else there ah damn it i'm all right i hate that um should we try and take b when can we play you can play now if you've got access to the uh early access beta yeah try changing the um the video quality to 4k guys i did bring this up with youtube because it's uh it's it's a problem on on their end i don't have any drop frames at all hopefully they can fix it because it's up happened a couple times now during my live streams but it is what it is i'm sure it'll fix it just seems random because like the first 40 minutes were fine and then all of a sudden it just goes no sorry enemies multiple enemies by playing contacts oh man we've gotta hold angles more here keep just running and dying it's annoying i just hold an angle now hostile artillery targeting active hostile artillery i'm gonna hide under here hopefully i don't get hit okay that one was close i have to admit that was close that was right i'm mad hostile counter spy plane established above established they just got me unlocked here that's a bit of a cheeky spot for a field mic there isn't it now they got an attack helicopter now [Music] instead foreign ah i think this is going to be watching my uh sorry i think this is going to be one of my worst matches tonight 25 or nothing you get a couple more limbs this match that'd be good i guess on his ipad i might try mp5 next time see how that goes got in the end one more at the end there one more 27 that's my worst match uh yeah it's on pc gaming try lmg too i might try lmg's tomorrow ground when i uh try a fire team dirty bomb let's see if we can build a mp5 loadout yeah i wouldn't have anything to lock for it would i i've got ghost yet nope wild card there either let's give this a shot moscow again yeah i'd rather play a map that i haven't uh already played just to keep it entertaining for you guys you can use stims to quickly come out the stun effect is that true i didn't know that i'm gonna leave this game not a big fan of that cartel map going co is pretty good is it okay hey boy wonder how you doing moscow again all right we'll play it get the mp5 out hostels have captured the hardpoint secure the objective oh how did you not die try some of this hip fire there with the mp5 or not apparently oh my goodness you see that holy the damage on that is terrible at mid-range wow maybe it's because i haven't really upgraded it with anything located we're going to drop another code in the chat here guys lockdown so the code will get you early access to any version of the baser contesting hardpoint enemy spy plane inbound guys are dropping c4 like crazy yeah the spm is definitely kicked in uh those first two games were nice how did someone beat me to that people are quick people are really quick trust me not sure if that was just my team i heard then maybe activating phil mike i just got the most london guy there didn't they located him sure i recognize that voice sounds like gasps okay i just have to slide one maybe that's it we've lost the hardpoint that's how you win the cods oh mp5 is the main weapon yeah it feels like it doesn't it testing nice grenade danny small time getting it done danny small time that sounds like it could be like a uk hip-hop artist [Music] use knife i don't think a knife would be great in a kill race maybe it was like a really small map there's someone back here you got the kill [Music] i wonder how west he's doing we've lost the hard part oh a second too late my secondary's in 1911. that's cool hostels i could stay here nice little head glitch here field mic i think it detects where players are it's like a little it's like a little uav basically that you put on the ground but people can destroy it that slide boost is a bit odd isn't it and nearby enemies basically it does sound like gaza what's the voice actor's name it's like raise something is it ray he was in a tv show in the uk called eastenders yeah the health bars are a bit too big for me heck brown is secure i think you can turn them off or i hope so i'd like oh we picked up the pace a little bit here but not much craig fairbrass that's it thank you uh sadaya that's who i was thinking of i don't know why i was thinking like ray or roy or something yeah it's craig fairbrass absolute legend i am on pc today ac yeah artillery targeting detected that call incoming artillery why can i not use my equipment you can turn them off in the settings there you go haynes yeah multiple enemies i'll probably try and do that is [Music] screwed i'm screwed this guy right here you did get a lot of ammo don't you with this mp5 there's a custom one here [Music] 36. got some uh unlocks for the mp5 as well see you later brandon yeah i'm sorry about that honestly it's not my it's not my fault i don't know i need to get in touch with youtube and see if they can figure out what's going on so i've got zero drop frames on my connection i have a gigabit connection dedicated upload one gig up one go down sorry one gig down it's uh it's something to do in youtube i don't know what it is but yeah i know it's annoying i'm sorry if it's happening guys but if it does happen all i can say is refresh the page try changing the quality maybe that will help are you using mouse and keyboard fighting no i don't want to play cartel uh so what did we get for the mp5 there accuracy did i get a mag for it kind of feel like i want an extra mag you know quick play again i will drop another code here as well see a lot of people are saying there's no lag at all so i just i wonder if it's just people can't buffer 4k like their connections aren't good enough maybe that's what it is people are always going so fast in cod like buzzing bees i know satellites are better map but i want to play miami because we haven't played it yet how am i doing 4k stream no sense gaming so i've got my game going into a 4k capture card on a streaming pc and then i'm streaming with nvenc at 50 000 bitrate at 4k that's it it's that simple use an obs you need a good pc you need a good capture card and you need a good internet connection and you can do it i don't know anyone that's doing it for gaming on youtube at the moment but i'm going to try and always do it because you know the quality is pretty nuts right mp5 on this map if i stick around the caves area maybe could be all right l96 is so much better than the r700 i'll check out this thank you hmm that's strange slim yeah i'll try and get in touch with youtube and see if they can look at the data and figure it out i lost a lot of views though which is uh annoying team deathmatch well i'm gonna try and stick to the right side of the map unless i decide to change classes yes drop the oh come code i should have had that i'm kill sure i like how slow you throw the grenades hey chd what's up what are you talking i didn't siri i didn't say anything to you did i what are you talking about you've gone mad he's trying to assume control wrong way multiple enemies do you see someone else there multiple hostile spy planes detected nope how do you get it so fast it's out now you get early access i am dropping codes in the chat every now and again didn't have time to reload there yeah i'm not sure mp5 is best for this map especially when i when i'm aiming like that spawn flips as well god damn it nope ruined hey i'm dave what's up i'm gonna pick that angle this is the sweat lobby now yeah i should change class let's go with the xm4 stay at range because just rushing people isn't working here try and get as many as we can kartik thank you for the 500 man from india it's very kindly dude thanks [Music] i'm in proximity get away go sniper we played a bit of sniper earlier mason i think it was a second second map we played sniper you stand up there you get ruined steve thank you for the five [ __ ] out request why not gotta get some kills is not good try and play a bit more passive maybe that's annoying is that spm and hitscan in the game shaney yeah definitely to both i hate pushing this handle ruined best buy had a 3080 for like 45 seconds now hey you got to be quick if you want thursday i'm afraid they're really hard to get hold off 30 80s and 39 is difficult to get artillery targeting detected are you kidding me hey vibe enable fps counter um yeah i might do after this game you just have to remind me do i have the lss turned on no no i don't multiple enemies by playing contacts i guess i could put the uh nvidia overlay on i'm just getting absolutely 14 that's a bad game again and that's my worst one so far what's up 34 how you doing thank you for coming to the stream this thing's awful in this game can you use the stoner lng i've not got anything to lock for it [Music] 14 that game that's a bad game uh i'm not sure how many matches i've got to go now i think i've got a few left over i am playing with the 39 yeah so someone wanted to see the um interface i guess it's in here fps counter sure there you go it's in the top right it's really small 60 on the menus all right we're gonna drop another code now i i think we've only got a couple left at the moment i could try sniping on this hey left in silence what's up okay right this is i think this is the last game for me so i've got to try and get as many frags as i possibly can here there you go top left guys 280 290 270 the fps is pretty insane ah nice shot hey m what's up thank you for coming i should have just sniped the whole time shouldn't i oh it's easy mode with a sniper what's up tanda [Music] someone going for those tags on my left oh that was a nice shot this game has no shadows yeah i turned them off he's dead nice shot ruined trying to get this game in the back i was shooting at me like in the back then i didn't even realize 11 kills so far i think the game needs to end though i don't know how long i've got left oh you're an enemy i mean tobias yeah first impressions to me isn't about like max graphics it's about how the game feels i don't care about graphics the most important thing to me is established the gameplay and is it well optimized you know does it run well yeah it runs pretty well mouse feels nice there's no noticeable acceleration or anything weird like that no input lag it's nice feels good how's reacts what's up hostile sentry turret active oh ruined who killed you what the hell they're gonna be spawning over here now i think i'm behind artillery yeah it's running great kiwi it's running good friendly let's go to my left get as many times as we can i don't like that counter spy player that sucks get my position away there yeah ruined hey ed i'm doing good thanks how are you [Music] targeting detective i just got toasted by the exact helicopter ruined where the enemies i'm struggling to find people here i wonder if it needs more players on a map like this like 6v6 is that really enough i don't know just feel like i'm wandering around and not really seeing anyone that much hey adam i don't know to be honest i mean it really depends on you know when the game's out how much does it have to offer you know what's the replayability i'm looking forward to trying dirty bomb tomorrow and the combined arms maps as well like i wonder yeah do they have any really really big combined arms maps that are more than is it 40 no it's not 40 players i think it's it's only 24 in combined arms something like that yeah we'll see i mean when number four games out like that'll be the true test you know everything that's on offer hostile spy plane established overhead nice okay so we picked up a few kills there obviously warzone's going to be a big part of this as well well the war zone is separate i suppose might be a couple kills there we go and it was literally a couple i love that splash got these tags well the last game is going to be a win by the looks of it i think this one will count i hope so 28. um if the admin is watching is that the last match for me does it feel like 240 fps yeah i mean it's i'm getting like 280 most of the time hey jordan no it's not the game dirty bomb it's the game mode so i'm just gonna check if that was my last game in the race i think that's been an hour and a half roughly uh 28 we're doing a kill race at the moment sensation no it's not on high sense okay the admin is typing something yeah james we got a few matches in before it kicked in hey strange loops thank you for the five all right so that was my last match okay so how many kills did we get in total then i'll just see if the admin has added this up for me thank you eric by the way if you're watching i appreciate that hey kit what's up barracks so the kill race was only for an hour and a half leave that lobby what's up jay i'm racing against study westy sacrile tomographic and benny central tonight is me and westy is anyone good at maths [Laughter] so we got all right i'm gonna use my calculator for this i'm i'm really bad at math guys it's you know it's uh there's never one of my strong suits at school so add up how many kills we got so first game we got 29 and then we got 39 and then we got 41. then we got 27 and then we got 36 and then we got 14. and then we got 28 so 214 kills in total we got in an hour and a half does anyone know how west he's done i'm just into i i mean i don't care if i beat him or lost him or whatever but i'm just interested to see how many you got that's just me wesley tonight [Music] can you show a graphic settings yeah now that now that we're done with that guys what i'm gonna do is we'll play one game of dirty bomb i'll put everything on max as well i think benny central's gonna win it just because he's a sick cod player westy got zero i don't believe that uh ultra it's quite a few graphics settings here for pc cpu priority management i think that's everything is that maxed out now i think we're good oh i missed one ultra ultra yeah right i've not played this yet so i played one round hate them thank you for the two hey ghost face what's up okay right so this is just this is like warzone get to work westie got 190 okay you just jump out well done west there i reckon benny will get like 300 or something oh this has got doors in look at this doors guys unbelievable scenes i don't i've got no idea what i'm doing we've got three codes left as well so we're gonna drop one in the chat now i've got no idea what i'm doing guys i have to get uranium i think you have to wait to respawn i've got captain price on my team wow look at that carry on pacer no it's not groundwater it's it's a new game mode what i might do is uh tomorrow when i stream again um i might get a team together like get a squad of players this is weird they've got armor and everything okay you bleed out as well look at this kill me but yeah this is the game on max settings i guess what's up fritz snow how you doing you have to wait a long time to respawn deposit but where do i get the uranium from that's what i want to know it's kind of a weird looking map yeah it looks kind of fast in the trailer though they had a uh they had an attack helicopter and everything and now i'm with different people what my teammates just changed today i'm really struggling to understand this it looks a bit flat doesn't it air patrol oh dude drop to kill streak i am confused deposit you just go stand next to it and then deposit uranium yeah i need to play this mode like and actually understand what's going on i'm so confused oh oh we're both dead now that dude's on a jet ski snowmobile what's going on my squad mate yeah i don't really understand this have a better idea of uh what is happening taking the cow's way up uh we got two more codes early access codes so we're gonna drop those in the chat now you pick up uranium off dead bodies okay right i understand i understand so you've got to kill people get uranium off them and then deposit is that a kill streak or is someone controlling that helicopter i am so confused oh there's time down there look at that oh they got tanks and now there's gas is this is this bad for me is that bad for my health i assume so i've got an arrow pointing here fire team is down i'm waiting for it yes i just don't deposit hmm and from crates around the map okay kelly thank you danger close i don't care put me in put me in coach put me in you got it game again good job oh that's fun it's like a gunship or something i'm not really enjoying this to be honest with you guys and i think i need to understand that a bit more learn it before i go back to it but we'll try and play that tomorrow get a squad of players and get on weird it's my first impression it's just a bit weird anyway guys that's it for today so hopefully we did okay with the score 214 we beat westy but are we gonna beat study tomographic sacrile benny central i'm not sure i
