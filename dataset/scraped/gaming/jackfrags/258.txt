you've probably read the title and gone come on now jack why you always lying but i promise i'm not so at the moment in warzone there's no regular battle rail mode they're just gone it's all buybacks always has been and buyback matches are 10 out of 10 a number of reasons why no gulag you get a free respawn up to a certain point so people tend to play a bit more aggressive i find there's no skill based matchmaking so it does have that random fun feeling that the game had in the first few weeks after it came out in march last year and not everyone uses the same gun so you can actually use non-meta weapons and be competitive and not want to rub gravel into your eyes thus i introduced to you the double sniper loadout ironsight spr swiss31 now admittedly this isn't a great loadout and this concept has been done before and it was tomographic the mad lad that he is that suggested that i try this out after he had rip-roaring success with it and i've given up on it because i did this a few weeks ago playing with tommo acolyte and stone i had some great games in normal vr we got a couple of victories but i accidentally deleted the footage because i'm a fool get this though in one of the games i spotted a goo lager flying in not parachuting so they were moving super fast whipped out the iron sight spr and bang headshot first time they fell to the ground and were ejected from the match now you may not believe me but that did happen and to prove i'm not full of sugar-free dessert recipes i think stone mountain was streaming at the time if you were ever so inclined to search for evidence of such a feat i digress so today we did it and i didn't delete the footage this time double sniper loadout this is a great game and every kill in this match is with a sniper and there's a bit of variation too we've got some nice long range looping bullet kills bit of chaos alongside some up close and personal quick shots with that lovely spr reminds me of the car 98 from day of defeat for some reason maybe i'm just weird so here we go then as always a big thank you to all these legends using my code in the cod store jack frags in caps thank you very much if you enjoyed the video
