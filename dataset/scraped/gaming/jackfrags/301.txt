i founded some bf1 gameplay today we're here we're back again we're playing on galicia i went with the gewehr 98 sniper i don't think so mate which might be first there's a lot of enemies here and that was not a headshot guys these guys have got to stop proning [Music] it's not conducive to your health when you're just lying prone in a big field not a great tactic you know oh falsely boss oh my god look at all the no that's that's too many snipers that's i mean i know it's that kind of map but that's come on now that's another level of snipers oh hello it's like a big rainbow effect they updated didn't they oh we ran into that oh let's go baby i say that completely ironically by the way i don't actually i don't you know i'm not a let's go baby ow i didn't it was it was a joke i promised it was this joke i am pinned down right now man teammate next to me just died oh no bombs yeah that's the thing with operations on this game there were two vehicles coming i like this hey hey stop that stop stop showing your rainbows oh god i'm suppressed how am i not dead i should be so dead right now king mikey hey good going with the sniping brother you're doing a good job i'm proud of you not like this you see that guy he was just crawling on top of the plane i think they were moving between the seats on the plane that's cool i do have cables though so i could i get a good shot here maybe disable the engine [Music] okay so did you see that then the rainbow effect is that good but it's actually shining through the rocks oh we got the shot oh man i love this game what goodbye i don't know what those noises were early i'm on one today i think i had too much g4 that's i don't i don't drink g4 that's the lie as well i've already told a couple of lies to you today guys i'm sorry i need to die though because i've got ammo i'll change class or something ah oh yeah okay fair enough there it is it was well overdue it was coming and i'm dead it's fine oh man they are all over that a point they friendlies yeah they're friendlies there's a tank there i'm a sniper here come on i know you want to stand still shut the medic in the face no no i can't really do much about that vehicle can i it's a big lad oh so shiny that's a shiny if you just stand oh no i needed to aim higher up all i wanted was them to stand still that's all you ever want is a sniper in it like i think you can get good in practice right hit the lead shots but it's so much easier when they're still still i get the horse in a bit too high there oh it's so good guys if you've never sniped in this game you're missing out like the sniping in bf1 magnifique i think it's because the bullet velocity so high oh wait hey look don't even need to see him just shoot in the general direction i'm gonna check out b see what that's like it's fine there's no one shooting at me i don't understand no i don't see that guy's head i'm literally literally out in the open oh there we go nice medic was taken out oh no i overcompensated they're behind the tree what are you doing in a tree no i need more kills oh my god what they're all they're all just pearl what are they doing guys you can't just go prone you got to go play the objective but okay we won that's just the first bit though right they get another i think they get another go they still got two defenses left okay well that's way more sniping i mean oh the train i forgot about that they got the zebra train it's op isn't it okay absolutely mad mad thomas the tank engine thomas the dank engine heavy bomber why not okay so it's not really sniping but you know i can't doubt i can't turn down the opportunity for the ilia murmurs right there's a guy there he's dead i think he's dead as well he's dead maybe i'm gonna die as well oh god oh god oh god oh god it's fine it's fine well that will that work i think that's fine i think it's it's fine isn't it [Applause] what the you yo yo yu-gi-oh killed by the train why did i say you go what's maybe maybe someone slipped me a g fuel or something i don't oh no okay we're gonna relax and we're just gonna go back to sniping because that's clearly it's arguably the most fun thing to do in the game ever there ever was never will be ow who was that was rude that was really oh god they're looking at me now from everywhere i'm on 11 hp guys i don't even know who i am anymore or what this is but hey it's a video as long as i can you know get those satisfying headshots i just get tea bagged by a horse is that what happened there i don't know how i feel about that out of bounds you kidding i don't want to be i don't want to be out of bounds dice there's no cover either horse i see what you're doing horse i know your game damn it yes horse come over here horse and we'll see what happens i know you want some i will give you oh god no no no stop looking at me i have a large stain for this vehicle this might be oh that's like he's put his shield up have a go oh my god look i'm all here oh someone hit them already right because i need to get it sanitated oh god go away vehicle no are we cool we're cool let's gas it's not cool i'd like to go in here go away oh oh the trade kill come on i deserve that one didn't i horse come here come here horse horse stop of course i just want to talk i just wanted to talk i have a carrot for you it's all it was yes again just wanting to talk they can't help themselves are we being bombed right now no we need um we need the big we need the big assault players to come take it out that's what we need i mean there's like no leader all there is there that distance there is here oh where'd they in the trench i went in the trench surprisingly unsurprisingly i should say there are a lot of trenches on this map oh he's got his little shield isn't he look at that mate i've got medics though you got a shield i've got medics that bullet you shot me with gone nothing just used a bit of cryogel there and cut that out not biggie no big deal hey no i can't they're actually there aren't they they've got their shield look shoot do the gap it's that simple that's all you got to do are they taking b with the train they may actually be taking b right we've got to get over there then yeah there's a surprising amount of enemies on the point right now give me that kit hell regal oh it's on it's on now yes get out of there i love this thing so good there's a train gone now no it's still there oh there's someone i think they were doing like a charge there all right we got it back it's fine i might be able to hit it 24 damage look it's nearly dead has it gone more to me though am i the only one hitting this lads come on give me a bit of an assist here i'm being resupplied too i'm gonna keep firing i think it's fine back at me now part damaged yes [Music] the horse ran into it come on we've nearly taken it out we can do it it's like a few more hits lads come on one more shot that's gotta be it yes that guy gopro in there die this game is sick absolutely love this game no ted was it you that was resupplying me ted the whole time thank you man i appreciate you ted ted i need ammo ted ted please thank you you're the best ted i'm literally just running across the middle of an open battlefield and it's fine it's fine what you've got to do all you've got to do is keep jumping like this and no one will ever hear you don't worry everything's gonna be okay oh it's brian brian i know you want this yes no i thought that was going to try and take it i thought it was empty zing brazilian i see you seven six five four three two one sing they just did a roly-poly instead of reviving me i unbelievable you know there's a there's a time and a place for that thing right and it's not it's not in the middle of this war zone what all right see you later i'm not going back there again i was quite enjoying using that hell wheel no more i can't use it anymore it's gone and i could just switch to an assault class and you know pick it again but a bit too much effort there isn't it i mean that's like at least what four or five clicks so if i've got it in me i'm back on my sniping now i just killed the coal mine every time i look at people their heads explode that's a really really bad superhero ability to have isn't it just look at someone and their head explodes although it could be good but what if you couldn't control it and every time you looked at someone their head exploded whether you wanted it to or not like i don't know it's probably not ideal is it you're not really a high functioning part of society then are you every time you look at someone's head it just just explodes not great oh here we go oh yes killed the coal mine again i'm sure i saw a shiny then dick 54 that's big 44's brother just gotta keep going for the shinies look at him shining look at him shine i'm sorry they just dodged that bullet oh man hey timmy we're in the thick of it here mate keep your head down for that big lng though timmy you're doing great great grenade love that love that energy i don't know where that don't know where that went oh we've got the big crossbow energy as well timmy is living the dream right now i put one of those over there look they've only got 17 tickets they're obviously not gonna do it but i've had fun i've had fun here hopefully you guys have enjoyed watching it too i like this game i think it's good ow oh dice dice now he's sliding along the ground i think i was suppressed there's a full dice please moment right there wasn't it let's be honest with ourselves yeah but overall i

leave a comment thank you it's a great way to support me this horse is going absolutely ham just wanted to carry it back down though gg gg well played i gotta go right see you later bye [Music] by the beginning of 1916 it was becoming increasingly clear that russia could no longer sustain the losses from several failed operations while maintaining loyalty to the autocratic and ever more dysfunctional monarchy of tsar nicholas ii if the austro-hungarians had managed to halt the first busill off advance inflicting further wounds on russia it is likely that anger amongst the people at home would have ignited the revolution immediately leading to the bolsheviks pulling russia out of the war before the winter set in a huge blow to the allied alliance
