Call of Duty warzone has been out for a week now and I'm sure that we've all been having a great time battling it out to the end game over the course of that week though there has been some crazy stuff caught on camera I've certainly experienced my fair share too for example I found this grenade launcher on the ground in the bank vault here and it's probably my new favorite thing in the game here we pretended to be an ac-130 and rain down some paint from above really satisfying but it is the rarest thing to find in the game one other trick that I've learnt is spray tagging people bright yellow while I'm waiting in the gulag this allows you to see them way more clearly when you fight them as this is such a dark area but you paint them yellow or red and they stand out like a sore thumb I've also witnessed some more insane clips posted on the cod warzone subreddit so today I'll pick my favorites and we'll be looking at more crazy things that you can do in this game we're kicking things off here with dood 7 1 2 9 his squad is currently engaged in an incredibly dangerous helicopter vs. helicopter battle it's difficult to aim on these things though when you think oh maybe he's just gonna shoot them all down but no dude aim is true deposits the c4 triple kill mid air helicopter to helicopter triple kill ridiculous next of earnest fear I did not realize you could do this so Ernest is currently on their own in the squad they're up against three people but they get the UAV drone out ok useful for bit of recon maybe marking the targets what's going to happen back so as it turns out if a remote drone flies into a helicopter the helicopter loses but no you know I guess being sent to the Gulag hurts it hurts really bad but at least you have a chance to get yourself back to the game and rush gambino here they don't just win they do install check this up [Applause] oh that is a move that John wick himself would be proud of not sure how proud of de booter here he would be though but let's just watch beautiful snipe falls down a ladder and dies that's just so unlucky but I suppose it does happen to us or tallywacker here chilling out looks like mid-game just waiting for the next zone to move really spots an enemy on the roof over there pulls out the Joker now we know how good this thing can be they lock on fire the shot now pay attention what's that in the sky it's the enemy's teammate it's just one the ghoul I can come back in yeah you can land here it's safe oh sorry Joker lines on your head goodbye solos have just been added to the game they are quite sweaty and quite difficult but apparently this was space koalas first wind and what we've been seeing in solos is people camping in helicopters like this right at the end how is koala going to win this one luckily they've got a gas mask so that will give them a few more seconds they continue to shooter the chopper and the enemy jumps out but you've got to reload both your guns man you're gonna be in trouble oh okay so the dudes own helicopter falls out of the sky crashes next to them and blows them up that is really unfortunate next up send is this guy playing Call of Duty or battlefield I'm not sure midair parachute kill rocket on a car 1v1 on the ground that's a great play this is another great play from one-trick wolf but maybe a different type of skill they've dropped in start of the game haven't found a gun into the chopper someone lands on the blades he gets her down he gets a second down but finding that guy mid-air then Mario Boop guy on the roof splat and there's one more I think from this squad you can't hide from one trick wolf he will chop you up like yesterday's cheese is that the best pilot in the war zone maybe this is another great helicopter play from Cal's hero the helicopter doesn't have any guns on it of course you can have teammates on the side who can shoot for you but who needs teammates of guns when the helicopter itself is a weapon if you are a budding helicopter pilot though watch out for Paul Sharkey this guy has got a precision air strike a car 98 sniper rifle and a whole lot of patience so he calls in the airstrike on the chopper they of course have a warning for that so they get out of there fast and this is one of the most patient well calculated shots I've ever seen no joy [Music] now that's a long way down to the ground for that guy and a hell of a shot this next clip from Neptune assassin I think demonstrates the anarchy of war zone there's only 39 players left we're getting towards endgame and this guy's down fortunately his friend Killzone here he's been an absolute mud lad in the blue Jeep he runs an enemy player down who's about to kill him starts reviving him unfortunately there's a Rover coming over but no big deal assassins got that c4 boom quick thinking smart play love that teamwork I think c4 in general is so useful in warzone though this clip from spicy meatballs just that's perfectly timed and aimed throw with the detonation hits the triple someone get the popcorn squid legs here two being chased by attack Rover with his mates it's so obvious but it works so well just a bit of c-4 on the road it's also great for setting traps the Mandalorian here taking a break from protecting baby Yoda put some c4 on the heli Matt Center he gets in and that is all she wrote there's no getting back from that one this next clip is insane so for a bit of context it's really really late game the final circle is closing and they spawning their teammate run done done unfortunately the guy that bought it back goes down and this is the perspective of run and you're slowly parachuting back in to the water still have one squad mate alive but it's getting pretty hectic they go down now at the moment it's a 1v1 be one and let's just watch and see what happens this is crazy Rondon done find somewhere safe in the final zone but he's way up high the other two players fight and one of them remains victorious now it's a one versus one will he go for the pistol kill I don't know it might be a bit risky that guy's probably got armor and he could easily look up and kill run done done here before he can take him out with that pistol but I think he's playing this really well here we go unbelievable the cattle flood execution to win the game after that last minute coach respawn that was just so impressive the patience on that dude I think that war zone victory should go down in history as one of the greats and this is another great takedown from general Spice but instead of being right at the end of the game this one's right at the start and I think you'd be quite annoyed if this happens to you but general Spice just perfectly goes this guy gets the takedown get in the gulag Roman banana here playing 40 chess while everyone else is playing 2d checkers in this clip Wendy's and Friends learn just how dangerous helicopters can be when went here in the Jeepers obviously figured out that this is in fact the best weapon in the game splats one against the fence and I need some home and proven there splats the second they've got time to reverse and then cleans up for the third some absolutely quality driving there the final clip for today is from sticky garage now they've been sent to the Gulag pretty early on in the game but that is a tasty one hit kill headshot there from a revolver that I know we all absolutely hate to use but this guy made it work so they're released from the gulag and there's absolutely no hesitation they drop right on where they were fighting before quick down with the pistol turns around gets the second one get stuck in the BI station it's okay we'll deal with it 180 turns around finishes off that squad for the triple kill and gets the revenge now that is a hell of a comeback play straight from the Gulag with that said that is all for today I hope you enjoyed this guy's let me know your thoughts down in the comments and also which clip was
