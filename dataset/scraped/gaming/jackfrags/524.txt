operation underground with the shotgun the m18 97 let's do this it is really stuttery though isn't it i think i know why though it's because this is the first time that i've played this map since i installed my new motherboard and see for you guys please thank you for whatever reason the first time you play a new map it stutters like crazy i think it's because it's building the shaders but i'm going to try and force my way through this give this kind of melee not a bad start i think we might carry this on even though it's just throwing a bit it should get better i'm sure that it didn't used to do the same bf1 did it that kind of thing but it doesn't be a five normally on the second map load it's all right i will live with it for now see how it goes ah how was that a one-hit kill oh the range on this is mad absolutely mad i just fancied using a shotgun today you know now bit too far away for that one only 10 damage there gonna get closer what then so every new area of the map that we go into it's gonna stutter a bit we just prone on the ground but as long as we go everywhere it should stop it's supposed to clear up when it's done all the shaders there's loads of people hearing this mg nest alright mate oh my god you just wander over them [Music] deletion protocol call this that's insane that is absolutely ridiculous one-shot kill potential i thought you were there goodbye [Laughter] this is so stupid so dumb we've nearly taken the entire map as well chill here for a sec and then we'll try and jump in through one of the windows maybe there's one here we can use hey it's me shotgun guy oh my god that's that's too many people in there how did we actually do that 16 just charge through oh look in the chat are you done they have a chair report jackfrag save youtube onechi it doesn't matter noob wow all right maybe they think i'm cheering out he cries all the time i don't know if that guy's referencing me but i don't cry all the time only one only when i look in the mirror feel the sense of dread and anxiety about the duality of the human race is he a cheeser grenade i'm gonna go with yes jack france is no cheater yes oh come on oh he's in the bookcase what was that right it's time for these guys sorry i chet i use big chest i use the big chest nobody can catch me because you have small balls wow tiny balls like peanuts oh god this is too funny and it's cheap by the way no it's chet dude's corrected me my spell in there i don't think it matters in a game of battlefield does it imagine if it had spell checking it or something ea fixing everyone's grammar one in-game insult at a time love to see it is he really checking what jess i've already told you it's chest not chechen not cheetah chest this thing is so stupid okay oh here we go here we go oh one peak too many i should have stayed back never mind 25 and two not a bad start at all is it not a bad start jack frank's like the youtube beer i'm fake chet how can you have same account name twice a simple i use a spoofer do you want link to chat answer do you want link to chat see if he says yes give me bro okay does this dude really believe me well this game will be a comfortable win i have to say hi stop shooting it's me dude here a little hedge smash them shotguns are so much fun in this game not many uh maps you could use them on there just open ground on the bigger maps and they are useless as they rightfully should be on those kind of maps the guy here i don't know if it's worth aiming with it i got peppered me maybe if you got the slug i don't know the drilling is still my favorite though take this ammunition by far the most satisfying shotgun in the game let me get this res there protect your kill death ratio my friend no problem jack rags i send you friend invite okay i'll send you chest 4.99 for one month i think that's a good deal isn't it you pay oh there it is that's good [Music] oh yeah chat that's that's it isn't it how yeah chest makes complete sense that's
