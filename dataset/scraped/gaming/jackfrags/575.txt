before we start talking about what made the gameplay of battlefield 1 great let's first see some of that special reveal trailer to this day i still think it's one of the best reveal trailers for any battlefield game it just hits all the right notes when seven nation army kicks in goosebumps of course the trailer is one thing but the game then had to deliver well how about 25 million unique players does that qualify as delivering i'd say so let me just preface this by saying that that's not sales that's unique players bf1 came out at a time where there were other avenues available to play triple a games other than shelling out full price mainly ea and origin access being able to play the game and many others for a small monthly subscription is quickly becoming the norm alongside that there were lots of free weekends but even still we can't take away the fact that 25 million unique players mean something and it means that players really engaged well with bf1 and i think in the beginning bf1 was super popular because it was incredibly different and unexpected previous games had been modern but the series took a complete u-turn and went not to world war two but world war one of war that most people are not as familiar with this did the game a massive favor because there were a lot less expectations of what theaters of war weapons armies and vehicles were going to be in the game no one saw it coming it was just completely outside of the box yeah sure it wasn't a super realistic depiction of what happened in world war one instead it was almost like a fantasy version of the great wall now probably the biggest marketing point of bf1 was behemoths we saw them in the reveal and then they featured quite heavily in trailers that would follow the airship was a scary thing to see in the sky when you got into a game but seeing it set on fire and crash into the map when you've taken one down is a sight to behold for me it's still the most epic behemoth in the game there are others of course the armored train which is a little more restrictive and at times feels like an easy target but also the dreadnought there was even a super tank added down the line as well the impressive thing is that these huge vehicles are all player controlled you've got one player who can move them about quite slowly mind you but still it's possible and then other players man the guns and rain down hell from above or from the sides there are definitely these grand crescendo moments of maps that genuinely had the fear factor although if you're in a team that isn't working very well it could also be incredibly frustrating moving on next to the gun play i wasn't entirely in love with the gunplay in bf1 i have to be honest and lots of members of the community felt the same way but others actually enjoyed it because it moved towards a more accessible and simple model guns didn't have much recoil so they were pretty easy to control and they didn't even have attachments like in previous games instead of attachments there were different variants or packages of guns depending on your style of play a variant might have given you better hip fire up close or better accuracy at range and some people definitely prefer this simplistic system you get a pre-determined weapon that is really good at one particular thing there were a couple of all-rounders in there too other players preferred a more versatile system liking bf3 or bf4 where you have actual attachments that you can fully customize and i'd say that the setting of the game was somewhat more limiting than the previous games being a world war one game but there were definitely options there if that was a route dice wanted to take in terms of the guns though there were a few personal standouts for me the martini henry oh that's at the top when i first used that gun it was so satisfying when you fire it it almost shakes your soul around it's just so good with a few well placed shots you're going to be struggling to find a more exciting gun to use it was tweaked since the launch of the game mind you but it's still great fun and of course simply due to nostalgia we've got other iconic weapons like the bar m1918 i love this gun in bf1 you have to be careful mind you because those 20 bullets go very soon and how can we forget the iconic hell regal this was a prototype weapon that didn't see real combat but in the context of bf1 i don't think that mattered it was a beast of a weapon that you could get those insane multi kills with of course if you wanted to be the true sweat you could always crack out the automatico and we all know how marmite that gun is to people shotguns in this game too were brilliant and so much fun to use we've all been there on argonne forest with the hunter don't pretend like you haven't even if you not want to use a shotgun i know that you've definitely had one used against you on those close range maps and then finally probably my favorite thing about the gun playing bf1 the sniping and i'll go back to what i said earlier about the gunplay being more accessible well sniping is no exception to that it's certainly nowhere near as difficult as it was in bf3 especially bf4 where it was quite tough landing a headshot in this game though and hearing the sound seeing the helmet fly off it's addictive simple but incredibly rewarding sniper sprees in bf1 it's one of the first things that i think of when i'm reminiscing about this game the thing with the bf1 sniping is that it allows you to play really aggressively or defensively depending on whatever you've picked one of the reasons for that of course was the sweet spot mechanic each sniper had a certain range where it would always be a one-hit kill to the torso the gun playing bf1 some loved it some hated it it wasn't everyone's cup of tea and some people will absolutely have thought that it was maybe too casual or too accessible but ultimately there were a lot of fun weapons in there to use the vehicle gameplay in bf1 i had from there too i recall the light tank being incredibly fun in the early days of bf1 especially on sinai desert to be fair it was probably a bit overpowered then and it did get nerfed down the line but the idea of this smaller more mobile tank was interesting the gameplay in the f1 was so analog you had horses for example you could travel around the map on a horse farm and get enemies with your lever action as you went and then five seconds later you could be fighting a tank by galloping around it and throwing grenades at it all while on top of your horse it sounds crazy on paper but it's just something so different and refreshing horses were used a lot during world war one in certain theaters of war and it definitely brought a unique gameplay element to a battlefield game that none had before and probably we won't ever get to see a game one big element of the feeling of physicality in bf1 was the improved movement system being able to slide which initially may not have been to everyone's taste but now it would feel weird to play a battlefield game without being able to do that double vault was great as well offering up new ways to get around the map when it came to game modes bf1's big swan song was operations it was essentially a large scale version of rush but you would progress over multiple maps that were designed to be narratively linked to one another based on their relation and stories of world war one rush yeah great mode from previous games especially bad company 2 and bf3 and operations was a way of taking that to the next level huge maps designed specifically for this mode with multiple days for each if one team was struggling and ended up losing a couple of days a behemoth would come in to help them out and then if the attacking team would win it would progress onto the next map it was a cool concept that tried to really embody that you were in a war that could last a number of days we also saw the introduction of front lines and breakthrough here two game modes that have definitely picked up some fans along the way wrapping things up here one of the biggest talking points in the marketing and build-up for bf1 was all about the physicality of the game and just how brutal it was and you absolutely felt that when you played the melee takedowns are definitely brutal so visceral and there are all sorts of variants too baseball bats covered in barbed wire knives cricket bats even a shovel none of those things i'd imagine you want to be hit with and it was of course the bayonet charge both brutal and incredibly frustrating at the same time some loved it some hated it i felt like there was a lot of that in this game but the physicality and the brutalness of bf1 goes further than that the most iconic thing about this game i think is the overall atmosphere of it and every map really made you feel involved in a big battle the scale of everything the sky boxes the dogfights the horses the tanks infantry fighting grenades exploding clouds of gas off in the distance there was something unique to battlefield 1 the art style everything just came together perfectly and who could forget about the class pickups that you could find on certain levels there was the sentry that guy had a suit of armor and an ngo8 heavy machine gun could also come to be a perrosa machine gun too which honestly is deadly especially on a map like fort bowe you could also find the flame trooper who as you may expect has a flamethrower and then there was a tank hunter my favorite like i had the tanker there which was meant to be for taking out tanks and planes but let's be honest we all just used it to one shot kill infantry more elites were added with the dlc but if you came up against any of them you were in trouble but damn they were fun to use i also feel like quentin scar is in my top 5 battlefield maps ever made just a unforgettable combined arms map all in all going back to battlefield 1 now has given me the appreciation for just how good it was the best compliment i can give is when a game is just fun it looks great it plays great sure there are some things that i don't like but when you launch into a map the atmosphere is undoubtedly fantastic and the gunplay while simplistic is just so satisfying with particular weapons and with that said that is all for today guys i hope you
