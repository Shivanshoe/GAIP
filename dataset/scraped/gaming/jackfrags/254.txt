we're just getting straight into it today guys buying back solos gonna use the mp5 today modern warfare mp5 apparently you've got a secret buff the 10 millimeter 30 round mag was changed on the sly i watched a couple of videos by two game data and jay god and they did really good breakdowns of everything it's a weird looking knife are you going to paint me again a little bit rusty [Applause] what were you doing there so i'll be equipping that mp5 when i get my load the long and short of it okay is need some of the stairs fine that's an absolute dab right there hello i'm just trying to get through the door mate yeah it'll be great for solos so i wanted to try and solos but because of the reload speed on the mp5 and the fact that you only get 30 bullets like trios and quads it just isn't gonna cut it [Applause] but i really like solos and um there's a guy here isn't there buybacks are really fun i like buybacks a lot are you just on the roof oh yeah i think they're okay it's not normal solos my dude yeah so i mean it's quite an exciting slide here five kills in the bag already i think i hear someone don't know if they're on my level though ah nice kill man ak i played that's good player that is guitar by the movement we did have enough though didn't spend any of that cash so go back down there there's a little fight going on get an akma on here [Applause] i think they're both in this thought done for there seems like an eternity when you're trying to get that rpg out if you don't have that that's a good fight oh it's a low ts great smg that is all right let's try this mp5 pretty competitive i mean it doesn't have the mobility of the cold war smg's there's a guy there wasn't and one behind me being this kid not bad at that distance you're gonna push i want to get my ghost load out because i i feel like i need it and there's another one behind me that's not cool let's even get this guy first they don't seem to be moving [Applause] right there ttk is really good with this uh 10 millimeter they go inside i thought they were right there how they've gone left uh oh there was two that was a different guy that might be the guy that i just killed damn it i wonder if i'll have time to go back there [Music] maybe i think we'll be all right but the gas is pushing isn't it right in the edge there that load up slow side though so it could be all right grab this gun hopefully they're not here still assists right one of them's dead i loot the front of that orange bit isn't it i think let's get whatever i can i've already got one didn't get the mp5 okay not bad although i need more cash now otherwise i'm done what was that there's a little babbler there [Applause] debbie still not enough cash though there are 50 still active good hunting i've got three spectators to eliminate the bounty target well i think that car is my bouncy they're driving around like they're playing mario kart [Applause] and now someone's shooting um [Applause] this is good i like observing there's some gunfights up there hello another sniper there the bounty's going up dead the bounty target is is happening right now that was creeping up on me all right i gotta move i cannot stand these rocks like the worst part of the map and you have to try and get them after you've just crossed over that giant valley what's this lad doing here of course because it's buybacks there's trucks everywhere are you stuck i get out it's a bad idea should have stayed in the truck oh i thought i could get it more rocks please dice is that real or is that a parachute no i think that's real [Music] what did he say yes it's clear something got a nice bit of high ground here just checking no one's creeping up on every soldier that'd be the guy just killed all right there's no i mean they're back in the lobby now [Applause] and i've got enough cash in case i get sniped but i do have that self rest too no one on there i'd love to get this though because i don't have my perks risky which one is it i need to like name it properly [Applause] how did i get headshot then don't see anyone there i think i'm clear on this side bound to be someone on bank there i'm surprised i haven't seen anyone although those buildings are all still in so people just probably are like on different floors in there oh that's a little idea the solos right chill player the worst kind of war zone player second to a cheater i would say you've got cheaters they're the worst and then you've got right shield players well that that's how i feel about it anyway i have to close the gap here i think that's right shield mad they're shooting at me love tempered though and you saved so many place end game where is it from though not one guy there in bangkok [Applause] someone just died and i don't need to move at the moment i think so [Applause] sometimes you can hit them in the side of the head there when they're moving but the gas has gone all the way over there so i'm ruined let's do oh that's like shot again oh my god [Applause] well i'm just in here okay it's me versus right shield i think yeah two left [Music] [Applause] you know i'm going to grab the car because how else am i going to kill this guy i would like to play the phone nuts [Applause] all right here we go [Music] yes well i can't put that on youtube [Laughter] he was not happy oh god he was not happy at all well that was a good game i enjoyed that mp5 though it was good man i mean i know there was a few swiss kills there as well but yeah it seems like a really good choice for solos anyways thank you for watching guys if you enjoyed it leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one bye [Music] [Music] you
