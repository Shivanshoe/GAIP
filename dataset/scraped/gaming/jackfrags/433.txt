got just keeps on missing i got the down on that first guy i don't want to see him vagina that ground luke pellington is awful isn't it like there's just no redeeming practice like 30 meters it's okay drops massively i'm high threat but how thomas are they on the roof or maybe they're just over the way are they in the are they in the point could be underneath no idea where he is in the plane could be let's move over wait there's threat three where is this guy here somewhere it has to be within 50 meters so on the roof or right two i'm not as loose been taking protect at all costs it could be underneath do you want to head to the flag anyway let's start doing that he's actually memed away that's tooth right now is this the real meme i'm on the flaggy boy we know we know we know yeah he just shot us by them no [Music] we've got a lot of cash already we have indeed where's our nearest buy all the way back where we started i think roof makes more sense he's not just following us there i am i hear his steps i think he's i can't tell because the vertical audio is so scuffed oh [Music] let's get our actual guns not messed up remember we need to switch okay right drop in as a healer thank you all right appreciate that what tommy's not talking to us he doesn't know where's my phone i just i dropped it and you never took it okay there's money there's this might look blue it's just

really one that closed superstore yikes we'll have to brave it yeah we'll have to just have to suck it up take it like a man is anyone on roof someone twins mark the target oh wow good mark you can see miles away that is an insane mark at 600 meters so i'm just rezzed [Music] it looks like potatoes over there why are they landing so close to us though i don't know it's weird maybe he's got walls on then he can just see it the lobby would be deleted if there was a hacker well that's the experiment today cameron i'm really happy that you said that because oh they're still cheaters in the game of this video they said they banned loads was it enough i don't know have we seen any cheaters since the band wave last tuesday i personally haven't but i know other people said they have i mean there's been some sass moments but nothing concrete you know nothing obvious no blatant cheaters i would say no i just got the raider stock on i started yes yeah it is did he jump out the truck i got the guy i killed him i killed him um oh he's coming oh yeah we're now being sniped down one there we go sniper there's a beamer you guys still being shot from that's what i wanted a couple of shots

they're just like congratulations here's here's your token you did your participation trophy well that was a decent first game there a bit of action a couple of snipes hello to everyone in the chat thank you for watching appreciate you guys being here that was pretty intense wasn't it pretty intense indeed uh father time thank you for the 10. the hackers seem to be a bit restricted but they're still very much alive and well yeah it's interesting i mean since that big band wave we've not come across any really obvious ones but i want to see today if we get some uh hefty harry thank you for the 20. keep up the great work harry that's very kind of you man what's up k burley hey sam the marine a.m sink skull it nick daximus how's it going guys so we're back on the warzone streams it's been a while the last time a stream war zone was in december but i feel like the game's in a decent state again now so i'm happy to start firing up the streams again and these are the typical crew that i'll be playing with here they're all good lads what's up brandon and mayor thank you for the two that's very kind it's great to see you guys here tom thank you for the ten treat yourself to a cheeky starbucks latte i will tom thanks where do i see warzone going in 2021 paddock oh man i mean there's a there's a lot of rumors about a new map in march you know for the year one anniversary so you know that'd be really great to see a new map or a refresh of this map tons of new points of interest stuff like that oh that guy just disappeared right before my very eyes i'd like to see a couple more limited time game modes i'd like to see better focus on anti-cheat weapon balance you know i'd love to see them kind of fix up the the cold war attachments and everything but i think the game's pretty fun at the moment you know the met is in a good place lots of viable options for guns so i'm enjoying it ah come on should have been a headshot all right that's enough now we do this for real got a couple new members here today as well i appreciate you guys thank you paula field it's very kind of you and lauren thank you very much lauren sometime from maui brandon do you think the dmr is

frederick you just got home from the dentist painful yeah you'll be all right man you'll be all right what's up auntie jaggers how's it going first time you see me live yeah i should have good time today donna thanks for the five right let's do this all right boys let's do this oh he's sticking with the flagstrap right here to start with okay because you know if we did position there easily yeah funny because there's no tanks is there yeah in warsaw they're weird i suppose there were tanks in yeah ground wars where you'd be killing the tanks i'd be surprised if they well i wouldn't be surprised if they added a marker a tank mode similar vehicle vehicle on the side there it's warning steam and we can nearly get loadout [Music] be until you're dead is there still a guy on blue there's some crates in here still i think you're ready entering the area [Applause] raglan question is does he have sufferers early um if he's peaking you know he knows what's up there's a lot of people at tv this was clear right he quit the game he quit the game yes i just got credit for the down without the actual thing popping up oh wait a satchel i'll be taking that i'll drop my money and somebody can go buy a loadout oh yeah we should buy the lady i dropped my money 200. i mean started to secure this it might give us a better money [Music] come on [Applause] oh there's another one here you can take it one place in here if you need oh i get it because it sounds like ffar yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah genius he jumped up to the top i saw him on blue and then he fell down again okay he might even be because i feel like he might have fallen and he can't get out now he's going back out the ladder but let's come back okay you can actually see him on the over the top when he comes out ready three two one and oh oh oh nice shot if your shot didn't hit him i think all of our shots would have hit there just bang four bullets in there that was a good start that was good when i saw him come up the ladder the first time it's already popped up yeah someone got their loadout over here just so you know no my last name isn't frank's but that's uh that would be interesting worth taking yeah ground load blessing oh no baba he was probably the victim of an early game wiping recon contract ready someone's got their load out here yeah there's people shooting at the top of that tower from hospital i'm just gonna yolo it because why why the hell not okay uav maybe you're going up there come yeah why not you good seem to be no loot taking secure that position why is purple pink was someone on there tom yeah someone's shooting up there before okay take it off that was when we were before we down the gun oh there's people over at prison just camping out yay there you know something we don't know old player dropping in on hospital on that on the heli is he in it okay where did he go did he just left he went through the roof or something i don't know wow train anyone on the train nice shot what you just look like you instantly sprinted away then let you worm it away sprint away sprint away there's a bite stadium uh someone's shooting down from he's hiding okay it's roof campers oh on the road oh yeah i just saw him peak nice shots i can't get the angle man he's called in to revive though understood we could push over if you want or we get the loading loading spaghetti oh stud oh we read stuff just hang on oh god oh god oh god i think what i think was wrong oh [ __ ] didn't let me put my shoe in time no yeah i couldn't jump up straight away for some reason just like stop me yeah oh no i fall too welcome sorry i can get my guns and then get loaded out again all right with this guy get ready to fight your name it's the only load out there so you should be good here and you return to the problem sort them out or capture the nice play there glitch very [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay can i get my loading is it clear yeah yeah lonely i'm pushing over towards it now oh yeah we should all get already get your load out sir thank you i'm on for a doughnut game boys zero kills this is or we can grab the next one though there is another one in front of us you can get just around here isn't it we'll be fine don't worry just huddle together as a group model shouldn't i that's exactly what i should do friendly uav overhead [Music] there is somebody on the parliament building [Music] yeah yeah i felt it you get yourself stuff uh okay i just don't care either way yeah do you want to die in the game does anyone want this you must be going oh maybe i did oh yeah i did this is going to end up in farmland yeah farmy should we do that recon yeah we should oh hello there hello there there he's jumping he's jumping so that he can see the edge and the other guy's back whoever goes back on the roof try and clear the ripping in a second shot from blue and he broke me you guys are serious yeah they're jump peeking to get an edge oh it's cool there are people hunting the song so they're edging us we could just go stadium i just i don't like the balls in it broke the guy in the ground floor of purple one's left of blue as well like here somewhere moving now the one underneath purple pink yeah he's still there sniping and what are you doing from some random angle annoying that was the centex where'd that come okay i just thought you know i i eat it see if it works it's all right horrible position i was doing [Music] [Music] 2021 playing recon plugs freak on flags online hey it's preparation for battlefield 6. conquest yeah we just played guys did anyone ever play the capture the flag game mode in battlefield i was all right in bf3 the maps were awesome dlc oh my the bikes yeah yeah end game what was your favorite they've just fallen off the building what was your favorite bf13 content update aftermath perhaps yeah aftermath and the best maps i quite like the cqb i like the cqb update though uh close quarters yes like the destruction was insane oh yeah that was great because you could like shoot a hole through the wall loved it love zebra tower they added gun game as well to that deal so didn't they yeah they did that was good i love gun games it's very fun yeah it was real good gun game battlefield six i'm surprised it was implemented as well as it was the only thing that was slightly wrong with everything going on in battlefield it was the uh the team-based combat so it was 12v12 gun game it was a bit weird it worked but then if your team was too good you'd actually lose yeah people could just steal your kills like bf3 didn't have assist cancer's kill so you could just like shoot someone once in the leg and get the kill surprisingly i was thinking blue well stodd said that somebody fell off of it and they just died if they hit the floor they got sniped from off the wire oh interesting pretty sure it's going to be hot round this by somewhere there'll be a team i reckon friendly uav over here and copy your mark in the sky over there what yeah spot on green enemy marks do we get more central yeah absolutely [Applause] [Music] i really needed [Applause] his teammate's using his right shield as cover in the window yeah i see that it's time to push did you get the finish on that no yeah i did tell my i did on on the guy that you downed yes look at this guy what's he doing sounds good look at this dude i've had two kills this entire match it's been really slow he's still peeking on the right shield down that ground floor all right the right show guys run over so there's a guy behind me there's a guy just in the field behind behind oh it's a team am i doing where the hay bales are he's broken was that the same guy that was in the building yeah um don't know i think there may be one more hiding somewhere because they're thinking it was further on did i get a team well they flanked that's it's just kind of weird that they moved that quick you know i think it was a separate team [Music] right shield like that man there's not much you can do is there yeah right why doesn't it degrade over time but the more damage it takes the less effective eventually it should break i mean yeah but enemy ui needs to be good at something right yeah but yeah the point being is that you could use it initially but you can't just stand there forever oh and you just don't have a weapon like yeah this guy's not the great thing is that you your window gets covered in bullet holes about it like what do you think the shield isn't balanced do you think it's broken i think it's pretty easy once they're moving they were really easy to hit yeah their limbs become visible but when they stood still like yeah it's a tough shot you have to you have to fly shield is really inconsistent maybe if you stun like what they're gonna do to kill you with the right field other than get right up next to you and then punch you four times i think that scene was really good but they got caught out so they died team on the wall of lumber do they see you yeah they see me i'm off this way yep i'm being run up on stay where you are stay we were it's too late it's too late it's matt 10. it's back down on mine uh stopped by yeah yeah i'll go for it they're going for the crate now team here they're running into that building they're in a fight tom watch out watch out they're in a fight with me there you go they got positioned on me right here they are pushing over pushing over i'm clustering of course nice um roof where roofware literally right here i'm being high alerted from this building on blue guys thank you jack that's right should we move for zone you want to move on um they are someone's aiming me from is he in there yeah he's in there he's in there there's a team on this hill next to the blind we're about to get pushed into our back side so i'll just be careful yeah i'm moving yeah he's pushing back to yellow okay i'm pushing to you guys now oh come on people behind guys right the way over here yeah oh sorry i'm green sorry i can't see any of those guys so much right in front of me here there was two others there that i saw max i think literally here on green behind that little boy hill do you want to dip out the back maybe yeah we're gonna have to see okay don't worry don't worry but it's gonna keep peeking they have the movers all the push-ups enemy uav overhead this is a very very strange push well it it might pay off there is a harry over there i'm dead i'm dead you have to keep it topped up now there god stunning zero place no i'm done i'm done i'm done oh i'm lucky question they're just going to push us together yeah i know yeah yeah better [Music] oh [Music] the sweatiest lobbies today it's full sweat i think we had to combine like sub sub 15 kills i was i was straight donuts the worst thing was is maybe if we didn't kill the team on the right maybe they would have fought this yeah two kills i think misty got ready did i did i have two guys oh i feel better now i might just be lying but if it makes you feel better then thanks tom i love you it definitely wasn't zero i'll tell you that much i just can't believe you survived to that end game yeah i mean i was running running across an open field why did they not shoot me we that's great good fun no cheaters again though right uh yeah as far as we can tell i mean hopefully hopefully hopefully it was that weird i thought that was the same game actually we were just getting shot at from train station at airport like those bullets were landing right next to us consistently they're shooting us from like 800 meters away which is crazy yeah it was a good second game um yeah that's what the lobbies are like nowadays oh it's good fun though you know when it's uh competitive like that hey ross how you how you doing man good to see you yeah we were screwed there i mean they had positioning on us 4v2 there's no way we would have won that maybe you've started an airstrike but they were so spread out and just honest hey intron what's up i think we got a couple new members and donations as well thank you guys for deployment now's a good time hawker field upgraded thank you alex thanks for the 20. hardly ever awake enough to catch a stream what's up mr big boy thank you lucas cheers eduardo do you think battlefield 6 will have a br love your videos man greetings from mexico i don't think battlefield 6 will have a battle royale and i don't think it necessarily needs one either i mean if you think like ea have already got apex legends right that's their battle royale game that's what makes them a load of money so and battlefield should just be doing battlefield but saying that i would love to see a standalone frostbite engine battle royale game and this is something that i've been speaking about for about four years now you know i made a couple of concept videos on it i think that could be incredible incredibly popular because the frostbite engine's so good oh that'd be super cool uh chad thank you for the fire from atlanta you've been watching for four years that's awesome man casual norwegian thanks for becoming a member paul potential of gamers is that what pog stands for i never knew i never know what's up andre william mayer sammy how you doing sammy what's up brian eric no one plays with me because i'm too bad [Music] from india thank you

pretty good impressions of most people can i i did i posted a clip of the the alfie solomon's one and shaffer bates and jeff leach both commented saying that they could do way better so okay but they're professional voice actors they are and they've just insulted me like that and knocked me down a peg and i was like all right never again primary objective accomplishments by professional voice they don't want me to get better than them without impression is what's really happening they're like no he's going to take all right that's pretty close let's get low he goes absolutely ruin his quickly smash them into the floor like an ostrich did you say yeah then because they are just bury their heads oh ah jack jack you can do a really good impression of that baby that covers himself and feed up [Laughter] yeah i'm sure there's a market for that yeah it's marked what are you doing why are you staring at it what there it is there it is why don't you just drop it in the open so i can

plates actually no where did i get these from i'll grab a satchel where's this lad the last lad we won't have enough money will they final lad oh my what is that guy sniping all the way over there for jack he's a cheater a little bit higher i mean where's my bullet going is there something blocking that maybe maybe [Music] uh yes a cheeky red only if it's cheeky i just have to aim a lot higher yeah that's a long way away actually that's like moving 500 meters yeah 500 meters um we've got enough cash yeah yeah but someone's got it oh and cover hold on i would get loaded afterwards you don't want to just go for the one that's down there yeah that's why i mean we'll just drop you in there on the roof jack stand nice shot stop i guess it's fine i don't think you saw us jack you didn't know we were here roof is so hard to cover all the angles yeah i mean that's a good thing for yourself isn't [Laughter] of course r1 drops below and everyone else just stays up cool relocating atc guys in atc trying to account for bullet drop when there is none at that distance i don't see anybody here in the heli he's making it really easy okay just can't see through the smoke that's really annoying all right yeah they're ready to see is that on the roof yeah lighting for you there's also a heli all the way back come on yes no let me get this down do you see him between the terminals come on again i know you want to i know you want me to see there's too much smoke dude come on there's another healer further back there as well is he jumping up he just slid to the left [Music] yeah i'm pretty sure it's atc lads yeah yeah they're distracted by me they've landed the heli on the low car park back in it with a king grab the contract there's one lad he's back out i'm coming back towards you guys

driver no hit you're still shooting truck yeah atc is shooting at him as well though i see atc's head is tuning you guys yeah i can't lie though let's get munitions [Applause] any of these shots actually registering downs there you go come get it for exposed what come on okay i need to start froze we might as well myself yeah come on sniper in the window he's low level there's a team that dropped out from the heli earlier we might have a team pushing on the roof whilst we left it so just keep an eye out you want to go back up it's probably an easy way though we're just gonna yeah [Music] hills again hills with pills oh that's annoying there's more teams over here to the east if you want some snipes if i had the height on him i could have confirmed the downs you still got you're going up yeah yeah if you have an angle on purple window jack i'm down two um they might have backed off though i assume they went around the corner and got rest for the left oh i got sniped from atc yeah i see a sniper hanging over it just don't see his head i still remind the by down the guy in atc this is just we do this every time yeah it's back backwards forward backwards forwards backwards forwards there's loads of fighting going on here on blue have some money no down one over here oh silly there you go drop the money at the bottom of the cable nice enemy uav overhead i feel like we're gonna have to push across that at some point though that's the only thing oh i did it as well maybe if we down maybe we could down guy on acc one more time just push across in that moment we're not even picking it up again three two push down yeah okay let's go let's go otherwise we're just yeah uh one in the window of the house behind it yellow there marker existing [Music] nice [Music] pushing mark some gear no not anymore he just tried to spot it yeah lovely nice that was the one from yellow building thomas yeah just keep pushing along maybe watch out for atc though they got cyanus from there yeah this is probably sticking through it it's so nice this can't do anything about it but you can keep sniping sniping just keep an eye on whilst we're moving now if you can yeah i'm watching from here yeah make sure to see anything happened to the team that we're below atc yeah i'm not sure what happened there well this guy was trying to peak with an amax let's do it he's a king there's a truck coming random king yeah [Music] disabled nice he's always out good stuff they'll just have claymores not insecure well how many how many are there two two at least yeah because he keeps getting rez the guy i love bolting in this game vaulting's fun isn't it vault vault vault anywhere on this wall can i vote there you go okay [Music] we have a buy in range if you want to quickly buy uavs and stuff strike whatever in the vehicle that i marked earlier maybe no i i distracted him i distracted him oh my god he nearly bled out yourself because i was like they've got me the glint was enough to put him off this guy's still peeking this guy is speaking they love it they love it they love it they love it that's acc there's two there i thought it was the same skin two rose skins over there that one running really fast everyone has the same skin someone running across three people sniping at the same guy yeah it's not about position but after this zone we're gonna be screwed well uh maybe we work our way up towards northwest on the hills yeah if we want i feel like that's the only lodge on the roof you can actually get on the roof here jump out the window and doesn't do a 180 grab oh yeah yeah no easy yeah i think that was a trade push wesley's got another down what what happened just stunned me stunned me can you finish again [Applause] thank you i just perfectly beat my lovely [Music] [Music] three tomorrow i can drop you some yeah i'm just trying are you clear there are they still in yellow i i killed two it's only i don't know i just got sniped from atc maybe use those plates you just wait that you can't vote christina up to die to a team that was underneath him that yeah no but no idea about it there may still be a claymore up there look at all the gear in here yeah there's probably a team right here orange down top of airport broke his teammate's armor purple ping he's rising on that corner broke armor down one behind the cover tom yeah he's dashed off the left what is that man [Music] that's where we need to run is there people below us i think we might want to go now i can go first i'm going first peek in [Applause] so much damage okay we're gonna take that guy's position take that guy's position yeah he killed the guy under the bridge take red marker watch out from purple though because they can pick us from positioning online yep absolutely no there's still a guy down there thanks here underneath himself count again he's dead he should die anyway that's still in the tunnel below [Applause] we have to go yeah do you want to

there there pushing pushing pushing stunning who's making sure going left going left get going right got one mental kills like eight downs 57 well done that's well played you see that um uh that developer that we used to work on plants versus zombies has confirmed he's now working at daisolet on the next battlefield game or on the battlefield franchise yeah he was his name was um justin something hang on a minute have a look justice beaver no justin [Music] jackie you got no authority yeah it looks like um he said that he's like now working on the battlefield franchise oh dude he's working at daisola senior design director at daisola bringing some crazy to the battlefield franchise i thought soleil weren't making battlefield games anymore i thought dice la wasn't iceland anymore what's happening what's happening can we can maybe they shouldn't have confirmed that then well let's uh take some screenshots before that comes down if it does and if it does then here video one more one more for the road or the road and then uh uh someone has to see my loadout uh this is what i'm using i do think that's the best ffa r loadout going at the moment you get insane ads speed good mobility recalls crazy time to kill is insane and hdr that's my build classic hdr build um abdic thank you for becoming a member simplified thanks for the five love the content jonah what's up man thank you for the donation that's very kanye i remember your profile picture yeah yeah we play everything on low just for better performance and visibility really that's it i could switch to dmr but we're playing very uh keen today so i don't think it makes sense to go dmr when we can just keep sniping people with that hdr check your gear and weapons planes are making ready for deployment so i might stick with the uh hdr could get the stroller out for a laugh that'd be funny what's up chris mckinney how you doing any hackers no no hackers at all today and this is quite the stark contrast because a week ago and i wasn't streaming it but i was recording like almost every match we had a blatant hacker so they've obviously done something something's working [Applause] right here we might be coming up against people who are just like soft cheating like a soft aimbot or wall hack or something you know they're not just making it obvious kind of thing but i don't know it's been pretty good today i have to admit it's looking good i just hope it stays this way you know i'll get him it's been a good day so far how do you get good at pc just practice loads james practice practice get counter-strike global offensive find the sensitivity you're comfortable with and just play dust2 team deathmatch for hours [Music] virginia well it depends if anyone's landed there or or or our comms

the fastest queue like ever yeah he's already turned his pc off oh he's flatlined no he's dead he's again stop the time sponsored by accuracy will be time of death 1541. bloodlist can't i'd have i can still hear his voice in my head have the cheaters gone though yeah i banned them all you banned them all yeah the game told me said you successfully reported 60 000 people and we've congratulations that's pretty much what it said in short block list that's the blurb why do we keep getting blocked this turn around how many millions of players 105 i think they said at the earnest school right 105 million players yes right uniques or you know daily um guessing it's unique uniques i think [Music] block list dude three in a row is it a stream sniper a little baby yeah maybe they're just cute at the same time it might be time to turn the screen black come on guys lossy tweeted la soon to be rebranded are working on a shooter it isn't battlefield 6 but it is part of the battlefield series some rumblings of them using the frostbite engine too that's what i was just saying about that um that guy who just confirmed he's working at daisola on the battlefield franchise and it's not just like um like a level designer or something like that he is a senior design director what's the guy's name cam justin weeb on twitter he is j j a underscore we w i e b e j a underscore weeb and he's working with a pi [Laughter] staker and bend over on the team as well how do you spell weeb w-i-e-b-e oh yeah that's him so he was working on the plants versus zombies franchise and then last year he said that like he's going to do something else now okay um and so apparently for the last year he's been working for dice la as a senior design director that's not just uh that's not just one of your run-of-the-mill development positions and it's a breakaway um what's it called team then they're called pen island right there stop hey starts coming out with all the puns and the lead director is there mike [Laughter] yeah his profile says senior design director at daisola bringing some crazy to the battlefield franchise that's in his profile this is the same dai soleil that last year was no longer going to be daisola and wasn't going to work on battlefield anymore and now suddenly a year later they're working on battlefield and they're still called dice la interesting is it battlefield well uh full stack thank you for the 10. keep on sniping people with rockets maybe full suck maybe today we'll be doing that hey that's interesting though because daiso i mean i thought they were just

relocating come on he did not like oh there you go he's just dropped in i got killed confirmed on my dad where did he drop footsteps in the building i think hang on he dropped him like sort of here armor here unless unless he just slammed into the i didn't want to do that there's a rose skin here with no gear on it so yeah i think i think they just face planted and didn't want to take it are you sure yeah i'm not sure really but you know i might just have to take my word for it you've got loads of money do you want to start first don't leave yourself a celebration chris easy i see anyone on the left there's only 23 players left um we're not in the best position though we should probably maybe head far right far right yeah because the rest of it's open you should go all the way to the right wheel no that will be out there out of bounds cancelled no comments i see shots from the top of the hill i saw the traces where is it going to end lads where is it going to end have you seen the submarine underneath it oh my god look at this submarine under the ice there is a monster though is yeah you can see it moving on the top of the dam oh i just got the load out just got the load out top here there's two on oh three locating there's three on us you have no authority i remember when the zombie mode was on the top of dam there was like zombie hands coming out the ice that was cool yeah i'm sick yeah yeah zombie top of hill top of hill north yeah see that are they guards i like how they actually have ice physics if you slide a heli on it it'll keep going [Applause] yeah it's pretty cool the skids are very i'll just keep sliding forever oh top of police roofer police roof of police okay it's getting dangerous now i mean multiple angles should we concentrate guys yeah let's go now going this way oh god that's not that's not good thomas that's not good they are in this window of purple there we go okay let's have a cheeky little look at that is right the play here stod uh you need to remove that ping i just penned him you could yeah if right was actually safe to be fair i think ryan might be the player what instead of just staying in this building i don't know well let's just see where the zone goes first let's see where the zone goes first found one in that white building nice westy back window or something that was a smoke top of here a regular smoke grenade in there you might bounce towards us yes we have to go right sides i'll have to go right outside full circle flank enemies that's the problem we might have to put this one on the hill down one on the hill i'm not sure about right anymore now they're up there yeah this is the problem we might have to push police i think and then hold the wall of police all right coming back there is people here though take it back now y'all if you could not hear the muslims inside yeah if you can knock anyone that was on the hill i can use a what's a good position yeah i can see if i can get an angle they're up by the blue heart but there's still people in white house yeah in white house steps in here oh downs down down here humbly need to down one of the people up in the shed if we can let me see me yeah and they've got a trophy in there dive shed wind dive shed it that one it might be above us he was so close but i know but then she was about to be he almost finished me oh god oh there's a guy upstairs in there i forgot so close to finishing there's a guy upstairs isn't that i don't know we have to go out we've got to go out i stand just in case it was mine go go go go go now we're good [Music] keep pushing the tank you put in the shed [Applause] can i finish you guys reckon well yeah i can try oh well played well played well played well clustered well how have they got so many not even it's not even the team that we offered it was the team on the hill oh god what did you just run in there and just like get distracted by the things on the wall yeah more airstrikes i turned around the corner and looked straight up or saw the soldier and shot the wall and then he killed me that's fair enough i kind of want to see it no one's in there who's going to win who's going to win [Applause] i mean that was a terrible term yeah i know he's got one he's got two trying to get the direct impacts for the fight unlucky oh good game boys that was good fun last game yeah good games today yeah one win two wins one we got one it was a good win as well it was a good win yeah i feel like we might have had a win before that though no we only had one okay we can claim we had yeah yeah we had seven seven wins sure seven wins yeah easy i'm sure it was eight but okay yeah eight okay catch you later we'll settle with it you know guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed a that hectic at the end there uh david thank you for the two marius a.t francis i appreciate that man big dubs for the vibes thank you man hi thanks for the two as well full stack thanks again for the 10 hw thank you and matthias johnson i appreciate that man that's very kind ggs right that was a few interesting games of war zone there and you know the whole point of this i suppose was did we come across any hackers i don't think we did today so whatever they've done i mean this was a live test seems like it's worked for now at least which is good and it makes me happy anyway because hackers are the thing that really destroy this game anyways there'll be more streams coming up in the future guys battlefield and cod warzone although i might have to do battlefield on console because whenever i play it on pc uh hackers just follow me around and ruin the server so and that's no good for anyone anyway boys and girls thank you for watching um also just a heads up one last time if you buy anything on warzone or cold war whack in my support creator code jack frags and caps and i'll get a bit of kickback from anything that you buy there are other content creators in that program too so if you get something pick one just a nice way to support us right imovsky enjoy the rest of your day see the next one bye
