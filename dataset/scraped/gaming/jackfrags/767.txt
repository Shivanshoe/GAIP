surely not I'm thinking you throw your jump pad and I Silas you wallets midair or the jump pad disappear Gordon of thought sir hi everyone and welcome to some good old-fashioned video game myth-busting as you may know season four of apex is live now and introduced a new legend called revenant one of his abilities is a silent and with so many abilities in the game I wanted to test exactly how this works and what you can and can't silence my friend hads joined me and we discovered some really interesting things we also found out a few things with his totem ultimate - I hope you enjoyed this and a big thanks to EA for sponsoring this video sit back relax and let's take a look at what happened if you pop your whole is your old still on yes but I've got chains all over the bottom of my screen saying I've been silenced yeah that's just the typical silent thing but no it's still it's still working are there any abilities that channel had Jemaine okay right so switch the Wraith first try that start it might move away a bit so it's canceled the portal I'm silenced yeah but when the time runs out I can do it again right okay so what we'll do now is I'll do a three to one and then finish your pour okay okay right three two one that did actually make it so if i activate my ultimate here and place one rift there and then I get silenced by the main man over there revenant it actually stops it the original riff gets deleted but as soon as the silence wears off after ten seconds I can use my ultimate again it hasn't canceled the charge of my ultimate so I could still make another portal it's just if you get hit whilst you're placing the exit it will take you out of this whole animation so if you put the silence down there and then I go if you walk through the silence when you're in the void it doesn't actually affect you so that's a cool way of avoiding it if you're playing Rafe all right switch to Bangor what we need to do is throw it down and then I'm going to silence you and see if it stops it from coming okay ready yeah I'm gonna put it just go put it here on the left I did it anyway so as soon as your thing is on the ground I guess yes so for the most part it's it's only stopping you from doing your ability it's not canceling abilities it looks like yeah okay go to Gibraltar now huh all right so call it in I didn't stop it at all yeah as soon as I once it's set in stone okay switch to you a quitter so if you fly your drone around yeah okay just fly next to you did it take you out of that view yeah it'd take me it took me out of the drone but the drone is still there so once the silence wears off can you use that again I can re-enter it now yet did it take any damage no okay Oh a little bit of a little bit of armor damage right so what we'll do now is is you're all ready yes okay so flight close to you again and then what we're gonna do is you press it I'll do three two one you do you're all under my silence okay mm-hmm three two one yeah so that time because the EMP has a charger I was charging up when when you canceled it and it didn't stop charging up weight pulled me out it pulled me out of the of the view but the EMP still went off but I but I didn't finish charging it their switch around I'll play kripp so so we'll do a countdown again do you want you throw your all to my character okay yeah all right 3 2 yeah I think that's a case of as soon as you press their door as soon as you activate that EMP it doesn't matter if you're silenced and it will just go off anyway I suppose the bottom line is that once you've started that EMP it's going off regardless unless you shoot it yeah let's see unless you shot the drone or could you silence the drone I don't know do you want to test I wonder if you can alright let's test that see if you can sign just the drone so do 31 popular I'll try a sign it's the drone okay alright alright three two one now no it doesn't do anything can you change the mirage I want to see like if you've done a decoy and I silence you does it destroy your decoy if I stand here you stand in front of me if you send your decoy just straight ahead there yeah okay go yeah she does it gets ready a decoy it does I find as the decoy go normally oh man it can go ages come come all the way over here well that missed how was that missed you look where it is no no no no that is hit me silenced it didn't do it that time didn't do it no wow that's weird I didn't get a hit marketer it definitely silenced me if I do it sooner rather than later yeah disappeared didn't it the first time yeah okay go okay so it's used to be within if you do it early it will delete it yeah what if it's a case of if I hit your it could be the any damage on the Mirage hologram is causing it to disappear oh and the the because if the Holograms within the raid damage radius so if you you do it again now that didn't silent you right no but it did get rid of the Mirage okay so do you think it's a case of it might be it's taking damages within the range of damage use your ultimate but don't move because obviously you're gonna go invisible yeah okay okay so go so it destroyed all of your illusions but it didn't make you visible you've just come back in your normal time there so go octane ah surely not I'm thinking you throw your jump pad and I silence you wallets midair well the jump pad disappear orden the thought so let's just try the queue first so if you yeah just activate your queue and run towards me now you carried on going now yeah so it's it's obviously cancel my ability but it's not stopped me MIDI Billiton okay if you got your jump oh yeah I've got them I've got the jump out I'll go behind you and if you just look bike into the air I guess and throw it so I can see it ready yeah okay go no no it definitely had London then either no you can't you can't destroy these can you oh yeah you can it's just some of the asylum the asylums won't destroy it yeah don't think so well what's test no way okay so can you bounce grenades off it as well yeah I think you can so the silence bounces off that that's interesting what about pathfinder mid grapple yeah might be difficult hit for me i get mother shot three two one did that hear you well i heard the sound but it didn't actually I don't think it actually hit me that's weird three two one did I hit you no that made the sound though yeah it explodes midair but it's not canceling your think you'll no no no no it no it's not silencing me at all that's it's like it's not hitting me so if you mid grapple I suppose the silence just doesn't work you test it again just to be sure yeah and you can write three two one it connects with you I don't get a hit marker and you don't get silenced no I'm not getting silent that's all that's interesting three two one so you can see that actually hit me midair but it didn't silence me and it didn't stop the grapple okay what if so your ultimate it's got a bit of travel time hasn't it yeah fire it to a location far away will it cancel it midair while it's going so tell me when you've got a location where it's ready to fire I've got one this wall basically dead ahead of us so it's got a bit of travel time okay so I'll do three two one and count you down all right ready three two one so it made it but it does fire very fast yeah I'll try that one again three two one yeah that was definitely before he had finished yeah it was it's still lot of ways to go it looks like that as soon as you put that first one down it creates the zipline yeah set in stone so Watson's obviously got her thing I reckon it's gonna be blocked by it right I've got it ready okay so walk it down here's a normal grenade right if you stand next to it and here's a silence say I get zapped interesting okay that gives Watson a little extra punch I suppose yeah because if you're if you're holed up in a building evidence kind of silence isn't gonna work if you gotta Watson there what if I try and do it from above so if I fire it directly upwards got it from miles away so what if I throw the silence through the the beams do you think if I try and hit you through the beams I don't think that will stop it will it it shouldn't it I don't think it stops grenades Yeah right there Korsak I think would it stop his smoke from his ultimate from Pluto Minka um what if you okay so you throw a caustic trap and I'll try and stop it midair Oh God if you run forward and throw it in the air can i silent you and would it disappear okay three two one still popped I suppose I did silence you then run you definitely hit me before it landed okay right so what we'll do now is if you throw your ultimate out that sticks around well if you throw that in the air so recharge that if I saw what you want it's midair I don't think it will cancel it I feel like they've thought about this so that would be a hell of a shot as well yeah three two one go now still pops so it seems like if a character's ultimate is a projectile it doesn't matter if you hit them with assignments before it's activated it will always activate notice I call that babbling come get your birthday present coming right here babe now I carried on going didn't it yeah imagine if you could hit that midair and it will just disappear if you activate into the void and then I sign at you while you're in the void will it take you out of the void I reckon it will no it doesn't say man that time one thing that we haven't done as well is a nice little tip for it is that if you just put it down on the ground like let's say I miss I could make it almost like a trap so let's say this is door here if you've run through that but actually sign misses you yeah so you can almost set a trap with the silence if you want so the death toll atone if I put this down so full shields full health if I use it if you just shoot me with it see it doesn't actually do shield damage so I keep going keep going keep going keep going there we go so respawn me back at the totem but I've got no health so the thing with the death throes of is sometimes it's good to use it and sometimes it's really bad so in this scenario here let's say it's early game but I've got my ultimate ready and there's a team up ahead somewhere we're about to go into a teamfight but I've only got a level one shield a gray shield and I don't have any big medkits all I've got is two syringes so if I were to put this down now and then use it and then get into that teamfight and then I get killed I'm in a bit of a bad situation here now because that other team could push me really quick and it's gonna take me a while to he'll get back up to full HP right so really that might be a waste of it in a way whereas if you're in a situation like this where you've got purple armor and at least one big med kit maybe it makes a bit more sense then because what you can do is put it down into death protection you can go into that teamfight get killed get teleported back and almost straightaway you can pop that med kit and take a bit of cover while that other team is maybe pushing towards you maybe they're not gonna be ready for you to be on full health again so it's a really situational ultimate and you've got to think about when and how you're using getting teamfights do you see this line yeah what's that for is that distance from the tome because I've still got death protection I've got half of my timer if you cross that if you cross that it's canceled oh right so it has a radius as well I didn't realize that I thought it was just a timer I see I can see it you can see it all the way behind you on the rocks it's telling you where the radiuses it's not huge you know this is the edge here yeah but I think it's the kind of distance that you might have a teamfight hat yeah yeah so if you go through that it's going to cancel it so you have to keep that into consideration - yeah don't cross the stream so just to demonstrate how good revenants passive ability could be let's say there was a a piece of loot or something up there I'm just crypto so I've just got the normal climbing height I actually can't get up there so it's just no way but revenant can do it that easy so if you get up there look at that straight up there it's just somewhere that I couldn't reach if this ramp wasn't here something to think about especially with a map like world's edge where you've got so many tall vertical buildings like that there's a lot of advantageous spots that you can get to there so there we have it there are some things that you can cancel mid-channel so to speak and some oddities with the silence - but it seems that the general rule of thumb is that most abilities cannot be stopped if they've already been activated or spawned into the world it will be cool though to see if the silence is developed any further to accommodate for more councils in the future book we'll have to see at the moment it's definitely more of a pre-emptive measure that you will use before a teamfight or to stop someone from escaping with that said thank you for watching I hope you enjoyed this one if you did leave a like
