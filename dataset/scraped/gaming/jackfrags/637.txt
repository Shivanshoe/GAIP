hey everyone hope you're doing well today we're going back and playing some bf5 it's been about a month for me to be honest and I just fantasy jumping on today and see what it was like now I'm gone with the m3 infrared sniper rifle today I never really used it you know not bad suppressed Hamada as well and I picked Hamada because you know I did that series across the battlefield where I did every map and game-mode live commentary and everything Hamada was one where I think like it wasn't a very long video and I didn't think it was particularly good either so I thought you know I'll just get back on it how many times there we go there's another one there so really weird like sight this guns pretty satisfying to use though but yeah I thought yeah it's still murder why not it's not a map that I particularly enjoy all that much but I thought let's give it a shot I mean the bullets on this a really fast aren't they I'm not unlocked any attachments for it or anything like I don't have any specializations on it so I don't know if it can be a lot better than this are you fire like that it's okay in it I'm gonna get a knife Donna I've got the suppressed PPK as well as my secondary assault player up here it's not bad I'm liking it so far to be honest with you I don't know I've survived this long because it's a full server I've just been like prone on the side of the building here we go and now we die yes you have to heal in this game who shot at me felt like it came from over there no no maybe my teammate got the kill always really dodgy running across this bridge though isn't it it's out open I am why it's no one shot at me where is everyone on this server look I mean eh maybe what is this always the the the Doppel shush Doppel shush is that right the double flare oh that's cool spit fire they're flying over yeah so they have guy a try and get back there let's have a look don't see any enemies over there well let me know in the comments how many of you guys still playing beer 5 now we're not gonna have any more new content for the game it's done I don't even know if they said whether they're supporting the advanced or of graded community games cuz I know there was some talk about that in the past that they were going to like continue developing that but I think don't know if they have they said that they're actually updating the community game still I don't know honestly I've got no idea just not been following the news I just been so wrapped up in warzone and all sorts of other things that I can't talk about coming soon which I'm looking forward to it's gonna be exciting weekend for video games put it that way let's try and get back here so weird flare gun you can't stick it on things so you are this is really satisfying to use I can't believe that I haven't tried it before but I suppose I did that oh there's a lot of enemies here I think that one video under new maps actually I did too didn't I did one on Provence and then one yeah on encampment and I was using the shotgun and the well gun for those videos I think I hear someone down here but yeah I just didn't really try any of the new guns so if I put a flare on there it should be like a mobile flare and little ball UAV look you see you look at the mini-map it's moving with me how long will it stay there I don't know I've no idea that's pretty cool feature though the vehicles certainly don't handle like water hey you can just throw those things around like crazy alright I'm gonna leave this here and then we'll try and capture all these points put it down there let's get a bit of cover there's a bad guy up here yes proper James Bond isn't it this pistol cracking good shooting destroy that pretty chill round so far I did see that but I just thought you know keep running rather than pro oh I was trying to get the guy wrapping it Oh am I gonna get a res not Nabeel has got to climb up unless I've fallen down let's see where they are they're dead I'm lucky enemy down there oh you didn't like that did you bullet to the head not enough damage though there we go I feel like I'm gonna walk into a lot of enemies here if I'm not careful get on one of these guns maybe I fell down there with the one on the top thought I'd be able to see enemies can hear a sniper over there and I'm squad leader take me somewhere these guns are never any good though I works all right there I think that guy was pretty lower I think I hear an enemy over here well then though gotta be careful one more here dead yeah there's the body back to e it's only hundred meters away could be a nice overlook here for the sniper still enemies around right there so another one no I'm gonna need it just in case oh there's someone here in a rush Dona grenade I say not falling for that and someone else on the point but I don't know where around here I'm sure I can hear someone and they just got killed yes I trying to find a needle in a haystack let's go back to there oh yeah I forgot about this I've got this thing don't I it's the grenade launcher thingie yes I don't know what else you would call it watch out for AP mines hmm everywhere you pew pew are we clear I think we're clear you can cap it from appear that's cool I never knew that feeling chipper again I am me I'm feeling just fine thank you all right can we get a long shot with this thing I think the bullet is so fast on it kind of tricky at that distance there is a guy there is one here as well what's your out there that's one headshot they still there yeah oh we got a kill assist what are you firing out what I'm attracting a bit of attention here aren't I is that an enemy tank is that sniper still looking at me you don't know that's just a wreck here we go let's try how I do just got a quad kill without bomb that was nice I think we were all spotted all infantry as well it's pretty good for a bomber let's have a look I'm being very cautious here nope get off that gun I'm sure that was a painful death all right I don't know if this my bear has a glint on it maybe no does it - guys just prone on the top nabil are you there nabil yes oh I'm gonna get revenge thank you all right they just said the top there's one oh come on one more shot would have done it at least they're off there now all right so we could go to sea stay away whoa massive explosion as long as I don't get sniped in the back I should have a nice little fine care sure nice to sound that blaze make why am i spotted I don't want to be spotted yeah well you why why maybe there was a flare you guys ever seen the like Blade Runner style enemy there the weather on this level it turns it into Mars basically red sandstorm it's really cool doesn't happen often though just bounce around a bit I think that's the guy they got me before enemies don't actually stand out easily there oh behind us oh my god that guy just butchered us shot me in the back and then shoveled Nabil Nabil I'm so sorry I didn't want it to end like this enemy here you gonna jump down give me the old one - oh nice headshot someone's gonna jump down on me on there feel like there's enemies around everywhere shouldn't have fired a shot let's destroyed everything I didn't mean for that to happen get out roly-poly hey be cool see me enemies there see buddy take see before the rounds over saw an enemy then where'd you go oh I can't see a thing thanks I guess oh that look cool as our I've just realized I'm squad leader aren't I so I can call in an artillery strike there that's a glint see that first shot accuracy is really nice that artillery strike should keep those snipers off that Ridge as well yeah it's really difficult to see people like I thought that guy would have a scope over there but I'm not seeing a glint or anything yeah difficult to say come on dice dice there we go made it eventually capture this flag wonder if I could take a plane down there is someone there it's just really difficult to see them or hit them it seems oh no the tanks turret in yes we got one more kill I'm happy with that there's another guy here cut down and a bale with the clutch nabil the absolute legend there you are that was going in for the knife oh GG that was all right wasn't it pretty chill game hope you guys like that I know I'm done bf5 for a while but there it is let me know your thoughts down in the comments below guns alright I think I need to get the specs on it though first before I properly give it a good go fun game anyways without said if you enjoyed the vid guys leave a like if you didn't
