it turns out that you can pet the dog in battlefield 2042. earlier today the battlefield twitter account sent out a video and i took a look at it and it appears that this is pretty simple to do all you've got to do is call in a ranger and then get next to it hold the interact button even though there's no prompt and you'll see an animation just a nice easter egg and i believe this was found by a dog driving a car on the bfe discord but i also realized this if you hold up the cameras the menu here there are additional controls at the bottom for the ranger ego to ee follow hold e self-destruct so in theory what you could do is send the ranger to a location and then tell it to self-destruct so i'm just gonna hold e now which is interact appreciate it and he's gonna blow up so much so that it actually killed me there you go lesson learned don't self-destruct the dog anyway that's all for now just wanted to share that little easter egg there thanks for watching see you next time
