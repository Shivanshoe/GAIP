boy oh boy have i got a war zone video for you earlier today i was playing some solo matches and i came across one of the worst kind of cheaters that you can possibly encounter in call of duty war zone and it's a bit of a strange tale there's some twists and turns it's annoying yeah being killed by cheetah but this tale has an oddly satisfying ending and before we get into that i just want to throw some appreciation over to the swiss the k31 i have used this in the past and i've done a couple videos on it but there's been some changes recently to the attachments the barrels and just general sniper buffs for the cold war weapons and the swiss it's disgusting i hit some absolutely filthy shots in this match just popping people left right and center i feel like those kind of distances just doesn't have any bullet drop or travel time it's almost instantaneous that one there mid jump over the wall they're not going to be happy about that one now about this cheater then so the game started pretty reasonably i landed at promenade picked up my first kill there well that dude nearly had me no bye here though i was kind of disappointed but there was a scav i wanted to get but people just whom for those things in solo matches and they're all gone by the time you land normally picked up the second kill now this is my first encounter with the cheetah i'm losing fire station roof and i just get shot in the back little bit damage there and the person shooting at me there wasn't the cheater if you listen very carefully you'll hear some gunshots in a second that's the cheetah killing the guy that was just shooting at me now i'm on the roof i've played it back up this guy runs into the fire station so at the moment i don't know that this guy is cheating right i just think it's a normal player and use the heartbeat i see 20 meters away they're probably climbing up the tower so i'm just waiting for them to peek here and then i decide against it maybe not the best position to just be out on the roof like that pop the dead silence and i'm thinking about going for a flight so we'll get back inside they're still up in the tower but then they jump out you heard the footstep there i wasn't sure if they were on the roof or underneath me i can tell now that they're underneath me so what i'm going to do is go by the door post up or beam them when they come up the stairs but watch [Applause] i got absolutely toasted there and i wanted to see the kill cam now i instantly reported this player for chasing i don't often report people for cheating unless i'm 99 sure that they're cheating and i was so sure there that i just hit x and did it straight away and this is why this kind of player this kind of cheater is one of the worst you can come up against so let's watch the death in the kill cam again we'll break it down now it wasn't the aim and the shots that i thought was particularly dodgy here although we will get into that a bit later because i think they're using a different type of aimbot here instead it was the positioning and the crosshair placement and how fast i died that gave it away as they came up the stairs i instantly was shot a bit peculiar because i'd been very quiet and it's not often that you can predict 100 where someone's going to be in a building like that when there's so many options and then the killcam sealed the deal for me look at this cheeky little look up to the right there i am on the wall they know exactly where i'm going to be so they can get ready zoom in pre-fire do a little jump and i'm out of there i nearly killed them but you can't compete with software like that at the end of the day but we're going to keep watching because this is where it gets really good and i think it's important to talk about this because a lot of players might look at what just happened you know they're playing the game a similar thing happens to them i think oh it was just good prediction skills because it didn't really look like your traditional rage aimbot did it they didn't snap to me or anything and some people might think oh it's just a good player with good cross hair placement and they might not notice that little look up to the right before they came up the stairs so i won my goo lag i dropped back in as you saw i got killed when i tried to get my load out and i wanted to speculate because i knew eventually it's gonna come back around to this cheetah right because if they were cheating like that they're trying to hide it i think that's what they're doing they're not making it as obvious they're not rage hacking and that's why it's pretty dangerous because they might not get detected or reported that much now we switched over to a guy called radar here watch what happens here they jump up on the shed instantly killed and i knew straight away because that player was quite a nice move they did there jumping up but this is the guy that killed me before they were looking at the top of that shed already they knew that that player was there and as you can see pretty low level account default emblem that's usually a dead giveaway and i guess that they've picked up this pharah off someone that they've killed default skin 22 kills it's kind of obvious what's going on here now right now what happens next i find quite interesting through social media reddit twitch chat i've always been under the impression that you can't get aimbots that will lock onto players in vehicles and i'm sure a lot of you have heard that before but i think what happens next will prove that that's not true or something has changed and the cheat developers have figured out a way to lock onto players and vehicles because he absolutely tracked the hell out of that guy in the truck then but again notice how they're not locking this isn't rage hacking what they do is they use their walls they look for people get them roughly in the center and then once they're on a target an enemy player that aimbots just going to ensure that they're locked on no recall the bullets don't move and the enemy player just gets wasted so i think it's more of what's called a soft game bot where as long as the player is near the center of your screen like you put your crosshair there you've predicted where they're going to be using your wall huh it's going to kick in when you're near and just lock onto them so it's not quite as obvious and perhaps any detection tools that look at statistics won't be able to pick it up as much but you can see here in there with the pre-fire straight away they just jumped and right on the guy as soon as they came around the corner didn't even take any damage there now for me personally over the last like three weeks or so i've not really come across that many cheaters none that i can remember but i think that they are just way more prominent in solo matches and that's probably because they can control things more efficiently because you're not up against three or four players you're up against one at a time and if you've got a wall hack you can methodically go around cover your back from the player over there while you kill that one you don't have to worry about people being revived unless they've got a self-rest and you also don't have to worry about more grenades being thrown at you or stuns because they're quite a good counter to cheaters like this now we're about to see some justice here guys and i promise you it's gonna feel good so they jump outside kill the get a beam on a second but that player at the top puts a cluster strike on this cheater now this shows how little game knowledge these kind of people have if someone puts a cluster strike on one of these buildings don't stand on the stairs because the cluster strike goes through the building and will hit you on the stairs and that's the end of the cheetah in this lobby now this is the guy that called in the cluster strike zagoony and i spectated afterwards i kept on watching they're here couple nice shots here with the k31 representing with the sniper rifle there and finished off here for the final kill to win the match and i stayed to the end round lobby and i put voice comms on usually i have it turned off but i thought i'll be interesting if people stick around and say something and just listen to what they say there was a hacker in this one too yeah kings some guy kings dude that was in my last lobby he had 26 kills last game bro i was so freaking happy somebody hit a cluster that dumb ass goes to the top floor and dies dying yeah he won the last game though like he killed he killed me and sent me to the gulag with like 73 people left and i knew it would come back to him but i guess we'll see him in the next one so this cheater had been in that dude's previous game cheating of course and ended up winning the match it's kind of sad for a couple reasons because a player like this when you've got stats racking up like that should just be banned automatically i don't see why there has to be some kind of human review there when it's obvious what's happening and i feel bad for the guys who's have to deal with that two games in a row now one way you can avoid this i know some people already know this but i wanted to show you if you come across a cheater or someone you suspect of cheating the first thing you should do is go to the recent player list and report them or report them when you're spectating them in game like i did but you can also block them so you right click block and then when you're in a lobby it will tell you that there's a block player in that lobby so you can just leave and re-cue join another one but something the game doesn't tell you is that the block list actually has a limit it's around 200 people and if you already add that limit if you've blocked 200 people already you can right click on someone and click block but it won't actually block them until you unblock someone on your list so if you've got 200 people blocked that you thought were cheating or whatever i'd advise going to your block list which is here and then maybe looking for some of the ones at the bottom of the list which you blocked ages ago with default emblems because you'd assume that by now if they were cheaters they've been banned just unblock a couple of them and then block the most recent one so you won't have the same problem that this dude just had where they played another game and they were in the same lobby again because it sucks for that guy you know you don't want to see that happen everyone wants the game to be fair i mean that said that's all for today folks i thought i'd show you this because i did find it kind of interesting the way this guy was cheating and the fact that they'd popped up in multiple matches and they weren't rage hacking so yeah maybe it is a bit more difficult to detect but after i spectated and i kept watching it's quite clear that he was using an aimbot and hitting shot after shot that just wasn't humanly possible so statistics based auntie should be picking that up and flagging it as always guys thank you to everyone here using my cod support a creator code in the store i'm still going through a massive backlog of pictures that i've saved from everyone that's used it for the previous season for the rambo and the john mcclane skins and also of course season four which has just started a ton of you guys said that you'd bought the battle pass and used my code so thank you very much i appreciate you the way it works is if you buy anything skins battle pass whatever put my code in before you do and i'll get a bit of kickback from the sale basically it's that simple just a way to help support me on the channel if you enjoyed the video guys leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
