work out what was bad I don't know I feel like the whole pop your chute and cut like that seems to give you a bit of a speed boost but apart from that I just don't know yeah we should actually we should probably test it ourselves I feel like it gives it I don't know big does give a speed boost or whether it's a lucky it's an MOV increase that's why I'm trying to work out we take this building here actually and then go over to the store no one on the right I said yeah and traveling for all of us we'll make it work as long as we got guns we can use to you know do some damage down the line that's that's the nice thing about this game is you can never really drop and be like all my life I've been ruined I've I'm so undiluted I feel like you're always gonna get two guns in a bit of armor and then you're ready to rock roll yeah there's a cooler if anyone's feeling extra sausage helicopters just having a great time in I'll shoot it down yeah it's empty - oh shoot back at us unfortunate I've got a spare almost that may be ok I created most of it so if we want to send this IKEA into a spin here as well afterwards if we get some dosh can we get in the high ground I've never actually

some spelling yeah yeah it's those different bits of blue around here we this is really open here doing let's go east I'm gonna pop a UAV in a second because I'd be a lot of people probably coming north in Canada here I wait to work out of here yeah goes this Vic me Invicta have known each other for a while well yeah I just called in some other that I think I say we play zone we play down the

I don't know if that's the same squad up in Nice he's really max them I think he's gone to the right let me still though I trying to run far far away that's all right I haven't got any Ranger guys so I'm just gonna stay in yeah no worries we could weaken I mean I don't know how we want to play this like we heard there's fighting over where we want to go quad on the left any good for - is there any orphan okay nice right now these two minutes down nice Paul thank you for three last year I would say look you content you the best thank you so much Paul yeah this is a different squad yesterday it's big starring Joe put this down everyone get a move back up we stand a lot this gunshot sounds like they sound really close but actually not yeah after that is so disorienting I feel like footsteps are really quiet as well in this mm-hmm let's do a laugh like here does anyone else have you area in the pocket or is it just me just you might be worth using here so we can clear these guys and keep moving they're a bit more ahead like in the forest I've got nothing why is that could be rise there I'm thinking I'll just like walk it I hate these areas but you can't like Mountain what's these like that you should get stuck on a night yeah I'm missing two plates don't - I've got like three out of five so far good fun just checking Jack how many spare plates do you have on okay and I think we can buy I'll buy something you can have the extra alright gravity anyone I'm in the bunkers yeah I don't think so I just keep working away I don't think anyone's done it yet mm-hmm yeah really an a so we've all got a UAV before the final sir yeah we cheering can I make it yeah yeah that's my dad laughs laughs well good work I hear that you don't get the kill if someone else finishes you down you never actually know how many of you yeah times like that spent on a5 armored plates a friend of all you need a tip one there's another for a little bit those on the side there that's all right okay let's keep it moving bene Oren can get here oh wait let's give Jack money Jack here can you buy our UAVs how much more do you need I got the map we got enough yes I don't have a gas mask that's gonna

anything anyone dropped here sure where is a little trick you can do guys if you can't figure out where a mission is on the map if you ping it actually shows you very nice but once we've got that contract yeah we can get that by as well down there oh there's two people two people near that near the drop they're probably gonna come for this one okay I should push up on this yeah we should go and collect that by the ocean which is gonna cover that yeah they don't renew yes my station all right let's do that let's go rather than the last like you ready um they gonna have guns now cuz

Eskimo I don't know why like I'm I don't know I just feel like I encountered a few too many bugs with it like it's got a lot of technical problems still and I feel like the economy's broken in that game so I'm kind of waiting until they do a wipe on it and then I might play it again we'll see I don't like the measure of it right now I'll definitely play it more in the future mix all right don't worry he's got this Andrew Knight he's got this EP Zed reamers how long were you friends was Vick well me and Vic met each other at the okay get this battlefield 4 reviewer then that would have been October 2014 in Stockholm that's the first time that I met him but no sorry the reveal event oh no I think it was March 2014 and they revealed the game unlucky man here's a good try why do I think what I mean they're probably gonna kill me anyway yeah no worries I'll bill gave me thank you for this n in hindsight it's actually quite funny like this entire secret mission for that well you come back home and all that money for them so mix-up yeah yeah yeah yeah 5 5k donation so what first place then what were we in the second game 14th or something something like that and where did we finish then it's literally just being on the screen but I don't remember you xx so we're getting progressively worse than oh dear oh dear oh dear Rohan is this better than pub G I mean they're different types of games like oh jeez much more hardcore and tactical I'd say if an audience did you leave the pilot it might have glazed over you like that oh yeah yeah yeah I'm definitely enjoying this more at the moment I would say this is brand new like it's hot isn't it there's lots of stuff to learn people are doing fun stupid things at the moment it's not just all about winning the matters forming what are the best loadout what are the best strategies like this is the best time to play a new battle rail game like the first two weeks are always the most fun trust me you need to get this crowd you need to get your bow bars up it's they got it now but I just haven't got any attachments for it um yeah once you get them all hit express or in the arcade your barrel cool yeah I might have to run

right there from Vic if you talk really fast [Music] I never learned how to touch site myself I just I just pray that they keep updating their slight if we got like weekly updates like new guns new life kinds of contracts I would be so happy in the trailer they had like attack dogs and yeah I mean I don't see why they can't add like a lot of the kill trees into here the non overpowered ones could you imagine that the dogs chasing you like this is more pressure or more stress they need like some more high cost things cuz the amount of times I think I've got 14 grand what am I gonna buy
