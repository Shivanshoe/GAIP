welcome to crysis 3 remastered big thanks to crytek for sponsoring this video today we're playing the game here on pc in 4k maxed out with ray tracing and dlss turned on it looks awesome and i have played through this game before but i thought that to really show off the game and what they've done for the remaster let's play through one of the most iconic missions for me anyway we're gonna switch to this electric arrow and fry these people in the water here maybe that guy too so this is one of my favorite levels in the game it is quite early on but it really shows how open world the game went again the first crisis super open world the second one was a bit more linear but this one was just a nice blend of both and of course we've got the bow here i think this guy should get it and as i've always said if you put a bow in a video game it makes it just so much better now if you want to check out the game for yourself it is a link down in the description below as i said today we're playing on pc but it's also available on nintendo switch and current and next-gen playstation and xbox consoles and it contains all three crisis games getting major predator vibes here i think i can take this dude out without him seeing me wait for the energy to come back and then we'll go again what's going on here nothing going on here don't worry hey i've called some reinforcements i'll be fine i'll just stain the long grass like a velociraptor nobody gonna see me now if we're talking specifics about what's been changed for the remaster they've improved the lighting textures materials shadows are better we've got shadows on glass and particles and also as i mentioned i am playing here with ray tracing on and dlss which are two really cool technologies games running great as well i'm getting about 70 frames per second right now playing at 4k too i think i'm just gonna use the shark up here get both of these in one boom oh that was good so i've gotta meet up with psycho here it's a character from the first game and also crisis warhead which was a really great standalone expansion super cool single player there he is foliage is just so dense here all right psycho no what are you pointing at it's fine it's not important don't worry about it i hope you know what you're messing with yeah i do come on we'll cut through the channels to the train yard he's very cockney if you haven't realized already maximum armor i'm almost there yeah psycho doesn't have his nano suit anymore unfortunately but he's still quite smart you know it is important there's a lot of talk about you in the suit alien modifications those visions people aren't even sure what or who you are anymore what do you believe i'm here aren't i okay let's keep it quiet here we're getting close to cell patrols miss sneaky hey you're the one making the noise look at these effects here it's like those weird reflections that you get when you go to a pool i'm sure there's a scientific term for them but i'm stupid so i wouldn't know it all right so he's going up that ladder i think i've got to go this way now if i remember correctly there is a turret here that you can hack right there there's a little minigame where you've got to press f when it's in the box we got it well that thing is going to start shooting them all now right there as well [Applause] i'll take out this guy with an arrow silent but violent so you can cloak and shoot the arrows in this game and it doesn't take you out of cloak oh no you saw me put the armor on there i mean i'm essentially the predator i don't i don't think my ass is done i don't see a scenario where you're going to beat this dude couple more oh in cover goodbye i only got spider a little bit there not that detrimental sneak up on this guy nobody left buddy anyway stealth oh nasty and psycho is over here mate stop shooting at me super jump i guess they heard us yeah i think they did so you do have options here you know you can go completely stealthy if you want i like to uh mix it up a bit i'm going top side see what's going on i'm going top side see what's going on jump over here get ammo from this i already put a suppressor and a drum mag on this assault rifle out of the [Music] hear grass i'll see aliens plans you're gonna have to get out of there ruin ruined ruined a triple kill quad kill hmm what if i take this ladder for protection i think that's how ladders work oh it's gone hey alien put the armor on just in case something like that did you oh good jump scare there die oh my god they take so many shots i've seen what's been attacking us stalkers tell me about it oh this looks good like i said just waste some strays out of hiding because we blew up the cell's defense tower maybe you're right they're behaving guys no hive intelligence shoot these uh tripwires i'm boxed in by stalkers and sale you can choose a draw as well so you get different types of shots on the arrow outside up we go this way dead end there's my compulsive reload syndrome full effect through the door big room take those two out this guy snapped the neck put the normal ones back on so right now they're aware of me but they don't know where okay they'll see where i am now i didn't find that particularly well oh you're gonna get arrow i just stick to this underwater bit refill there this bit goes all the way through the station as well more of a stealthier option here there are a lot of bad guys in here and i've got to get up there no no no no oh they're repelling again get underneath again they're just shooting at random things there i've got to go all the way to the end of the room up these stairs here and across the zip line over there don't want to punch i think we're clear here got loads of ammo there's a turret there i wonder if i should hack that cause a bit of chaos then move so we're going to be distracted trying to take it out and i can push up a little bit here i use my electric tip i can say i got that essentially going without needing to hack it this is like a game of chess almost lots of options available by throwing grenades at me get him out of the way you're going to be a problem i need to switch arrow types again try and get this guy with the explosive oh that missed i missed as well there we go [Music] only took me three attempts he was right there but that just tags them and explodes so if you can get a big group of soldiers together fire one of those arrows into them you're gonna do a lot of damage there with one arrow you know it's good bang for buck the explosive arrow what is that oh i think we used this in crysis 2 the other day when we played it it's a big chunky light [Applause] [Music] if i can get a fix on it that doesn't sound good i can hear them all around me go away and they're behind me as well gotta really use the audio here they're horrible can hear another one well they're quite fast difficult to track did a bit of damage there maybe ow bit of ammo again that's the uh electro gun isn't it one there yeah i think there was yeah this does a load of damage to shields i think it's more effective against the aliens as well to put a hollow site on it i'll get over there it's gonna book it i feel like the longer i stay here the worse it's gonna get it is such a good job making this look overgrown and steadily you want me to protect you then open this i was trying to get it first time but i mess it up and what did that give us oh okay this is kind of like a grenade launcher rocket launcher thing but i've also got a stationary grenade launcher there too nice animations on that alternative who the [ __ ] are you some explosive barrels there no no no i do not want to talk try to get close that's better [Music] where's your plan b oh it's a one shot if you hit him directly quite satisfying noises as well there i feel like the audio director just smashed a few watermelons with a sledgehammer or something recorded that come on psycho get a move on it never ends napalm choppers wow i don't know if we should stick around for that i'm gonna take this this is mine now they've gone i'm gonna kill myself though roast potatoes nobody wants to be turned into roast potatoes oh they are delicious what's that guy doing dead end oh that's mate [ __ ] brilliant typical hq [ __ ] i can't open up that tunnel i can try what if i shoot this no well i [ __ ] can come on oh psycho's got a plan what's it gonna be will it involve the train tracks i think it might critical threat i love the design of these so detailed give it a push yeah it looks dangerous do it psycho this train is full of highly explosive material yep look how he went prone i'm just stood up here like an idiot it's got a lot momentum this trade die oh there's a led what the hell that's a close one it worked yes put some c4 on there cheeky well i've done about you but i call that [ __ ] flawless me too psycho well i think we're gonna leave it there guys thank you for
