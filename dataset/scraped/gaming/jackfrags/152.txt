it recently occurred to me that although i've done many hunt showdown videos over the years i've never actually showed a full match from start to finish and i think a lot of people who have watched these videos out of context who don't play the game themselves may have wondered what the hell is going on and just smiled and nodded so today we're gonna jump into a game i'm gonna explain everything and just tell you about this fantastic game hopefully we can get a decent match so this is the current character that i have this is a new character i've got some perks down here the more you level up you can add perks you can also change your equipment so you've got your primary your secondary you've got tools and consumables and if i go into a match and this character dies that's it they're gone for good that's the risk reward for this game and you go into the game collect bounties you extract you collect money and then you can spend on upgrades so without further ado we're gonna queue into a match now see how it goes if you enjoy the video leave a like sit back relax let's get it okay so here we are in the game and on this occasion there are two bosses two bounties that we could potentially get if you look in the top left there's the crow and the spider our objective is to locate one or both of them take them out get a bounty and try and extract one of these locations these are random every game as well the extraction points always on the edge of the map as well so how do we do that well we're going to use dark site and see if we can find some clues we've got three here there's one up dead ahead of me here so we may as well get this one first and this will help narrow things down next building along okay there's actually a hive right on top of the clue we call her the bee lady and if you alert her she will send a swarm of bees in your direction and if they get you they poison you on this occasion i can't really see a quiet way of taking her out without alerting her so just kind of shoot in the head sound of course is really important and that gunshot was probably heard by other players and the audio design in this game is so good you can easily pinpoint where people are so there's the first clue in the bag and that was for the crow and that's going to narrow things down a bit okay so it's not in any of these areas which is kind of annoying for me spider boss is over there somewhere but for now we're going to move across to the next clue which i think is that one there although there's one there too i think that one's closer let's get there first not a big fan of moving through water because it slows you down so much and there's also these horrible water and where demons you make you bleed i'll try and keep the low ground here too so i don't make wood noises okay i've made it to the next clue because i'm playing solo here i could be up against teams of one two or three i think i hear an enemy player both bosses are banishing as well right now which means they've been found i'm dead ahead of me there's two players next to me i'm not to make any noise hopefully they don't see me right there okay there we go it's as quick as that it really is as quick as that the firefight and those guys did not know i was there at all and that's given me a massive advantage just being stealthy i think i got a bit lucky there though because i did run into this area just maybe they didn't hear me that team are out now i think there's only two of them and if we look at the map we've got spider boss here being banished all the way down south is the scrap beak and once those percentages go to 100 in the top left they will drop two bounties each and then players can pick them up and that's their opportunity to attempt to extract from the level you extract with bounties you get more xp more points more stuff to upgrade your character and that's what it's all about i'm gonna head over to the spider boss here blanchett graves see what's going on they're still fighting over there south so i think that's at the slaughterhouse so it could be that there's only one player or one team here that have just done the spider but i'm gonna have to get there quick because if i don't they can pick those bounties up and then they get five seconds each to look through the wall they're gonna see where i am if i pick up a bounty hopefully i can demonstrate that to you instead okay so i think it's actually downstairs in the graves it's a really difficult area to attack though all sorts of little cubby holes that you can be hiding in if i leave it too late though they're gonna be able to see where i am okay they're actually just in here i'm dead as quick as that one shot to the head he was behind me on the right in a category okay so that character is dead now we go back to the main menu we can roll a new character all of the traits i had on that guy all the weapons equipment tools wiped out it's all gone we'll roll another one see how it goes okay game number two we've got two bosses again this time it's the butcher and scrap bait right so quite a small area there in the south where the clues are quite close to me here lighting's a bit darker as well this time it's not quite night time but it definitely affect how you play the game when the lighting changes visibility and all that okay first clue is in here [Applause] hello mate sorry to disturb you you look like you were doing something important there with that machete what have we got here okay it could be darrow on chat next clues up ahead these things here are supply stations if you look at the map they're like horse carriages i can get ammo health that kind of thing special ammo some guns take special ammo usually the high power guns i've got a big boy there i do not like those at all i tend to just avoid them some of the ai are a lot tougher than others so there's a player right there [Music] are you on your own what were you doing oh he's got a friend there tag them i'm gonna move around okay i'm gonna put pressure on this guy they have a chance to revive their friend here but if i set the body on fire which i'm going to do now they will have to try and put that out because if the body burns out they can't be revived but they won't have a teammate anymore throw a choke on there there is okay we got him that's a duo down gunshot behind me all right okay this guy is annoying we call this guy jon you have to use grunt damage against him if you shoot him or use sharp damage like with a knife he explodes and he will set on fire and start running after you and it's a whole thing you don't wanna you don't want it you don't want it at all what did this guy have not a bad loadout do some looting that's going to give us a couple of consumables back and some ammunition they did use a choke bomb there you can use those to put fire out but they actually missed and because i set them on fire i can't loot them there's all sorts of little intricacies with this game that you learn the more you play it can't carry anything else at the moment yeah i think i just stumbled across those guys you gotta watch out for environmental stuff as well let me show you around this corner that can blow up and explode and cause poison damage these birds here if i get too close to them or sprint around they'll actually fly into the air and they could alert any enemies around that i'm here and you can pinpoint where people are very accurately if those set off and watch out for these dogs they're horrible dogs are a nightmare to fight in euros and trios but in solos if the whole pack attacks you you're in trouble you're gonna have to use a gun to get rid of those two shots step ahead of me now that could be the team trying to kill the butcher it might be up here take these out so i don't get [Applause] i any see them bit sketchy this is to be honest okay third clue's in here john's over here are you gonna see me jon yeah that's not good but again we've used blood damage don't want to make him explode although him are growing onto me there people would have heard that those christmas presents are just part of the holiday event just a temporary thing just being very quiet right now listening for footsteps i don't think there's anyone around if there is sometimes the clue goes red and that lets you know that there's people nearby that's the third clue and now we know that the butcher is over here at blanchett graves so we're gonna head over there see what's going on there could be people camping it there could be people who've attempted to kill it already there's so many question marks we just don't know but we'll go over there and have a look here you can hear gunshots that sounds like a i fight i just heard someone die then as well making a lot of noise here though i don't think they'll be paying attention though they'll be focused on that fight god dogs okay i'm gonna have to shoot i think that was so annoying i didn't see those at all so i've lost some health bars there only way to get those back is to heal or if you banish a boss and replenishes them all burnt through all my pistol ammo then as well four left that's really annoying should have been a bit more careful there i think i can hear a player on my right just moving very slowly here there's two i think still players fighting behind me as well there's a lot of people alive in this lobby up to 12 in total they just put a trap down they did something can hear the pig as well they're just running around inside okay so they've just killed the butcher right in front of me wow no kill can't believe i didn't get that kill hit that guy three times okay this is bad to be one here as well i'm almost out of pistol armor and use this to heal so i don't burn through a health kit if they pick up that bounty as well they'll be able to see me through the wall like i mentioned earlier man i'm really really upset that i didn't get that kill i needed that kill i mean i could extract i feel like 2v1 though if they get the bounty you know being able to see me through the walls i'm a big disadvantage no range either without that pistol which is above me of course another option i have here just go and extract or i could actually wait at one of the extractions you see they're quite close to this so they might pick up the bounty and just go over that straight away feeling a bit more confident now though i've got some pistol ammo back i think what i'm gonna do is head out to the extraction and wait for them although i know they'll be able to see me with dark side i think it's my best player right now because if i run into that building probably dead it could be that the other squads run in there as well an interesting one this okay so one of them just picked up the bounty one of those guys and that means that they'll be able to see me if they get within close enough range also i'll be able to see them see these lightning strikes here that's them that's the disadvantage of having a bounty other people can see you with the lightning strike they might be able to see me crossing from there a bit of a risk see if it pays off okay gun shot close to me there i think they are actually coming this way on the north side right in front of me now i think they know i'm here [Applause] hey you saw a dino at me that's bad i've got one shot left in my pistol i'm gonna set that guy off see if it runs to them he's looking at me damn it someone's damaged there please flank me oh my god all right i think i got one but they down me let's have a look did i actually down the teammate yeah i did couldn't get the other guy though let's see if these guys extract i don't think john went after them well that's me oh they're looting me no that was a good fight though i enjoyed that i mean i was up against it i think maybe what i could have done differently there is get a bit more pistol ammo so i had more range so i was just limited there with the shotgun but these guys they've got both bounties they're going to extract they've got a kill on me at least and as long as no one interferes with them in the next 30 seconds they're gonna get out alive and extract and get some more points for those characters they're playing this smart though to be fair i think really lucky that that extraction was right next to the boss too i think these guys are home free well that's the end for another character for me i hope you guys enjoyed this and got a better understanding of how you play
