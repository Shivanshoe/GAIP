it's a good day to be a star wars fan and an even better day to be a fan of first-person shooters star wars just announced the respawn entertainment are working on three new star wars games and i'm pretty excited about this so we're going to take a look at all of the information now we're gonna dive in digest it see what it's all about so these three new games are one the next title in the star wars jedi franchise let's be honest that's gonna be jedi fallen order two a strategy game more on that in a bit and a first-person shooter all currently in development from respawn entertainment shepherding the next installment in the star wars jedi story is game director stig asmussen of respawn and peter hirschmann game director who has a long and accomplished history with star wars leads the development of respawns star wars first-person shooter now this guy's worked on some pretty good games and then the third bit a new studio helmed by games industry veteran greg forge will create the new star wars strategy game developed through a product collaboration between respawn and bit reactor respawn will produce the new star wars strategy game while bit reactor leads development of the title and bit reactor is a relatively new studio that's made up of former x-com developers and x-com is an excellent strategy game there was a quote here from douglas riley we're excited to continue working with the superbly talented teams at respawn they've demonstrated excellence in telling epic star wars stories along with best in class gameplay across different genres and we're looking forward to bringing more amazing experiences to the galaxy far far away and then the svp of walt disney games said fostered by the expertise and passion within each team will create thrilling original games for diverse audiences across the star wars galaxy peter hirschmann said working with lucasfilm games on a new first person shooter in the star wars galaxy is a dream come true for me as this is a story i've always wanted to tell hershman previously worked on the original star wars battlefront games the ones from 2004 and five and the medal of honor franchise were talking the og stuff back in the day and more recently the virtual reality game i also found a quote from him here on an ign article i'm so thrilled to get a chance to work with my friends at lucasfilm again i have such great memories of working with them on everything from the original star wars battlefront games to the force unleashed and i've always been inspired by the classic star wars titles dark forces and dark forces 2. i've never forgotten the emotion and excitement i felt playing an fps inside the star wars universe they are defining experiences for many of us on the team and are regarding light for this new project it's a dream come true to make this new title a star wars game we've always wanted to play so the first person shooter then the fact that hershman said it's a story that he wants to tell i presume that that will be a single player and in terms of single-player first-person shooter stories for star wars battlefront 2 the one released recently that had a single-player campaign but also star wars republic commando back in the day which was a fantastic first person shooter dark forces one and two well that was 1995 and 1997. i bet mostly watching this video didn't even play those games or have heard of them before but all that seemed so long ago now but there was no mention of multiplayer or anything like that it was just this guy wants to tell a story doesn't mean that multiplayer won't be featured it just appears that single player will be the focus of this and i'm cool with that as for jedi fall in order to well i absolutely loved the first game i think respawn did a fantastic job with it definitely one of my favorite games of 2019 and if you haven't played it it's got some excellent star wars-y bits in it there's some awesome gameplay opportunities but also the story itself is solid and jedi on the run after order 66 you get to see some of that in the game as well no spoilers but there are some epic star wars moments in there too so i'm really looking forward to a sequel for that game and the possibility of it being on unreal engine 5 as well next gen only jedi fallen ordered the first game was on unreal engine 4 looked pretty fantastic but i don't know if you guys have seen some of the games and tech demos of unreal engine 5 the graphics the lighting the texture detail the environments they're looking truly next-gen so a star wars game on that engine made by respawn where you're playing as a jedi could be something incredible we'll have to wait and see and that strategy game as well as i mentioned star wars has had its fair share of strategy games in the past but the fact that they've got former x-com developers in this team probably means that it might turn out great x-com is a series i think is beloved by strategy fans so the game could have xcom style elements in it too but all in all that's it for today i mean it was a pretty brief statement from star wars but i'm excited i'm hyped i think respawn as a studio have put out a fantastic game so far apex titanfall jedi fallen order so fingers crossed these games turn out well and with that said do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below thank you for
