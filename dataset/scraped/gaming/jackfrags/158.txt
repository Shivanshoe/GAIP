[Music] hello guys and welcome back to battlefield 2042 i hope you're well i hope you all had a fantastic christmas day yesterday today is boxing day in the uk have after christmas i don't know why they call it boxing day i presume it's something to do with boxing or chickens for some reason chickens come to mind i don't know why maybe it's got something to do with chickens but we're back on the game again today we're gonna be playing battlefield portal to start with we'll be doing some sniping i've created a server which you guys can join in if you'd like and we'll be starting with bad company 2 conquest and then moving on to bf3 conquest and then i think we might play some 128 conquest just to mix things up a bit you know do some sniping there maybe some breakthrough we'll see how the night takes us we'll be live for the next three hours and 45 minutes also a bit of a late christmas treat for you guys i'd say a big thanks to epic games for sponsoring this one today they've given me 11 codes of 2042 for the epic game store and i think they're the ultimate edition as well and i'll be dropping them in chat i'll just say okay i'm going to put a code in the chat and then whoever gets it first congratulations you get yourself a free copy of the game also at the moment they've got the holiday sale still ongoing big discounts on certain games up until january the 6th i think so if there's anything that you wanted to pick up have a check there is a link down in the description below if you want a direct link to the store and also they've got this uh coupon system at the moment where if you spend i think if you put any game that's over 14.99 in your basket you'll get a 10 coupon and you can just do that as many times as you want so check it out see if there's anything on there that you fancy and if you guys do pick anything up or even something free do consider using my creator code which is jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that which is always good nice bit of support if you'd like to so we'll see you all in chat thank you for coming along if you enjoy the stream tonight hit the like button if you're watching this as a vod please consider doing the same we're gonna get stuck into this hopefully we can get some nice sniper clips here so again you guys are free to join build the server up start with bad company 2 conquest i don't think thumbnail is a good name for the title not sure that's a good one so we're going to go with jack frags bc 2 not 23 bad company 23. they've not even done a three yet i don't think we're quite there conquest description it's pain then i think that's a good description i'm not gonna put a password on i think i think that because this is a 64 player map if you're on old gen you can play as well so i think if you're on like ps4 or xbox one you can join jack frank's bc2 conquest is the name gonna host it feel free to jump in guys starting off with a valparaiso now we'll be going over to erica harbour of course let's see who joins first who's going to be in the squad i'm intrigued hannah thank you for the fire man we got nano bonanno welcome nano banana level 30 nonetheless cam sas 117 xbox and dan level 51 going up guys what's up d-bear rocket hello david gabby kelvin beagle plays welcome guys thank you for coming along tonight happy christmas to everyone again just missed the intro do it let's have some fun how do i go for the goal or the m24 see i think i used to prefer the m24 double stick of that i don't think i've even played this in congress you know on portal oh my god that's a hot spawn right there cam there's a tree this one just want you to know that there was a tree there it was it was a tree there well that was a good shot was it mr centu hello big aldo obi khan zeriax you can't find my server that's strange should be available i need to change my sensitivity because my dpi is higher um on foot i think my default is four for battlefield like that let's go uh what's up matt hey mike thank you for the 20. very kindly it's a silver full already nearly nearly fall the trees are open here they are crystal you'll have to try if you can join on ps4 i think you should be able to this is a 64 player map i don't know if they did separate versions for as far as i know it's the same version for each generation of console so should be able to join oh that feels good there's an enemy vehicle down there isn't it oh it's a tank [Applause] someone's got to say get that tank i need a rocket here i didn't get the res mclogg thank you for the five euros did you ask krampus for thick treats yes i did i did actually i sent him a message on slack and i said krampus come on now mate hell there is good and everything but you know you gotta put some thickness on those trees i do have c4 but i didn't want to run up there you know at the end of the day it's a time so it's difficult to get close to it recons yes have c4 in bad company did they have c4 in the original game and start playing the objective come on you get a mortar strike no i don't think so the recons did have a motor strike in bad company too they just not put it in this or is there a different way of having it i'm under fire get down to that objective lads latin thank you for the 10 that's very kind appreciate that i think throughout some pokeballs did you all get some nice christmas presents oh rpg to the face horrible uh dan the server name is jack frank's battlefield 20 sorry uh jack franz bank company 2 i think you can just scroll back on the stream and see what i called it i think it was that just type jack frags in and you'll find it could come up right away another guy back here dead yeah dead what are you doing there stand still that was my kill this is kind of cool though i didn't realize this so like on the conquest version of this they've got a low tide here look you can actually come all the way out here like you can't do this on rush this is all water isn't it i think right zombie you got an awesome trampoline oh my god louis hope you're alright man no aim assist yeah i don't think they've changed the controller settings yet jp yeah this is awesome you can come out all the way here oh that one was a headshot this dude's just doing cinematic flybys i mean i'm here for it no complaints from me oh no no cam cam you you appear to have glued yourself to the side of the the wall there is this how physics work has anyone seen physics or learn about them i'm not sure that's possible i mean i'll have a go you know this can go either way i couldn't do that again [Music] don't think it's not moving guys players that's gonna end up crashing the servers over whoa what the hell i think i got him you just did it a turbo jump or something that was sick i'm playing like sergeant and ignorant the sergeant enigma still make videos i used to love his montages what the it's a helicopter audrey hey you jumping in front of me really isn't helping yeah i'm not sure this is a good idea guys it's not a great use of the helicopters there's a guy down here somewhere on the radar can i bang that i don't think so yeah it is pretty stuck zark yeah don't think they're gonna get it out of there i'll go to see then i guess i need to put this all ultra graphics i'm still playing on low settings mostly i've got texture detail on high hey i'm getting lit up there's a guy literally you could shoot the guy instead of jumping up and down in front of it how how about that concept how about that we gained majority but we're losing guys are we going to win this game or what we need to win all the time come on i can get the tank i can get the tank oh my god you can't okay so bad in battlefield 2042 you can throw that for ages i did a bit of damage killed myself in the process it's fine did i have a nice christmas gin yeah i did thank you it was pretty cool it was nice and chill uh spend some time with family had some good food oh that's what it's all about isn't it come on cam show me what you got then be the pilot that we need you to be camp don't just fly into trees don't fly into trees [Music] whatever you do do not fly that's a good shot rpg oh cheeky teabag as well see if i can get whoa i went upside down then you see that what the hell it's strange see the c4 trigger is so iconic motion sensor yeah it is look at it you see that you just think bad company don't you it's just iconic with bad company oh wait wait i can put c4 on it wait wait wait wait let me put dude let me put c4 okay okay let's go go go and go find me a target oh no this is not gonna end well is it the beeping i mean that literally stood in the middle of the flag i mean yeah done that's not how you do c4 jeeps nice motion sensor transmitting that is it still there oh my god it nearly just flew into me oh nice shot [Music] i was waiting for dan to do something you know i wanted dan to take me to the i need to reload you can't just put c4 down there now there's nothing there yeah i was waiting for dan to take me to the promised land and the promised land in that occasion was a a tank you know some kind of a tank or vehicle so dead look at this uh merry christmas thing they've got here how do i get that i'm trying to get that gun let me know how i got out there me are you trying for the knife aren't you i know your game i know your game buddy oh good shot yeah you can go prone in this intron so i've just got i've got bad company to everything apart from movement behavior you know i'm not really a big fan of the classic pc2 movement behavior in a modern game this doesn't work very well you can't sprint strafe and you can't throw them so oh that was nearly a collab hey dan what's up should we go up here is this real virgil nothing is real have you seen the matrix it's a documentary your body is actually a battery none of this is real i think the red pill or the blue pill it's your choice that just goes outside there i'm sure in the original map you could go all the way up [Music] edit player card in the menu yeah that's how you change your player card can i get some armor here these guys are literally just following me around i've got my own little private squad it's great look at this i'm gonna try and kill that guy what the you died what killed me can anyone explain what just happened anyone watching the stream right now just anyone help me understand was it the matrix genuinely don't know what happened hit reg dice thank you what maybe it was the matrix yeah the matrix killed me the matrix has you now bad guy down that's a friendly helicopter overcompensated a bit there didn't i no i'm under compensating that wasn't a head shot dice okay good shot craig helly fell on you the ceiling collapsed i don't think the ceiling can collapse there that's not a thing oh good shot res yes oh oh god damn it somebody draw the fire hey robert what's up wall factor doctor aide i used to nail this map with the gold magnum now i'm struggling in 2042. well the gunplay is different it's not it's not the same it's not the same experience you know so that might be having an impact on how you're playing doesn't quite feel the same hopefully that tank doesn't get me throwing motion sensor now there's another tank oh my goodness but i'm gonna see fallen pokeball go deploying motion sensor blowing motion sensor is that the original voice there's some little crabs here look at this you saw that happen to your friend didn't you can happen to you if you show me your head another one hits the deck play the trick

coming along barry no hit marker kill do your best american accent how's that i wouldn't say best though i mean that's you know i've got to be listening to americans and then i can do it better because i start with something that's quite what's the word cliche i guess i need to like watch watch a tv show where there's lots of americans talking and then you know i start to pick it up they use elongated arms a lot or i'll tell you what i'll make his sniping montage just for you okay gonna take me awhile though i need to get the clips nobody can get the florida accent right [Music] what's the florida accent [Music] oh no there was a tank as well save yourself not me i've been to florida a few times but i'm not i don't really know what the accent is because there's so many tourists there so you don't know you arrest me thank you i don't know what the local accent is you know you sound like a stoned liam neeson interesting ted interesting can you play some portal frederick we are playing portal this is battlefield portal sure he did that i don't know who just shot me hold on hold on there's two kills here that i should get oh so matt granger thank you for coming to the stream appreciate you being here buddy what the dpi 1600 in-game sense is for yeah i know it's like out of all the videos that i post whenever i do a sniper game play it usually gets a really good response people always so when you do your next sniper video i haven't i haven't really done a proper s in like individual sniper video for 2042 yet i've done clips like in montages kind of thing like there was like a battlefield funny moments video and there was one where we were all using a soft lamp and there were some nice sniper clips in those motions but i haven't done like a dedicated sniper gameplay video yeah so i will it's just you know i haven't really had a chance to at all been so busy there's been a lot of variety on the channel recently which i really like you know it keeps me uh creative it keeps me engaged and hopefully you guys like the variety as well you know it's not just one game i'm not bush hockey hide here without being seen now the red dot come up ah what were they doing over there i suppose they could ask me the the same question grato jack has a personal medic hired i swear grato i don't know any of these people they just joined the server uh they're definitely following me around though because you know we're live on the stream but that's cool man they want to do that that's cool oh my god pam you need to get your pilot license again come on

servers if you play on pc anyway i don't know what it's like on console i feel like i need to increase my sensitivity for this throwing motion sensor i now in thank you for the six months man appreciate that i'm not sure if this will be a great sniper map but we'll try and make it work i love this map so much chaby yeah it's good mapping it classic there's another one there oh there's one more on the left trying to get him team 17 just separated from them but they lost their publisher i'm sure that'd be all right like they were a top seller on steam it might just go self-published or something or find a new publisher yeah i'll definitely be doing more videos on that i think what i might do is [Music] like a sing single player play through some of the levels you know like i did with the first video where i just played through the entire mission a shot i might do that for like the most interesting missions in the game people like to watch them you know is this a premium map i don't have this one johnny it's in portal you need to click on battlefield portal on the main menu we're gonna fight the other helicopter [Music] what if i can and i see foreign the radius isn't that big on it i'm dead ah i didn't get the head shot tactical scottish what's up love from team westy how's it going man is there a chance you'll play insurgency sandstorm again yeah indeed i need to check it out to be honest i haven't played that game in a while i presume that it's had a lot of updates i know it's on console as well we oh god not like this i wonder if they say not like this in the new matrix movie not like this motion set for transmitting oh there's a tank on the right oh no jed thank you for the five loved the bf50 yesterday got a strict 4040p 278s monitor for christmas hooking it up now super excited thank you jed yeah i mean um 1440p 270 hertz damn not many games you can get that kind of frame rating though unless you're playing stuff like csgo and valorum or maybe like pod on pc with low settings or something like that [Music] can we jump through this there is the whole movies are not like this god i've not been to see it yet there's another guy here oh we are hitting the headshots today guys i'm enjoying this let me tell you it's good fun what's up michael jones season greetings from new zealand i hope you had a good christmas it's been a good year watching all your content thank you michael hurry i'm good thank you i like doing random slides when i'm running so do i put it you play vr sometimes i haven't played vr in a while you know in a long long time since i've done vr jack snipes my husband and then me sorry that's funny wish you could have an attachment that takes away the sniper glint on the scope you've never been able to do that in battlefield you can do that in some card games [Music] a rocco no this is my own server it's my own portal server that i've made we're gonna do bf3 after this so i'm gonna shut the server down and then open a new one so like more people can join damn it i'm missing easy shots here i'm in trouble [Music] vr is only for gaming nerds grenade great like there's a lot of great applications and games for it i just hate wearing a headset for more than like 20 minutes [Music] there's some great fitness games for vr beat saber for example rhythm fitness game boxing games that kind of thing there's a couple of star wars games that are quite fun too did you hear me i was gonna go for the knife i feel sad now edon thank you for the 20 where can i see my kd in the main browser you can't you can't see uk you don't you don't have like a stats page in this game at all anything and everything i've got no presents as normal sorry to hear that man i mostly just got socks and chocolate and you know what i'm happy with that i think i got him intron how's your head save yourself who lost course save yourself he was just going home with him lng over here [Applause] dead guy down you play some bf1 yeah i've got bf1 video coming up soon i said in my video yesterday that i'm gonna start implementing regular content from the old battlefield games in as well because as many plans and ideas as i've got for 2042 um i missed too many shots there get up i'm gonna start doing the older games as well you know cycling them in regularly that's it the f1 beer five three four those games still have player bases you know and i enjoy playing them so i will continue to make content on those games you know as long as you guys keep watching and i keep enjoying it i'll keep doing it it's that simple there's a tank here somewhere wow missed too many easy shots there didn't i did you have christmas pudding yeah i did so i was looking at the chat then just running forward my eyes closed i did have christmas pudding my my mom uh made some homemade christmas pudding it was good and she made some mince pies as well oh my goodness what have i spawned into here motion sensor away from here cover me i'm reloading do you play with maxton i don't know who that is amir sorry do a red dead redemption 2 playthrough oh my god isn't that game like 80 hours long i don't think i could fit that in sorry i think there should be a stats page though i don't really see why they haven't got one just so you can see how you're doing causing big problems here aren't i oh no they know now i'm stuck they're gonna come after me yeah there we go [Music] purple pompano you got the lego darth vader helmet that's awesome do you mean the one that's a picture that you hang on the wall you have to build it and then you hang it on the wall or a different one like a proper 3d one cover me that was so funny i'm there's a lot of enemies around right now i don't know why i'm doing this you gotta look out for your fellow squad mate don't you right that's what it's all about that's the guy i wanted to knife earlier i should have done it then maybe dark have you ever played airsoft in real life um i haven't actually going up here oh what where was the takedown you need to give hunt show down a tron console it feels extra stiff toasted almond now i haven't played it myself recently but i've heard that if you have the ps4 pro or the series x it actually has 60 fps on it now so you might want to look at i don't know what console you have but it could be that you're playing you know one of the uh older versions but it could just be extra stiff maybe that's just how it is i mean hunt showdown is quite a stiff game anyway you know it's purposefully that way so it could be that that is what you're feeling on pc it runs great i like the fps is good the performance used to be quite bad but they've done a lot of optimization on it and it runs great now look at this doesn't this remind you of old school battlefield right here what what is going on i got you why does it take three c4 more than that to blow it up wow wow i sounded like uh owen wilson then wow credit oh no too much pain they introduced poor weapons to all that warfare no they haven't luke that would be good though i think they should do that because apart from the 1942 weapons i think it makes sense right like he dodged my bullet it's feasible that in a world where everyone is at war no one really has any allegiance to a country and people are like scrapping for food and supplies that they would use old weapons so yeah totally they should put bad company 2 and bf3 guns in why not i think the only limitation would be the there's not much customization for them right like the plus menu there's not much there for bad company 2 and bf3 weapons let's go it's dead now oh that was a headshot then [Music] nice trade kill derek thank you for the five cover me i'm reloading uh prawn yes they work thank you for the 20. appreciate that they do work if i don't see it it's just probably because i haven't noticed it you just grenade yourself where'd you go there you go that guy just exploded thanks again derek what's up rick your voice is soothing that's good to hear you got a headache i don't think the weapon sounds will help with that though we're gonna lose this one what's the name of the server put us just called jack frags conquest i'm gonna make a new one in a sec this guy trying to defend me on the team sounded a bit like sylvester stallone there are so many in-game voices for characters that sound like sylvester stallone maybe i'm just crazy [Music] rpg guy over here ah missed two shots there yeah bf3 next gabby yeah three don't worry this map is like bf1 is it you think it plays like a bf1 now oh you see that ragdoll there did you like shanghai nights i've not seen it beats on drums i don't think i've seen shanghai nights or maybe i did just once at the cinema oh god oh god no i think i did but i don't remember much about it being honest with you is it jackie chan and owen wilson i think it's those two what's the most infantry kills you've got i don't know to be honest in a battlefield game well it depends doesn't it because you mean like in a vanilla server because if you mean in a any server well it could be in the hundreds right because i could have played on a server with like 2 000 tickets or something aaron thank you for the 18 months two years buddy thank you oh that doesn't make sense that's not two years that's never my strong suit i was thinking about it in the terms of a baby because nine months would be youtube baby then 18 months would be your second youtube baby birthday does that make sense i'm gonna go with that he's behind you they're always behind me i'm a lost cause right away what's up apollyon ajp icarno people play portal yeah oh what's going on i'm playing on low apart from texture details small and mighty here what's my take on milsims mill sims are cool i like to dip in and out of milsim games i can't play them all the time they require like so much attention danger parachute right there boys danger parachutes wyatt mullins cheers for four months eating chicken noodle with a head cold mixed with the jeff livestream makes it all better chicken noodle though hello what you got some spicy chicken ramen or something beef mushroom you got going on there brian hazard is like the only thing that is pretty much doa yeah i think so brian i don't think anyone's playing has its own that's a good game hip fire kills 42 did i really get 42 135 kills [Music] uh derek thanks for becoming a member finally [Music] oliver is chicken noodle soup not i think in the uk it totally is all right we're gonna drop another two codes in chat here guys these are 2042 pc codes for the epic game store i'm just gonna end this server and we'll make another one on bf3 see you later thanks for coming she has intron as a zone needs a complete overhaul for me to want to play again i'd head you bet that a lot of people feel that way as well it's not enough meat there add some meat put some meat in you know take down confirm don't play alden ring yeah i did fill it i did a video on it the game was destroyed all plays disconnected error code there's no error is that i mean the game was destroyed it's simple are they gonna make portal its own game i don't like the rest of 2042 i don't know tanner i can see a world where maybe portal or hazard zone goes free to play maybe even the main game you know see what they do like i said yesterday in my video i think you know like um was it end of november i think it was the end of november like the first week of december licensee made a load of announcements about this game about 2042 um a lot of people left um left dice so there's obviously been a changing of the guard there there was a new general manager vince zampella is now the lead for the whole battlefield franchise they've opened up a new studio in seattle um and they said that they're dedicated to this game to 2042 but what they do with it i don't know you know do they make it free to play did they change the live service plans do they expand on what they've got do they keep with the existing plan that they had already and just make it who knows yeah we'll see it's going to be an interesting couple months i expect there'll be some kind of announcement january or february we'll see right okay so oh by the way this full code's been dropped already in the chat if you guys get one of those codes and use it um just let me know just tweet me a picture and say hey i've got one of the codes okay host okay battlefield 3 conquest this time we still going to be sniping what are the snipers is it just the oh actually in bf3 it might be a bit tricky because isn't it it's just a m98b with a 10x on right uh so this is jack frags pain that dice here we go conquest oh server so anyone feel free to join if you want jump on in is ready or not worth buying it's up to you man i mean do you like tactical shooters like old-school rainbow six stars swat games you'll probably like it i can't tell you what anything's worth though something that's worth something to me is different for you isn't it worth is subjective how much time have you got um how much money have you got how many games do you play what kind of games do you like you know i can't decide that for you tim white thank you for the two man when are you gonna play with enkel's mom again maybe one day maybe if they make pub g2 she'll come back how long have i been gaming for ever since i was a little kid is the attack helicopter there well someone's got it already i think when was the first time that i played a game i don't know maybe like four or five like master systems do i have um okay so i've got anti-air they're gonna flare that there's no shell canals where did the attack helicopter go [Applause] they got their players back i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead i'm dead a jet got me this longy do i have any halo related videos gregory i have said this before but um if i get a chance i'm gonna stream the halo infinite campaign um multiplayer vids yeah definitely like when they do a couple new maps maybe did you ever own a nintendo 64 [ __ ] maniac dude n64 was my jam like that was i mean i had other consoles but the n64 was one of my favorites i put a different scope oh i can eight times okay so we can do this yeah dude i had an n64 goldeneye star fox super mario 64 mario kart diddy kong racing donkey kong 64 jet force gemini blast courts perfect dark smash brothers zelda ocarina of time one of the best games ever yeah i had an air 64. i i loved it man so good obviously there's a lot more games than that but just some of the ones that i railed off the top of my head there yes on those hair canals yeah they did not have jets in pretty sure it had jets in bf3 it did yeah it did rogue squadron was lit pod racer oh my god star wars pod racer why don't they make another star wars pod racer game come on and the other star wars game empires empire of what was it called empire something shadows of the empire oh so good i've still not tried world war three everyone says i should give it a go but i had a chance really i've heard that the vehicles are just so op oh i think my game crashed did my game crash i think we crashed have a look directx function error that's no good is it it says that my graphics card has been removed guys i'm i'm pretty sure that my graphics card hasn't been removed look at this does anyone else get this error the gpu will not respond to more commands this error oh no this is a different error i got the graphics card removed error earlier that sucks i'll try and fix this hold on um the clog what's your least favorite christmas food diddy kong racing better than mario kart a lot of people say that i mean it was just a different vibe wasn't it like there was a lot more narrative in in diddy kong racing like mario kart 64 didn't really have that narrative really and then you fight that boss at the end don't you what was the boss called on it was like a pig flew on a rocket do you guys remember what was the name of it my least favorite christmas food sprouts i can't stand sprouts they make me gag my mother and my grandma used to force-feed me sprouts when i was a little kid because they said that it was good for me they used to make me eat them and if i didn't eat them they would like mash them up and hide them in the mashed potato is that full oh my god there's nine people in the queue right sorry i'm gonna take that server down and host another one year three conquest um it's back there we go try that no not like this rocket pig no he wasn't called rocket pig paul but that's a good name for a bad guy what are sprouts oh my god dude devil spawn i think is it doing the thing where it says that it shut my server down but it didn't actually shut it down nice the pig boss was called whiz pig that's it man you got it whis pig doing that thing on the hardest difficulty man that was tricky please i'm trying to guys if you're watching the stream and you're still on that server can you leave please because this is a bit temperamental this system it doesn't work whispering flaxsaw thank you wyatt five thank you literally the best xmas food i've had was my grandma's breaded pork chops and mashed potato what about churrock yeah i played churro brian churock was hilarious because um it actually had like pretty decent for the time character models and and guns and animations and particle effects considering it was running on a nintendo 64 but because it had all that detail up close the rest of the game had to be shrouded in fog so you could only see like 50 or 60 feet in front of you and the rest was just fog yeah please stop joining that server guys if this worked i wouldn't have to ask you to do this but it just doesn't work so server shut down successfully take down dice please i mean i could just join it now couldn't i let's join just join it again guys is it working it is working okay i reckon in about two minutes it'll just randomly turn off richie thank you for the other months i've played in a few weeks have they made improvements hope you well jack thank you um they've made improvements in terms of bugs and hit reg that's about it hello man we also got hassan and m goods welcome yeah so if you guys want to join up again the server is jack frags the f3 conquest what hassan you want to get oh you're full yeah yeah it's gonna switch to caspian border anyway yeah but there's no there's no new content or anything they haven't put any features in either so it'll be pretty much the same game that you played at launch but it's less buggy and um the range is a bit better that's it whoa hopefully we don't crash we got a full server now tell you what next map seen as this one was chalked start with a fresh caspian border uh mayonnaise 13 thank you for becoming a member it's very kind of you if you want access to the discord mayonnaise go to jackfraggs.com discord modern i saw a leak about infinity ward making a banger mw2 in 2022 with amazing graphics and super realistic gameplay super excited for a real cod but dan yeah i've heard that as well everything is pointing to the next game being modern warfare 2. um some kind of like cartel favela style you know drug lords that kind of thing i think that could be a cool setting i wish i would save what i use i need to put that in the center don't i that's why yeah what i think is going to happen is warzone 2. i think they're going to do it because infinity ward made warzone in collaboration with raven but you know i've read a couple of interviews and articles it seemed like the inception of it and most of the work was done at infinity ward raven were a support studio until infinity ward handed it over to them when they started working on the next game now i reckon next year we're going to get modern warfare 2 there's also rumors of some kind of like escape from tarkov style mode but i also reckon we're going to get warzone 2.0 and i think what they'll do is they'll do a brand new map infinity ward will do a brand new warzone map and they will wipe the slate clean with warzone i think they're just gonna go okay warzone chapter one is done we had modern warfare 19 we had cold war and we had vanguard i think but now that's all gone and we're starting fresh with just modern warfare two weapons like i think that could be pretty cool um the clog that's very kind you thank you for becoming a member and the server's just randomly what is going on it's literally just caught up with that earlier command that i did but yeah wipe the slate cl clean warzone 2.0 give me a sec i'm going to i'm going to go next map well you know what let's just play no shaw since we didn't and then we'll do aspirin after yeah warzone 2.0 all your operators disappear all your weapons blueprints all that stuff goes away that's what i think's gonna happen i don't know for sure though [Music] uh matt what's up man thank you for the five is it true snap next and cast checks uh no comment [Music] oh no do i have a gunner [Music] i don't think i have a gunner we oh my god yeah watch out oh the rib boat you see the ribbon but it was a river it's gone now sam thanks for five you should check out an airsoft video and do some conjuring see what you think about it i used to watch level cap is it crashed again why is it crashing on that map guys i'm sorry i don't know why it's crashing it's crashed twice now on that map does this happen a lot of no-show canals or is this is this my pc is this a game what's going on alexi cheers for the 449 next battlefield 1700 with muskets uh i don't think that's gonna happen hey jordy thank you overheating i don't see why i don't i don't think i've got my gpu overclocked having the same issues in custom portal lobbies so you think it's a you think it's a portal thing hey summer yeah we're going to be live for another 2 hours and 30 minutes good morning from western australia what's up terence [Music] reinstall nvidia drivers i think i've got the latest ones it's just crashed twice on that map which is a bit strange does dice validate portal programming to some degree knocks but i've not done any editing in the logic editor for this um it's just a vanilla experience on the f3 map it's just caspian border and no shark canals with bf3 there's no i haven't changed any logic it's pain then i mean that is my description and it has crashed twice for me there so here you go well if i try and take it down it's gonna do that thing again isn't it you think it's a poor thing main game seems fine hmm and it didn't crash on caspian border we were only playing it for about like what five minutes so let me just check something what's that while i'm in this queue i'm just going to check something on my desktop make sure that my cheats are working correctly yeah wall hack is on inbox on board mode is on no clip is on [Music] soft aim is on see look at this like my gpu isn't overclocked or anything the temperature's uh fine temperature's 58c give it another go draw what what happened i forgot to take no recoil oh damn i'm sniping anyway so it doesn't matter what's my server code you should just be able to see it in the server browser guardian what's the q the q was nine people in tron but i think people left so i could join so thank you for that guys where is

dummy can't wait for the official jack frags video game mcclogg wait wait wait wait i'm going why have i got a shotgun i mean i might make a studio one day or join one but i don't think i'd ever just make my own you know it would be terrible i mean what would it be about would be awful why nice did i not just select the m98 am i going crazy and you pick it and it still says dial 12. there we go hey i'm dead oh my gosh thank you daniel cheers for becoming a member i'm looking at the chat i'm an idiot are people still playing battlefield 5. yes jason lots of people are playing battlefield 5. it's been on sale many times and it's also on game pass i think on xbox you get ea play don't you and i think it's included in that ray gamer sorry jack both crashes happened immediately when i loaded in from the queue wait it's crashed again what is going on every time that you connect to the server you just crash my game i mean [Laughter] as soon as i read that it crashed did you try and join again the game is possessed yeah that's funny i think it's something to do with portal don't use the c word we try should we just try around of all that warfare i'm ready and see see if it crashes hey mark what's up jason hey silk bruno kristoff good to see you guys yeah i'm gonna try if i can get through a full round of all that warfare 64 players see what happens why have i got the suppressor on this i can't take it off of course i think i just did it for oh we were testing suppressors won't we remember that suppressor video that i did guys where we were like this is why you're on the mini map all the time it's because the suppressors don't well two of them don't work the game can't handle the power maybe most games can though right [Applause] oh it's weird going and switching from paul to the main game that's not a headshot which suppressors don't work pb heavy suppressor works this one does not wrap suppressor 6k suppressor doesn't work uh what's the other one called there's another one that's kind of like rectangle that one works so these one what these ones only work if the person is 10 meters away if they're within 10 meters it doesn't work now the description says that it will keep you off the minimap that isn't true it actually keeps you off the minimap if the enemy is 10 meters away so it's either this description is broken or the attachment itself is broken i did a whole video on it it's called this is why you suck at battlefield 2042 and did you know this guys right if you fire your gun unsuppressed or with any suppressor apart from the two that work you're on the minimap for five seconds when you stop shooting five seconds keep that in mind okay that's just one way that you can be on the minimap like if you look here at the descriptions right so pb heavy suppressor no mean amount spotting while firing this one works doesn't matter what range um wrap suppressor no mini map spotting while firing only works up to 10 meters and then 6k u suppressor again it says no minor spine not true where's the old long boy what i want six times is that the eight times there extended mug you want that one don't you wish they added mouse and keyboard support for console i think that'd be cool yeah i mean there are a lot of other of course he's got armor on there a lot of other modern games that are allowing mouse and keyboard console now i think as long as they've got input based matchmaking or a bias towards it i think it's okay i want to kill this guy can't stand armor man really don't like it you guys going home i don't think i'm leading enough there what's your password i don't know password123 maybe are you going up bye okay oh i don't think i'm gonna make it right now we oh my god that doesn't happen very often ow how do you level up faster play the objective place angel drop armor plates drop the loadout crate don't be sad this is just how it works out sometimes drop med kick let's drop ammo so pokeballs on breakthrough use casper's drone spot people some ways to level up quick now [Music] what's up wyatt i didn't crash then did i zero the people that can't find the servering pools will have to fill the game searched so the server browser also shows the games that are already full yeah you're right we're not playing on that at the moment if i can get through an entire round of breakthrough now without crashing i think it's a poor thing i don't think there's anything going on with my pc because like i've played a lot of games recently and hadn't had any crashes warzone in particular used to crash a lot but on my new pc it doesn't reality yeah we're live buddy live right now thank you for coming bombing bots is the fastest route to 60 pino they nerfed it can't do that put a cap on portal servers custom portal servers anyway [Music] i'll break away cool why does my game look different color by these are 2042 codes pc for the epic game store is the 12 900k worth it i mean it's the best gaming processor at the moment sean so for me yeah it's a business expense for me though so you know if it's a personal thing then it's based on your personal situation isn't it [Music] jack please don't let the man be on the moon paulina the man is always on the moon isn't it always the same as well because of the orientation of the earth and the moon so we can only see the light side of the moon so it's always the same am i not dead oh my god that sound what the hell there's a really interesting thing that i saw on mkbhd's channel mkbhd does tech reviews great channel he was talking about a chinese smartphone i don't remember what it was called and it had a filter on it the fate the moon because it's always the same so it had like uh i don't know what it was let's say 200 times zoom on it right up to a certain point it was optical and then it changes to digital but it used ai to realize that you were looking at the moon and if it did that it would replace the moon with a really high definition picture then you would take the picture and be like oh my god look how good my camera is like look how clear the moon looks and the company denied it but everyone's picture of the moon was the same so it was obviously happening i just think that's really interesting but okay [Music] that's a good time for that to blow yeah it was it was a really interesting video in in all really because it was about how like cameras on smartphones are good but there's a lot of ai that cheats and it makes up for a lack of information by using ai to guess what things should be and how they should look like and there's a there's a debate there you know is it ethical is it not does it matter is it just art and create creativity really interesting video um i recommend watching it if you i mean if you don't watch mkbhd anyway you should if you're into tech but that video was really good really interesting that one was blind i love that this is a good spot there there are some apps that can like make you smile and like completely change the shape of your face even in video format now as well and literally do it in a video so you could be live streaming and your face could be look looking completely different how it actually is can you actually shoot the driver i don't think he can from the back maybe with the big boy bullets sws i think the sws is better than the dxr the xr does more damage but i think the fact that you get so many more shots with the sws is there a squad mate behind me i know it's an irish i like this angle here though a storm i don't think you can get a tornado on this map can you no corey thank you for the five what games am i looking forward to next year um god of war two new modern warfare like we were talking about earlier horizon zero dawn two i'm interested to see what they do with this game will they completely change it what will it be in six months time i don't know what the hell what's that an attack helicopter corpse i'm interested to see what happens with warzone as well i'm gonna get a res can you give more codes i've got another seven to give away drop them in a little bit yeah the dxr has faster bullet so it doesn't have as much bullet drop on it so it can be a bit easier to hit running targets sometimes all depends about what range you like to play at them right like if you like to play at more extreme ranges the dxr is probably going to be better for you if you're more like medium close range you know kind of playing like i am now maybe the sws is better for you have i tried any of the mills themselves yeah i have chill not for a while hey tobo just stopping by to say hi i hope you had a nice crisp but same to you turbo i hope you're all right my man thank you for coming bye in this game i mean they're mostly very similar though [Music] of course because i've played portal it doesn't save my setup resets everything see that rank i think that was the time yeah i'm definitely gonna do a sniper video i'm feeling it what did i get for christmas chocolate and socks just like every year and you know what i'm happy with that i don't want anything really like i don't expect anyone to ever buy me a present i just like seeing family good food that's it also christmas movies you know i like watching a christmas movie lord of the rings star wars just watched the grinch for the first time last night that was good elf [Music] bye hard anyone that says die hard isn't a christmas movie is wrong it literally is about a christmas party there are christmas trees in the movie [Music] it's a christmas movie isn't it let's be honest with ourselves here guys come on the electric well i'm not crashing in the main game guys so i think you know maybe it is a portal thing unbiased thank you for the 20. that's very kind here i'm doing well thanks you're going to hunt showdown and i agree that it's really good yeah hunt's great is a fantastic game just difficult really steep learning curve but once you get it so good we'll just do that i think someone's soft lamb in that is out of range closer come on bye bye soft ones are so good thank you whoever's doing that these are you gonna stream any battlefield games tonight i mean this is about go game okay val see you later thank you yeah sorry about the crashing i don't know what's going on there hopefully i can have a look at that and get it fixed who lose v10 how do we lose b1 sam thank you 20. why is english pudding called spotted dick i don't know some things just are the way they are alfie okay let's watch the shadow around there i do a thing you know hey bitter what's up andrea now don't let them capture the other point there's a guy right here really enjoyed the ready or not videos more of those please thank you and amino yeah there'll definitely be more it's too quick i love that people are actually soft lambing now no one ever used to do this should die i think really good way of dealing with vehicles bing bong man that was a classic matimo although it wasn't a small just a lock on you know bing bong has to be a sword isn't it it's a little head there have i ever played battlefront 2 yeah of course king battlefront 2 started really bad but then they did some really great plc for it and by the end of its life it was brilliant 300 meters i mean there's a few things in it that you know i kind of wish they'd have done differently like i wish that it had a proper first person only mode in it so there's a lot of grenade spam in that game as well and also i kind of wish that some of the maps were wider and had more flanking routes rather than just corridors a lot of them are quite similar in that respect and they get really grenade spammy but yeah it's a great star wars game let me stop that that wasn't a kill i was a headshot thank you the 50. the only qualifiers for a christmas movie should be they take place during christmas or were released during christmas i don't know about release during christmas because i could release a movie about a tropical party in june in december if i wanted to you know not that anyone would do that because that's a really bad idea but do i have screen shape turned off i think i've got it on the lowest value that's what you mean my head there mama screw armor i'm okay i want you to walk into my bullet let's go what's the best ever card yours is modern warfare 2 best ever cod my favorite card is cod 4 first modern warfare i played the hell out of that game i used to play like they had something called pro mod it was competitive i used to play competitive counter strike and then the team that i was with for a few years when we wanted like a bit of down time we would just play pro mod for fun just search and destroy you know yeah i have to say original modern warfare is probably my favorite after that maybe in terms of just sheer fun and multiplayer black ops 2 what are we doing here it's a ranger who these tanks are they're trying to make whoa it's not that time of the year guys come on my fave card is cod and chips good cod solid choice the very first call of duty was world war ii and um you know that was just a great experience because it it was just a good arena shooter and even though i only had like a 56k connection at the time the amount of fun that i had on that this guy over here i'm going to mark him for an 8 rest not going to get rest did we win we won i think a lot of people who say modern warfare 2 probably it was their first card game on console like on the 360. angel does it again but modern warfare 2 i think went a lot more like more arcadey than cod four spectacular what's the ring to pass how you doing is he gonna the team that made battalion are making a standalone pro mod game oh i saw that actually does he tommo told me about that that might actually have a chance we'll see happy boxing day edgy what's up take a drink of water killer jamie cheers for the two hi jack i said you were tweeting my pc and so did you know let's have a look oh yeah i see jamie oh that looks nice man you got some nice rgb going on that case very pastel colors i like that that's a cool staircase isn't it myself oh and i also see the war zone poster what a legend thank you jamie there's a new poster coming out by the way soon i'm not showing you what it is yet but you'll get to see it soon and it'll be limited edition same as the first one whenever angel talks you can hear jack die a little bit inside yeah i think that's true cover the title is a lie the title was there just so you could write that comment do i like the bg's i mean they've got some classic songs but they're not i don't really listen to them regularly they're quite old now aren't they did the beaches even make music anymore i don't think so how can we lose yeah that was brilliant me and my mate uh used to play that all the time at school mohawk that came before cod as well didn't it i think mohawk came just before cod carrington was a great level on that game and the springfield sniper oh you felt like you were playing in saving private ryan in melevon and multiplayer a new roblox update yeah this is roblox obviously it's good man they've like just copied battlefield basically did i ever play day defeat of course funk yeah dead defeat was one of the best uh half-life mods nearly said counter-strike though their defeat was great running around just one banging everyone with the car 98 yeah and then they did their defeat source which didn't quite feel as good but it was it was fine hey nick from darby i'm good thanks that was a double not bad to start around with the collateral is it tips for new players don't die yeah that's a pretty good tip i've never played roblox i don't think i ever will it's very popular though a game isn't it let's see for kids angel does it again suck on my angel ow ow that's a roboduck yeah indeed operation flashpoint that's also a good one now sure i'm going back up to get killed by that sniper again let's go so paul paul i presume you got my message on discord by the way looks awesome thank you yeah return to castle wolfenstein that was also a great shooter of course you've got armor that first shot did they shoot me through the side of that there not like i was around the corner with the first shot not on the second on the first though definitely this christmas game there aren't really any christmas games i can't think of any i mean christmas video game or like a board game what do you mean i'm gonna go up here on the right and see what's going on might be some better targets did i ever play the mass effect games yeah of course uh one two and three i played andromeda for about two hours and i just didn't like it so yeah not much of andromeda can't move day after boxing day i'm not even a sniper normally but i do find it satisfying in 2042 it is very satisfying are there any christmas video games like has there ever been a triple a video game set in or around christmas max payne i'm just thinking off the top of my head was max payne said christmas it was snowy wasn't it i don't remember if it was at christmas though oh my god [Music] your fave jack defending yeah i should switch from now thank you for reminding me buy hard yeah die hard had a couple of games didn't it die hard had a game for the playstation one and it had a light gun one part of it was a light gun one part of it was a third person game and was the other part a fps do you guys know what i'm talking about do you remember that you know what let's try 128 because it didn't crash like this whole point of doing this is to test if it crashed and it hasn't crashed in all that warfare miles morales the division yeah although the division it's not really set at christmas is it it's just the virus started at christmas time i don't want to play this map on breakthrough unless i'm attacking am i attacking yeah the division is just stuck in time in christmas it doesn't necessarily set christmas right driving game yeah it was a driving game am i attacking i'm defending uh we're gonna drop another two codes in the chat now let's make the impossible possible any netflix recommendations lockers i've just finished watching the witcher season two and it was way better than the first season like so much better i'm watching season three of titans dc titans um not much else at the moment to be honest defending again oh it could be interesting nope arcane is supposed to be good i've not seen it yet i remember a couple streams ago i asked like should i watch arcane and i'm ready like 80 said yeah i just played breakaway as well didn't i don't look ups just come out that's uh jennifer lawrence and leonardo dicaprio isn't it that looks really good i might watch that kaleidoscope okay okay i'm attacking finally oh that was close oh no it's right at the start hang on they give you 600 tickets oh this feels really laggy tank 140 distance 200 meters can i even see my ping i don't know maria can you stop dodging my bullets oh my god yeah that was such an annoying player to fight well i didn't really fight them did i they didn't shoot at me once oh i got you bro thanks to the five seven put one okay eleven really laggy when i joined maybe it was because the start of the round did you watch hawkeye yeah yeah i did i watched all the hawkeye giro it was good it was quite predictable but it was good i didn't know about the thing i wasn't spoiled for that so that's good that was quite a surprise a nice surprise so oh my god we took a i see you take it down and someone with a software unlocked hello from pakistan what's up leaf how you doing looking forward to the book of boba fett yeah i mean i hope they've actually put some time into that series you know i feel like it just came along really quickly and you know i don't want it to just be like hey here's a series about boba fett and it's just not that interesting you know it's gonna be uh it's gonna have some meat on it you think if i pitched that to disney they'd make a good show hank you're gonna go up in the air mate oh how do i miss that dude i want to put it back oh i need to reload hello northern gorilla what's up you're gonna stand up angel what's going on there angel come on angel i don't want to get sniped while i'm waiting for you to pee are you still there angel oh no you're dead no angel maria there is hip fire spread on the launcher that doesn't really make sense oh no money ranger the ranger should have a angel it was you all along it'd be cool if the ranger had a weak spot on it like if you sniped it directly in the eye or something it exploded or did like you know more damage look all these guys here what are we doing lads what are we doing i suppose they are actually playing the objective there aren't there hey rambi how's the snipes yeah it's nice to be good today man i'm getting flanked here aren't we you're lucky oh my god grenade escape from tarkov with the boys win tixton um i'm planning to play some tarkov with acolyte now i don't know when it's gonna be and also i haven't played it in a long time so my ability on that game is not going to be good to start with so the first couple videos will probably be like what the hell's going on jack you're a complete noob um and that's fine you know too many targets here i don't know who to focus on well yeah so me and connor are gonna play some um i've watched a video by a guy called pesterly who did a beginner's guide because i have played it and i've done a few videos on it but i've never really committed enough time to it to really get it and understand it because there's a lot of meta and intricacy in that game that i just don't have knowledge of yet well i'm willing to give it some time you know to learn it a bit sure are we losing a1 that's not good we lose there's a barista right there why didn't that come up on the scan i suppose it never does right krampus krampus isn't in this game yeah they're taking that point back i mean that's if they get that that's actually devastating so i guess we're ruined i mean i don't know what to tell you getting it back three four two two two one kill him please use the little bird it's so good if i could yeah i would if i get a chance to i'll use it this place uh sundance to get a flank here to get this point and then i can go about sniping i think are you starting a new server jack killer i don't know jamie um it doesn't it's not crashing in all that warfare so maybe it was the fact that i was playing portal that it was crashing where did they come from there's so many there [Music] jack your closed captions are coming out a second before you say the words that's because i can time travel oh bird that's not very good though is it can you kill them dcb kill the people get this osprey maybe oh wow the jet flew into i've got the wrong rockets let me close what's up nick how you going do i like the gvt4570 you mean the this one oh the mk2 one i've not used it you know not really used it so i couldn't give a impression on it to be honest i don't see many people using it either so i don't know if it's worth a shot some people swear by it though they say it's good i'm scary mayor's leg yeah kind of hey jeff i'm good man how are you the hell okay there's a lot of problems with the hit range on this gun in particular they still haven't fixed this not great because it's supposed to be anti-infantry but you just get railed like so down oh come on hovercraft out the way what happened with that grenade he's so weird how are we going to take this point how are we ever going to take this man hey sketch beats name your ranger i think we did didn't we i'm sure i gave it a name i'm going to go just temporarily guys temporarily we're going to switch to sundance i'm going to take a pkp i'm going to go on to that roof actually i can that's not a bad spawn there get a spawn beacon as well and go up here fly over let's even get behind him point's a nightmare really you got the helicopter what about some bf5 not tonight prologue we're focusing on 2042 tonight the devs went making 2042 while playing just cause write that down i don't know how far i can go come on peek ap don't let me down mary is going to go revive them and she i did get a small beacon down though i've not destroyed it away from my position i've crashed so it does crash on the main game as well what kind of a crash is it you're gonna give me an error no you literally just closed okay cool oh that's the worst kind of error isn't it where it just doesn't give you one hey rip what's up what's up i'm some death hello suicide milad mohammed you've got afk the character sneeze with the camera shake yeah i've seen that a few times mohammed a little easter egg i don't know alex crashed three times today here's the three jeb we tried portal again i'm gonna host the server oh wow there's actually 64 people on it okay i didn't expect that yeah wouldn't drop two codes in the chat now don these are pc codes for the epic game store first come first serve mom unplugged the cable mom all right you know i'm gonna try i'm gonna put my fan speed up on my gpu um just stick it to like 90 or something i don't think you guys can hear that can you oh my god it's like i think it's hitting something in my case 80. try that this is my server by the way if you guys want to join just called jack frank's pf3 conquest oh that just missed the tail helicopter helicopter have you got rockets little birds oh tank please nice i swear these shots are hitting don't play with my heart like that dice ow ow skinner youth if i can't have you no one can jack frank's is that you i can die a happy man now what if it wasn't me anyways these don't crash helicopter helicopter helicopter [Music] helicopter helicopter so what this server is cursed i need i need to stop this this service cast if only showing it down would work if only actually worked the amount of times i press take server down and it never works i think there's a as a bug where like it should shut it down regardless of if there are people on it or not but it just doesn't it just goes now i think i'll i think i'll keep it going for you i know you want to keep it going don't yeah yeah you like that don't you yeah yeah you like it when i just keep the server up even though you told me to take it down don't yeah yeah yeah yeah it's obviously some kind of problem where it just doesn't take it down if there's people on it i have become the helicopter trying to get behind this spectacular is that right is that what they say helicopter helicopter this guy just flying around in circles man oh they bailed rambi thank you for the 50 limiting gpu utilization oh maybe that's what it is no [Applause] i was you this guy's gonna kill me i love the battlefield heroes that was in third person yeah heroes was a great game i did a video on this years ago like it was so far ahead of

bullets what you see all the blood did no damage what is going on don't revive me i deserve to die no i'm the thing i can't aim still no guys we did a whole round without crashing wow incredible i think the hacks allowed me to walk through the wall there maybe i don't know thank you margie yeah yeah for sure man i'm not um i'm not stopping making videos on 2042 like i said it's going to be interesting to see what happens with the game like if they change tactics with it i can aim again [Laughter] do they uh keep it the same stick with the plan he's about there isn't he a spud gun yeah it did kind of look like a spot gun didn't it there's someone on this point but where i mean in here hello where are you guys there's someone hiding here okay they've been killed is it the server no

do you even even you know do you have a fire constantly on around you at all times like a ring of fire are you a mage and can do that what what is it jonah man you idiot it's just two random people in front of me free falling cheating magazines scott thank you so much for becoming a member you're awesome scott thank you how do you stop the pipes from freezing look at this when the whole server

i'm sure yeah one day i'm down like i said i've just been to montreal before what's the name of the server jack frags bf3 conquest am i playing on pc yes i am rolling but cross plays on so if there's a spot you can join you just fly didn't you annoy me boy [Music] i don't know i'm out of range i'm dead now that didn't go very well didn't it it's the awesome edition okay go visit the young sacral i hope he's doing all right i haven't spoken to chris in ages i was actually watching him earlier but i just kind of lurk in the chat i don't like to say anything he's playing talk of i'm you know i want to get back into it like i said it's just had a wipe apparently supposed to be the best time to get back in i was watching him he was running around um is it woods and uh there's some kind of like santa scab in the game at the moment but if you kill him you lose rep or something and he accidentally killed him i didn't really understand to be honest because i haven't played the game in ages if i play with connor you know i know con has played it a lot more than i have so maybe he can teach me a few things there's a tank down here over here hostile tank spotted really enemies the voip has changed everything in a good or a bad way smash it's got directional voip in now doesn't it why do you keep shooting me [Applause] a broken saga do exclamation mark set up or exclamation mark specs you can see my spec just got a new pc i can't shoot it wouldn't let me shoot what the hell i literally clicked there to shoot and it didn't shoot [Music] and then it just it just fired a shot then when i didn't tell it to what is going on like cue the paschal they are there on the roof get your magazines we're loading you need a helicopter he's going after that tank pj we did a whole round no shot canals yes we did it i didn't crash someone did suggest limiting gpu utilization though i might try that off stream eric thanks again why has there never been a jack frags and broken machine collab i've done a few videos and live streams they've broken broken's a good lad works very hard as well a b sod gaming 30 bucks for 2042 on egs right now it's hero how long am i going to be live i'm going to be live for another 45 minutes we're going to drop another two codes in chat here epic game store codes for 2042 i think it's the ultimate edition as well i think there's two four six eight i think there's three left we'll drop two in then we'll do one at the end guys if you're enjoying the stream hit the like button thank you enjoyed some bf sniping tonight and some crashing of course that was good fun jack and doc collab yeah i'd love it have i met stone mountain in real life yeah i have he's great dave is really really nice i think we shared a meal together a couple times you know if you capture events you know a couple bars together what's up boston all 11 codes have gone now okay see you later bio chris thank you for playing hope you enjoyed it [Music] i'm defending again i'd like to attack on this i think it'll be fun maybe the armor plate guy you get armor plates with him anyway don't you sir kind of a waste no b said i was getting a dxgi error two different ones i got first one i got which was uh i think it was like on the portal map it said that i'd remove my graphics card and then the second one was like uh the xgi or something over there and then the for the third crash literally just crashed the desktop and didn't give me an error message okay so who knows at this point what's my favorite map so far in this game um taken breakaway cheers buddy it's 2014 one better on windows 10. i don't think there's much of a difference between windows 10 and 11 for this game um i mean i'm on windows 11 now but that's because i've got the 12 900k so you know just runs better i've been told that there's not really any point getting a 12 series processor unless you go windows 11 so that's just what i did you know i even got a kill yet i've got one kill use this i'm defending again i'm just gonna end with quitting one [Music] fine this is where they launched the james webb telescope from yeah apparently it is right it's the same place in french guiana that building there right outside it over there i've seen like pictures of this as well in real life and it does look quite similar i think dice have done a good job with uh how it looks maybe i should leave so that time coming for me want the best spot here is it that guy wasn't shot in the back where are the enemies guys where are they come on have you ever played with spartacus you mean the facebook stream yeah i did i played with him once play some warzone with him seems like a nice guy it was him stone queen eliminator and me he played some warzone you wouldn't think there's 128 players on this server would you where are they all yeah you're okay with no voice chat for now let's get the party started huh i mean voice chat i think is necessary really for this kind of game i know some people just won't use it but like playing on your own especially you know for console players too who don't necessarily have easy access to stuff like discord and teamspeak i think they can use party chat but like a lot of it needs to be in game doesn't it in your squad it's a squad game team play is supposed to be a big part of it but it's just not breakaway okay let's go jack frags and tim the tatman collab i do actually watched him i don't think that he'd ever do a collab with me though as much as i'd love to just play some war zone with him or something that'd be hilarious he's very entertaining okay am i attacking russian's attack will defend on breakaway i think the russians defend is ed sheeran coming to bf6 yeah they confirmed it elias he is going to be what he's going to be the first specialist and he's literally called ed sheeran and it's like a version of what he would look like in the year 2042 so he's a bit older his abilities are pop song where you use that ability that's his ultimate and it just generates a number one hit just straight away very good and his passive ability is called shape of you and that means that every time you shoot him his body warps so there's a chance that the bullet doesn't hit him yeah he's going to be a really popular specialist i think because ed was in game of thrones now this is a squad i'm happy to be part of and he was in red notice as well so you know he's like the cameo guy now but he wanted more of a leading role so they you know his his team and dice got together and they started working talking figuring out the numbers and how it'd all work they did a 3d scan of him so yeah he's the first specialist really looking forward to playing zed you know got a guitar gun as well it's like fully automatic sniper rifle one hit kill so i think he's gonna clearly be like the best specialist in the game for a while not enough space to deploy it's literally the flag dice what do you want from me hey josh eddie's opie i'm an early access tester yeah jonathan would know jonathan would know about that i'm just gonna just bail from the helicopter study where's the spot where do i have to go that's a tank [Music] take it take it take it thank you thank you thank you thank you don't be sad a mid-air wingsuit kill hit her twice like this every time ed is near you as well you can just hear it it just starts playing shape of you reloading you know because like because he's so op they needed some way to balance him so you know he's obvious when he's around duh any more codes evan i think we just gave away the last one buddy end room now if you look too please please think about the children get wrecked you plebs this guy just farms infantry in the little bird doesn't he i think that's what he does i think that's what he does can i not shoot through that glass enjoy maps with zero cover soft lamp time it could be i mean if someone get i tell you what someone get a soft lamp if you're on the server get yourself lambs out or kill them don't beep your [ __ ] and then just drive away from me dude how i got a rude way to run [Applause] that was a headshot dice you stole it from me come on is there a guy on there [Music] i don't know which mill that that's supposed to be i want to get that guy that's all i'll be a fun kill a tank right next to me don't care kill myself then i'm sure i threw that grenade far away oh the little bird was taken i didn't know about that thing holding number three thank you for the tip kinky cobra you can just hold three and just apply a armor crate on the plate i thought you had to like drop it like that and get it uh bellio yeah you can only do that if it's been soft lumber if the ground vehicle's been soft am i running into pain here i feel like i am me dice please hi martin i'm good thanks how are you yeah that's a good tip isn't it cobra and they're all dead how does a dumb rocket become a lock-on just part of the game design that's all just a team player mechanic isn't it bit high ready fletcher still does this thing occasionally where it like aims in and out for me it's not my mouse either it was a bug on warzone as well but they fixed it a rocket launcher from there player good shot i'm still playing portal not at the moment andres we played a lot paul tonight so i'll finish up with some all-out warfare i think heyman [Music] is anyone up here that i can snipe it's a bit crazy isn't it i think 64 players is just better you can just focus a bit more get more fps that was laggy oh [Applause] bandana ah good shot welcome back gabby thank you for coming back did you play 2042 team deathmatch yet it's good no i haven't actually damon maybe i should give that a go how many tickets have we got oh there's a lot of tickets i don't know if i can stomach that many tickets defending the answer is i can't isn't mike is a bit prison mike alagash yeah you're right should we try portal team deathmatch that's wrong sorry portal tdm so because this is a featured mode i think you get max xp hey andrew yeah i'm good thank you isn't mike american office is so good i mean the uk office is also excellent oh so it's 2042 weapons okay i'm gonna give this a go because someone said it was decent let's try it out yeah the american office is like a completely different vibe you seem right that you can have a barista and tdm so is this a two shot kill the mk2 i presume it is like two shots to the body i'm gonna take you out right i've got any unlocks for it hold up a weird cobra site ammo types vehicles accuracy while moving try that give this a go then what's up ashley thank you oh damn i did that wrong oh one hit kill headshot remember i might as well get my med pack back right oh could you go that i was wrong two shot body shot one hit kill head shot how'd you get up there is that mckay there sure this is a very good td i'm not to be honest i'll try i know there was a guy in there but i wanted to kill that guy instead you know rate of fire on it as well interesting would it be any good in all that warfare though i don't know that's one plus side of it was this the gun stop did a video on i think angel don't be sad sometimes we just disco dance he only knows one move is there any decent meat grinder maps in this game no not really not yet i think they're gonna fall send on the inventory maps though dlc if you stay already oldest trick in the book that is i thought i disabled the depth of field effect in my config there's my config reset even with armor it's a two-hit kill okay okay i'm feeling it chat game's over you've been struck by you've been hit by a smooth angel dunk merry christmas to you jdp [Music] because he was an angel don't and then run into the bathroom was struck down with an armor plate boom [Music] you should post a bf1 no hood gameplay it looks amazing yeah it does so fun [Music] omega you got code did you good there's a penguin with a gun now what's up oh i've got the wrong gun but in single fire mode you'll get a number plate you get a number plate everyone gets an armor plate with angel angel does it again don't be sad sometimes it works out this way i can't click it as fast as study [Applause] 128 player bf1 oh that'd be a bit spicy wouldn't it he's dead ice i don't understand there's like no bullet drop is that how this gun why do i have a soft flam what use is that [Applause] there's no bullet drop on it i keep wanting to throw down a med kit but i've got a bloody soft one i think they actually cleared that now okay there was a guy here though on the mini map somewhere was it you it was you p57 come on bro are you getting steady fps yeah i'm a new pc me let's see i got terrible fps on my own pc my old pc angel is not convincing enough that's why he does not get revived an emp grenade as well what what year is it what's going on focus i do not like this map at all maria you better return the favor where is she maria god damn it murray you can hold the shotgun reload by holding the trigger so you just why would you want to do that though there's a guy in here how to get down hold on reloading don't approach me we're doing okay here trying to get used to this gun it's a funny one i think i see the appeal of it though like you can delete people like that that quickly you get the two shot you don't even need to move your crosshair if you can hit them that's important you get an armor plate you get an armored plate i will revive you if you hold it let's get you moving pay it back maria [Music] reloading my aim isn't quite dialed in for that zoom is it i do over and undershoot quite a lot sometimes at that level [Applause] at that range it doesn't have drop which is interesting it does seem like it has a bit of spread though which is weird you just want some of this this is what you want okay that's a terrible tdm map i think like maybe a higher power scope on it would work better i don't know just like red dot or 6x maybe [Music] hey rocket queen i hope you had a merry and most of all a rock-tastic christmas i did indeed rock it queen thank you for coming along hey gabby [Music] what's up thank you for giving me company while i just taught her no problem gabby i hope you hope you're well it's not a shotgun po it's more like um it's like a lever action rifle i think that's what you call it i don't know why they would have those in the year 2020 2042 but they do apparently so yeah brandon the epic game streams are always three hours 45 minutes did i um i don't know if i unlocked the best scope for it i'll try a red dot this round over maybe 1.25 now the dot's better isn't it the gun with a 6x is mental yeah maybe not in tdm though damon i think that guy could see me well that didn't work out as i had fun you're dead oh rain then where they'll go not seen any targets it's a 2x isn't it loading ammunition i'm not sure why i have this skin for it either it's like some kind of mastery skin but i barely play with it aiming too high there don't need to aim above their head sir [Music] see six times here would be great wouldn't it i just chilling on the top there let me get a bit closer i unlocked a different site there didn't i was that someone here myself right that was i played hey son all the nostalgia is strong yeah on this map yeah definitely that's a tray a shotgun with a scope is basically a maze like i've got a 6x for it no the biggest i've got is two hmm we'll keep going see if we can make it work it's interesting you know it's forcing me to play a different style that i usually don't play so makes it a bit of a challenge for me which is good i could just run around with the pkp and beam everyone but more interesting this way isn't it do not approach me it's not hitting those shots though that i need to hit we'll get there that's a fish burn handshakes from the champions club thank you man charged with a knife see you later rambi what's my favorite gun definitely the pkp yeah pkp is really good i'm fine i'm gonna switch them fire i'm not feeling this gun on this map it's not really working out great for me so i'm gonna switch it up none of those suppressors work either so muscle break is that what i was using i think that's what i was using we're losing as well so we can pull some points back here how do you play tdm johnny it's in the portal menu if you click on portal from the main menu it's the featured experience at the moment in the bottom left [ __ ] watching some of my videos on stream yeah i've seen that i know you watched a lot of my 2042 preview videos you know whenever there was a new trailer or some new information i would cover the news i know he watched a few of those but i don't know if he watches anymore we'll see there was um you know before the game released there was a fair few news videos that i made with just information in odell thanks for the five yeah i need to try world war three [Music] easy do one more round of cdm and then i gotta go tdm is not permanent dudely no not as far as i know but they should be a permanent ddm mode [Music] l alamain okay is this in the barracks area okay um yeah i got this set up wrong i think that's right right let's just buzz some people man last round of the day let's see how many kills we can get oh i died very quickly then if you like rea you should try re2 remake they're short games um yeah i mean i never played resident evil 2 all the way through it'd be a good idea the remake is supposed to be great as well isn't it got this is a terrible map for tdm as well look at this it's just a big open area in the middle what though let's have it really locking onto me from there okay across the map people have just put up boris turrets as well i'm gonna stay here then oh good shot hey james i'm good thank you jack why don't you play hardline oh man i mean i did i did do a back-to-hard line video a couple months back it did really well i think it's got like 800 000 views or something um there's not many people playing the game so it's difficult to find a decent match being honest with you if there was more people playing it then you know maybe i'd be more inclined to make regular content on it but it's just you know difficult so i don't think it really makes sense for me to do it my cousin vinnie thank you for the five that's very kindly there's guy out there just camping hard with that mp9 right there i think unless he's dead grenade get this i got him in the name a new record i don't think so thank you cousin it's very kindly what's up richard weaver thank you for coming you can get the community to fill a server um yeah i probably could but i mean the thing is you need 64 people right and if i just started a random stream of hardline people are gonna have to have downloaded the game you don't have it ready on their systems well the chances of that i think the way that i'd have to do it if i was serious about it was um [Applause] like make a video where i'm like okay so on this day at this time we're gonna be playing hardline like i think that's the only way that i could make it work really there's a guy there oh [Applause] [Applause] i think there's another one in here ah good kill you play hardline weekly do you play on console brandon or pc i don't know if it has an active player base anywhere thank you [Applause] reloading take this we get across there without being sniped this is such a bad tdm map it's so bad because hey i've done that for the assault rifles i've not done it for all the guns though i've only done it for the assault rifle pass closed captioning not available knew he was there somewhere i just didn't check in between the crates he won hey there you go not ending on a loss chris how about that bit of 1942
