take t-rex if i had a rocket launcher yeah like with a machine gun now i don't know oh you think if you had a rocket launcher you could easily take a t-rex and that's that yeah you're trained how to use a rocket launcher yeah definitely killing yourself have you ever found a rocket launcher in your life before no okay so well here's what's going to happen you wake up there's a rocket launcher in a box a crate in front of you there's a t-rex goes you know i can't do the wrong that's a bit too high pitched but uh there's t-rex hurtling towards you down like um a dark road give it a go a road why would the t-rex be on road because that's the only time i've ever seen a t-rex running is along the road after a trusted party would you do you think you'd be able to kill it i think i could pick up that rocket launcher load it fire it before the t-rex kills me but you understand we've never used one before i played video games all right i think i think might just he taught me how to use a rocket launcher what would happen is you probably just detonate yourself oh do you know any t-rex yeah i know loads right are they can you hire them or yeah where'd you get them from there's a lot of dinosaurs here jack nobody knows i was trying to kill them and talk at the same time it's quite difficult all right here we go um there's raptors with drills for hands weak points on the belly oh it's
