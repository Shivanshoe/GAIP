listen where are we spawning well i've literally spawned five top four times and i've died four times so that's good uh i'll spawn on uh i'll spawn on wherever you spawn i'm responding where you spawn e1 good work they're seeing losses keep it up i've never played this map originally did you back in the day yeah of course yeah i never i never played 1942 my first battlefield was battlefield 2 i mean bf2 is a good one though like it made a lot of improvements on this it is a good one yeah my favorite map was strike it car can with the millions of grenades spam oh yeah and dolphin diving as well don't forget and dolphin diving yes you know the only annoying thing about this the classic mode at least i know you could tweak this import but you can't revive oh yeah you can i was wondering why i just instantly went back to the spawn menu yeah you can drop health but there's no revive so but there's no revive huh was there no reviving back in the day no no you couldn't revive him really i'm driving it slowly forward i'm gonna get a snipe guys on the right guys on the right guy in front there it is i'm dead nope you're fine you're fine i'm definitely dead it's called the afterlife he's one he's one he's one he's one he's cracked we are hitting an objective jumping out dog sector's mine he's one he's one [Music] yeah i'm back in holy cow the recoilness i gotta get i gotta i've never done this before you just got a hedgehog it's hard not simple oh we got a wrasser over here oh look at this this judge recognize this i'm scared hold me hold me close oh me close and dino dancer jackie jack you have the golden pipes please don't get me dmc8 can you imagine it's so cool it's so close to the original eyes are in control of most sectors keep doing it not well then it dmca this friend that dmca is yeah yeah yeah wow i don't think there's is there no health regen if you're just a normal assault player um i don't think so you need to get the health kits off a medic teamwork and battlefield excuse me i mean i could play as a medic and just keep us topped up instead or i could just switch to a medic i'll switch to a medic what does assault even bring to the table yeah that's it just gun just guns i'm a gun lots of guns uh we have a tank rolling in on to b-o-d over i snapped the gunner he's dead they're getting lucky and hitting us where it hurts i don't know how he saw me it's not like i was running out on the oh i was running down the open all right let me switch to medic and i can top us off does there is only oh there's two guns i'll use the thomas give me some goddamn heels my tamio wait jack yeah where's my where's my optics in underbarrel where's my different ammo types you need to play called vanguard for that man i'm sorry not that type of game for the true authentic world war experience you want the world wars to experience van gaal yeah i got one i got one top shelf oh man you're good you're good you just dropped me down the floor yeah i don't know how you didn't die i'm back uh do you need hp yes please okay where you are i'm here okay look at that frostbite boom didn't have that in 1942 did not so is it just heal you if you stand next to it yeah you just have to stand in the vicinity of it okay okay i wasn't cause it's a small little bag so i thought it was kind of like a battlefield three bag instead of a pouch enemy infantry logistic ribbon this is the true world war ii battlefield now imagine if bf5 was like this instead uh yeah maybe pretty cool they're over this little edge okay i'm gonna switch to assault are you dead i just i'm struggling jack i can't get my aim on this uh this old classic recoil you can do it these old guns you can do it matt there's a lot of spread on the guns i'm just kind of fire a couple shots and see what happens with it well a bullet comes out the end flies through the air here's the target thank you jack oh there's no there's a lot of recoil okay i need to give this guy some health he doesn't seem to care i love the models they're great man yeah yeah yeah world war ii style i wonder where they got the models did they make them exclusively for this or they bring it from another mode i think the i think the bodies uh exclusive the heads are all from previous games oh okay okay one of the heads is from battlefront battlefront and then you've got some yeah you've got some from bf1 someone from bfi so i think they reused some of the assets for the heads i mean why not you know they're just just random assets you know that's cool kunta is still here though from the germans oh always have to have him he's the one that everyone cares about all right we should probably go after an objective i feel like oh charlie top fire is already good on these guns yeah i think i need to start tap firing and stop uh full auto enemies are in control of most sectors both sectors enemies in control that's a big tank i'm just gonna okay so i'm gonna do the tactical move called tactical cowardice okay i'm gonna probably die now i think so the play is to hide it's going to roll right past me you actually no you just prone there how i don't understand these guns at all dude just don't don't think about it too much okay i'm thinking about it no just don't think about it i'm so nervous now my chat shaving me my chat they can't see the scoreboard anyway hey gotti got you let me try this gun listen you leave that alone chat he's a good lad thanks check you like the big brother who rolls up on the bully like what up well i never what up kiddos you know you gotta watch out for your little your little brother right leave matimo alone we can cut this point here yeah we can we're because yep we got it it's because we dealt with all those infantry right yeah [Music] next to the giant ammo container oh i killed him did it i did it spawning on you when i can oh so you just have to tap fire okay yeah it's not simple we killed about that we control baker sector yeah i was going full auto and like the recoil was just nuts tanks we need some anti-tank up in here we could just run away and avoid it go back to d could just run away uh the vive i'm thinking is just good back to d yeah it's gonna oh someone's trying to snipe us i'm gonna do like i do with all my problems ignore them and let them fester until it becomes such an issue i i can't think of anything else i think that's how most of us nerds live our lives yeah yeah yeah it's called procrastination i can hear clogs yep yep they're close hard right we've seized charlie oh they're clogging damn get him up get him inside or on the outside oh outside as well i was just ruined yeah we got a couple though listen we're holding the germans back here that's the most important thing that is the most important they're capturing either should we take a because you know what the uh the end result if we don't right we're all speaking german we don't want that well well you might not even be born if we it's true the allies are less thrilled yeah i knew he said we i was i didn't have anything to do with i mean you were there right you're time traveling i was just a twinkle in my father's eyes you were you weren't even a twinkle bro i don't think my dad was eating you weren't even a twinkle i was twinkling my grandfather's eye there you go that works oh god that tank is going to kill us no one's surprised there are now two tanks enemy tanks we got enemy one of our forces i really like this man it's cool it is cool i think i just killed a guy but he's now like floating my hair empty i'm gonna try and steal it yeah that was the dude i just killed oh my god the eyes roll back on the models when they're dead it's horrible oh i didn't know that yeah it's gross by the way if uh if you ever want to be a voice actor i think you got the chops for it man no you know like i mean you're already great at the death noises you know i'll be a death actor so what is your specialty um i'm a voice actor oh okay what roles have you been uh you know everyone who dies yeah that's me there you go number one dead guy number two that guy's 69 nice cover me reloading we got enemy forces attacking one of our objectives you'll be the sean bean but of uh voice acting you still like oh no oh my mate johnny's joined us what's he doing johnny johnny what are you doing is it i bet he's watching the stream oh oh i'm scared johnny's a good medic probably better medic than i am i think the only place medic if you spawn on me damn we've already lost half our resources so they are all over there did you do the directx 12 thing by the way the directx 12 what do you mean yeah yeah it's been doing the rounds on the internets today basically you go into your documents change the prof save profile and turn directx 12 on and it gives you a little fps boost oh no i've not tried that how much of an experience we talked about i got about like 10 15 more fps i mean it's still like on this map it's great like on the um all that warfare maps it's still pretty bad yeah yeah give me a little boost and also you can turn depth of field off on the guns oh okay i might have to give that a try yeah i mean so how many how many frames are you getting right now hold on i just i got one allies are assaulting an objective enable oh i spawned on you and then a panzer showed up sorry i'm in the menu no i'm blaming you for that uh where should we spawn johnny's alive now johnny yeah that's one on johnny he's in combat sector he's probably holding down the fort we now hold the majority of the sectors okay i'm gonna go rent i'm gonna go wrench wine sweeper wrench guy what is no i want to go classic soldier engineer's a pretty decent class so i just born here at sea i have 120 fps right now nice let me spawn on you i'm wait no i can't you're dead i'll spawn on d1 so wait a second the engine the anti-tank class only has a bazooka and a pistol yeah so you get you can pick up a weapon though if you find one i'll run it with you dude we'll go we'll be anti-tank bros come on let's yeah let's go mess up some teams let's get this tank here look at that boom shot in the book no biggie dead instantly there's three tanks rolling up you spawn on me yeah get ready for some spices a little bit of sugar all things nice but some extra spice holy enemy team dude respawn timer active okay okay okay okay i'm in okay they might round the corner just a heads up um you'll see pistols are quite good though in this i mean that's great but there's like 50 of them but we need to find tanks oh matt the tanks man the tanks i know the tanks but there's infantry matt the tanks there's a sniper on the bridge but there's all right where should we spawn we need tanks matt tanks i know i don't have the tanks spawn at e1 no actually oh yeah that's why you want to take this tank tank thanks we're getting this tank to get behind it give it the beans oh just wreck that guy okay you got him good good good good i put a couple balls into him but i died now there is tank so is tanky okay i've hit him once matt i've got two rockets left i'm going to need your help here i think enemy tank got it okay i'm trying to deploy someone else helped somebody he's gone is he dead he's dead i hear him though that's not real what is real this is a dream is this is this inception jack are you a figment of my imagination jack are you a figure in my imagination check check check i'm scared what is the matrix what is the matrix have you ever had a dream so real that it felt like something something something i am so bad at movie quotes i am terrible i can't i'm really bad with just anything that requires memorization lyrics movie quotes names i bet you know the entire lyrics of forgot about dream by eminem and dr dre oh 100 yeah 100 100 percent rpg this guy nope nope come on then wait you see him there's a man there harry is down harry down harry boa i mean i'm i mean the one song i do know is eminem eight mile ways to go now you're cooking with gas knees weak arms heavy vomit on his spaghetti already [Laughter] does that take oh god that's not the whole lyrics though man is it let's be honest i mean you could call me out on that right now oh slap slap i'm get okay i'm getting the hang of this now oh wait jack i even got the lyrics wrong i said yeah i know you did okay i just wanted to make sure i just wanted to make sure you you caught that let's go way over there yeah if you pick up a gun by the way it replaces the bazooka so you can't cheese it that's not good you can't chase it i'm sorry yeah you can't do that oh we got infantry coming in from uh uh we got 480 m uh east let's go oh oh i think we just both died at the same time our soul descends to the skies the heavens above together quite an even game really it is quite even you ever see that uh you ever see god what was that movie i didn't remember what's called i think was like a no you never mind it doesn't matter it doesn't matter i mean you can't just say that and then nothing it was a bad movie though starring uh tom cruise his like he gets hit in the head there's a lot of enemies coming to this point tom cruise gets hit in the head yeah and then like his soul like the it implies that his soul is leaving his body and rising up and then uh he it flies back into his body no vanilla sky was it vanilla sky i don't remember what it was yeah vanilla i've seen that long time ago what about it he uh yeah just no never mind it was that's that's a it's movie it's a movie that's a movie that's real it was edgy tomorrow secured my allies it's not edgy tomorrow it's not edgy tomorrow no for some reason it's vanilla sky my brain went to we have most of the sectors so you know when you die in this game and your camera goes flies up into the sky yeah it did like it did that in the movie but it was like acting as his soul and that's for some reason my brain just went there so you're saying you are tom cruise i am i am definitely not tom cruise show me the money oh jack the one two combo i will remember you your memory will live on did you blow the sun cup i definitely blew the tank there's another one another one it's pouring on you spun you you're in combat i hit it i hit it well i just shot it so pain pain where is it uh it's somewhere in the smoke i think it died good yeah i think it's dead good good do it do it oh they're spawning [Applause] we got their number today [Music] not great having a bazooka is it no i think it's i think it's fantastic i've actually done better with the bazooka and pistol than i have with any other gun somehow i don't understand it's fine uh i'm also done pretty well on this little stationary turret so i think i'm gonna stay here for the rest of time this is my this is
