a couple days ago ea and xbox announced that they're adding fps boost to a load of their game titles and the ones that interested me the most were bf1 bf4 and bf5 so i thought that we would jump on today and play some so we've got there's a guy right here isn't it all right and just to prove look at this so i'm on the xbox series x here if i go to my settings tv we're 1440p 120 hertz i'm playing this on an hp omen x27 monitor and it will do 1440p at 120 or 1080p at 120 over hdmi if you use displayport you'll get 240 hertz but obviously xbox doesn't use that that's just a pc thing and i also tried bf4 a bit earlier and that is really smooth that's like a true 120 fps feels good unfortunately they didn't increase the resolution though so it still looks like an actual potato but bf4 was a classic and i mean there were a lot of people playing it on xbox 2 in europe at least i found a load of servers that were running that were populated and there were some other games on there as well that you might be interested in like star wars battlefront one and two that could be quite nice titanfall one and two fans versus zombies a few different options there i can tell straight away that this is definitely running higher than the usual 60 that it runs at and you guys can all enjoy my potato game 10 out of 10. ign came over last week and they reviewed me playing console games with a controller and they said you know what jack it's 10 out of 10 right there that's a lie no that happened why would they why would they even do that anyway i don't know but you guys should check though because i know a lot of console gamers actually play their games on pc monitors so you might already have a tv or a monitor that's capable of doing this but you'll have to check i think it's hdmi 2.0 that you need as a minimum and i believe that most hdmi 2.0 displays will do at least 1440p and 1080p at 120 hertz so you could experience this for yourself but it really is night and day like 60 to 120 is huge i remember years ago when it first came out on pc and it was a really big deal because i'm gonna i'm gonna bring bring some old references out here all right back in the day i'm i'm 34 years old right so i've had uh pcs for a very long time i'm being chased aren't i since i was a very young kid i've always had a pc very lucky in that respect and the monitors that we used to use were called crts and a huge like honking great chunks of plastic and metal but those things could do insane frequencies not really high resolutions though i think the highest resolution crt i ever had was like 1680 by 1050 or something like that but i've been all over the floor it's just not is that yeah that's the guy that i just killed and they were massive right so pc gamers if you're a bit older like i am we've always had high frequency stuff you could afford it and then it kind of shifted to lcd technology and those things were only ever like 60 hertz back in the day not great but now of course you can get some insane flat screens with crazy refresh rates and resolutions oh my god yeah they're all bad yeah check it out if you've not seen 120 hertz before i think you'll be impressed i don't mind 60 on console i can do it but it just takes me a little while to get used to but generally speaking you'll have a smoother gameplay experience it'll look smoother add less input lag and the game just feels a lot better you know everything's a bit smoother feels a bit more snappy and responsive it's a good way of putting it yeah and if you do try it out let me know what you think down in the comments below and maybe you've already got a 120 hertz screen that you can use there's me proving that i'm playing on controller i don't know why ign gave me a 10 out of 10 to be honest because i can't aim for toffee try my best i can hear an enemy over here i think right here somewhere oh they've gone inside where's the rose skin where's the rose skin i like this map though aras when bf5 came out this is my favorite map in the game next to twisted steel i think twisted steel is brilliant i don't know how many people have actually managed to buy an xbox series x or esther like can you still not buy them or they got stuck with them now i don't know ah dude flank me out of nowhere oh he's got a gold stone go there pro player right there people were begging to get these consoles christmas last year are you not dead he's right there look oh no please don't i can't believe i'm not dead what even just happened then how do i not get killed i was very lucky and i was sent one by xbox whoa oh no oh no but can you just walk into a game stop now and get one what's the stock like i know that gpu stock's really bad you can't get 30 80s or 30 70s 30 60s it's been like that for ages but in terms of console i don't know it makes me wonder about the new battlefield game as well that's coming out later this year what if the new game has got cross play on it right god put that grenade down yeah so sorry i was just saying what if the new games got cosplay on it i think it's highly likely considering how the game industry is nowadays and what if you can do console and pc together but the console players can now play at 120 fps and 120 hertz so you know they don't have that disadvantage anymore they can play with the big field of view that kind of thing i think that's kind of cool for the console players anyway zoom plane's flying around everywhere she'll go d there's gonna be a lot of people at d in there uh hello oh oh i nearly died then didn't i oh watch out watch out watch out oh v1 is paving the way for my squad here so yeah i thought i'd let you guys know about that i think it's a pretty cool update vehicle isn't it try it out if you haven't already get the kill then you're kidding i'm getting shot in the back oh god there's more here isn't there climb up oh no we didn't make it in yeah i thought it's pretty neat the fact that they've just enabled that you don't have to pay or anything it's all free maybe you can get that 120 hertz goodness in your life you know maybe that's what you've been missing this whole time oh my squad what are we doing here lads are they looking for the gnome house no houses around here isn't it it's over here somewhere no no that we're going to get b and take nothing out disabled nice we get it nope run out of rockets now as well i think they're being repaired too aren't they yeah so there it is guys rounds about to end if you enjoyed the video leave a like thank you let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you didn't like it a dislike hopefully they do this stuff for playstation 5 because that's you know easily good enough i think to run it but apparently it's got some issues with backwards compatibility in all the games or something the fingers crossed they can sort that out and get it enabled for the playstation guys down the line whoa look at that truck crazy yeah awesome thanks for watching guys subscribe for more i'll see in the next one bye [Music]
