just got our first look at call of duty modern warfare 2 gameplay footage and this is actually uploaded on the official call of duty channel in 4k so it's nice and high quality resolution it looks great and they debuted this at the summer games fest just finished which was actually a pretty decent show i wasn't expecting much but it was decent anyway today we're going to be focusing on the gameplay i thought that we'd watch along with this and give some first impressions this is one of the missions from the single player called dark water and the team are tasked with attempting to board an oil rig to disarm a couple of missiles i think that's what the synopsis of it was and it kind of reminded me of a mission from modern warfare 2 called the only easy day was yesterday where you go into an oil rig and you have to go rescue hostages it's got a similar vibe to it at times but also it's similar to the prologue in the first modern warfare game and you'll see why i say that in just a little bit so we're up on the deck of the rig here looks like the operator is carrying a vector and just do a slow open of the door there see the rest of the team moving on through so it looks like doors will be a feature in this game i don't know if they're in the multiplayer that thing is brutal the time to kill on that super quick but it appears that the door behavior in the campaign at least is the same as the behavior in modern warfare [Music] real nice weather effects going on here is a bit of a storm brewing some lightning in the air cheeky reload stacking up on the stairs like the townhouse mission from mw the bodies are dropping down from the sky here let's move on up so that guy's got an mp5 i think got a p90 there as well two p90s with suppressors on very nice not much of a heads up display here either big fan of that makes it more immersive look at how the sleeves are blowing in the window on these character models what's your status with shadow three now roger [Applause] there we go beautiful audio as well a bit later on you'll hear some of the shotguns and they sound incredible and it's a super cool little scenario where they're on the container ship and the cargo crates are shifting left and right and we'll explain a bit more about that when it comes up and get that molotov there we go look at that flare's gone up in the air looks like a skull or an acr maybe the okay scope that scope is in mw-19 so they say that all of the attachments in this game are based off real military tech they're not going to go crazy sci-fi with it or anything so we can mount again i wasn't expecting that you couldn't but it didn't look like you could move left and right there like you kind of vanguard and warzone now but they announced by the way i didn't get this from my video yesterday because they didn't tell us this warzone as it is at the moment will continue when war zone 2 releases but it'll just be live i don't know if they're going to do any updates to it or anything i'm assuming not and of course warzone 2 will be its own thing where they start from scratch so all the progress all the weapons everything will be all brand new and you'll start with zero progression zero stats on war zone two of course you can still keep playing warzone one if you want to they said warzone 2 is releasing this year as well i didn't expect that i thought it would be march next year make fun of these rain effects here i'd expect the war zone 2 will release in december then because i don't think they would want to cannibalize their own game if they release warzone 2 at the same time as mw2 i feel like it would take a lot of the attention away so maybe warzone 2 i december that makes the most sense we're going to rappel down here and you can see the waves so as i mentioned in the video yesterday the waves in the multiplayer are actually server-side there's a couple other games that have done that in the past but it's cool that call of duty are adopting that for mw2 with all the swimming game playing those new mechanics they've got there you can use these type of boats in multiplayer too this guy is stacked with shotgun ammo on his chest look at that he's got like 15 shots there so now we've just taken the rib boat boarded the cargo ship let's have ourselves a gunfight and here's what i was talking about so they explained at the summer games fest that the movement of the ship is actually being controlled by the body of water around it so it's all physics based it's moving the cover left and right as you can see and you could actually get crushed by one of these things if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time but it leads to some interesting emergent narrative in the gameplay here you might have cover for one second and then the ship moves over to the other side and the covers disappeared how good does that shotgun sound though [Music] check out the water on the surface of the boat there that foam simulation they talked about and on the sides there the water gushing over the top and dripping down watch out for those grenades it starts to get a bit chaotic now doesn't it vector's such a cool looking gun though those guys just slide into frame there oh watch out you just got rushed it makes me wonder are they gonna have these kind of mechanics in multiplayer that guy just got absolutely ruined there you i was hoping that they were gonna stay here i like to keep this for closer cows might have been a bit too cheesy there's ghosts over there go for the breach all right cuts and that's the end and then i think these are just snippets from the trailer that they released yesterday maybe a bit more bombastic than the mw19 single player which was really grounded i feel like mw2 originally was kind of like that in the second campaign a bit more over the top action so maybe that's the precedent that they're saying here i did see two other single-player levels in the behind-the-scenes presentations but there's no footage of those released yet and i don't want to really talk about them until they're out there so we'll leave it at that for now let me know what you think i hope you like this video format just kind of react into the new gameplay stuff let me know if you want to see more like this down in the comments below and also let me know your thoughts on this campaign mission and modern warfare 2 in general guys thanks for watching so much cheers for all your support if you enjoyed the vid leave a like subscribe for more i'll see you next time
