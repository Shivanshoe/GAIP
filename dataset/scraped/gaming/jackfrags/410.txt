okay so today i thought that i'd queue up for solo versus trios it's a streamer that i watch called iceman isaac and he does this all the time practice trying to get better fighting multiple people on your own and it looks like ferns will start giving a shot and usually he starts by getting a helicopter so i'm just gonna do that and see what happens there's a dude here i'm gonna try and chop him out the sky excuse me dice exit stop sorry did anyone see what i just saw i've got two more targets here oh come on what's going on [Applause] can you get off me get off me i hate you [Applause] i think they're still alive splat that's much better use the blades use the blade yes i'm sure there was something over here wasn't that i don't know if they're fighting in here [Applause] [Music] oh such can you land this on the on the train oh sick [Applause] you can i'd like to see the bit baby why can i not like this is so annoying the fact that i can't jump up that please dice just think about think about this nice anyone explain what happened then anyone explain that i've never seen anything like that before i didn't even know that was possible so the most obvious logical conclusion i'm seeing in the chat which doesn't make sense but it does in terms of game logic is that because the helicopter was still on the train its rotors were still moving and it counted as a moving vehicle oh that makes sense today who is this loaded what's going on here now there is another loadout here so there's probably someone running over to me now and i'm ruined is there for far better the mp5 i think it's got a quicker time to kill yeah it's like the best gun in the game right now easily the bloody hell was that why was that explo i mean i'm probably going to die here but okay i just want to know why there was an [Applause] explosion someone else [Applause] why don't you have assault rifle ammo dude what the hell yeah this is just stupid man so it's like silly it's really silly it's all reactive as well i've got cool skinness why we've got four spectators so i don't mind you guys watching but you know when it's in the game in the game in the game don't like it oh hello oh no no no look at that ammo love you thank you this guy here [Applause] that was exactly where i am as well get me on the roof please dice just in that building oh there's two now [Applause] same guy don't really want to take that fight because that seemed like he was a good shot just waiting for them to make a mistake but i don't think they're going to even leave that building so i'm just going to go you're hopeful that bf6 will have some really excellent rockets me too johnny salami me too rockets are fun rocket go boom double threat is it the guy in train station i think that was uh ghosted well i think i dodged a bullet there to be honest because i was quite eager to get the finish but the guy who was on top who i knew was there from the uav nearly killed me [Applause] i hope that he hasn't got dead silence it just rushes me [Applause] you got place still double threat he just pushed on his own i don't know why could've waited for his teammate unless his teammate is floating in the sky that wasn't that guy different guy it might be a different squad actually that now i'm kind of screwed [Applause] [Music] he's right above me i'm a gas mask here i really have a play here do i train station i guess [Applause] this will be in here just there's less than 10 to go you can win this oh i kind of want to get that truck over there very good come to me zone come to me come to me [Applause] made a enemy of noise then didn't i thought could be the stand it play this is tracker three one good copy let's try get back [Applause] over here this guy right there just jumped over 3v1 isn't it [Applause] i reckon the truck would have been a better player baby i'll tell you what though solos versus trios it's really fun that's really fun there it is there's the far belt if you want to copy it that's it man he's uh very strong you know what to do if you buy anything call of duty's in the call of duty this is your call of duty right here this i'm pointing i'm pointing to it you put that code in hashtag ad add support yo i want to afford that that golden yacht eventually and sail the seven seas and become the pirate that i was always meant to be i'm just kidding anyway guys thank you for watching hope you enjoyed this if you did leave a like and subscribe for more i'll see you next time you
