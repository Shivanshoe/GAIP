battlefield and electronic arts just dropped a huge bombshell and this is a major shake-up of what the franchise is who's working on it and certain people leaving the company and changing positions so let's take a look this is from an article that was just posted by gamespot ea is making major changes to its development structure as it focuses on growing and expanding the battlefield series following what's been a challenging launch for battlefield 2042 the future set military shoots are launched in november and were swiftly criticized for a lack of features found in previous games and for its many bugs but perhaps the biggest change being announced today is that ea is formally announcing the creation of a battlefield universe that will seemingly span multiple games and offerings which will be developed by different studios across north america and europe additionally dice general manager oscar gabrielson is leaving the company to pursue a new endeavor outside of ea the shake-up also includes respawns vince sampela taking on a bigger role as the new overall boss of the battlefield franchise with halo designer marcus leto building a new development team in seattle focused on injecting more storytelling into the battlefield universe ripple effect formerly dice la they're the developers of battlefield 2042's portal mode they're developing a new battlefield experience in the 2042 universe no further information on what that is in the immediate future ea told games but the dice ripple effect and lethal's new seattle studio will work together to expand upon and improve bf2042 the other battlefield games and experiences in the work are meant to serve as extensions to a degree of the new universe that ea is trying to create there are no specifics available yet about the new games and experiences that ea intends to create or what they will release as of yet as for leto the man who designed master chief and played a major role in making halo what it is today he's heading up a new unnamed studio in the seattle area it will collaborate with dice and ripple effect with the aim of expanding the narrative storytelling and character development opportunities in the battlefield series there's no word yet on what this means in terms of products or strategy but this is a major deal for the franchise byron bead who used to work on call of duty said that leto and his team in seattle will expand the 2042 narrative across a variety of experiences these will lay the foundation for storytelling opportunities now and well into the future and whatever they're creating there it will show up in later seasons for bf2042 and beyond while he and his team in the seattle area are just getting started on building battlefield world of tomorrow their work will shape later seasons for 2042 and beyond this new studio will act as the driver for narrative in tight collaboration with dice and ripple effect to help build great player experiences in the battlefield universe also a bit of news for portal 2 which i'm really happy about in another big move portal developer ripple effect will continue to support portal while it gets to work on a new experience in the 2042 universe the ripple effect boss christian grass told gamespot that he's unable to comment on what they're developing outside of portal who knows what this could be i've already seen rumors that it's a vr mode perhaps an expansion of the base gameplay that we've already got in 2042 as for vince zampeller storied history in the gaming industry worked on cod founded respawn titanfall jedi fallen order apex legends he has said that they think he's the right person to lead the battlefield franchise into the future this is a quote from the article here we're bringing one of the most influential and talented individuals in entertainment to a franchise that's ready to be unleashed into a modern era of gaming it's an extraordinary inflection point in game history his ability to lead studios and bring developers together so they can create world-class experiences is unmatched ea is saying that they believe that this is the right team to help the battlefield franchise grow there's a couple of quotes from zampella here too ea plans to grow significantly in terms of the number of developers working on the battlefield franchise across the company and he called on developers to look at ea's open positions and consider putting in an application zampela added that they're building a connected universe this is an and strategy in many ways we will continue to evolve and grow battlefield 2042 and we'll explore new kinds of experiences and business models along the way that we can add to that foundation to provide an awesome array of experiences for our players in this universe the world is interconnected with shared characters and narrative this universe is also built with our community as we harness the power of portal and user generated content that puts creativity in the hands of our players nothing specific about what these new experiences are but he did say that the battlefield universe is rich with opportunity from both a storytelling perspective and as a universe where our teams can create innovative gameplay experiences truly anything is possible ea ceo andrew wilson said the company may eventually develop a free-to-play battlefield game and while vin sampela stopped short of confirming this he did say the company is exploring every possibility as it looks to grow battlefield to help reach its full potential so there's a long-term plan to support battlefield going forward but the first job they say is to support battlefield 2042 and expand it through its live service offering from the foundation our teams will create new experiences that expand the battlefield universe so i wouldn't say there's a cadence or deadline we need to do what's right for our players and our game and with that news of oscar gabrielson leaving as general manager he's going to be replaced by rebecca coutas and they were the former studio director at ubisoft anna see gabriel's gonna stay on for the rest of the year to help with that transition and then he'll leave to start a new adventure so this is a bit of a response i think from ea to how bad the launch of the game went there was a big patch today over 150 fixes i haven't really had a chance to play it to be honest but i know that it did break a few things like the mouse movement so pretty unacceptable when a patch comes out you expect it to just be good stuff but then i think almost every pc player couldn't use their mouse to some degree for some people resetting keybinds help fix that for others like myself i had to delete my battlefield document folder and have the game make a new config for when i could use the mouse again i'll give the new patch a proper test tomorrow maybe fire up a live stream or a new video so back in regards of fixing 2042 laura miele who is ea cfo added we're lucky to have such passionate fans and i'm confident we will continue to do everything we can to meet their expectations we believe in 2042 as it is the cornerstone for the future as we begin to expand the universe as a whole we are all in on battlefield it's one of the most important and valuable franchises in the industry collectively we're out to unlock its enormous potential so there's a huge commitment to battlefield here and i don't know if this was already planned but a lot of people will see this as a response to the launch of 2042 and how that's gone down the seattle studio for example they announced that that was opening a couple months ago but there's definitely been a change in leadership here and who knows this could have been planned all along but it could be because of what's happened as for expanding the universe though i'm all in on that i'm really interested to see where they take this what are these new game modes that are being built what are these new experiences with narrative are we going to get single player back is there going to be a battle royale game are they going to expand on hazard zone will they make 2042 free to play or will it be a new battlefield game that's free to play what new things will come to portal lots of question marks here but this is definitely a statement from ea to say we're committed to fixing 2042 and also look at all this other stuff we're doing for the franchise whether it turns out okay that remains to be seen of course a lot of people have been burnt by 2042 dice have definitely lost a lot of trust now it's obvious the game shouldn't have been released in the state that it was but the future could be bright at least we've got something here and it appears that there is a big commitment but i'm definitely looking forward to some more announcements in the future it's pretty expansive pretty big deal this who knows where it will end up i'm just glad that they're committed to actually improving 2042 rather than just leaving it because i think a lot of people assume that that's what would happen here but i would expect some of those missing features from previous games to be added back into 2042 maybe some kind of rejigger the class system i don't know i just want to add to this here because i feel like most called battlefield fans just want a decent battlefield game that keeps its identity and i'm not entirely sure that narrative is as important as what's being portrayed here new experiences in the game i'm all in for that but i'm much more interested in the narrative of the gameplay yes story and narrative will help build a connection with the players and it helps for stuff like selling mtx and new characters and world building getting your players to care about the world but you've got to know the fundamentals of battlefield first before you start getting into that additionally to this there was another article on gamespot that talked about some upcoming future content for 2042 including the launch of a new map and specialists which will hit next year as well as time limited 64 player modes for pc and new gen consoles there's another patch that's coming later this month in december but it's next year that will bring new content including a map called exposure while we didn't get any details about what that is or what it will involve ea told gamespot that it would be something special by saying it takes map design to a whole new level 2022 will see the launch of the game's first live season and we'll be getting that new specialist weapons gadgets and vehicles over the course of the year we'll get multiple seasons each with its own set of new content further details have not yet been shared and we don't have release dates for any of this it's kind of cool though about conquest and breakthrough which will be coming to new gen as well for 64 players might actually be a interesting experience to try that out i assume it would run better as well because let's play as smaller maps we'll see but there it is do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below thank you for watching guys if
