everyone hope you're doing well today we're taking a look at everything that season four of Apex legends has to offer at Lourdes an overview of sorts to get you up to speed it's been live for a few hours now and I've had a chance to dive in and digest everything so far primarily this guy revenant got some cool gameplay in this video and a big thanks to EA for sponsoring this one so revenant is awesome not much is known of his backstory so far apart from the fantastic cinematic that we got to see he is a pretty simple hero on the surface though but I reckon you could pull off some high level plays once you master everything the passive ability allows you to Crouch faster significantly faster in fact if you look at this comparison a bit of a race and also he can climb much higher and longer than any other Legend I don't know exactly by how much but I feel like it's maybe three to four times more climb height than your typical character revenants active ability is pretty sick too and a first of its kind in apex it's a silent in Chuck this of people and they can't use their abilities for ten seconds of course people can still shoot you which is the primary way of killing people in apex but this is really good for initiating teamfights or stopping people like great or Pathfinder escaping and finally his ultimate is the death totem very menacing you drop a totem that protects those who interact with it from death for a certain amount of time but the totem can be destroyed now if you're under the totems effects and you lose all of your help instead of being killed or downed you will be returned or teleported back to the totem however you're going to be unreal a low HP and you can't use health or shield consumables while in this shadow form but the perk is of course that it's a way for you to cheat death and come back it's strong now revenant I think is a really interesting legend and I'm definitely going to play him some more and make an in-depth guide if you've used revenant already let me know in the comments how you feel about him is he Opie not good enough or just right one of the other big takeaways from the new update though is this bad boy a bolt-action sniper rifle known as The Sentinel and I've already had a lot of fun with this great sound to it and the action on it is smooth but the most interesting feature is that if you're carrying a shield battery in your inventory you can hit your alta fire key and then you can plug that battery into the gun to essentially energize it to deal massive damage particularly to shields it's got this cool new animation here too but if you move it will cancel once you've energized it though it turns blue and the particle effect of firing a shot is different as it's the sound and you'll see that bar on the right there that slowly goes down over time and of course if you take shots it will deplete faster but I have to say if you are carrying a lot of shield batteries on you you can just chunk enemies down with this thing it's mad and incredibly satisfying to use there's not much bullet drop on it either and it does appear to have a very faster bullet speed this will definitely become a fan favorite moving on you may notice some changes to the map to world's edge is evolving and the most striking change I suppose is now this giant harvester in the middle of the map this was added so people can quickly ascertain roughly where the middle is but also these are all new assets here so there's new rooms to fight in and out of multiple levels slides it's just really fun to explore and because of this harvesting capital city are split into two east and west and now separated by this giant lava Fisher with collapsed skyscrapers and all if you fall in there or you're forced to go in there to escape you will be pushed back up slowly and lose a bit of HP so it's a big gameplay consideration and you'll need zip lines or jump pads to get across in most places very deadly just make sure you don't go fall Terminator 2 like I did here there's also a new point of interest of buy epicenter called survey camp some new buildings and terrain there but the best thing about this location is you can get guaranteed weapons from the weapon racks inside it's kind of neat so while it may be a bit out of the way and not the typical hot drop area you could guarantee some decent guns and speaking of guns has been a few changes there too that will have a big effect on the matter of the game one example the L star is now a standard loot weapon that you can find in crates on the ground etc and the devotion LMG has been added as a fully kitted drop only weapon it was pretty good if you got all the attachments for it the r99 has had a bit of a nerf wingman has been given one more base ammo still very satisfying to use and the turbocharger hopper and extended energy mags are gone from the game interestingly the g7 Scout is now classed as an assault rifle and can use AR attachments and sniper ammo is a new thing to these little blue boxes our sniper ammo and working you guessed it all the snipers apart from the crabber I guess so this makes snipers much more easier to understand now I suppose rather than mixing up all the different ammo types and you can get a new attachment called the extended sniper mag apart from that I'm trying to keep this as concise as possible the top 500 ranked players on each platform will now be the only ones to receive the apex predator rank so you will know exactly who the best of the best are and you can now have a random favorite skin option to keep things looking fresh there are some other weapon changes too there's a bit of balance here and there but I didn't want to go through everything in this video just the highlights really with that said that is where I'm going to leave it for today I'm definitely going to dive into revenant some more once I played him and understand his potential a bit more so look forward to that and we might take a more detailed look at Sentinel - either way I really hope you enjoyed this one guys thank you for watching do let me know your thoughts down below as always leave a like if you enjoyed the video or dislike if you didn't subscribe for more and I'll see you in the next one [Music] looks like that what's the latticework did
