they're still pouring through there ow yeah oh my god okay i'm just holding them all down hi guys and welcome back to more hell let loose that was really fun something i've never done in the game before using a machine gun and it was just right place right time tommy said change class get up here you'll have a good time and it was true awesome feeling i know you guys like watching this game and a couple days ago they released a new update for it they've done an overhaul of the map hurtgun forest and that's what we'll be playing in the next match that you're going to see they've also improved the performance a bit and after testing it the frames per second is definitely a bit higher now i'd still love to see more there but it's a significant improvement over what we had before there's also been some changes to the back end the user interface they've added some transport vehicles too which is cool and tweaked the damage and bullet penetration with some nerfs and buffs to certain weapons in the game there's also the grease gun and satchel charges too didn't get to play with those though because i've got to level up my engineer class before i can get my hands on them but with that said i hope you guys enjoyed this game we had a full squad using tactics movement positioning getting around the forest trying to take out the germans as well as we could and if you enjoyed this video guys leave a like thank you so much subscribe if you want to see more and let's get the job done tom you're dead i killed the man that killed you there's some trenches here we've
