cod warzone today the mid-season event went live and with it we got a load of weapon balance and a brand new smg that you can see here the well gun this is said to be a heavy full auto smg with lethality and range for short to medium range engagements i haven't unlocked it yet but there is a blueprint for it in the store and that builds actually not bad for war zone although it's not perfect there's definitely some changes that you can make here it's what i was using today though playing with lackey and westy and i've got an action-packed game to show you so without further ado let's get into that match now a big thank you to these guys using my code in the cod store jack frags and caps if you liked the video leave a like if you're new here do consider subscribing for more let me know down in the comments below if you've tried this yet and what the meta build is if you've unlocked everything for it already sit back relax and enjoy they didn't bother doing the any of the titans and skins for the attack on titan bundle oh that would look horrible though wouldn't it yeah i know but it would also look really cool you want a literal naked man i want an armored titan running around warzone yes it would kill my emergency mr the bunny rabbit is just perfect for me but a naked man with horrible monster face i don't know if i could deal with that bridge too far is it i have dropped down i think he's underneath underneath see if he comes at the rappel there's people fighting in the uh code oh [Applause] whoa he ruined me we need you can you pull my helicopter that would have been impressive did you throw a spot grenade then yeah i did for a revealing boy yeah he did okay did you think someone else threw it no i saw one slightly after you what happened is just coincidence as i hit the wall here with my grenade it marked him but i think it was because yours exploded as i hit the wall so i thought is that a thing where you know you hit the wall but it's just yours went off at the same time happy coincidence i'm going to push left see if i can get a better angle here oh there's one right in front of me supply thing reason for the stun grenade jack oh oh i see there's a man there is a man yeah this ballgame's not bad you know target right here he's down that guy a little shed broken [Applause] recon is coming in feel like i can push here uav beginning fly over hold this guy above me don't try to push the blue house [Applause] one further back you've got a man on the hill there jumping down okay he's in the river deleted somebody out of the sky a little bit this guy's
