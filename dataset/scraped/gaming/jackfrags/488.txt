the closest things hi everyone and welcome back to cyberpunk 2077 this will be the ending of the main story quest walkthrough for me enjoyed it so far and we've got to go and talk to takamura take out some snipers and hopefully get on hanako's float but it's going to be a bit tricky there's all sorts of problems and treacherous things ahead of us well thank you for coming along and watching the stream in the video i hope you guys enjoy this big thanks to nvidia as well for sponsoring this one once again we are playing on high graphics with ray tracing turned on some nice reflections and shadows and we're also using dlss which is ai super sampling that nvidia have developed so you can keep your game looking nice and keep your frame rates high and we are indeed playing at 4k once again on an rtx 3090 graphics card with that said i'm looking forward to finding out what happens let's go speak to the boy they did release the patch yesterday so hopefully there won't be any crashes today fingers crossed i did some side quests earlier and it didn't crash so i'm hoping that that's all fixed now that remains to be seen sabotage just in time hey girl wow you look like a million eddies is that so that is not how i feel i ate what you call ascot scott burger and what do you think tasty ask the people the parade that was rude i adjusted the data from okada i advise you to examine it yourself take a look at the data to begin with the malware works truly much better than my anticipated our eyes and ears are in the guard room i observe the cctv and i know where the sniper potions are they are trio you must make each harmless before they do the same to me there are many ways to reach them the first is nearby he should not be a problem the second is worse you will have to climb as for the third he hides on the foot bridge over the street we are here hanakusana's platform will stop here close to the emergency exit we will use when all is done okay from these points you will have a clear view of the parade but the snipers will see things even better if they notice you bam bang right if this sounds dangerous consider that i must live to the floor and through a window and me to hanakosana face to face i think i'll be fine the last is what i fear the most is all this clear yes are you ready so kill the snipers i know and i thank you for this thank me once it works i get in position very well wait for my signal this is going to be a good mission i'm looking forward to this stay safe this parade should look really nice as well wow i am in position the floors have started to move remember to be careful what you will face arasaka drones join fish i also spotted the net runner uniform okay good to go then let us begin you must reach old snipers before anakosama's float appears look at this crowd can i get through thank you some nice lighting effects go down here they've really increased the crowd density for this mission i'm just trying to get through lately lady please thank you [ __ ] you're floating in the air is that a coy carp is that what it's called good for you just save me with that ah just watch it i think one day they'll have this kind of stuff in real life let me see it now let me see that [ __ ] juxtaposition it's the instagram selfie i think that's a is that a tripwire yeah it is i can disable that and i just jump over it disarm i know what maybe some other time snipers up there it's going uh yeah do i need to do this i don't think i need to do this i'm bad at that anyway it's fine there's no suspicious activity here my friend it's okay i'm gonna have to make a big leap aren't i i did just get a cool sniper rifle there i need to check it out i mean they're really flexing the graphics in this mission aren't they oh you're crazy check it out it's nice scan me right do i have to go to the balcony he said that's what they are that one this is important oda is speaking to someone i am linking you in we both can listen okay again do your damn job it is just as we expected oda is here oh i will contact you with anything oh there's a bit of a badass i know that guy motherfucker's barely human but hey know what i'm glad he's here you're glad you got to be satisfied you got [ __ ] all to lose all right fine we your finger on the [ __ ] trigger i guess chill out try to reach the maintenance area you can climb up from there go this big ladder not throw attention i mean can i even jump that guy so god thought i was gonna fall then i was so scared now where's this sniper you will have to get down somehow just be careful yes just so don't rush i need you alive not the corpse below can i hack that short circuit try just have to drop down bit by bit i think members of his family but i drop it on one of their heads maybe is that what that's for i'm not a big fan of this at all it's very claustrophobic cooperation i don't think we've been spotted yet although they have found a body and yet here we go feel like we're getting closer can i do something to him short circuit okay hit him with a noscope well the sniper knows i'm here now i could show you guys this check this out i've got the mantis blades just a few feet oh nearly walked in front of that oh you're gonna get the blades my friend goodbye talk it down oh my goodness sniper number two is gone to the next shot himself i don't like all these trip wires i think that would kill you in one hit come out with your hands in the air excuse me got this new shotgun as well check this out it's a smart shotgun it locks onto people shoots around corners really strong well that's a big drone look at that where'd that come from goodbye yes back collect all these guns i'm guessing they're pretty ob these guns don't pick up oh see he's behind the cover don't matter just shoot around the corner you can climb up from there and if that doesn't work you can use the foot bridge to your right watch out for the floor unless you intend to get cooked i would keep my head low i don't want to get cooked oh my god that lady's floating how did she how did she do that is she magical i think i can just go across here right watch out for the jets though i'm stuck those pipes look strong try to climb them okay we go up some more i think so i've got a big camera as well i'll show you my hammer hold on um oh there's two guys here though there's the hammer check this out come on i'm gonna grab this guy oh no i think you see me oh i'm gonna die i need heels oh damn it i should've just gone in there straight away with the hammer that's fine what's up brad hey michael howie hey younger how you doing hey holly thank you for coming along to the stream today i didn't expect that guy to see me second guy could hit him with the uh short circuit see how good that camera is i feel like the game isn't very balanced for melee like if you just level melee you can just smash everyone and this is normal difficulty as well uh construction i think i've got to go to construction drop any weapons and come out why did they just look at the smash no no there's no reporting i don't think so yeah let's go the last snipers up there a hostile agent sorry what did i just walk through a tripwire or something nbr yes i think i almost died then well done thank you one problem oh what is it that is you've got to jump oh no not the next she has taken control of all the networks you must get rid of her will not be able to hijack the float otherwise she hides in an unfinished apartment building here to the second sniper's nest okay on my way okay so i've got to take out the netrunner jack is now cyber thought pretty much huh take the elevator yep give me those consumables that i never use ever must be that one oh no we're back to the balcony okay firestar you died three times not seeing those mines really that's a giant dragon some good singing [ __ ] not good the relics in my head johnny's messing with now me i have an attention pull out calling been on a while time for a break oh my god you're here that guy is sick ow oh you don't like that dude oda i mean that that's a lot of damage i haven't really touched them reload who's tanking i wonder if i should use the hammer we'll just go in there with the hammer oh he's shooting at me nice little boss fight here what's the slow motion about that's cool he's got some sick mods oh he's invisible i got a hill run away where's my hammer there we go all right you got mantis blades i got hammer let's see who wins oh he's shooting at me again where'd you go where'd you go i'm a smash i mean that barely does any damage too oh yeah that slow motion is a new mod that i've got if i dodge it's a slow motion he does jump attacks as well i'm about to have a shotgun damn it uh might have to put an assault rifle on or something let's have a look i did pick up a load of new guns didn't i sir yeah i don't have any shotgun ammo can't use that yet where's my smg that sets fire to things put the assault rifle in there look at my character by the way it looks awful where'd you go it's a burst rifle doesn't do much damage this reminds me of a grey fox for a metal gear solid oh my god is he dead no percent hell got him i i managed i want to see what he's got is he dead he's breathing i will personally find you for that are you please me show him mercy there should be nothing standing in your way now we press forward i guess i could kill him if i wanted to you and your [ __ ] sick sense of honor let me go let's see what i just picked up from got some level up here as well i'll regenerates faster as you yep melee damage that's what i want stacking hard into that inventory was the new stuff oh my god so i've just got so many duplicates here i could craft some ammo for the shotgun um oh that's not that's just crafting the gun itself isn't it i've not really used this that much lucky day though i'm jacking up old friend goro okay prim online and in the system hanako's inside what is she doing trying to call someone i think try to listen check it out afterwards is oh you stunned her oh [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] he shot her well now we're really [ __ ] oh he just stunned him i couldn't trust him what happened to keeping him on his leash oh there's all sorts of horrible demons and robots out there you should put some pants on really it's cold this time you're dead okay that's i did i

now hey look at my stupid helmet it looks like knockoff darth vader i look like darth vader's jumps into a bucket of white deluxe paint everyone's messaging me all the time that doesn't make sense physics and weight oh my god my frame rate oh that was horrible it just chugged lows then so rude pretty good hideout to be honest go left the other left did he tell me to knock a specific number of times and i missed that is that what happened there was it three is it three times i think it was three times i've got 50 50 chance of getting this right it was four times yeah he told me not four

brother tried to hawk off the net watches in my head right now took a bullet to the brain but the tech on the chip saved me now it's slowly killing me one of your personality constructs engrams it's overriding my psyche gotta stop the process get it out it's too late i know you got the means to help me he is living proof of the terrible crime your brother committed we can confirm every word he speaks if only you will help him with the relic please you gotta help me please lady johnny's in my head i can't get him out did you hear that go and check she called back up i got a bad feeling about

this before time to go don't you [ __ ] dare float off not now come on got to get the [ __ ] out of the city where are we going to go the desert just like the bf5 katana op could be near your current position i think they make these motels especially the royal fuck-ups like us ac's busted dirty needles under the mattress [ __ ] clogged no for real who [ __ ] comes here to sleep we're a couple miles outside night city right someone leaving town just keeps driving somebody going there sleeps in the damn city what good's a motel in the middle of nowhere johnny yeah shut up oh damn random [ __ ] ain't gonna help anyone it's good point how the tables have turned johnny for crying out the ones sitting around waiting for soccer assault squads to storm in anyone knocked blast the [ __ ] door no warning not keen on us ending up like takamura we didn't see him die so he might be all right hear that car at this hour in this place my shotgun [ __ ] just one finger on the trick v i don't know who it is not a word i have a message for v don't touch that door are you asleep time to wake up i don't know what to do guys who's there i said who's there oh what's the home mortality here or will you let me in all right i'm gonna let you in no no i don't know okay finally i don't know who you are that on the wall is that blood yeah it's still leaping not the last star of this dump so you were saying got a message sitting right ah here start soon what'll start it's a doll poor proxy it's a hologram message or something she's going to relay the message i must make one thing clear i still think you are mad hanako that you but i can fool myself no longer i believe you it is higher i'm sorry i know this must be difficult for you painful so much so that i could not look the truth in the eye what happens now yorinobu planted a tanto in the corporation's very heart i must act while a wound is fresh and you will help me you are living proof of his crime and treason decided already is that it you're in no position to set conditions and what if i obliged you to cooperate have to send a swarm of proxies to do that this here talking is because you're alone you don't have anyone else you can turn to this is true so what are your terms i want to know everything you know about mikoshi mikoshi one of my father's flagship projects a data fortress with servers situated on orbital stations all around earth we can go into space is that what we do as an archive of personality constructs digitized psyches try a prison a matter of perspective in any case that is not where you will find salvation not without extensive knowledge of the relic and the construct creation procedure track down your run away hellman was hiding under kangtal's wing we chatted think sooner or later the engram will completely conceal me process can't be stopped a surprisingly deterministic conclusion for a man of science at the very least i got my hands on the relic schematics got detailed information about its inner workings project tech documentation all useful even more so given that hellman is still alive i will contact him and explain that one does not leave arasaka by the back door managed to make contact with alt cunningham the cunningham in the flesh well not really soul killer using her modified version now that should be more than useful that's about the extent of what we've got what now let us meet in person at embers in the city center it is discreet just remember one thing from now on we both must exercise extreme caution and she's back to be an adult well that's my job done know what what i think i'd have rather had a wave of soccer elites marching here we got what we wanted don't tell me that proxy got to you [ __ ] you come on think about it yesterday hanukkah was living in a world that was completely safe for her what she got on her hands now a foreign city a homicidal brother and a [ __ ] thief that's why she sent a proxy she's alone and she's [ __ ] herself more than we are uh-huh clink what did you say clink mm-hmm sound of her attaching her leash hmm johnny i'm not under the thumb it's okay we're just trying to help her i wish this car guy would just do one one of my missing vehicles could be near your current position he's always on about his missing vehicles what's up got a few more words about the porcelain [ __ ] [ __ ] get ready [ __ ] nah he's done for oh i'm done johnny you ain't dying yet i got you these are ticking time bomb johnny that smells the sea breeze get up pacific's beautiful this time of day almost

you're up for this what you getting cold feet no just i don't want to see johnny haze you adam smashes his obsession not yours think so just trying to play fair it's a little weird you didn't run into smasher before now came up in conversation time to time yeah but you never tried to track him down listen v fact that johnny's back changes things okay okay sure believe me i know we'll get back to that i guess okay here's as far as we go let's jump out it might be our lucky day drop grayson and smash her in one go i'm done gotta be around here somewhere okay we can start too many rats around better wait till a little darkness creeps in maybe smash your grayson will rear ahead maybe don't hold your breath though wouldn't be caught dead here in daylight that's better okay good as it's gonna get the door's disappeared oh it's already over maelstrom's got the darks covered and you'll cover me come on let's go she's dead so many bugs hey he's back take him out or let him pass your choice can you open it yeah i got it okay watch it now watch you not watching now see him gotta get to the date quietly find the data term it's over there i mean we don't really do things quietly do we like

anything we can use i'll watch the door knows exactly where to find him she's stalling told you rogue's still scared of the [ __ ] um looks like they're hiding out on the ship let's see gotta go to the ship to the right oh the leg's gone there it is right there love the music i do wonder what the game would be like though if you didn't have streamer mode on like what kind of license tracks have they got in here grayson yeah no not that [ __ ] shooting at me with my own gun signature sound i'd know it anywhere you're not getting it out of line there we go johnny's good come here not yours okay right now we're okay now we're really you and me not playing for the same team anymore yes i'm not at all surprised seems your specialty slipping shivs in the backs of allies she's not even looking where's smasher i'd start talking if i were you your wound looks pizza wreck awful and i don't see anyone around who could help but i'm happy to talk ever wonder how rogue survived after the attack on the tower how in hell no one ever hunted her down her alone out of all that atlantis trash cause i do i truly wonder how far she had to go to set herself up so comfy hoochie finger [ __ ] whose crack did she have to lick to oh where's smasher now with the arsakas but i think you know that already when's he do back never faithful old adam's just been naked ahead of security there oh not coming back to this rat hole ever i stayed behind just to tie off his loose ends [ __ ] bro say that again please look at him you two will never jump that high smasher's out of your reach but don't feel bad you'll find you himself likes to resolve [ __ ] like this in person you're [ __ ] useless let me do the honors v hey why are you so interested in smasher anyway i'm not interested in silverhand and what happened to him johnny silverhand what do you want to know smash here ever tell you what he did with silverhand's body bad into him huh plan to exhume that scop or you just want to hear how he died soaked in his own piss neuron scorched by soul killer damn what did they do with him near the oil fields buried out there 101 northbound then head for the landfill dig deep enough mighty find a [ __ ] smear heard enough finish it quickly i want to rip my eyes out just looking at me no no wait i got something silverhand you're in him right i could give you something what are you gonna give me you got lucky today turning soft on me v what i promised in the container on that goliath over there yeah what's inside you'll see got the access cart right here this is a truck take it for [ __ ] sake she's bad enough just knocked her out i think she's supposed to be there pointless this whole thing still no leads nowhere to go from here [ __ ] v tell her johnny says you'll get him yet oh yeah we'll tell him [ __ ] can't even have a normal convo with him smasher [ __ ] you don't get it this isn't about smasher he's just the goddamn tip of the iceberg even if we get him what does that get us no reason to stay i'm out no you're not at all curious rogue let's get later v leave her alone she'll get a ticket the box is ruining the emergency like this she prefers to be alone okay i get that gotta get that container down somehow if there's something of mine in there i want it back lower the crane i'm looking for the control panel is it up here surely no i climb up my game just forced me back to the ground there there it is this better be something cool and i hope it's not a trap oh [ __ ] i think i know what it is let's see what we got here oh it's johnny's car isn't it push yeah look at that take that rag off it oh wait okay let's go my ride hop in it's beautiful oh yeah oh my god it actually handles okay it's the first car in the game actually handles okay it's nice fine keeping that i never realized as usual he's just not interested in you johnny i'm sorry you can't swoon everyone not far now nice interior worse than i thought i mean it is just out in the middle of nowhere surely his body at this point will be all decomposed and rotten and okay gotta be around here somewhere have a look i can't believe they bothered to truck it all the way out here it's better than the junkyard where i landed on johnny's grave so that's how it is nothing here at all what did you expect headstones flag and flowers yeah right i don't know a marker something anything this says no future we'll figure something out js look at that 2023 better now a bit but let's say it was my real grave what would you write this is not yours real grave the guy who saved my life the guy who saved my life it's adorable v you don't know how much i want that to be true listen i realize i [ __ ] up a lot of things either let down or used every last person who gave me their trust blind selfish bastard that i was but i've managed one thing for now not to [ __ ] this up what we have and a long bumpy road the first bit of empathy that is shown most people i thought were my friends they couldn't even stand to be in the same room with me you're [ __ ] closest to me by a long shot there 24 7. and yet you don't seem to hate my living i think you're all right johnny just misunderstood it's too bad we didn't talk like this earlier would have made things easier never found the right moment remember waking up at victor's not knowing about me i'm seeing things i'm scared then moaning at misties about how you didn't want to die remember you whining for smokes in the middle of night complaining about not being able to kill me never thought we'd make it this far i think that would change based on your actions in the game still feel like you can't breathe in here yeah not saying it's great but it's different it's different sometimes when i wake up feels like i'm back for a while what do you mean back well like i got this body to myself like i'm free seconds later feels like i'm missing something something really important then i realize you're there always were and this stupid wave of relief washes over me when you said you let your friends down did you mean rogue rogue alt kerry santiago let him hold on now those lost yet at least with rogue can't pretend nothing's changed over 50 years can't just insert myself into our life come on you already have true with that you know did promise her i'd take her to the movies long long ago good idea call her for me ask if she's free some night the thing is you'd have to surrender control again yeah i'll call her okay let's delta nothing to see here after all worth coming out all the same absolutely thanks fee of all the heads i could have popped up in hella glad it was yours that was nice you think cdpr always intended keanu reeves to play that character or during development do you think they were just like oh we need someone to play this guy who'd be good ah maybe kyani roofs i don't want to leave the porsche do i where is it behind me it is a nice looking porsche though what model is that what's it be is it the 911 it looks like a 911 right anyways we've got to get to embers go see hanako again hi johnny that's a strange question there from johnny in the chat if you miniaturize anyone and put them on top of your christmas tree who would it be great question who would i miniaturize and put them on the tree someone who could tell me jokes like conan o'brien maybe i think he'd be good he could just whenever i walk into the lounge he could just tell me a joke and be on top of the christmas tree then after christmas i could put him away in the loft until next year i hope that answers your question i think i should save here right i feel sick don't like this at all this porcelain [ __ ] is the worst kind of news i know i'll be careful not exactly one of you actually just looks sick listen first sign of trouble me delta delta means to go for johnny is that a military term oh gorgeous place [ __ ] excellent you have come another fine dress thanks for meeting me of course v and i thank you before we discuss details i feel i owe you an explanation i must tell you why i changed my mind and wish to help weren't sure of anything if you could trust me if you were nobody killed your father now i knew from the start you knew all the board members knew not one soul even slightly interested in the matter believed in the poisoning details were disparate inconsistent you knew but didn't do a thing about it why suddenly sprouted conscience just yesterday my father had flaws i know this i harbor no illusions about it when a four needed removal my father ordered it without a thought to mercy a way of being yorinobu could not abide but to my father ends ever justified means saburo arasaka has always valued just one thing do you know what it is himself power family our family i was to be its heart to uphold life ensure continuity stability never to oppose it huh guess your noble's instructions were a little different yorinobu raised his hand against our father but he is an arasaka he is family i do not expect you to understand i wish you merely to know i do not oppose my brother willingly that it is difficult we were going to talk biz specifics let us do so did you bring soul killer as we agreed you finger on the trigger don't say a word johnny i don't know what to do now is everything in order of course that didn't bring soul killer afraid we don't know each other that well you prefer to keep your guard up understandable but unnecessary we are here because i know how to save your life that's right i can lead you to mikoshi don't exist in real space

he must be made to take responsibility for his deeds sounds like you want to avenge dead old dad i want that arasaka corporation to know the truth how you plan to do this right will soon call a meeting of the board representatives of all factions are expected to attend the perfect moment for them to learn the circumstances of my father's death i'm with you i will get you into this meeting and you will testify against my brother testify listen mind if i'm straight with you help me get rid of your innova i will help you get rid of the construct offers intriguing need to think about it

well how they operate you don't play ball willingly they force you they don't play these kind of games don't invite you for a meal at a restaurant with a [ __ ] grand piano hey you if we stand to gain anything from anyone inside our saga great you checking out again what am i no it's not what you think not yet easy there don't move just yet nick you're in pain i know delirious when you arrive so i had a doshu with beta haloperidol but light over sensitivity is a good sign means your optic nerves aren't damaged how how'd i get here drag yourself here beat the hell and back they missed the hell of a fright then you shoved my patient at the time off the table and demanded you be treated immediately delaman was your guardian angel huh i uh wasn't completely myself i know and that's a bit worrying so how bad we talking that bad huh real bad all right that should be a little better try sitting up carefully i'll try i think i'm getting some feeling back slowly another victory for the history books well looks like i can sit up all right but i can tell you don't have good news how much longer is this going to go on you tell me looking at you not long at all next attack you will be able to crawl back here you'll flatline in some back alley this is your last chance to take matters into your own hands understand i know vic i'll try soon no you'll do it now now see that setup over there uh-huh you'll find something there that'll help you end this on your own terms if you can manage to cross those few yards the rest will be up to you and you alone on your own terms huh really subtle there doc enough johnny i just gotta think about it i need to stretch guns and pills i think i can do it whatever you decide let's make sure to get out of here first i'm gonna go to arasaka

about that no need to be i know what's going on and i know it won't be easy for either of you if you don't want to decide here i know a much better place sure lead the way why is this spot special i took jackie there once it's not far jackie what's he got to do with any of this deal evic you'll see come on where's that cat i mean jackie is long gone so i don't think he ever told me about this place floor he had the same glum face oh jack this is it chica i'm done for doesn't sound like the jackie i knew that was a long time ago his mom had just found out he'd signed up with the valentinos trust me senora wells on one shoulder your gang choombas on the goombas no choice can ever seem right life wasn't easy for my jackie but he found the courage to bet on himself ah that's more like it i brought him here it's not a bad view see that i come here when i need to get away be alone with my thoughts she's on to something ought to sit mull through some [ __ ] yourself thanks misty you were right joyce spot so what what did jackie decide up here oh you know i'm gonna be a legend in this city and i'm gonna leave you alone now take your time [ __ ] scared me know that thought you were on your way out no i'm still here for now you know should call anyone you want to say goodbye to worst case scenario now would you expect no but whatever you decide risk's gonna be high if things don't go our way just [ __ ] do it anyone you gotta talk to now's the time pills can wait no not really my style goodbyes you do you come a long way to get here haven't we just think it all started in a [ __ ] landfill then you tried to kill me exactly what i mean here we are now together soaking in this vista night city my only regrets that i won't get to see how it all ends you're the one who rejects the only option we got left cooperating with monsters like them anything's better i think it's worth taking a chance in arisaka the [ __ ] was that god how are you so [ __ ] stubborn inherited your finer traits it's our only option really though we need her to help you absolutely sure no going back on this you know yeah just don't freak out honestly couldn't give a nat [ __ ] got a feeling you're gonna regret this decision and the moment that it dawns i won't be there to help could be my last ride this if it don't work out just want to be there for it where see you inside mikoshi johnny okay just me now he's gone at last your offer i accept you took your time in the interim yorinobu has made his move what do you mean my brother has made me his guest at his residence in north oak locked you in yes his people watch over me for my safety yeah well i'll get you out can be pretty persuasive i thank you with guns yeah where are you at victor's my ripper dock back behind a small shop called misty's esoterica i will send someone for you they will drive you to the residence then we shall visit my brother together at the arasaka tower she can come pick me up i missed it is that you v or yeah it's me so what now waiting for my driver come outside we'll wait together who do we have here huh cuts back that's mr brightman we found the poor guy in the trash behind the clinic i think he misses jackie oh ain't alone since you have to wait mind if i give you a what's reading why not tarot reading some believe uncertainty is an evil that should be dispelled through divination my mother did tarot cards others claim it's change that is evil but that isn't true either every minute of every day we each become someone new we shouldn't fear change itself but only who we might change into knowing one's path is most important i devised this layout especially for you and johnny your future is his future and vice versa okay i'm ready we'll start with you v the full what a surprise let's dig deeper to find its meaning here the fool symbolizes the start of a journey the announcement of something new it's the inner child curious of the world but also naive and reckless sounds a lot like the v i first met the magician she's that person of great talent and charisma a leader sounds like johnny a card is reversed that can mean a tendency toward addiction mental instability got that right okay definitely johnny he is one great disturbance the final cards are about your futures it's death then the devil got another deck lying around a cheerful one this is no joke v an inverted devil symbolizes subjugation losing control aggression evil a power struggle whatever you're planning treat this as a warning okay and johnny's that looks bad how is that the moon that doesn't sound too bad right i don't know v the moon is mystery i think that's for you say hello mister wait is that an arasaka stretch it is that's right but v they killed jackie and and now you're working for them i'm not working for them misty listen all this [ __ ] started because i decided to screw over the corp that used to sign my paychecks if i can make things right maybe just maybe things will go back to normal i get it they're only cards always open to interpretation oh it's hellman so this is where arasaka's finest technology wound up charming where's the ripper telling fortunes from rat bones in the back that's right matter of fact just foretold i'd break your [ __ ] spewing jaw remember the last time i did that i trust i do but i also recall what we spoke of that day the construct in your head and how it could affect decision-making the same construct that in its former life detonated two nuclear warheads inside arasaka tower that's right and now you and this construct have volunteered to sort things out in arasak interesting coincidence wouldn't you say i got johnny in check with beta blockers and our soccer's not on my radar that's a lie it's simple my life's on the line i shall be watching you let us go oh sweet ride we are almost there why has she not called who hanukkah i failed to see what you and your sharp wits are doing here well why i am here driving master v easy honor all right what am i your chauffeur i didn't agree to this neither did i matter of fact suggest shut up and drive i don't recognize this looks like a bugatti veyron in the future of course now for the fun part the limo is arisaka but there will be guards past the checkpoint try to act natural that's natural i can't do it still and calm this will all go smoothly good day sir good day is everything in order no one is allowed onto the estate until further notice by order of yorinov arasaka hanako is expecting us be a good chap and don't make this difficult by order of your innova arasaka must be choking surely you know my face i do but not his identify yourself i'm from ioc it's gonna get messy initiated protocol four procedures need to make sure every facility in night city is secure avenatti woman who committed suicide two days ago what stay where you are she killed herself couldn't be worse back up again here in seconds [ __ ] hell yeah it was gonna get messy cream hellman what was it you said about acting natural oh piss off blast it all what now they won't let us anywhere near her i have to plow right through him then knock yourself out you fetch hanukkah i'll sort out the av i am in the bedroom in the central part of the building and us you get the av but first we must neutralize the four guards v is your task clear it's clear we neutralize i will obstruct their communications so that no support arrives look at this place oh my god some kind of a horrible mecca over there careful now there are five more guns outside and a dweller in the garage on the left didn't say anything [ __ ] [ __ ] i thought my hack was gonna take this guy out obviously it didn't i don't want to find that giant robot though i'm not about that these guys are strong toby that's unnecessary i did it anyway there's a net runner here too oh and a sniper dude he's quick hey that's the net runner and now she's dead oh i'm over encumbered okay right got to drop some stuff i've got johnny's aviators that's cool i can't believe how stupid i look replica of johnny's samurai jacket but johnny's tank top one there's just no there's no sense of style or collaboration here it's just whatever's the best you know that's what we're going for i thought i had some uh points to spend there all this crap i've got get rid of it all there we go let me in he attacked me nobody attacked you what are you talking about are the doors right now that shotgun's devastating i like it a lot very good very good neutralize the rest of the guards there's one here above me i'm sure she said there was four guards funny loads can i hack you short circuit yeah that's one of the elite guards good night samurai sword beautiful do i have to take out the big one oh guys i think i have to take it out okay how much health has it got i can't even see how much help it's got there we go there's some grenades on it it's not really much of a challenge to be honest because it's so slow this is normal difficulty as well but i don't feel like that thing could ever kill me like the ai is just not good enough to play on harder difficulty though that wasn't a person quite clearly that was some kind of a mech let's go see her she said she was upstairs i'm nearing the residence good land by the pool it's gonna be these people they simply left me no choice we have a job to do we need to keep it together for all our sakes i need do nothing it is just that why is this random music stop playing has just just counting bodies you and me and hellman makes three actually two and a half anyway against all arasaka and its armies that's not much my brother is not all of arasaka not yet at least he knows this well should he use the amt grenades yeah it's a good one himself with criminals like i do have a lot of emp grenades that's supposed to make me feel better the reality is we're on our own my father was on his own and he built an empire we're going on the av almond what's up got some more mayonnaise for me please take us away he looks very concerned straight for the champers is it not too early for champagne but if it helps you calm down does anyone else have trembling hands no need my hands are fine i might beg to differ v rest of me is up to scratch too it's a lie that is a lie yeah he faded out in the car just tired that is to be expected your central nervous system is a shambles a day to be honest it's a miracle you can still walk we must make haste once yurinobu has been dealt with we shall attend to your needs makes me just want to watch blade run of this above the original movie and the new one with ryan gosling very good oh we're way up in the clouds are we playing this on pc michael on an rtx 39 graphics card i don't know if they're supposed to be talking here or something but this is weird i can't skip it either i think we're going in there did you prepare everything quite we just went through the wall oh [ __ ] that's embarrassing i should i'll be fine these lights they got some philips hue on the go this way probably won't get another chance to do what to fill me in on your plan what if i have none don't play dumb with me hanukkah i rebuilt it you and takemura had a plan the day of the parade moments later you had nothing your plan was in tatters and yet we are here now do you know why because sometimes you have to look the truth in the eye chill out back then that is what i did thanks to you you have a a very honest look that's how we're swinging the arasaka board you want me to stare at them weapon arts are ready if my charms don't work we go for more tried and tested methods i'm buying [ __ ] you have yet to see as judeo it was in counter until a while never heard of this place though of course you did not hear of it this is one of arasaka's most closely guarded secrets hang on is this father's office a faithful replica of the original in tokyo he ordered one made in every arasaka branch on the planet every last detail every item arranged as if he could navigate it blind that is the way he is meticulous fastidious fastidious that's a good word i beg your pardon meant to say was symbols are more resilient than you think looks like a star destroyer the question is if the faction leaders remain loyal to alaska various and if they will find the courage to admit their mistake they've got no choice we're talking about the future of arasaka here a monolith whose first crack appeared with yorinobu goro's words not mine a crack indeed yet no one did anything to seal it can't blame yourself i do not but they could blame me come it's got magic walls and doors oh that's sick secret elevator she's looking at me it's us it's pretty sus right now executive floors up top correct so why are we descending i told you mikoshi can be accessed only from a room beneath arasaka tower before we interrupt this board meeting we must do one more thing keep getting this weird feeling you're not telling me the whole truth because i am not telling you the whole truth i am cautious thought you said we trusted each other there is trust between us now that is why you are here so earlier soon after you abducted me i sought his counsel whose fathers the emperor what his office is not the only replica he created they cloned himself what give me johnny [ __ ] me dizzy foreign why am i here because foreign doing this for myself alone not about to end up beyond a glass pane titanium foreign what do i sign up for it is done we may go let's get out of here i johnny [ __ ] no no he's not happy it won't be much longer will you stay with us we're on weaker by the minute we gotta hurry indeed we do dire moments are upon us these your people in a manner of speaking meaning oh wow to what extent they have faith in me or my money i do not know i guess it'd be all the same to them wouldn't it you are never one to mince words that's why you brought me here look at this place motivations aside what's important is that they shoot in the right direction as a last resort and only then you mean when the board rejects every word out of our mouths if not when i feel like i'm in the rain forest cafe then what need me to neutralize them too keep your weapon and do not utter a word until i ask a thousand inhabitants no matter what happens we could relocate you must trust me you know so there are other islands around it sounds very costly i am late apologies what are you doing here my brother where is he he told us to start without him then begin without him we shall begin what the removal of yorinobu from his position as ceo of arasaka did i hear you correctly what what are you doing you cannot hanukkah i believe you owe us an explanation this is your seat i will not let you treat me this way you gotta move are you deaf give up your seat now that's my chair boy this is outrageous one of those logitech gaming kids yorinobu murdered my father and exploited his death to justify his warmongering and you knew of this all of you fascinating obscure what did you say yes indeed where's there nothing else is this all you have i have an eyewitness it's me it's true all of it saw it with my own eyes what did you see i saw your nobu strangle suburo arasaka ah more interesting with each minute i like this guy he believes me a serious accusation admittedly but nothing more if our testimony is not enough perhaps you will listen to my father this is this to convince us a magic trick oh my god okay foreign what is your command objections what the hell's happening clearly someone objects who activated the lockdown is it you is this your doing hanako to lock us in here so we devour each other like rats in a cage hear that have you brought more of this film from the street oh snap rip and tear until it is done neutralize us i did not believe he would go to such lengths well he did i will gather a force and take control of arasaka tower you must find my brother this lift will take you to the upper atrium from there you can reach your nobus floor i want him taken alive alive after all this he is still my brother i see how it is i got emp well they do so much damage to that ten years later we'll get the reload done cover me reloading you have no chance of escaping are these big lads gonna help why do we have to fight like this in the rainforest cafe i just threw a nade i think i can just leave them to their own devices operation all right let me just check my gear because i feel like there's some kind of boss fight on the way you know i can finally get rid of that stupid knockoff darth vader thing um yeah the precision rifle's really good increases crit damage okay um that sniper rifle isn't really curing it anymore is it i look all the mods for this gun makes it non-lethal though doesn't it good dps oh invisible shotgun let's go i got my mantis blades as well if i need them this thing's gonna be really good i think hey ken how you doing what's up semi shoot it's side guns for next time okay on every level come on out you're not in trouble i mean definitely i just keep posing there oh here we go oh okay that one actually hurts me well i've got to be careful with this he said shoot the guns it's a good tip that's a really good tip whoever said that way easier if you go over the guns not a problem they've disabled all the go to elevators lift in the middle on level three quickly good there are more stairs on the opposite side august where'd you come from go go go yeah johnny's good is just clearly the best don't really need to pick up any more guns to be honest i will join you once we have the situation under control okay ceo office let's go 2067 an arizona bodyguard shields the emperor of japan from an assassin's bullet 2071 arasaka security forces prevent mass riots in san francisco saving the city from certain ruin really 2074 an arasaka investigation eliminates a terror cell in rio de janeiro ending a string of attacks and executing those responsible you will receive that one oh my god loads of enemies i think i'm gonna get my blaze out for this there is a large room ahead my brother's most capable men guard it okay oh here he is you're nothing emp grenade's good against you god i hate him nope i'm barely touching him guys can i hack him nope can't do anything that's why they call him smasher i don't know if he has a weak spot his head i guess there will be nothing he's on left now hey don't reload this seems to do a lot of damage oh my emp grenades nope oh that really hurts got to keep healing and running and we'll get him it's a war of attrition he's i think this is the final boss after all and when he shoots he just can't stand in front of him like i did just then i was on fire i'm doing a lot better than johnny silva did let me tell you that he's got his guards take out the ads first reload come on what the hell is that you just fire a load of missiles at me or something ow another odd down man yeah he's firing missiles at me get the blaze on again maybe i don't know if i should engage him in hand-to-hand combat go for this big guy what is going on lots more ads yeah i can't do any hacks on him put those rockets down shoot through the wall like that it feels a bit cheesy he's just hitting himself i think he's broken oh no he's doing his missiles if i could disable that rocket launcher when he's firing it you didn't like that let's try um i do have a i think i've got a decent assault rifle now where is it 239 try that might be a bit better no not at all i mean that is horrible the amount of flashing on the screen there yeah that shotgun is dangerous is this jeez taking him apart piece by piece there's nothing left how do i kill you adam smasher fine what's your take johnny son of a [ __ ] is basically scrap suppose it'll have to do and smasher don't bother trying to get up you pile of junk it's a true war of attrition i mean this dude deserves to die doesn't he how about that johnny that was for you i thought i was gonna die a few times there hair on his head i remember privilege is all yours if i harm him she's not going to help me with the relic delights with violent ends you gonna kill himself where is my sister be here any sec now until then supposed to watch you so don't try anything what would i try i have tried everything nothing else remain this you won't need just one bullet left it's not for you look what do you see a guy who lost just one i see millions kyoto dubai was a it westworld wasn't it paris these people had a chance today but they lost it a chance a chance for what to forget their fear this how you want to help people forget their fear by killing them sorry just don't get it fear ever since i can remember the one thing i cannot deny him he knew how to cause fear in people bro he once told me anything of value is only a flag blowing in wind and wind is fear and then you know what he did blew in my face that was the one time he was wrong and others it worked on them they feared him even now you saw idiots terrified of a dead man talking from a box pathetic i would change that if only you did not appear um you're even worse yeah i agree he's not good it's a bro ruled with an iron fist but he didn't need a purge he's not thanos basically it's a power you you think i wanted power 50 years ago terrorists blew this building into smoke yeah so i heard johnny you needed it what did it give us not much nothing but i learned lesson if planting bombs not enough what can you do you become bomb isn't this essentially what johnny tried to do nissan i thank you v that will be all not all not yet need to help me i will keep my end of our agreement you will go with helmand and you i must stay with my brother is there retribution for him time to look to your problem don't know fate is a fickle mistress isn't she literally johnny's fighting to take over isn't it that's what's going on here in the deep net here's johnny it worked i did it johnny hanako kept a word looking at you now reminds me of the moment we met still see that same small time mark little thief with his head in the clouds haven't changed a bit got it all wrong no way that v would have ever made it this far just wouldn't have survived i had to grow stronger and i did maybe but that v also couldn't stomach betrayal wait that's what you think i betrayed you worse lots you betrayed yourself oh you mean by that biochem did mourn just blend our memories that line that kept v and silver hands separate well faded a while back i'm still here i know what i want and i know where i came from iii who's this i you even know i'm the v who chose to live same drive that kept silver gold his whole life that drive in two thoughts never look back never look to those around you just keep moving look ahead stare death straight in the eye you're not the only rebel around here and i'm not the only one to have missed a bigger picture where a tangled web you and me one in the same so if you're here to tell me something it's because you need to hear it yourself i want you to hear me out let me explain all this explain oh then talk listen i'm on an operating table getting sliced open our socket docs are taking the chip out as we speak i mean you knew it at end this way the day would come when i'd want to be normal again want my life back normal is overrated if it exists at all they're cutting a piece of us out and that'll leave a hole forever what choice did i have stay true to yourself give a thought to a tiny concept called loyalty if you're all paranoid about being thrown in another our soccer prison don't be they're gonna shred you you're never gonna get it it's not about our saga not even about life and death then what's it all about johnny enlighten me the principal v it's always about the principle swap meet for chrome live a bd fantasy whatever but at the end of it all it's the code you live by that defines who you are ever get lost it shows you the way home bust up into pieces it puts you back together again that rocker boy silverhands credo words he lived by something johnny picked up from v the old v conversation's pointless goodbye johnny remember what dex asked you quiet life or blaze of glory sure i remember shame you chose wrong damn shame in addition numerous brain functions

someone you know as it turns out i'm the only familiar face for thousands of miles around as it turns out i really did die and go to hell listen to me the procedure was a success we removed the biochip but the damage it wrought proved enormous at the genetic level altered dna the kind you would find in those suffering from radiation sickness and sadly it's lethal so you're telling me i'm gonna die all the options have yet to be exhausted what other options are there already gone under the knife once arasaka corporation has the capability to cheat death all we require from you is a dose of trust trusted you once already fat lot of good that did me you may join our pilot program secure your soul but my conscience in another body body is no longer of any use you must abandon it we will create an engram of your mind and store it in mikoshi store it why can't i just get a new body we have yet to solve the compatibility issue doesn't sound like you had much of a problem with suburu our saka you have no offspring nor do you have an entire clinic focused solely on your care hmm how am i supposed to know this isn't another one of your tricks a trick maybe arisaki just wants to punish a pain in the ass thief maybe saburo just wants another soul in his collection the harassakas have become gods you are nothing to them insignificant so this has to be your sweet revenge lucky you your life's work has turned saburo into a god yet here you stand a mere mortal that would make two of us why would i seek to punish my companion in distress my employer has made you an offer we should finish discussing it so let's say i agree land in our soccer soul prison put myself at their mercy do i even need to ask about the catch all is set forth in a contract guaranteed therein you must merely sign it if you wish to live that is now since a digitized psyche is not legally an individual the contract entails relinquishing your rights a temporary measure naturally no not about to become the property of our osaka corp current participants of the program are all well-known influential people we have yet to receive any complaints and if i refuse your belongings are packed a shuttle will take you back to earth and you will be dead before winter it's no easy decision i know you should think it through carefully oh man i i don't trust that they would do the right thing with my conscience no fine print you have nothing to fear maybe i should go back to earth made my decision going back to earth going home it is what it is we'll die there goodbye anders your offer was [ __ ] but in making it you gave me something better what are you talking about before death was inevitable a fact of my [ __ ] life you let me choose it accept it on my terms the only thing is vic might be able to save me the doctor this place sucks nothing of beauty will never fade away i see your eyes and know you see me you're like a ghost tower everywhere his mouth supposed to be like that i don't think it was this is one of the first times you see your own character in a cutscene ah havey how's the earth looking from way up there she is pretty as they say is that just another lie listen don't forget your implants were made for earth gravity could start acting up in orbit what i'm trying to say is don't ignore any arrow warnings okay and when you're back i mean if you come back i'll do a full checkup maybe even give you a little discount take care of me i was just wondering how you've been haven't heard from you in a while still living large in night city i don't know all i think about is dropping everything and leaving yet here i am still most cities like quicksand the more you try to get out the more it pulls you in once you're up to your knees you never get now like evelyn anyway look out for yourself okay and call me sometime bye heavy it's pen m remember me the one with the car listen you wouldn't happen to have any gigs to spare would you i'm not picky or anything i'll take whatever pace around if you've got something or you know someone who does give me a call okay i really appreciate it so yeah that's it catch you sometime in the afterlife maybe hello v it's all speaking from the aldecados um i heard some big noise coming out at night city with uh you involved no idea what that was all about but um if you're ever in trouble i need a hand or a place to disappear we're here you've saved and all the caldo's life we will never forget that it's a debt we're happy to owe stay in touch me hey v it's me mitch remember you saved my ass from kang tao well it doesn't matter if you don't remember cuz cuz i do anyway if you ever need help with anything i got your back alright you just give me a call and i'm in night city before you know it doesn't matter if you want someone to disappear or if you need lunch brought to your office literally anything all right all right take care now gotta hand it to you v i'm impressed when you told me you were gonna go after hellman i was sure you'd come back as a garbage bag full of smithereens but you didn't i'm not usually wrong about people and what they're capable of i'm curious to see what else you've got in you if you're looking for your next job you know where to find me hello v from what i understand you have less than six months to live i do not know how you plan to spend this time perhaps you have chosen to put your feet up rest ponder life's meaning or perhaps you continue to do what you are good at if that is the case my father and i would gladly retain your services you would be compensated generously six months will pass faster than you imagine it would be a shame to let this time go to waste heavy orbital connections cost an arm and a leg so i'll just get right to it i was just thinking about you so i laid out a quick tarot oh dear the fool the moon the high priestess those those are bad cards keep a close eye on your new friends fee i mean i wonder are you guys in chat are saying that there's six different endings is there an ending where you can cure yourself you fix yourself i feel like there must be an ending where johnny takes over your body or something like that because they hinted that so many times during the game interesting segment at the end though when you're in space there fast forward the credits i suppose what you have to do now though if you wanted to continue playing the game and go through all the side missions is you load the save just before you take the elevator up but i didn't really do many side missions in this walk through just pretty much main quested it weird ending that i'll probably look them all up on youtube charlie fisher said all endings are crap right can i just skip this completely it was a blast you completed the main storyline last open world checkpoint okay yeah so that will load just before the elevator i think one ending v shoots himself in the head killing himself and johnny is that true special rewards in your inventory okay what did i get i'm not really seeing anything new do i have to go somewhere to get these things i'm not sure you can trade with johnny i got to level 21. there was a multiplayer option too in the credits was that i know they said that they are doing multiplayer but it's not gonna it's not gonna come out for ages is it you need to go to a ripperdoc all right where's the nearest one i just want to see what it is so i'm interested one over here too much stuff on my inventory multiplayer is being released in 2077. good one yeah i do wonder what kind of multiplayer it will have pvp i imagine they could do some kind of pve if you appear to be sweet though because you've got all the acts and abilities and all the different weapons it's difficult to balance though i that the think of firearms to advance through traffic is prohibited by the law yeah don't use guns to speed up your journey great so as i was saying you mind taking a look at my chrome dome make yourself comfortable um so what did i get is it just some new mods is that it oh that's the tattoo that he gave me nothing now it might be that i have to go to victor yeah i've got a double jump as well cool right okay so i think i'm gonna end it there for today guys as always thank you so much for watching i appreciate you guys tuning in being here thank you for all the donations thank you for anyone that became a member during these streams i think what i'll probably do is one more stream where i go and do some of the cooler side quests because i know there's a load of side quests that i missed you can spend like 100 hours in this game if you do all the side quests but um i simply don't have time to do it all so do you know i'll pick and choose some of the best ones i've heard that the pan am ones are really good out in the desert they're supposed to be cool so we might do one more stream where we check those out yeah that was uh that was cool i mean that ending's a bit unsatisfying i think for me but maybe that's because of the decisions that i made the legs are in the ground guys you got arms oh it's the top right okay cool anyways i hope you guys enjoy the rest of your weekend if you enjoyed this and enjoyed the walk through the game hit that like button below it's a great way to support me uh also once again a huge thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this stream and a couple of the other cyberpunk streams too we were playing at 4k on an rtx 3090 graphics card using ray tracing and dlss making sure the game looks good and runs at high frame rates anyways if you like to leave a like if you didn't dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one bye-bye
