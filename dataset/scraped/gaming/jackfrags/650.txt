hi everyone hope you're doing well today a bit of intense warzone gameplay for you with some news about nerfs to the grout among other weapon changes and more coming soon but first I wanted to ask you for some help the title isn't QuickBase after all getting straight to the point I've created a fundraising page for a charity called special effect and I've set a goal of $10,000 special effect or a charity that helped to enable people with physical disabilities to play video games we all play in love video games they give us hours of entertainment and satisfaction even inspiration sometimes and for most of us it's as simple as picking up a controller or using a mouse and keyboard but for others that isn't possible so these guys come in they assess advise recommend and build custom tailor-made solutions for physically disabled gamers if you want to learn more about them it's all on their website I just like what they're doing and I want to help and I think that I can so I've started a fundraising page with the goal of $10,000 I think we can hit that goal together I've never done anything like this before but I do believe that that's an achievable figure I've donated $1,000 of my own money to get things going and if you'd like to contribute anything at all thank you and the link is down in the description below or at Just Giving comm /jf special effect now then over the last few days or so there's been a lot of buzz about weapon balance changes coming soon to cod war zone if you've played the game in the last month or so the meta has been dominated by the growl and the mp5 these weapons are absolutely the best choices right now the growl melts people at medium and long range and has practically no recoil with great accuracy you can out snipe snipers with it the mp5 on the other hand well at close range it's unmatched it's got excellent hipfire and mobility and it can eliminate a full armor full health opponent in 500 milliseconds half a second if you're not using these guns you're at the massive competitive disadvantage and that's no fun especially when you consider how many other options there are in the game however Josie cot who is the co-designed director of multiplayer art Infinity Ward replied to a tweet from a user called captain who asked on a serious note guys when is the growl going to be nerfed at least 90% of the kill cams are from a ground does that not tell you anything the m4 was nerfed three times already the growl is ruining warzone right now and Joe replied to this and he said that we've got a bunch of weapon tuning in the works for the mid-season update patch notes will outline when they drop so while joe doesn't directly say the growl is being nerfed i think it's safe to assume so seeing as that was the main body of captain's tweet we don't know when this weapon tuning is coming apart from mid-season i'm going to guess that's either at the end of june or the first week of july but it will be really interesting to see exactly what is in those balance changes what will they do to the growl they change the m4 again will they maybe both the m13 or the ram 7 we don't know and not that I want to either but I would expect there to be a shotgun buff too as I would hazard a guess that they are the most unused guns in loadouts in warzone alongside something like the foul and the dragon off but we will see one thing that I would love to see improved again I'm gonna say the audio the footsteps they've been pretty bad since the game launched and lots of people including myself have done tests on this and demonstrated how inconsistent and quiet they are sometimes it feels like they just don't play footstep sounds at all so I think improving the audio would be one of the biggest steps forward for the game right now also in other warzone news there was a bit of a disappointment in the community on Friday when the playlist of date drops and normal warzone quads that's the four player squads mode was replaced with realism quads realism quads is a completely different experience to normal it removes most of the hoods mini-map along with a ton of other information I've tried it on my own a little bit but I really need to play it in a full team to get the real experience however removing normal quads I think was a big mistake especially right before the weekend quads is probably up there as one of the more popular game modes many people enjoy it and play with three of their buddies at the weekend but removing it for something completely different isn't a good move for me maybe having it as an option would be cool for people to try I think with the 60 or 70 million players whatever the number is and cross play there's plenty of fish in the sea to fill a Lobby on every game I think a skill based matchmaking will definitely have an effect on that but you've still got a big pool of players there so I hope that they reinstate normal quads again soon with that said what you're about to watch next is an incredibly competitive trios game with myself study and a fire born a lots of people have felt recently that the hypothetical skill-based smutch making has been cranked up I don't know for sure but I can say that this was one of the most tryhard lobbies I've been in so far good fun anyways and I hope you guys like this ones right here at this he ran into the right jack team
