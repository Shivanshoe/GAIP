this is what warzone should have been oh this is what wall zone could have been i couldn't quite decide on the title for this one so which one did i go with did i make the right choice maybe i picked something completely different but either way today we're playing iron trials and this is a new limited time game mode the raven software and warzone have just implemented into the game and i won't go over all the rules but it does make some fundamental design changes to warzone and it arguably fixes a lot of the perceived problems with the game the key takeaways i suppose that you should know are the loadout drops now cost fifteen thousand dollars the only vehicles are atvs and dirt bikes most of the things in the store also cost more money for example the uav goes up from four thousand dollars to six thousand dollars but the most important changes are with the base health of the players so compared to a normal match all players base health in this game is increased from 100 to 250 health regeneration delay time has been increased from 5 to 7 seconds and regen per second has been decreased too so it's a much higher time to kill and health regeneration takes longer so things like plates managing your health even taking a medical syringe a stim might be a good option now and having played a few matches today with my friend stodd it does feel like a completely different game and this opens up a whole new world of possibilities for example gunfights now last a lot longer you don't just get instantly beamed you've got a chance to react plate up flank coordinate with your teammate the loot pool is also significantly changed and there's a lot less money it's more difficult to find cash so there's not as much uav spam it's more of a challenge to get your load out there's no free loadouts either so you've really got to think about how you're playing this and also get this there is no dead silence or stopping power at all it's not in this version of the game there's a lot of other changes too for example stuns the stun effect is now decreased by 50 percent so they won't be as good gulags are slightly different as well and at the moment it's only available in duos and get this there are some redacted weapons in the loophole that you can find i found this one here this is a stoner and these red weapons that say redacted and play a little guitar sting when you pick them up they have more than five attachments so if you've played mw or warzone you know that you can only put five attachments on the gun but call of duty vanguard's coming out and in that game you can put 10 on i think this is the developers testing that mechanic in warzone in this limited time mode because when the vanguard map drops a lot of people think it's going to be december a month after the launch of the main game we'll be playing on a brand new warzone map in the pacific and it could be that at that point you'll be able to put 10 attachments on your guns which is going to be just crazy think about the customization the min maxing everything will change at that point so i found this stone and it was ripping people i was winning gun fights that i really shouldn't even with the new increased time to kill and finally sniper rifles can only one shot kill you with a headshot now if you're within 30 meters of them when we were playing we found that it pretty much made the snipers irrelevant so i'm sure they'll tweak that and adjust it and i don't know whether this is a test for ranked warzone or is this the direction that warzone's going in will it become more competitive because this game mode it's definitely not for casual players and i think for most players it wouldn't be as fun because it takes a lot of variety away in my opinion and it's much more difficult to regain if you die or if you don't get a loadout so i think for the casual player for the majority of war zone players i don't know if they would enjoy this but for competitive players and ranked maybe this is where warzone's going but enough talking i'm going to show you a match now that i played with stodd earlier today i'd love to see trios and quads in the future duo's is a bit weird but we had a good time some great moments in here too with that said i hope you guys enjoy this let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you do like it leave a like thank you subscribe if you're new and let's see what happened right good start advanced uav on this i went through the door but there shouldn't be red doors on this way surely i guess we just push this and see what happens stick away in [Applause] okay yeah there's three people on our level nice there's two more stunning it's done here one more back here i did yeah it's fine two oh that's a different two i've got a hero i'm in really big trouble here okay okay we'll go i'm running around the side to the right the rose on the right he won really hard [ __ ] him again [Applause] fish that's that that's the team dude what just happened everyone in the superstore just fought the same time and we just came in off the back of it and won it lovely gas master i've got some time to play i think i'm gonna take a heartbeat sensor because it's the best things still unless i find stims you know what stims [Applause] no one's got stems watch for enemies [Applause] surely they're coming back we've got 7 800 what do we get uav yeah um at the factory i think the fact well yeah this one here yeah i think so it's closer [Applause] okay i can get you keep coming back to me he's going to rest i'm going to push that is he there's no way repeat it i mean if he did push it yeah i'm really confused about where they got the second guy is is he actually in the garage or no he's not he's not he's not unless that's a different guy i'm so lost dude they're both from the guys that's another there's another team they're fighting oh one more in there yeah i know i'm being shot by another team from over here okay he's pushing push together i'm gonna go right we might get pushed by that other team uh there's a playboy yeah you say that could have run across as a strat because they're probably pushing no they're not they're just saying if i had a sniper that would be good enough they think that's your loadout maybe it's okay it's actually not worth like fully playing most of the time they're on the roof uh no they're in the fire station all right oh yeah i say loadout behind us stuff i'm running in i've not seen anyone else or maybe we should get um uav let's do it yeah okay i'll get it if you want around [Applause] i'm still holding the fire station dude [Applause] yeah same place same place on top of the building hit him a couple of times still being i mean is it just one one guy yeah i mean um we've got two guys on airport roof as well i mean we can push me if you want yeah i feel like we can take this guy [Applause] it's just we're not gonna i don't have any needs or anything so yeah [Music] i mean i just don't know what else to do it's like we could just sit around and get positioning again yeah yeah let's just go back uh maybe guess you get self-rest still [Applause] this loadout's still here yeah yeah you get self respect [Applause] that might be the key to winning [Applause] and then can you are you oh can pass me i'll get you i can get in hey and on the top of superstore yeah on top of superstar and then the top of there we've got one underground floor what's that soupy guy he'll be on his own i think probably he's now now he's in the middle uh no he's on our level he's down he's downstairs yeah round four he's just sitting there though is there a ghosted guy on him no i don't think no no no no no right here ready ready ready go he's gone in the left side left [Applause] yeah he was right there unless it was a late ping [Music] maybe around to know this yeah yeah right on top of us right he's on top he's on top yeah sliding around you went up the ladder i think no the wild goose chase yep 30 meters he's now over there on the roof i'm moving hey hey i just i just didn't see us i don't know if you saw us i think he did he's now just waiting on the leather just literally sitting on the leather he's not on beat though anymore okay yeah we can push that up him oh let's start [Music] checking gaze right side right side [Applause] oh no dude dude he they made a bit he actually then are you stuck to the ladder what were they doing i don't know so there was one with ghosts yeah but um yeah he he jumped down and then got stuck in the ladder and just yeah it was not good for him yeah and that's that sounds so close but it's just not so weird all right [Applause] all right so now still no money holy crap man this was the guy we were chasing jack this is him right here for ages this is the guy that literally was like on the roof jumped through that they have red eyes what the hell is that about just the skin that's weird dude that's the guy we've been chasing since a while back that guy wait wait wait wait wait wait for the wait for the pool oh he's going to go there's two surprise again we'll see them very often one here can't even enemies in the area yeah i've seen them both i mean we could push together knowing we have our loadouts that's the third one now what the hell do you want to go maybe we take this building instead so we um hold them out so we're not actually pushing them but we're just holding them someone just raised a pd [Applause] do we push pd first do you think um or just hold this is the smart player yeah yeah quality i'm just showing me itv atv nice job nice job jack come maybe i'm gonna run to the other side of the boat and go up the stairs he shot another team but it's okay something on pd i'm going upstairs no but maybe ghosted no they're surely not these are the guys that landed surely still being beamed from fire station jack they've got a sniper on fire station oh yeah and they're just hoping it finishes with them uh people pushing me with a bounty but no wait they must be ghosted yet yep if they're red and i can't see them they're in the building i think okay i don't hear any footsteps yet if you hear me shooting just peek over and look at the ladder okay then okay though maybe then maybe they are still in that fire station as well [Applause] enemy uav overhead okay [Applause] this is a interesting one i'll tell ya [Applause] can i be me from that roof yeah they're beaming you from the right roof as well jack yeah two there on a bike bike yeah and they just pulled up on a bike went into car dealership all right we can always retreat to the other building it's just like i don't want to run up there they're fighting in there moving position careful of fire station that shooting yes we can get the roof of that if you want i don't know if you want the kills i don't think we want the push i know it's just like it's so tempting i think yeah yeah this is good this skit is perfect so we sit on this roof and then we jump over to this roof once we're done and we hold them in at least as long as they get beamed which we probably will it's still fine i mean that's the thing though you you can stay on the roof because even if you get headshot by a sniper don't i wouldn't even bother um armor playing until you want to move [Applause] they're running across now oh god over here as well remember spaghetti [Applause] someone just landed here on pd that's that pdf the problem is we don't want to take too many fights and then run out of um wait so i've only got one left dude i've got a couple i can give you yeah i think we i think we maybe no we don't have enough money to buy plates either so whoever's on pd i think has the actual like goated position [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] whoa yeah i don't know where that guy is in the building my bottom floor window yeah [Applause] he's coming in the building yeah i'm a bit okay but you keep reading [Music] he's down there 11 meters oh there's a guy there's going pd as well let's roll skin and this guy is gonna maybe we have to push him together jack are you on drop hold on let me just check how many just one i can go first and reach out if you want ready yeah go go go i can't get down okay good good good i couldn't get down the roof dude [Laughter] right you got one play two play lovely right should we start making our way to the back of the garages i think that's the only thing we can do i suppose the saving grace is that like other squads will be in the same position as us like they won't have plates yeah but these guys are in look i mean i'm just going to go down the stairs i think no down time time time time don't jump off him i think you can do that without the shoot yeah yeah again no plates there is cash i'm gonna get cash i have to we're in here just in case we can get plates [Applause] are we in here yeah just about yeah next play kind of ruins us though i suppose you got a gas mask i've got a mask i do i do i do so what you think we push really late uh into pd they're gonna be funny play though aren't there there's so many dudes look how many solos there are yeah there's a lot it'll be awesome pd team and then everyone else will be solo i'd say we take the bottom building of uh pd on left side i could get maybe i could get one run one cover maybe or i want to get plates i want to buy plates oh yeah so give me the money for playbox we're going to be on that uav we're in factory as well plate works plate box plate box pushing now actually now plate box is going down here hey boxes they're shooting someone else yeah that's fine go play box thank you yes we still got gas masks as well [Applause] yeah for the footsteps biscuits nothing on heartbeat straight i'm gonna have to push in now [Applause] upstairs yeah just chill dude yeah yeah eight left oh yeah yeah yeah right um you wanna guess my specialty yeah let's go around the back of uh garages this is good everyone else should fight each other whilst we're sitting here okay oh god [Applause] they're in a bad situation there dude let's go oh my god well played we needed this we needed this we did my god great game 8k damage that's a lot of damage the thing is though in this kind of game mode you are going to get a lot of damage because the hell's higher so so sweaty this i mean it is also that was definitely like full mouse keyboards ttvs look at the tcv's there's a lot of tv everyone's in a clan as well most people are so now we get our calling card was it worth it um [Music]
