hi everyone and welcome to the halo infinite tech preview i just got access to this on pc so i thought that we'd jump in play a couple matches go over everything in the settings the customization and just get some first impressions and see what it's all about so with that said we're going to jump into a match straight away play a game see how it goes right here we go so this is really exciting because this is the first time in a long time that a halo game will release on pc the same time as it releases on console and we are in i'm gonna pick up that battle rifle straight away oh my god they're rushing me so at the moment you can only play against bots they're using this as a bit of a test for their ai i think they're gonna enable real matches in the next few days on the preview but i'm sure that they're going to take all that data they record use it in a good way to improve how the bots are how the ai systems work that's some equipment isn't it drop wall so this will give me a bit of protection from this side and i can shoot out of it but the enemies can't shoot into it without breaking it so let me just try and kill this part here see how it's turned red now so if the enemy broke it like that i could get shot through this but i can still use it as a little window kind of thing if i wanted um the frame rate doesn't feel great on first impression i have to be honest it feels like i'm getting maybe 60 70 fps i'm playing on a 240 hertz monitor here got a 30 90 graphics card and an amd 5950x cpu so it's pretty high spec system that i'm running oh my god i just got heated i'll try the assault rifle for a bit i think the power weapon spawns there whether that's a sniper or something new but yeah fear the mouse doesn't feel great on first impression and that frame rate as well i think obviously it's a very early test this is and the game is not until what october november so i'm sure there's a ton of optimization to do wonder if there's a is there a frame rate counter or anything fps car there we go see what we get yeah look 60 that doesn't feel good so when i look at the ground 80. yeah obviously there's a lot of optimization needed to be done here i'm sure they'll nail it and you know they're looking for feedback on this type of thing so there's a bit of feedback for you my plasma pistol here let's charge this up get someone's shield off right that pistol very nice these bots don't mess around [Music] i want to see if i can get the sniper [Music] oh man these sounds it feels so good to be playing a new halo game man honestly i'm over the moon with this it's there okay sniper give it give it dude 10 seconds that's a real player unless they've programmed the bots to teabag which i don't think they do so you're with real people but you're against bots okay we got the sniper hopefully we can get a kill with it oh nice hit with a noscope condolence postcard dispatched to enemy family that's the 50 isn't it beautiful where those bots at found them oh yeah coming up with the back rage remote dead nation it's so good to hear that announcer again i mean the pistol is just the best isn't it get those 10 shots and there it is we got the victory and it is only just bots but gives you a good idea of how the game plays how it feels now in another section of the game it's the academy and this is really to teach people how to play the game newcomers with it being free to play for multiplayer there's going to be a lot of new people playing this game so they're adding weapon drills and different training modules i think at the moment all you can do are the the firing range kind of thing and there's different difficulties here so let's go with the commando three levels the first level they just stood still the enemies the second they're moving a bit and the third they're doing your typical combat behaviors where they'll be strafing around ducking that kind of thing they won't be shooting at you but let's jump into it here and see how we do i assume there'll be a loading screen here when the game's out properly there we go pick up that commando take down your targets quickly i'm trying my best to take down the targets quickly this does a lot of damage all right you can just full auto this there we go see how they've highlighted the players as well when you do damage to them they've got different zones on them they flash depending on where you hit them see the headshot is quite different isn't it when you're hitting different parts of the body that's neat that it gives you a bit of feedback as a player to know okay right i'm definitely registering in that area where i'm aiming six seconds can we get this one and another one i thought you'd be dead three come on one more one yeah we got it nice how did we do fantastic showcase of skill is that a triple yeah we got three stars maybe they'll add more difficulty levels down the line cool right now we're going to take a look at the settings in the game and go through some of the customization and i'm glad to see that we do have a fov slider here i typically go around 100 value borderless full screen okay so it doesn't look like that we can have a proper full screen mode which is a bit disappointing maybe that's why the mouse felt a bit weird so i know that a lot of microsoft xbox games on pc don't have proper full screen mode for some reason but i'd love to see that because it can feel a bit janky sometimes with input lag change the minimum frame rate change the maximum frame rate all the way up to 240 uncut frame rates very nice decent off all of your individual graphics settings here i think mine's pretty much maxed out there as much as it can be for this motion blur get that off screen shake off okay well there's a ton of customization here already full screen effects exposure we'll leave that on for now speed lines it can be like sonic can i sharpening i don't want any of that i'll turn off those speed lines as well so plenty of customization there in the graphics audio all sorts of stuff you can change there very nice ui okay so you can just turn the hood on and off if you want change the opacity oh man i mean this is a chromatic aberration yeah we don't know blue no goodbye i'm kind of impressed that they're letting you turn all this stuff off accessibility options always good to have very nice keyboard and mouse of course we want a bit of deep customization here mouse sensitivity setting here turn that up a little bit we've got different settings as well for variable zoom rates which is good if you want a sniper that's got a slower sensitivity do that mouse acceleration that's off by default i love that you could probably remap the controller as well if you wanted to and finally we're going to take a look at the customization in the game because there's all sorts of stuff you can change here you can customize so many things from the way that your spartan looks to the way the weapons are we've got the mark 7 armor here looks like that's the only one available for now we can mod it oh man we've got all sorts of different base colors that we can choose oh my god there's so many those ones are locked at the moment go for that bumble bee yellow for now different style helmets visors oh my god this is so cool chess pieces yeah this is uh pretty insane left shoulder right shoulder gloves wrists hip knee pads check out the knee pads oh baby to unlock some of those in the future so all sorts of customization there for your sparse and the way they look and then we've got the weapon bench as well you can cycle through all the different guns in the game let's go with the sniper also give this a different coasting not much there for now but from what i recall you can actually get different skins for these in the battle pass so we'll take a look at those in a little bit vehicle bay oh there's the warthog scorpion i mean you can literally customize all the things by the looks of it yeah the body and the ai as well right okay so that's i guess your typical male female just changes the the hips and the tummy a little bit there choose prosthesis left leg this is pretty insane the ai model as well different types of personalities for your ai do you want a happy one on a cheek you on one that's going to insult you you can also change the color of the ai let's go with pink why not equip that one presentation customize your emblem announcer voice service tags that's disabled for now so we can't look at that if we go to the shop they do actually give you some currency here battle pass is available right so that did just remove the currency and i think i have that now quite a couple skins as well why not like the bundle i'm very working progress at the moment obviously boost and swap pack xp boost pro forma helmet there buy all the things and then when you bought those things you can apply them to your guns here in the customization different closing options that we've just unlocked so there we have it as of today i think that's everything that's in the technical preview for halo infinite i believe that their intention is to add more and more as time goes on so in the next couple days we may be able to play against real players do some proper matchmaking more customization options i'm really looking forward to getting stuck in with that so there we go a new halo game it's on the cards it's coming this holiday i'm excited and i think this is a good start a few technical problems for sure but that's the point of this right get people in early get feedback optimize add things remove things whatever it might be so i'm glad that 343 are doing this and letting people get hands-on before releasing the hope that when it does release when it does come out it's pretty solid and that's all guys thank you for watching do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more
