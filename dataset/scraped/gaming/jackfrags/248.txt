you may or may not know the name brendan green but you will have heard of his alias player unknown and the little game that he created called playerunknown's battlegrounds pubg and in turn the battle royale genre took off like no one really anticipated and in a very short space of time pubg became a huge game almost a sudden phenomenon these days though in my opinion i'd say that it's fallen from grace a little bit perhaps there weren't enough updates and improvements to the game when they were really needed and you could definitely say that the game didn't evolve with the times battle royale as a game mode or a genre has moved forward quite a lot but pubg didn't really change all that much and by the time new content came at a faster rate it was perhaps a little too late for some a lot of western audiences have moved on to other games that were inspired by pubg like fortnite or call of duty war zone apex legends and it would definitely be hard for pubg to entice those players back i just don't think it would happen so why are we talking about this today well i actually wanted to talk about player unknown himself as just this week he's announced that he's leaving crafton the company that published pubg and he's formed his own studio called player unknown productions what's interesting though is that crafton has funded the studio which is formed from around 25 team members that have already been working together for some time and crafton has allowed green to take the team with him to the new studio and in turn crafton keeps pub g what's really interesting about this is what the team is working on venturebeat published a fantastic article breaking all of this down and it's a lot more detailed and elaborate than i'll put forward in this video and if you want to go and read it i have linked it down in the description below so this new game and game engine that they're creating is proprietary tech and it's called the entity component system or ecs don't focus on the name too much as it doesn't exactly roll off the tongue the studio wanted an engine that was fit for purpose and could work for their ambitions but they couldn't find one now that may surprise you because there are some fantastic game engines out there currently but what green needed was scale and i'm talking serious scale to put this into context erengel that's the original pubg map is eight kilometers by eight kilometers and it is considered to be a fairly big map but prologue which is the project that the team are working on now using their new tech is aiming to be 64 kilometers by 64 kilometers when you really put that into context you start to appreciate the scale that they're going for here and this could mean huge things for potential battle royale games in the future but that's not their ultimate goal though their goal is to recreate an entire world now i appreciate how crazy that sounds but we'll get on to that soon as green himself has said it's clearly not feasible for an artist to create and populate an entire 64 kilometer squared world bit by bit it would take a considerable amount of time it's not just about placing assets down in the right spots it's about creating those assets as well with this in mind the team decided to lean towards ai and while the ai isn't going to replace human designers the hope is that it will make the gargantuan task ahead of them much easier the idea is to strike a balance between real user-generated content and machine learning and while ai will automatically create a lot of the content there is a lot more to it than that the first stage was building a terrain tool to generate and fill these massive worlds with content after that you need to fill the world with life using ai and of course you would need things for the player to do he even spoke of adding in 100 000 players i didn't just get that number wrong that's what they've said the original idea of prologue was to really show off the terrain technology you would have this huge map and the player's goal was simple you just have to get to the other side of course there would be weather and some other stumbling blocks but it would be a case of a simple sandbox game leveraging the tech after thinking it over a bit more though the team decided it just wouldn't make for a good or interesting experience so they've stripped back the experience and instead will release it as a tech demo when it's ready with a system allowing you to pay for it whatever you want now this isn't a short-term project either right now the team haven't finished the engine and so they're utilizing tools from unity to create initial game assets earlier i briefly mentioned the idea of creating the world 2 or at least a world of sorts the concept of that seems quite far-fetched if i'm honest at least one that you could walk around if you look at something like microsoft flight simulator well they've created the world in essence and they're detailing it with satellite data to make each and every area look and feel realistic they've shown that it's possible but that's only flying around it and walking around it are two different things the level of detail required for that sort of experience is completely different and naturally way harder to achieve if not almost impossible but project artemis here aims to create a world with a radius exceeding 6 000 kilometers and they want to use prologue as a test bed of sorts the difference between prologue and artemis is that artemis would look more like a real planet such as our own and it would have different biomes terrains animals plants a whole living world green loves the idea of a player not being restricted by boundaries like you are in most games at some point or another in current games you will come to the end of the playable space and this technology is attempting to make that a thing of the past the notion that you could find a spot in the game that no other player has passed through ever it's a great idea and an exciting one at least in theory after reading the article i think that green sees himself as making a sandbox for players and he mentions rust as a good example of that oddly he says that he doesn't want to make video games he wants to make the tools to allow others to create their own games inside his world and i think that hawks back to the initial conception of pubg which originally started as a battle royale mod for armor so for example if players wanted to create a battle rail experience within his world that'd be totally cool in fact he said that he wants to start simple and he did mention battle royale king of the hill other similar mods as examples of how to give players the tools that they need to create their own experiences as i mentioned pubg the origins of that i think the team wants as many tools as possible available for the end user without having to delve into code or programming or have modding experience at all sandbox in its tourist form and on an extremely large scale we haven't even touched on multiplayer yet either and that's because the studio hasn't really talked about it they've decided that that will be the last thing they tackle prologue will be a single player experience but the goal for artemis is to be massively multiplayer the team have decided though that with all of the advancements in multiplayer technology happening every single year and given the time frame of the project they can work on that later down the line all in all though it seems that there's a lot of time and work still to be done on these projects to get them out there and green hopes that we'll be able to see some of prologue soon and has made it clear that this entire project is a long-term one he expects that it could take five years or even more to get this technology to where it needs to be we have to admit though that the scope is impressive but if it can be realized or not is something different entirely games have evolved so much even over the past 10 years so what's to say that they can't evolve that further in another ten the idea of having a planet-sized world there's actually just one whole game with multiple communities hundreds of thousands of players and unique experiences at every turn is a concept that we can only dream of but maybe with this tech could be a reality one day maybe one day we'll see a battle rail game that has a thousand players in each match and if it were a solo match one player out of 1000 could win imagine being that person pretty exciting times and that's all do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below and i would advise you to go check out that article by venturebeat as well because there's a ton of stuff in there that i left out
