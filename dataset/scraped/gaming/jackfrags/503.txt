hello everyone and welcome back to more call of duty warzone today we're going to be playing with the tactical brit mr pro westy and study and i'm going to be using a couple of new loadouts that i put together the first one is the ram 7 with the spr and the ram 7 is really interesting because study told me that if you use this canted hybrid here it gives you the most recall reduction i haven't tried this out myself yet but it's going to be really interesting to use that and see if it actually does make a difference and i don't really have any kills with that site i think because if you go to the customize and look at the reticle off unlock nothing because i'm not really a fan of that but if it's really good in terms of beaming people then yeah okay i'm in you know maybe you'd want to unlock a few of these different ones that one looks quite nice and the blue one at the end as well so we'll be using the ram seven and also the spr is the secondary i haven't really touched the spr in a while if i'm taking a sniper it's the hdr but they fixed the sbr they changed it from instant hit scan and this is the build that we're going to be rocking today i've gone with like a green tiger camo too and i've got the forest camo on the ram seven with that said we're gonna have fun today it's gonna be good great group these guys and i'm looking forward let's see if we can get some wins and it should be uh it should be great let's see if everyone's ready it'll be use this hello hello let's go baby yeah let's kill one let's go you want to go let's go baby oh i just saw the skin you were talking about westie the nicktown one mate that was sick which is this in the store in the barracks yeah it's in the store in the store it's cool yeah it's a bit it's a bit nutty it it feels like it should have been a halloween skin to be honest oh the scarecrow yeah man it's also got a nice uh as val skin on it it's like the only other as val skin in the game at the moment it's like it's like rose rose reversed yes it is if they made a really light version of warzone he would be the character to play what's the what's the gun it's is val ah that's actually really nice yeah ma'am right oh that looks sick this barrel looks amazing yeah that is a nice one but it's not a barrel you'd use no you need the oso barrel it's the wrong barrel it's not the right one all right cool let's have fun um are you using usbr stud um norma norma or the least bullet drop normie max normie max yeah the extra damage one doesn't it's literally it's basically just feels like an hdr but with faster everything yeah i just changed mine i had the lapua in yeah lapura was good before when it was hit scanned but now that it's back to uh no it's working as intended no it's actually the way it's supposed to be yeah it's just yeah now pepperoni hello in the chat everyone how you doing what's up jaggy slap cat advantage what a great name yeah so we are streaming a bit earlier in the day today usually on live in the uk evening time but i thought you know let's do it earlier today a bigger fun with it should be good also if you pick anything up in the cod store all right that's enough [ __ ] you consider using my code jack frags in all caps had a little graphics made there let's do this [Music] jacob from sweden how are you doing right first game where are we going poor you want to go poor that's the solid port yeah okay it's treated as well the last few weeks before i'll be honest all right decent amount of loot paul is an undercover bank i feel like a lot of people are going to drop here now look see look no one's here they're all waiting for you know sweaty store or whatever sweat leah [Applause] yeah i don't see too many i see shots over the back over here there's a lot of people at prison enemy team is tracking your location that doesn't surprise me ah they're quite far away aren't they somebody's [ __ ] yeah let's do it [Applause] give me no i'm seeing some crouch sliding why does that bison look like an mp5 oh no oh yeah i have that bug as well i got a vehicle over the other side of the road [Applause] right okay still threat to is it that with the squad is that our bounty i think it must be because like the threat level's high enough yeah it's got to be [Applause] if we grab it and chuck it over the back of the logs then it gives us a bit of cover hopefully they don't run over got my cash yeah more money money money yeah a lot right down over here or something i'm off this way from the 800. i need plates too yeah yeah shut them out well let me pick it up though you're not alone let's start do you use the the big sight on this or do you use the small screen you use the big size big one okay so it's basically just a bok alternative i do not like the default reticle though let me know it is it is horrible yeah on the grind you can go and unlock blue dot you get you get a nice one at 200 kills but it's 200 kills so i've yellow blue dot i've got blue dot holographic and blue dot uh reflex now yeah we're not doing the doof do today guys unless we absolutely have to we're not going to do it it feels kind of cheap so i just wanted to do that one video on the doof doof um not seen anyone is it just one guy or one no i think it's multiple right i've got i've got my vrk i might run in there you do fire shotgun today stud oh yeah fine yeah i don't know if i should do the doof doof again i don't know man well have you have you done a video on the a big video on the doof tooth yeah last night only guy i've seen only guy i've seen okay i'm creeping around i hear them on my left stun running through with the dude a mini do a mini dude okay wow okay [Applause] and he's dead he came in with their doof at the end the downtown saved your ass oh my god see that coming it's one by one it's a wave well we bought them we won they go they're dead so you you've got vlk with dragon ball franks is that what you're doing yeah so what's the difference between that and the doof do well because the deep dupe is worse that's just a doof then it's a yeah it's a mini dude i caught a mini dude right a singular dude uh and then jack do you want surprise yeah sure we're inside keep your eyes open okay right there's a king at prison no he's just hanging out okay all right that's right oh player going into prison and i haven't used the sbr

why not the doofus does anybody even need anything before we go or uh no i think i'm good so i need some ammo but i'll pick some up on the way it's all good i shall loot diet dude i like that one a diet that's a good zero [Laughter] a doof without the consequence oh there we go i know this one is the one with the consequence because if you miss the single shot you die they're on top of the uh

bloody train why do you think he was changed what did he do i don't know i just i died instantly could it be a bit of um damage stacking you know i mean he could get a better latency yeah i guess so

silence there two kings yeah we we actually kind of need to hold where we are to be honest with you because it's still very unfinished well it's just that we're in a massive disadvantage if it ends up moving over the other we have to cross yeah well we can cross right right yeah he's gonna i think it's gonna go the other side i said we go across now to be honest with you but we could take like over here maybe yeah all the way to the right all the way to the right yeah don't get off the side i think i've got my ghost slowed down i can't remember yeah i think you do watch out i feel like there might be someone here still i wouldn't be surprised if there is [Applause] that king is like he was on top of the white building there's a good set of rocks here relocating lovely set of rocks man

you so much does the tactical brit sound like joe wilkinson or is it just me a little bit mother-son yeah lorenzo became a new member thank you lorenzo uh john love catching a stream with you lads much love from new york he's zach in he's hacking mate so is he can you put up the graphics it's ugly mate i like playing on low just because you get more fps and you can see better it doesn't really matter to me if the game looks ugly or not i'm more about the competitive and the gameplay rather than the graphics hey robert what's up colin murphy how are you doing not a fan of the iron sights no i don't really like him michael on the uh insta if you want to see the ram loadout go to the start of the video you can skip along on the timeline you should be able to sean thank you for becoming a member that's very kindly man yeah sometimes that it's it's a bug i think that happens where like you see the textures are a bit better now for some reason if you change your graphic stains and then load into a game it just makes everything look like potato i mean i do have it on low but matt thank you for the 10 tremendous about respect for your positive attitude and avoid being toxic i think fire team is like the test server for new warzone i don't think so i think fire team was just an experiment maybe at some point in development they were like okay we've gotta make the new warzone but

glazed ham you're a honey glazed ham outstanding i'm i'm feeling this dual sense five with a passion right now we looking at blue buildings they're still in here they're in here here you want to push them together with the doofs if you can hold your position the way it's checking [Applause] [Applause] i marked that one on the road over there i'm coming over yeah they're fighting in this building right here i could just go behind them uh i think they've run away jack i'm catching all the rooms wait hang on no that's still close 32 meters one player okay going in footsteps footsteps over here yeah in here 11 meters [Applause] unless they're in here checking the rooms roof red roof [Applause] on one live thing yeah there's another guy what's next below us oh that's me oh that made it good trying to get down are they opposite us yeah i think they're opposites moving here is he there on green guys a guy on purple there's a guy it's a um uh what's the word i'm looking for ghost skin bro go skin yeah oh i couldn't make it no we are what do you think they're in i'll be yeah there's two in here there's two in there 23 meters they're in there an air strike from the red building from the red building in that airstrike hello right there right there oh inside yeah he's literally there he must have come up behind i'm a cross in the other building now damn it he must have just come upstairs because i checked that room survive and you can redeploy why is my arm glowing is it my watch [Applause] that's quite cool watching that return to the front line all right pistols let's go you're up soldier okay that was easy let's get him off you gave him a proper sword [Applause] right i think that's it i think that's it did you get them yeah yeah loads of satchels up here we can run i think there's still a guy in this building somewhere over here yeah there was a guy on red roof he was over here a little while ago he might have gone though he might have moved away he jumped down i murdered him but he was chasing someone else i haven't seen that person yet killed me there are so many plates satchels it's everywhere there's a lot of all the gear many ideas there's a gas mask if you want i think there is somebody maybe on the stairs or something not entirely sure okay so much ammo this is insane how much gear do you need somebody's doing a recon uh back towards train training oh i mean we had a lot of fighting here should we move on yeah move back to train route i'm gonna grab a cell phone before we go oh yeah that's a good shot that's a good shot we can probably all get self-resistance yeah we have big big pps at the moment there's money 12k there fathom and there's no one here yeah that's fine people here i'd rather we had the uav and we knew there was no one there is a recon that was activated really close like within a 200 meters so perry legs hello sherry hey jamie ram is better than the amax close range yeah i think the ram doesn't have the best tck out of all the assault rifles or maybe the asphalt beats it i'm not sure your watch is bugged it allows you to see enemies through walls i don't know what that means but if that's true then that's ridiculous [Applause] hey brad you missed the streams hey cena been looted stay sharp what's up guys thank you for coming along mid game here had a couple of fights already i think we're going to move on see if we can get in some more trouble [Applause] we are going hard in the pain [Applause] but no stock m4 is working out well oh it's still an m4 it's aggressive that's what it is it's aggressive this aggressive and for maybe stick my oh man none of that should we head over to here uh do we need we can go further and i guess we need some action don't worry i think that rooftop is going to be a banger we didn't see any wait hang on uav or nah yeah no we can't afford it no we need six or 200 more all right okay we just gotta be careful coming through because boneyard on the left team could be pushing across the bones yeah i think the tower is a good shot though because you know everybody from the north is gonna crash into it so the north yeah from the north where they didn't fry everything anything is that what they do in the middle of the bars everything fingers okay i'm kind of used to the auto tactical sprint now are you oh you've turned that on yeah been using it for a couple days i just feel quicker like i feel like i can do better in close range gunfights yeah because you're just instantly picking up speed aren't you you just slide around like a mad lad and if you've got the doof thief especially uh jack i'm gonna drop 1400 on by okay so you want me to get a loader airstrike i've already got an airplane somebody else can hold it i'll just leave it there for the next team also i'm not running ar or shotgun so if anybody needs that i got loads i'm good got my snipe and my m4 [Applause] we're good shots firing towards superstore i think oh uh rez over here on orange res

is closing in relocating the safe zone right five teams so that's uh 13 people left oh shots to the left i'm pushing a little bit yeah yeah for sure i mean do we haven't given anything building mono yeah just keep checking nothing nothing on heart [Applause] i'm screwed on the left in the plane damn it nice that's such a dirty spot that is well i mean they're just covering us on there yeah good there's a guy oh another one am i right another one on my right in the tunnel yeah watch out he's going down in here moving here no i could have finished that's fine it's fine we just need to focus on getting in maybe this is tdm basically ground war now shot from behind oh my god [Applause] what where are these people coming from one dead night i'm done no different teams that's the guy that got me getting just revenge lucky what the hell happened to your controller oh my god are you there lucky you'll be there in a minute he's joinable i'm surprised that he made it that far to be honest he was so funny it's just strafing across the field and no one shot him he lit i think he died to the gas that's the new mess strap i i looked down i realized that my braided usb-c cable was downstairs i was like [Applause] i legged it down the stairs came back up and then when i plugged it back in bottom warfare was like your controller doesn't exist mate you're on keyboard and mouse go to the main menu oh no no no no dude i was going off as well i had 11 kills before that third circle are we joining on here are you joining me i need an invite i am on you i'm all over you oh bloody hell i've sent you an invite i don't understand what happened to the controller as it died it was like it just got whatever your last input was it was going to indeed kept everything for a good five minutes strafing along a field and then you see it directly in the middle of the field on the screen he was doing like 360s and pinging everything you were jumping up and down at one stage the controller is just like jumping up and down and that was a rough second game there towards the end we just got pushed and pushed running into the burn zone like that as well late and you're not set up you're gonna get fried and we did we did get fried it was good fun that's the ram loadout that we go with it's that thing there apparently the counted hybrid that reduces the recoil to the maximum amount that's why i'm testing out with the spr as well i don't usually use the spr since they uh since they fixed it jack your watch yeah what about it great game it's always a sweaty day on uh on warzone dave rash uh vincent thank you for the 200. you've been watching since 2016 love you thank you man very kind vincent get yourself sorted what's up how are you doing at low settings just for frame rate and visibility [Applause] yeah smoke grenades would have been good then the flambe i mean who takes smoke grenades in their loadouts right you know they are very situational [Applause] we got fried it was good fun yeah you gotta you gotta look at the positive things right it doesn't matter it's all good a landlocked pirate recognize the name you're just about to go and wash the car but the stream happened now you got a good excuse landlocked matthew thank you for becoming a new member and player number 109 thank you what's up cod addicts hey tesco i don't use any game filters little lags pc today we're all playing on pc but lachlan's playing on a controller battle royale you've got gas closing in fast get to the cycle oh i see what you're saying twisty so you're saying that when you wear that watch people can see you through the walls yeah maybe i should turn it off for the next game hey ty saw what's up graphic does look nice didn't it you made it sir there you go you crashed how are you coming i just immune and that's the first thing that i heard right they're all in he was literally one shot if they survived oh i couldn't survive that last one damn it put two pistol kills down and one pistol kill two pistol kills yeah there's so many people around me right now i hate it yeah i have dead silence on they still found me i'm just gonna chill in here for a bit okay i'm gonna come back down oh get the just gather my belongings is there anybody else there's so many people here enemy uav might be able to be might be able to beam your teammate is ready [Applause] and that's bound hey watch out cam because there's multiple people here still all right i'll come to you jack i come to you i'm above you i'm above you i'm landing on the roof they're still in the train station okay [Applause] i'm coming down here want an rpg and a shotgun camera oh yeah yeah there's loadouts claymore as well yeah i wish we had enough money right now to get a load up oh yeah here he's gone in the garage just rpg time get it boys oh [Applause] all right run at them blindly come on be in the truck no i don't think so on the reason i just throw him on the roof i think i just throw him in the roof he's dead and there's another player dropping in on uh um train station roof another player in the window oh okay i was so far behind that corner whatever where let's can we save you yeah he's on trade station he's just shooting out the window come over oh oh oh oh okay i'm pushing i think guys yeah on studs it's all right they chose to push probably yeah it's fine there's a player upstairs in the room i don't understand it just appeared out of nowhere absolute magic how the hell do i have no ar a vehicle vehicle vehicle pulling off pulling off yeah we should buy some plates maybe repositioning he's dead teamwork that's chaotic that was great i enjoyed that we had fun as well yeah we still have enough money up here you might have something not plates either a couple more armor dropped your couple plates there mate oh yes proper nice rocks there man i've got about five grand okay ryo thanks for becoming a phantom the best it's confirmed it's confirmed [Applause] who doesn't love ruining a man he's actually crossing we could probably ambush him uh yeah disney could be great it will be great there should be people maybe still in this area i don't know king's fighting someone coming over car coming over i'm coming it's backing away come on come on i hear a crate i hear a crack i think it was uh twins i think we can we we're literally like a few hundred off yeah we're not far away big big watercash let's go let's do it lots and lots of pogba's lots of doggers there she is lots of pogs carol kirkwood on a saturday afternoon oh it's sunday isn't it right even better give me monies he's going over he's going over [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] good job more money please what a buddy please thank you oh he had a doubt if i would have died probably yeah and that was um who took my um stopping by there you go and i'll buy some plights yeah that's what i was going for we are on edge of uh edge of zone so people coming from boneyard we probably stand a good chance of killing those guys yeah i just got sniped from behind from the hill club nice place that guy's down as well that was another sniper let's go baby there's an atv come in okay that's the end of that was that a full team wipe yes yep hey wait hang on a minute i didn't get a kill for the guy that i downed so did they oh and one still there there's the other guy that you [Applause] [Music] this is where the king was this is the king i killed her okay there's maybe one more then should i pop a uav this is the guy this is the guy i shot wesley so oh did i not get a kill for the king maybe not maybe not i killed the king i killed the king lulu thank you for becoming a member and did i miss one there going in hold on he's in cemetery let's go yeah the doof doof is the r9 guys because it goes when you fire it it's like do do break break that's that's why you call it the doof dude basically that makes sense can we reach this uh lucky yeah jump up the stairs um by going up on the fence here on the outside and then jump on stairs oh cool that's right extreme and then just cross over here oh oh no i coughed oh no don't know we're here that is rona found right all right let's go [Applause] until you die so you've got slightly reduced vision now yeah it's fun let's go yeah here's the round that we're using [Applause] today that's the site you're supposed to use this one though to get the recoil reduction rather than that one well you can switch to that for closer that's the one although i cannot stand that that looks horrible to me this actually hasn't been expensive [Applause] yeah you want to go for a walk oh wait i i want i want uh self press if we can muster it uh i can drive your cash study can you muster the funds i'm once again asking for your financial support i really am again come on come on stop likes his fans let's get it done oh my god look at that our bounty's all the way over at port why the hell is that the nearest person to us then probably let's just keep going someone died on that train [Applause] that's the guy we've got to kill he's on a crane he's on a crane over at port he's literally on a crane i reckon we could do it lads do you want to get a vehicle uh yeah if you want i don't know yeah even if we get all the way over there by the time we start fighting we've got no chance truck sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah where's he going he's going to go four by four land oh god we've given away our position good come kill us please i don't see anybody nearby to be honest with you they just cut out and started shooting over police [Applause] coming up behind you jack someone did their loadouts here mp5s look at that we could go um let's go let's go for the normal should we go for the killings repositioning oh there's ammo in here if people need [Applause] oh self-rest kit oh such a shame vehicle [Applause] uh vehicle again the boundary selects the person who didn't have a bounty on right okay so uh that was the nearest person without bounty the bunty as you called it the other day enemy team is tracking your location yeah i could do with a few more armor plates to be honest i could drop yourself if you want i do have a plate box that i can put down at the top of the building yeah all right yeah [Applause] down that one [Applause] he's self present this is just one repositioning mark's a bit better donovan for the round seven that's why i'm using it i don't know how they will be able to balance cold war guns with modern warfare guns dusty phantom what they're gonna do is make war zone versions of those guns if that makes sense so they're not just going to copy-paste the gun from cold war and put it in this game so it won't have the same stats it will be balanced specifically for war zone it will have a war zone model it will have war zone animations so even though the gunners come from cold war really from a statistical standpoint it's got nothing to do with that game [Applause] what's that one just came up i'm coming up the stairs [Applause] anybody got an airstrike or anything yeah wherefore uh trump tower oh no don't sorry don't lose those plates watch out for those wrist rockets waiting for the snipe in three two one trump did you kill the ground stadium no no just over there i killed one i got one bounce on stadium sorry no crack right now [Applause] nice oh they've gone over the brow with it they're gonna get rest no who sits on stadium in 2020 someone rest on the buy at stadium pounds northwest small calories he's going to rest right here difficult to see with that skull yeah what scope you got the spr solo zero okay yeah it's kind of warning can you zoom in further yeah you have to get the variable scope for that oh there's actually a sniper on another hill closer to him again take cover i'm off that's from stadium oh i didn't even get that i didn't even get that yeah didn't get the notification for that at all he's down the one closer lucky yeah yeah [Applause] enemy mark hopefully don't get beamed here oh no no no no no no no [Music] [Applause] you're inside bastard lucky if we drop you some cash we can uh get an airstrike maybe just finish this yeah yeah yeah good job we're just gonna be doing this all day [Applause] i can finish here i can finish it's all right i'm here all right let's go there's this cash okay he might let's go baby got him as he was hitting the right more more snipes yeah still from trump tower more caliber oh my god buildings downwards close buildings [Applause] [Applause] brilliant yeah screw those guys like yeah it's just a sniper battle yeah there's no way we're going to win because you can't finish anyone off they drop below the light uh the lift of the building don't matter they [Applause] just got spanked from the top of one of those buildings from that far away i mean this building we definitely should hold based on the yeah zone a strong building you reckon this is gonna go stadium yeah it'll go that way yeah go that way here i love that you call that trump tower mates around i think they are yeah [Applause] right here kilo downs just saw him jack yeah he's cracked i think got that guy he uh came back in to try and get his gear still there [Applause] on trump in there in there lower close building it's one of the guys is is trump is trump clear now pretty much uh nobody's peaked oh wait hold up there we go let me know if you get down on trump oh i'll track it that's right over here where i thought i heard a truck oh there's an enemy uav up uav definitely here's some i can hear someone firing suppressed shots yeah okay still 30 people left so plenty of that yeah this is a really campy zone though this i people aren't going to move for a little bit they're going there's a guy there okay oh yeah they just jumped up from movement target right here oh yeah they've gone live there he is there is the guy yeah i think he just jumped i think that was the animation for it sniper ammo do we have a munitions crate or anything nope now it's a ghost town the [Applause] there's someone in that window i just saw him run past yeah did you reckon we could still get up here load up two loadouts here guys i wouldn't risk it i've got no plates so i can drop your thumb you go oh thanks there's two loadouts 48 meters uh east east east all right good 49 meters east going up please don't get me killed 25 remaining right here right here place has been lost that might 22 meters i think they've gone all the way down okay down the bottom he had an angle just where i picked it thank you [Applause] yeah finish finish finish [Applause] no hits no hits on any of my grenades downstairs yeah there's one yeah dude what's the point of that i need some armor man i've got nothing we all do is that clear lucky i don't really know we've got the satchel well i need plates as well now any plates check i can drop you a couple sod yeah vehicle outside vehicle outside around here come up come up guys come back up is that two stores [Applause] [Music] okay oh right here yeah i heard something 41 meters 41 minutes [Applause] that's directly underneath us guys hunt them down no they can't come here unless they go through the gas which is highly unlikely 46 meters we're in the safe zone yeah they're going to be underneath there's 50 meters directly ahead south south east should we take our position as well get down then or what no no no we can just hold for now hold for now yeah because we've got the two different levels of the stadium i think that's what's happened it could be one above us that's entirely possible nothing on heart now it's all gone all that gear that was at the bottom of this they could still come purple they could still absolutely yeah yeah and the other and the staircase at the end as well six meters could be doing zip line no no they'll be coming up the stairs they'll be coming up those stairs i think repositioning you stop here 14 meters i think they're going up those stairs is going on with this circle sensational it's like with that bruce foresight just gonna have to hold the elevator then and possibly the stair cluster cluster the i mean they could still come behind us on that rappel anybody know the code for the stadium you need to do the easter egg easter egg not enough time they might gas mask you never know i don't know if there'd be enough sudden heartbeat 9.8 meters and then further ahead as well i've never had a certain finish like this before i think they just we got the rarest circle was it this is a this is a very rare ending and this doesn't happen very often 32.7 yeah yeah they're all just underneath us if it bounces i say we go fast even if it means gassing out of the zone for a bit you crush are you coming first i do i do i've got a guest i've got a guest one yeah yeah so we can all just go really late like super late wait till everyone's finished and then go super like i think they're right below us i can hear them yeah twenty four two of them not we have to go out this window i think we have to go out this window he's going first yeah that's why they're waiting i don't know if we can make it out anyone who's got the roof you instantly win because you don't have to go into that team that we were sniping for ages um probably i don't know my unlucky good game left good game if we ju if we jump that any differently it wouldn't have we still got a loss to be honest with you yeah we would have lost i deliberately went long to try and bait them into thinking that we were far north ah so that we were like yeah because we couldn't actually get out the window down the other end it was it was it wasn't possible yeah i wanted them to think that we were further around and he only started shooting me as i got towards the ground so i think it kind of worked sort of maybe kind of sort of maybe worked either that or i just killed myself like a muppet but hey you tried something that's the main thing you can't win them all you know the other thing is was that that team decided to sacrifice themselves in the gas as well to kill us yeah they did they were not running they were just waiting for me they went nuclear on us yeah and then there's a new life team in the circle let the sweats uh stop flowing um so many cool watches in this game i feel like most of them aren't very useful though it would be nice if there was like a more of the tamaguchi kind of thing or that kind of stuff my chat was saying the one that glows green that has like the holographic numbers that come off it apparently if you don't turn that off people can see you through walls ah wait what what you mean that's good to know the watch where the numbers flow green you know the one i mean stud yeah if you don't turn it off in game people can see you through walls like the glow goes through walls it goes through your gun as well doesn't it yeah enemies the halloween one is even worse because there's like tiny bats that fly around it so whenever you're scoped in you think you've seen something yeah can we test this watch out stream all right we'll ask you a question are we gonna win this warzone match of course [Applause] will i get 50 kills probably not it's quite accurate to be honest i'm enjoying it what's up from nepal how are you doing extreme yeah we're running a 30 night hey fat bernie ah we can't use the doof doof i'm trying i'm trying to use new stuff that i don't usually use a ronin thank you for becoming a member some canadian dude royal and lulu thanks again guys battle royale there's a little green dot that shows up through the walls yeah what's the prime minister cologne you're showing up late we've been streaming for about an hour and a half ah that stadium is so enemy soldier incoming superstar where all of the budget kills are is that right you get the bargain basement deals over here buy your kills in bulk get them here like costco for kills kilco through the window come in they're coming right so you can see them shooting through the room someone just opened the door oh man got me he's cracked scratched come on sort them out or capture the objective [Laughter] thank you very much more footsteps i hear more i can't get through this door are they still on the roof i'll come there i'll come through oh they're dropping off on you guys watch out watch out enemy mark one there as well i'll mark some more for you [Applause] that's right here that's just one one further back down that's him that's money yeah let's get out to the car park there's still people here watch out yeah i hear him i hear him talk to ourselves to ourself once pretty far back to mad lad let's go bye 30 meters 30 meters in the car park in the car park you guys dropping into the air you guys in the car park down gone outside [Applause] rpg passed before red [Applause] maybe i shouldn't have picked up the most wanted contract i just want my loadout i want to i want to take a breather please all right let's do it how are we going to get that [Applause] bracelet [Applause] the guy one of these guys that i killed sounded like a parrot that's all i'm saying i do parrots play warzone he laughed at me coming this way [Applause] we shall not let them we shall win you're saying that this you're right jack yeah there was someone over there on the grass i'm not sure where they've gone now [Applause] [Music] [Applause] with my vlk oh threat two on me brilliant just what i always wanted made it all the way over no way did that thermite get all the way over there stodd may be able to confirm red roof red roof [Applause] one downstairs blue skin still red roof can't see him on my side coming over come down again come a little bit where's the other one there's one left one left somewhere yeah i think it's the one me and jack is shooting at oh where's he gone he was up here on there still fred too don't see him anymore yeah he's him he's him he's down he's still threat finish him i can't finish him he's disappeared into one of the little kings he's hacking oh alexander popov upbeat he probably nothing on harvey this is where i sniped him earlier [Applause] occurring he's over there in that window [Applause] come on finish him off oh right here was it a ghost with the hood that you just killed here yeah that was i got that kill [Applause] [Music] you [Applause] i think i'm gonna go for um i've got a lot of cash yeah we have money and i have no plates remember the subway system remember that yeah i think i've seen someone in it once it was great for one day and then no one used it ever again it's like tfl right now i'm gonna go down and see what's up what's popping down uh wesley you got there's money here for you to go sell fred's for sure yeah you want to eat it's raining stud money it's kind of weird how like he's no one uses this at all like ever no yeah it feels too it's vulnerable guys also no because they have well it's also you don't know when the trains are coming and where they're going so you just if you go down there you're then stuck in the zone if you go into the gap it's like it's just too risky it's a bit unclear isn't it yeah if they marked it on the map do you think like like with the train going round so that you knew where they were do you think you'd be more likely to use it maybe but not really because it's just like another one of those times airport action [Music] i get the kills first okay there we go lovely [Music] [Applause] yay thank you for the rare ground humming's down there rolling really is that where he lives use frangible disabling park i've never used that perk in warzone at all what's up demi how are you doing rap good [Music] [Applause] hey that m4 is no good at that range yeah no stock at range is pretty rough he's over here on the on the agreement [Applause] yeah one of them is dead he's broke he's broke there's one there was one more in there okay i can't mark it locating atc clear yes oh this guy down here he just tried to throw a gas grenade yeah i marked the gas grenade mid-air can you shoot those mid-air no i don't think so no i wish you could that was an interesting i reckon you might be able to block a bullet with it maybe that'd be sick well in battlefield you could shoot them couldn't you should we buy airstrikes uavs all that jazz yeah oh i'm being beaten from the plane from the plane no there's a guy inside the plane he's got a kilo of all things no one uses that no what's the kilo what does that do uh it gives you absolutely no recall is that him yeah i think that was him is that the name i can't see the scoreboard anymore just hiding in a corner in one of the tents he's because you've got money on his body but he's not going for it no no he doesn't want to he knows those people above he's going to play like little and there it is that him i stole your [ __ ] and that's my luke disappeared because i can't get a gulag um thanks game where's my gear uh go for your loadout i'm driving yeah oh yeah it's closer when i come back visible please now we separate it's okay we need to get together friends forever anybody to snipe not that i can say uh you want a boost how many random angles on the planes than those guys yeah it's cool to fight here though yeah don't really get often [Applause] i don't think i'm gonna get an opponent 15 seconds left um there's 70 people alive that's a lot yeah that's a lot of people alive circle two that's a lot of people no one's dying yay more kills this game's a 50 bomb teammate is redeploying standby i'm not doing bad easy 50 bomb i reckon i can get more load out until them yeah goddammit is just going out of the zone yeah it's just gone dude human what's your ghost load out though uh mp5 oh yeah there is brilliant i mean it is a bit mad that there's still 73 alive that's 73 now it's gone up you never see that in a year it's like it's going to be a good game i need plates have you got plates i have five and i can offer you three anybody can drop me cash i can quickly go get the buy yeah i'll give you i can give you money money money thank you jack i don't know if you'll have time yeah you've got 20 sec 20 seconds yeah you'll be fine it's fine oh god take a little bit of it here a little bit of a tickle i'm going to hear some coughing oh we're good that's amazing and that's it we're good i've seen anyone is there a bounty anywhere no you get another king what you want to go towards tv [Music] i'll get it am i gonna get the track on fire station yeah yeah that'd be a good vehicle to get us up onto the map won't it because we're kind of far out at the moment entire factory hasn't been lured oh god this area feels like it hasn't been looted [Applause] save me a seat okay that was a sick pirouette you did that little pickup a little pick up a drop if you guys jump in the truck you'll be safe but [Music] where are they on the bridge they look like they passed it in the galley maybe maybe [Music] they're like this this is a bit dark is they're fighting someone else yeah they're fighting someone walks in front of us on the rocks oh god oh god no [Applause] yeah it's two teams this way in the back now enemy uav overhead trying to find the guy shooting you started no on my right yeah vehicle transport you [Applause] this

he's like just trying it looks like he's trying to get in the roof or something yeah you can get onto the frame that's in the way that's in the roof yeah i think he's trying to do that you pushing him lucky what's going on i'm pushing i see him running around out there i'm thinking of getting the superior position but there's a guy in purple that's something like i don't want to yeah he's at the

good clean fun clean fun i know i've said it now [Music] i've said it now that's one pound [Applause] did anybody check out the hanger with the truck in it like is there anything there doing a yellow oh nice i was thinking maybe if we can find a buy station that's reasonable we could maybe get a couple clusters or airstrikes over there should we push should we push playstation yeah i like the idea of that because i've not seen anyone else shooting us because there's one going in yeah they're going to be chilling in the um hangers until the end of the game so anyone on that right i saw at least three people parachuting [Applause] repositioning no confirmed in the window here um [Applause] finish that one baby there we go or more on the roof maybe i downed him and i didn't get the kill unless that's the guy steps underneath nothing on heart did they run they're just running maybe maybe he's self-residing just started peeking the window i think that's what happened i think clear yeah i think so all right i think we're good i think we're good i down the guy in this room on green so hopefully we need to go back towards where we just went on their own i think it was amara just run up to the fence [Applause] how is he hidden himself like that what here we go we gotta go decision somewhere i have no idea oh i think this might be bad now we're getting just going for fire they just put it on fire yeah watch out for this morrow she was here okay careful we don't have a good position here because we're just bad do you want to get into acc positions don't push this compound just because they all have eventually oh oh god they came out they came out yeah they're holding i'm moving moving yeah [Applause] dude okay this beams yeah those guys [Applause] and he's running kilo justus yeah did you kill him no yeah we got him down but surviving oh crap yeah the guy on the outside wall died it just happened to beat me that exact woman the flukey bugger right we're gonna keep

yeah if you jump through the window you can put them behind the box if you can get it what happened to them they're still there they're just holding i think i'm going to try and creep up from behind just hang on yeah these guys are a good choice you've got cash money yeah i just picked up the money that was on my body [Applause] [Applause] just go past him you think that was so so was that just kayla that's key like yeah i think it's just i don't think they're cheating no no they would have seen me thank you are they still alive for the loadout yeah going for loading survive i might have to get a kilo to win this and let's see guy in front on loading nice westy that was insane get down get down get out get out get down no blair jack oh god he's literally they're still in that compound guys they're still in the building by the way i don't have anything if you i don't know if you guys are where i died i'm just marked it there [Applause] unlucky guys i'm loving this though this is like the right kind of competitive you know yeah he's a good fight like that m4 fight there started eu i would have died i think like he switched weapons whilst he was sliding and then but we're like oh yeah but the thing is i would tried to play i managed to get one plate in and then i did a 1a and just started shooting him instantly i think that plate saved me because otherwise i would have died yeah yes sweat we're in the sweat zone now nah maybe maybe but this is not acceptable sweat you know yeah you can actually you can actually fight people yeah this is competitive you see the enemies that are shooting you people are pushing people are playing aggro like it's good i love it eu everybody's sat in the building i've got my duff duff oh you came to fight me you're dead i just think that the duff duff needs it it's got to be uh from the game dragon's breath is what's ruined it because if you didn't have dragon's breath it's that it's that like uh it's the damage that eats away from you when you're on fire the annoying thing is is actually relatively balanced on other shotguns lose the initial hit but the burn does something where um i might have to sweat it out this game boy so i might have to go kilo and do we'll see the ram just isn't cutting it against the kilos uh what monitor girlie gamer hp omen x27 that was a good game it was very competitive wasn't its gin what's up ramish hey jedi master what color is your lightsaber i hope it's green good morning ellepong leon how you doing ben wyatt what's up you wear socks in the shower no i would not recommend

yes please whoa whoa i was so upset that they killed johnny the monkey in that movie he was my favorite it wasn't a bad film like it was never going gonna be as good as the first one that i think yeah i don't think you can get away with the same kind of comedy the narrative was more like he was learning about the modern world and that he couldn't say the stuff anymore you know yeah exactly whereas the first time it was like wow everybody's shocked that the world is actually this stupid now we've known that for the last what five years yeah i feel like a lot of the scenarios in that movie as well were like fake or they were actors though yeah but i think like for instance you know with the um the dancing scene yeah yes i think that was like 50 actors and then 50 people putting their mates up right i think i think as well i think they were like right you're going to watch these people dance but they're not going to tell you exactly what the dance is oh and by the way you can't leave the room because we're filming it because they have to set the events up don't they they can't be like yeah we're just randomly it was a bit at the start where he was walking down the street and everyone recognized him so you kind of knew what was going to happen through the film you're like he's not going to quite get away with it the same way anymore does anyone want this oh uh loadout drop just
