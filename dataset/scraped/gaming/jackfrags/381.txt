all i wanted to do was take control of the church that's all i ever wanted i got my mp28 extended mag outside i know there's a lot of enemies in there look at the flag at the top and a tank rolls past didn't see me one two three three soldiers down at the back the sniper tower here really strong position pushed in got the kill dude just drops down out of nowhere but i know there's someone at the top this sniper has been plaguing us the entire match picking us off one by one not anymore mate you're dead that medkit isn't gonna save you on this occasion mate sorry so i took the tower and you can see on the top we did start taking the flag unfortunately look at the mini-map no one's here with me it's just me it's just me that's it well very carefully walk down the stairs i wanted to get this guy springfield she can pick up other people's guns in this game dude ran in got the kill i know there's loads here somewhere check the right left again drop one i run out of ammo there or maybe i just had second thoughts dropped two i got downed i do have a med kit though in this class i'm gonna res get back up we're still in the game now something i've got in this class a dynamite bundle we'll throw that down there in case they rush [Music] no kills on this occasion but now i've got a teammate here i've got my springfield sniper rifle let's go i'm gonna chill for a second see if anyone comes up the tower and now i'm looking outside and i've used the wrong sight it's kind of cool that you can do that though with the scope on dude was up on the roof get the kill someone else trying to climb up get the kill shot in the back flank me with the car 98 gg well played welcome back guys to enlisted at the moment it is in open beta free to play on pc xbox series sx and playstation 5. big thanks to them for sponsoring today's video and if you're interested in checking out the game for yourself there's a link down in the description below that you can click on to get started so today we are playing a bit of d-day trying to push up here and take these objectives i posted a video on this game already a few weeks back they had like a little early access trial for it and you guys seem to enjoy watching it so i took the opportunity and we are going to play some more today and this is the squads mode so this is pve and pvp at the same time so i have a squad of soldiers that are with me and i can give them a few basic orders and of course i can control one of them at a time like i'm doing now so if you didn't tune into the last video enlisted is made by the same guys that create war thunder and it's a world war two game obviously if you know your spirits exactly what you're looking at here i've played a few hours so far and i would say that it's a mix of casual and hardcore and i said this in the previous video sometimes it feels like battlefield or hell let loose and then other times it feels like the old school call of duty games the very first ones called one cod two and it's a bit more arcadey in certain respects and i managed to pick up a german sniper's car 98 here with a scope on it and the sniping in this game is it's really fun because people go down in one bullet it's got that kind of damage right you hit someone in the chest with a rifle most of the rifles in the game it's gonna be a one-hit kill and i found a little mg-42 nest here the engineers in this game can actually build fortifications in this game and wherever you want as well i don't think there's any limitations on that maybe a couple but you can set up mg42 nest sandbags that kind of thing i was just going to town there mowing the defenders down trying to help my team push up the and this game prides itself on historical accuracy so all of the uniforms that you see all the vehicles weapons the gadgets that the soldiers would have used they're all authentic to the time there's no experimental weaponry or anything like that that i've seen anyway so far so it's grounded in the history of world war ii i know a lot of gamers are into that sort of thing especially when it comes to historical shooters but this was a really cool moment i picked up this rifle through the dynamite bundle ran away those things make a huge explosion unfortunately mo down there by a machine gunner at the top now if you don't want to play with the ai in squads mode which you're saying here you can just play pvp they've got a separate game mode called lone fighters where you're just playing against other real players but i was on late with studying westy here and we just thought that we'd uh check it out see what it was like the bots are quite basic though i think i only ever got killed by a bot like once or twice but it would be quite annoying if you were just getting done by ai over and over again but it's certainly an interesting decision to do that and i think more casual players will definitely enjoy this type of game mode yeah you're going to be fighting real players too but they'll also be ai in the mix that you can shoot use give orders to whatever this is quite a funny clip actually i was sneaking up on that sniper who was prone got shot by someone else i wanted to test out the melee but i had a med kit so i could self revive if you don't have a med kit it doesn't happen i did practice there get the stab stab stubbies he went down let's get the finish so the melee is a one-hit kill it's pretty brutal and now we've got this nice little sandbag sniper nest i don't know if this one was created by an engineer or if this is just already there in the map and when you get a flank like this with the snipers oh man it's flanking the game this is because of how much damage the rifles do you get a nice flank and you can just go on absolute tear i'm just looking for a little angle here where i can see someone some people just don't expect to be this aggressive you know picking people off man yes so good i think where this game will excel is on console though and i've been saying this for years and years console players just don't have enough games like this and i've been making youtube videos for nearly 10 years and the amount of pc games that i've played like this is kind of realistic hardcore shooters historical or not games like squad hell let loose post scriptum insurgency console players just haven't had access to that but i do think maybe that was a limitation on the hardware now even though they're in short supply we are having more people on next-gen consoles like the series sx and playstation 5 and the hardware is very similar to top-end gaming pcs right now so these kind of games can run on them and clearly the developers have noticed that and they're taking advantage of it and i think that's awesome for the console gamers who haven't experienced this before have just watched it maybe they couldn't afford a gaming pc they didn't know how to build one they didn't know where to buy one whatever they've always just been on console now they can play games like this and actually enjoy them and i think that's a great thing so back on topic in the open beta you can try two of the four campaigns that they've announced so far you've got the battle of moscow and the invasion of normandy which you're seeing here and both of those campaigns have a couple of different maps and game modes in there are also two more campaigns that they've announced which will be released further down the line the battle of tunisia and the battle of berlin there's a few screenshots of the battle of berlin one and that looks really cool so i'd love to try that but at the moment if you jump in and play this just the moscow and normandy campaigns right now now we're getting to the end of the level now we actually managed to push them all the way back this is kind of like a rush style game mode where you have to take point after point after point and you go up the beach you go into the french villages and that's where we are now around these windmills and buildings that kind of thing i've got the m2 here i think it's an m2 right please correct me if i'm wrong i need to learn all these weapons throwing out a big bundle of dynamite i thought there was a group there bang double kill that one felt good and the sandbags just come crumbling down now something that i haven't really touched on that i did mention in the previous video is the metagame so each of your soldiers in your squads have names they have levels and different perks you can give them weapons gadgets that you can unlock and equip on them and the same goes for the vehicles too like the tanks and the airplanes i haven't really played the game enough to fully understand how that works and i'm sure there are people who will explain it way way better than i could but with that said do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below and as i mentioned once again it is free to play open beta at the moment link is down below if you want to play it for yourself we did manage to win as well which is great and that's all for today folks if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike
