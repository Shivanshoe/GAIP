[Music] so [Music] [Music] they've done it again another hitscan sniper rifle i think it's an accident but the x50 has an instantaneous bullet up to 400 meters at the moment you don't have to lead or account for drop it's not been patched yet might be tonight though so go have some fun make the fastest ads build that you can let's play a match see how many kills we can get leave a like in a comment below enjoy x50 650 everybody run eggs i've not even found a shot from it yet so here we go so it is still working it's hit scan up to about 407 meters which is exactly the same level that the spr was hit scan to when that release do you remember that there's a man here whereabouts jack on the roof is it working broken [Music] is it it's only out to 400 meters i think yeah 400 meters how far away are those 450. it does actually start dropping after 400 then it just disappears it's like the old spr bug yeah yeah so that may be why you can't hit him because if it's beyond 400 then the bullet just disappears i'll play right here and jack has murdered him quad bike behind us what's going on here there's two men on that one i don't think it's ended well for them lads double bobs the
