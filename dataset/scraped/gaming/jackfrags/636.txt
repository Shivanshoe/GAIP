the car 98 is the dark horse of cod warzone it really is i underestimated its power and i've seen the light the cycle rate is ridiculous making follow-up shots very easy and when you unlock the second reticle for it on the sniper scope lining up those headshots gets way easier you can put people down so quick here's how i've got mine built loving it at the moment and you're about to see three matches of warzone playing with study and tomographic tone of action in here some great shots and if you like this leave a like below subscribe for more so with that said sit back relax and enjoy that
