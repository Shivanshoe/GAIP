hi everyone and welcome to crisis 2 remastered i haven't played this game since 2011 when it came out for the first time and i think i had a pretty decent spec pc then but i don't remember it working that great in terms of the frame rate it was fine played through the game but it's been a while and this is a completely different crisis to the first game as i said i played through it once so it's going to be really interesting to check it out again a big thanks to epic games as well for sponsoring this one today crisis 2 remastered and crisis trilogy remastered are available on the epic game store and if you want to check them out there is a link down in the description below so just to show you guys we are playing on this maxed out we've also got dlss turned on quality and i think the remastered version has ray tracing as well and a load of other upgrades i absolutely love the soundtrack on this game as well i think it's brilliant like if i'm remembering this right it was actually

been a while swordfish three please confirm your status this is swordfish three holding station at point south water periscope roger that confirming point south one uh swordfish three can you describe

there's no bad guys up there folsom keep telling you this is a strictly humanitarian crisis ebola some such [ __ ] tell him alcatraz alcatraz he's talking much this morning contrary to popular belief

this dr ghoul get your asses forward get scuba gear on ten minutes i told you you don't take out the ebola virus with an m6 yeah just don't shoot this gold okay can you shoot a burner was an alien invasion maybe you could yeah right illegal aliens i don't know i don't think that would work what the [ __ ] was that get out back up doesn't it start sinking oh would you like a hand sir give me some help here i can assist the theme really does take hard on it yeah it's a great game samuel it reminds you of bf4 there is a level in bf4 like this oh no this has rapidly gone bad the whole thing just sent it's new york isn't it this game i think you'd say in new york for the most part at least [Music] pc [Music] make it gameplay i'm trying to blast out what happened just don't touch them hey looks like lady liberty took some heavy fire oh no i'd like to go to new york one day never been yeah she's still standing though i don't know what's going on oh it's the aliens i mean alcatraz just got riddled first time playing it jack nope i played through it back in 2011 when it came out once so i don't really remember much about it so this is going to be fun new york is smelly and amazing stark contrast there aiden oh there's prophet look at him watch out we got a badass over here you think they'll make a new crisis again where's my support where's the sub [ __ ] sub took you all out that can't be good's counting on us alcatraz that's your name alcatraz oh destiny's impressions [Music] it was a scene like this in crisis one as well [Music] crytek production obviously crytek went on to make crisis three and then hunt showdown have they made any other games didn't they make a vr game as well is that right i seem to recall they made a vr game with a dinosaur in it go smash and profit falco punch falcon punch oh no oh no no no warface yeah that's it ryze son of rome that's brilliant game un underappreciated i think that game looks amazing oh man i love how there's just an intro for this game where profit is just going ham on everyone 810 thunderbolts flying through new york reminds me of the godzilla movie the one from the 90s or was it like 2000 2001. superhero landing it was called climb yeah that's it that was the vr game cheeky cloak oh got him i'm out the window do it to him yeah there we go boom there's another superhero landing [Music] no they didn't make knack two i don't think so cute [Music] i used to play the crisis one multiplayer you guys remember that it was cool it was kind of like conquest from battlefield was it i think it was called power struggle but it had tanks and vetoes and all sorts of vehicles and you had to go and capture objectives and then build up enough power to make a nuclear bomb something like that it's really good fun though because you could run around in nano suits and just like go ham on people this intro is insane by the way what's up kodak from indonesia hello ho james samuel [Music] crisis 2 remastered oh baby i remember the multiplayer the frame rate was terrible though like it was really bad this is bringing back some nostalgia tray good oh no oh yeah they gave alcatraz a suit prophet takes it off i remember that bit sacred yeah we're live right now what they look like under the nanosuits how it integrates with the body [Music] alcatraz this is all i can do it's all i can do for any of us you're my last shot here gould's last chance last chance for all of us i'm used up i'm a dead man walking i'm i look really painful welcome to the future son welcome to the war oh yeah one last wish it won't let me go that easily symbiosis gotta break the link prophet no not like this i gave you the suit gave you my life promise promise me finally it's all i can do now you are all i can do they used to call me prophet remember me rep rest in peace break the padlock rest in peace [Music] that's his dog tag i don't have any ammo i mean it's a bit grim isn't it we got fresh bodies on the beach here a couple live ones too he used to call me prophet remember me you can just grab all the things this game made kicking things cool before dishonored school death louvre you read me that mice and magic game that was cool wasn't it you could just kick all the orcs and stuff i would have taken the oxford to be honest wow hey no yours integrating dna i don't like the sound of that did i ever play bullet storm yeah really good single player it's only like four hours long but it was good you can just spy on people really weird highlight cell are all over downtown looking for you i'm sending you my coordinates i've got some ammo now is this an accurate depiction of new york i think it is right to a degree i've got stealth mode yet you can do the gun thing as well right it's the plus system from bf2042 guys before it was cool [Music] let's go there's two bad guys here harry is not clear mate you just haven't seen me yet [Music] oh lovely scarab i mean it's the same one isn't it what's my frame rate it feels like i'm getting about 120 fps or something playing at 1440p i'm gonna check out crysis 3 next week though we'll be playing that 4k because this looks good considering this came out in 2011 i think they've done a really good job with the remaster but i read eurogamer's report on crisis 3 remastered and crisis 3 is still a pretty good looking game but the remastered version i saw some footage of that and screenshots and that looks insane man well this does have ray tracing on it now oh okay so it gives me cloak mode here i love this dude's voice [Music] hey val when's this game originally from 2011. what i want to know was against the whole nanoscience program right now never trusted it yeah the quality should look really good at 1440p [Music] the other guy saw me no dammit you have to balance your energy or your suit you've got armor mode stealth mode and i think i'm outside i just have speed mode as well you have to get here i don't know how long i can hold out death by teddy bear yeah it's not going to happen is it this helicopter winter thank you for the fire that's very kind my day is going good i spent a couple of days this week at a theme park i took a break earlier in the week did some halloween stuff at a theme park road some rides went through some scare mazes i've had a good week although it has been quite busy this is oversight do you copy seven report this leaning as well check that up don't keep anybody down [Music] my first ever shooter game was it was this the first game that you played it was an fps this game doesn't need a remaster change my mind i mean some people might think that yeah still looks pretty good but yeah we're playing this on pc i want to get all the attachments for the guns because they're super cool suppressor hollow sight you can get under barrel attachments as well is this guy going to set an alarm off or something no he just went to hide some grenades at me love that slide as well slide in this game and crysis one are very good also they know that i'm profit by the way i don't know how is that explaining the story [Applause] i suppose it might be at some point visibility is a bit unreadable i think when you start shooting because there's so much smoke coming off the gun can i get oh yeah you can just use all the vehicles currently you see that in crisis one that may have actually been destroyed this crisis one was all about the destruction i guess there are a few things in this you can destroy that's burgertown lots of bad guys to fight already it's fred's diner it's not burger town what are you doing around here you can still grab them oh my everything [Applause] [Music] bad guys everywhere gotta find mr goldie i can't use that it's locked i wonder if you can get the code for that slide is so good no this game reminds me of sometimes as well it reminds me of fear that game was incredible hopefully they even bring that back at some point with alma all the slow motion stuff you could do in that game so sick profit nice lighting in here all over the place i've got the bail i'll meet you back at the lab i'll meet [Music] hey alex another live stream yeah i've never had a hope in hell you see those bodies back there i really enjoy live streaming on youtube it's good fun approach enemies [Music] oh man imagine imagine that happening over the last three years the predator just comes up behind you and snaps your neck turns your head around [Music] you know what i might i might play fear because they made a sequel like fiat 2 and then they did another one didn't they for like 360 and i don't know it was just it was just never the same is this a different gun i can pick up [Music] complete standby magnetic seals released please release automatic system shutdown oh here we go this is where we get maximum strength maybe maximum armor and the field of views kind of messed up the animation oh look at this new york new york [Music] it's the division oh no it's thanos has my game crashed yet no not yet we've been playing for about 26 minutes [Music] a little girl from fear used to creep me out what happened to the suit the whole thing went down i think it's back now but you better get here fast you see that all over the place got one scares [Music] i love you i love you too [Music] i have changed the color of the logo oh look at a this of liberty it's mine now what am i gonna do with that is that windows xp not sure what that did oh mode we got scooby what's up jason boys [Music] they really have to demonstrate it like that we're gonna really show the player here how are my mode can save their ass let's just have an ai shoot some barrels next to them how about that i did kill you right yeah [Music] look at this looks like the ram 7 from modern warfare cool gun and get an extended clip a silencer reflex sight laser sight when did the remaster come out last week frosty was it last week no it was this week 15th i think no no no rest in peace i just changed the rate of fire how did i do that oh that's all the upgrades isn't it i keep pressing escape to get out of that screen doesn't work plus system on this game is amazing tactical donut available i think all right torching christ how'd we end up on body detail quit complaining watch from the bodies tactical option infiltrate let's do that that sounds cool no more they're a bio hazard i keep doing it such an idiot all right we'll go and portray it try and do a sneaky [Applause] i should have um i should have put my poke mode on ah this is more of an smg isn't it those grenades uh eric thank you for the 200. that's awesome dude very kindly thank you so this is the infiltrate option this would have been a better entrance if i had a stealth rather than just dropping down i don't think i'd even seen them i think it's because i was in front of that guy he saw me you did run a bit slower as well when you put maximum armor on you hear how the footsteps change too it's cool isn't it cheeky headshot looks like it's a one-hit kill with a headshot as years well has shown that a pmc-like cell operates at a significant saving to the taxpayer yes i agree when you don't like the radio station uh i'm sorry it's invincible how did that radio survive i don't understand scooby i remember almost everything on this game assume this is amazing what do you like about the remaster does it feel different it doesn't feel different i mean it runs a lot better than what i remember in 2011 it looks better as well it's got ray tracing dlss a lot of other features don't mess with the samurai crystal sword in the moon do you think they were gonna make a tv show or something made by the radios made by nokia that's a good one yeah the field of view has broken the oh my god what the hell uh prophet saws i'm sorry i just stepped down there what are they made of nokia lucky to do humans now right now little robot dude the aliens are taking over what's up crispy you can't kill them my immersion is ruined of the tiny box [Music] predictor mode then call it like it is you know that's where i came in no no vision enabled i'm not gonna get through here [Music] i mean you sent me down here goals what the hell little demons you want to get that last time mate gotta be some african jungle [ __ ] ebola or something that sprang from a plane look at me man look at me i think i don't think there's any hope for these people best predator impression i can't do it that mate it's like a velociraptor isn't it i just can't do it it's not for me i'm in the bloodstream ah that's more like it no that was like i was like despite all medical attempts to reverse the effects of the cellular breakdown and infected we have found no viable cure evacuation is no longer an option a shoot to kill discretion is now vested city-wide to be exercised upon any suspicion of infection further to this nano suit subject profit is also designated as an active biohazard profit is to be shot on site please not not like this [Music] incoming alien threat it's the squiddy guys in it the blue squiddy guys i don't have any ammo for this oversight one shut up got him right on my nose roger that stay on him bring him down bullets everyone nathan gould nathan gould yes shotgun no it's like that scene he wanted please i just want i just pick everything up i've got the shotgun now it's game over whoa transformers spread see this is full godzilla isn't it it's godzilla mixed with cloverfield how can i hear their comments hold station we're coming in prophet did you see that you see that no i didn't say it must have gone down from where you are you do realize what this means right this is our chance this is it forget extraction we have to jump on this go get samples from the crash get them to meet here at the lab this could be our best shot at rolling back the spore maybe the whole invasion evening man just got trolled did you know that trolled in the uk is slang for really drunk he blows him back so can i have a rifle and a shotgun oh i can nice what was that noise didn't see nothing the hell whoa glitching out got to get there gold is jordan peterson just look a bit like him yeah people there is some weird [ __ ] going down in this city and those jack boot [ __ ] on the corner with their little cell logo and their pmc paychecks signed off by taxpayers like you and me are not here to help they're here to put that jack boot in whoa this ain't america anymore this ain't america anymore no sir we've been taken over by the aliens what i wanted a red dot sight or something [Music] that [ __ ] still priority one have you okay fine i'm not sure i like this because i can't i can't really aim anymore they just called him reinforcements i have to take that off honestly i thought this bit up here was a safe area where i wouldn't be seen okay he's just flying from behind cover ai is as usual we oh actually started climbing up there that's quite interesting me i'm so annoyed i don't have a skull for anything yet it's cool that they actually like climb up stuff though and try and get you i feel like the ai is pretty good in this get game here i'm out here playing mortal kombat oh that one's got a reflex sight yes okay right it's gg now you have a man down [Applause] oh no it's instantly stuck dice look at this honestly dice said that they patched this but obviously not the road kill i must have the helicopter oh it's austin powers then you used to be able to like rip the um the turrets off like in halo there's no ammo looks like they bailed before i can do can i not rip that off detach there we go i can be like profit now [Music] how amazing does that sound by the way that sounds so good i love that no no you don't check these pods i am crisis this game has a smart rocket launcher as well it's kind of like the s rule from battlefield where you can aim it you fire and then you go wee and you can control it oh nothing okay you've got to get down into the wreckage what a surprise ow any genetic material you can find rocket launcher this what's that noise lost him i'm right here man is there a multiplayer in this game bradley oh you know what i don't think multiplayer was in crisis too or if it was it was just like a basic arena death match the first crisis had all right multiplayer and crisis which was the expansion pack and then crisis three i think had it as well i don't know if there was any mp in this please correct me if i'm wrong if there was i didn't play it or i don't remember it at least it's growing people just melted down that's horrible look without actual alien body tissue we're wasting our time just kidding just more arena based okay i reckon these are the developers marcel james that the right way i can just squeeze through here this is where we just what's my favorite crisis game crisis one i would say youtube wanderer just because it was so freeform you could do whatever you wanted price is very linear in comparison there is a nice mix oh no it just infected me it's firing electrical around this way yeah they're a lot tougher than the fronts [Music] collect metal there we go you can exchange that's it now get out of there profit head toward the fdr cool that's how you get your suit upgrades is unreal tournament back i don't know they made a it was like a free-to-play version of it wasn't it like six seven years ago and then they let the community kind of chip in and build levels for it but i think fortnite kind of took over didn't it i'd love to see a new unreal tournament though look at me cool you turned it off i thought i activated it oh there we go a little unclear there which was on which was off i don't want to go up that exchange a feline for a feline is that when you go to a pet store and say excuse me sir would you like this cat and they say oh yes sir i would take this cat in exchange you just swap cats unusual isn't it people do it but the aliens just ripping them up who is dude look at this dude [Applause] i do a takedown really oh yeah i had the options [Applause] so because i didn't kill that i don't get to collect the sample are you serious [Applause] watch the rooftops [Music] whoa they're fleshy bits don't they i'll let them get too close though hey chicken four months thank you so much oh you just get you just get the nano material when you walk over them that animation was just for the first one that you killed a horse marco i don't have to price that over let's go through let's go i'm trying stealth go oh no i'm wearing myself we've just gone underneath like this [Music] uh excuse me i'm not as sneaky as i think any travel plans i think next year yeah probably go back to america maybe thinking about japan as well there's secret in here yeah i knew they would [Music] [Music] i don't know what you did back there but the suit signal's going crazy i was probed by an alien i've got intersection protocols rolling up on all the lab systems and a bunch of biotech patent documentation with hargreaves name all over it it's like some kind of contingency routine he's built into the suits deep layers i've got no idea what this profit installed norton antivirus is what it means look take the fdr get up here to the lab i don't know how much longer i can hold on here you need to make it fast [Music] gold i'm coming don't worry what's up philip do you have a daily job or do you live from youtube and streaming um so i've been full-time content creator since 2012 flip i started in 2011 and then that was october and then by january 2012 i got a partnership with machinima cell have said they're not around anymore along the fdr freeway i just didn't i just took a gamble sounds like lockhart's down here overseeing the operation himself he's got to be close profit worked on it paid off here we are 10 years later i'll power kick you no tracer incoming bullet paths i already see hey what's the point of that i mean i'll try it out do not cross i'm a rebel give me that bucket why does the bucket have stats let's go arrange that on it that's funny freddie thanks for becoming a member [Music] the order is to bring him down i'll argue the civil rights detail we've done that alive is more useful yeah useful to who yeah the guy just got through massacring a couple dozen of my amendments strickland i'm taking no more chances prophet dies hargreave can have his corpse to play with hargreave wants margarite wants the suit that's what he'll get he isn't gonna like this and last time i checked we voted where you're wrong miss strickland you work for him i answer to the sell executive board on the dod i don't give a [ __ ] what some senile old shareholder like cargury may or may not like that's majority shareholder and former president of the crynet ward you want to be careful with enemies you make your lockharts this conversation is over that's an awkward helicopter journey right there i mean they just sat right next to each other after arguing like that it's just showing you what you can do like it's not i mean i can show you a tactical option if you want there's some tactical options for you enjoy their knuckles oh that's got a range scope on it look at this that's so much better profit i'm picking up a lot of cell activity around here if they find the lab we're both screwed you got to speed it up man how about you speed up i'm the guy down here risking my ass for you okay gold if that is even your real name sways a lot oh you can actually steady the scope you press shift that's good like that bang i'm start kicking some cars you know what that nano suit upgrades where you can see where the bullets are actually pretty good because it is kind of hard to see what the hell it is kind of hard to see where people are shooting you from so what do we do now until her lady special advisor tells us you mean just got ruined by a helicopter like these guys just what's this there's nothing there don't worry huh [Music] i want that range star again [Music] i just got ruined by that helicopter there it is it's got the top if we go up though we're going to be really exposed to the helicopter cell activity around here if they find the lab we're both screwed we've got to speed it up man go underneath this goes all the way around i like how usually the prompts are look here and the helicopter's just trying to beam me through the wall i'm not sure that's working as intended i like this animator look at that guy i need a rocket launcher was that body just hissing at me like a rattlesnake okay can i take out the helicopter with this 1v1 1v1 he doesn't want the smoke just follow the fdr until you reach the harbor lights pier would like to drive this oh fdr is the railway isn't it yeah franklin d franklin d roosevelt loser memes no i have to go up there we don't want that hey pelina what's up justin oversight this is i'm gonna take that vehicle i would like to see the baby show me the baby are you kidding i'm going how how did these cars just drive here if there's no way that isn't fair look i wanted to drive this they just jump off that there that ledge maybe uh draft seven this is azure one target is moving along the fdr on foot grid notation uh my favorite is niner can you intercept this is drab seven on the manhattan bridge manhattan bridge there we go he's a toast draft seven this is tara strickland on oversight our objective for this target is capture and interrogate i'm playing the options [ __ ] that noise this piece of [ __ ] took out half of cobalt section he dies here and now i didn't even see that truck where did it come from oh no what a flower [Music] there's one up on the bridge as well [Applause] interesting that it's you know giving me different penalties to fight against here i feel like you don't get this as much in in modern games they just put everything in front of you make it easy this is a cool level the mad hatter bridge don't know about that solano you had a 580 playing this what is that what did what card would i have had oh [ __ ] i don't remember that's cool maybe i had like a 480 2011. it's not like 800 ultra time what was that before this is drab two we saw him go down in the freeway collapse confirmed profit is still heading north on the fdr a lot of smoke and dust down there approach with caution all clear over here profit you hanging in there no i'm doing just fine there's a cell checkpoint up i'd love to require a vehicle do you copy oh your friends are dead john i had a 460. oh my i had a 580. i think i had a 4850 oh that was the amd one wasn't it maybe i did have a 4850 4850 was like the price performance card wasn't it was it still ati back then as well or had amd already bought ati at that point i don't remember all so long ago my memory is terrible as it is [Music] this whole underground section if i just explored a bit i would have found this x2 crossfire yeah yeah i think is right back then sli in crossfire made more sense if you could afford it um the scaling of it was a lot better nowadays i don't think it's worth doing at all oh damn it there's a big lady there prophet where are you man snag yourself a vehicle and get up here i don't know how long i can hold out we need reinforcements i'm gonna get past that can it see me i don't think you can see me i'll go stealth okay it's horrible oh i don't want to do that [Music] [Applause] we're taking significantly more bullets now to kill no dude don't jump there's no like vaulting through the window okay the ifv's onto me now [Applause] was not good in 2011. they've improved a little bit [Applause] that's the vehicle that i want i didn't kill that guy come on heading this way i'll be in touch okay all the battlefield practice is going to pay off now guys i promise that's where the game just lets you go home and do whatever you want what would have been so cool if this game had a multiplayer mode that was like from checkpoints nice water effects i feel like the water looks a lot better than it did in the original items in the tunnel you gotta break through man i'm done yeah it's hot he's in the tunnel got him i don't want to kill the helicopter with that lady and man it's just sheer destruction guys you can't damage me with normal bullets mere bullets will not hurt me maybe they will he's breached the roblox let's see if i'm sure okay i think it's dead guys i think it's dead we got it there's a helicopter here i don't wish i had first person as well really enjoyed this level so far games you actually remember this tunnel i don't i just have no recollection of this game even though i did play it all the way through i don't really remember it for options i mean who needs tactical options when i go on lab right let's be honest here danger nice i really needed this i thought i was screwed then we nice work though they actually got a flare up in the air then hey intron what's up john doe how many john does the do you think there are on youtube there's a lot i have to get out he's on foot repeat properly on foot how do you know as soon i don't feel like that's fair [Music] prophet listen i [ __ ] up oh no you have to help me oh no gold why heading out to this apartment an old girlfriend lent me it's not far you can meet me there sorry an old girlfriend lent you an apartment it's right there in the terminal on my desk lucky guy if they crack the access codes we're screwed you need to get in there and trash that computer hurry yeah that was a fun level i enjoyed that sniper time how do you guys remember this jason how do you like am i just stupid are my memory cells just worse than everyone else's oh [ __ ] they're in the lab get in there before they find anything i'm counting on you profit sniper check it out secure ledge grab how is the ledge grab a tactical option oh i think my game's crashed my game crashed that's the first crash right there sorry guys i'm reloading some people replay more than others maybe that's what it is flash [Music] do you think it's the fact that i only played it once and that's why [Music] the game didn't want me to play the sniper mission guys i was so ready to just start sniping but achieved with cryengine hopefully saved big f lots of f's in the chat that's fine right there oh [ __ ] they're in the lab get in there before they find anything i'm counting on you profit you get this guy sniper [Music] here's where it crashed smoke smoke what is it just smoke i mean what do you want from me i have to see this is it a smoke barrel defensive positions he's coming this way look at this these guys have got like wall hacks i just there's a guy here growing up it's crashed again does it just crash here guys i mean what's what's the situation here is this a common thing for people [Music] is this the area where it crashes we're gonna be vigilant don't worry we're loading it back up smoke grenades inside the building okay that's that makes sense uh matt thank you for the two [Music] can we get some more f's in the chat please guys [Music] you can use nano vision for thermal sniping it's my fault i will go it's not your fault janae don't worry it's fine yeah you had problems here too okay if you look at the water it crashes i go right that's the challenge then we're not going to look at the water we're just going to pretend the water's not there they're in the lab get in there before they find anything i'm counting on you but don't look at the water don't look at the water defensive positions get to the objective pretend it's not there water what water i don't know it's just a nice wall here that's all look at this wall wow incredible the detail such textures many pixels wow resolution wow i mean maybe you've trolled me but i don't care like this is it we just don't we don't look at the water that's how we win okay we're not looking at the water they just will hack you don't look at the water don't look at the water it doesn't exist it's not real it's not real close your eyes it's fine close your eyes just close your eyes there's no water what there's water guys no

splinter cell by the way i don't think it's anything official but on twitter this week there were rumors that ubisoft has finally started work on a new splinter cell game i don't know nothing is confirmed i don't know if any of that's true but i mean i'd love a new spin style game it's been far too long use the tree i don't know how to use the tree i'd like to use this a little bit and get

suit it's not far oh do we have to go get a crazy set up here too superannuated crying stock enough storage when i quit not as powerful as the lab but it'll have to do made of food you use a little crack there look at that that's gonna be drafty you want to get the diy guy around nice we've gone in the water no it's right across the flood barrier come on man come on man wait a question why are you doing right this must have been a tactical option from earlier which i have neglected because i refuse to look at the water i'm so scared that the game's going to crash what are you doing no dice oh i nearly fell down there where are the trolls today we don't really have trolls in this community read it's a really nice everyone here is really nice what is that guys you've literally just one comment in chat and i'm living in fear i don't think i need to waste my rustic launcher on that i will say on that guy instead sniper the fact that someone has just said in chat uh this part doesn't

you send it down gold hit me hit me oh my gosh rapid world record elevator this is a real elevator look at this meeple people people why does it go one two man you wouldn't believe that is that one day that's 24 hours one direction that one takes you down to one direction you're getting creamed that's the apple logo umbrella you're following the [ __ ] smart one chaos that's way more than two levels there it is profit man i'm glad you're here waiting's been creepy come on in quick let's get these doors locked again that [ __ ] you absorbed at the crash site it's lit up systems like a pinball man definitely viral same base structure as the nanoweave heartbreak must be nuts playing with that [ __ ] like it was kevlar right in there that was a weight delivery no same basic is out on the island just a bit less power do you want me to you want me to get in this okay i do have the whole trilogy assassination strickland man daughter of you know who some [ __ ] up [ __ ] right and hargreaves well who knows what's going on in his head [Music] [Music] what is this who are you did hargreaves send you here to find gold it's all i can do now see it's okay profit gave me the suit dude he gave me the suit i used to relax remember me relax it's fine [Music] clowns scare the crap out of me the only clown that scares me is pennywise that's a nice bolt georgie primary systems dude jesus just chill out do this anymore i'm not some spec ops hard man like you like prophet was that handles massive look besides that see how big that handle is big big handle uh i'm a geek conspiracy nut for christ's sake we've got a little octopus god damn it they're very intelligent they are profit was supposed to get us out the marines are coming for us now [Music] know what you think about cephalopods hmm dumb question right of course you don't well you want the dumbed-down version we're getting our asses kicked out there like tell mari [Music] no you ever wonder what the aztecs of the incas felt like when they saw smallpox for the first time i only thought it was magical right seen what it does yeah i'm saying it profit kept saying he'd found an answer to that clorox all right look that suit you're wearing it's built out of a self-repairing semi-organic stuff pushing me around patented by the hargreave rash corporation yeah that hargreave he designed the stuff profit was spec ops hargreave recruited him to wear the suit but he went awol came back talking something where's nomad from the first game and then a good point see that that's a viral sub routine running in the suits deep layers it's like living code and it's i don't know it's it's like it's rewriting itself to accommodate something new a fresh data pile maybe my best guess what you're looking at there is the bio coding for some kind of vaccine against the spore we have to get that stuff decoded and i can't do that here i just don't have the processing power i i need to just download more ram go to downloadmooram.com damn it the only place in new york that stuff exists isn't heartbreaking that's the windows progress bar that is the price never ever fills up and that's miles uptown it'd be suicide trying to get there right now with the seven what the [ __ ] they're here [ __ ] [ __ ] this is such a weird cutscene i'm sealing the doors i'll take the fire escape get out there and hold them up they coming through that door we have a man down oh it's bulletproof you put bulletproof glass on their [Music] windows what you reading what you reading you can't read it we are stuck in survival [Applause] ouch yeah that poor octopus [Music] listen alcatraz i ran a spike into cell cobs back there looks like they were going to take you to a command post in wall street i know the place it's a safe bet they've got a nano suit cradle there with deep scanned capacity we've got to take a look at the deep layers of your suit deep deep deep layers get to the wall street church that's where the tunnel comes up stick to the rooftops it'll be safer i'm taking another route i'll meet you there did you stab that man mid-four it certainly looked like it isaac yeah killing a man in the restroom is no no you know what film horrified me as a child because someone gets killed in a restroom it's got harrison ford in it and i think it's called witness and at the start of the movie this criminal follows someone into the restroom and then it's a kid or something and goes like cubicle to cubicle and then eventually gets the kid i've seen a lot of self because the kid sees the murder someone something like that but that traumatized me as a child because whenever i went into a restroom i was like i might die it's a restroom i've seen it in that movie this is a nice looking level reminds me the last of us nano suit shower oh my god it's definitely witness yeah i thought that's what it was called something hidden around here nope it's literally nothing but wow look at that skyline oh godzilla don't have to make a run for it i think i have to just do a running jump dice dice thank you okay i like that in world narrative storytelling direction leading that's the technical term for that that's what they call it basically visual cues directing the player where to go without putting something on the user interface approaching checkpoint delta requesting backup copy that hold firm emerald 3 is inbound i don't like bass i don't appear to be that dangerous see now people in the chat are saying good luck because this is some kind of really difficult part we're just having a nice chill experience here guys there's a rocket launcher another way to jump across hmm all right i'm gonna need i need a rocket launcher i don't think i needed to put nano vision on there you know ow [Music] maybe i can afford an upgrade now [Music] 700. it's oh hang on no there was one there increases ledge grab speed and reduces energy drain from sprinting and jumping okay i'll get this that did the job i think i got it no ammo literally killing everyone what's the critical threat if the critical threat was that lab i've already taken out the gunner so why would it say attach that's thank you very much it's mine now you forgot to guide the rocket i thought that one is just a dumb fireworks like the streets are sealed up pretty tight uh to see if you can get through one of the buildings don't get through that building a bit of ray tracing there hey look it's me real time ray tracing who'd have yay i look really small that doesn't make sense look when i aim here my head's there my head should be here i suppose in video games sometimes your eyes are in the center of the screen [ __ ] it's all changed place is crawling with cell uniforms they've got some kind of executive lockdown going on look i'll need some help getting past security i need you to create a diversion of the church draw troops away from wall street then you can slip through the emergency access tunnel meet me at the other end okay gold no problem i can do that i'll do anything for you gold what sniped do you get collapse in this game come on bro sniper they could just stay behind the bulletproof class oh it was telling me to snipe that guy i think that was the head play the high ground [Music] right in the nuts i'm not a fan of how the ai shoots at you through the walls though it's a bit weird like with that nano cell mod you can see when they do it and they do it quite a lot i watch somebody do it do it i'm right here you have to do it now what are you doing [Music] was that oh look at this cable an elect i'm program sure about that it doesn't feel very satisfying to use this oh huh but i'd rather use the gun that i had before i have to go steal one small look see yeah this works really well against the seth you're right i'm so glad that you guys are here and you remember everything way better than i do but now you said that it's unlocked the memory in my brain teamwork makes the dream work [Music] we have a secondary explosion at the church requesting immediate assistance roger that deploying reinforcements hold tight all right it's working but uh you're gonna be heading your way i need more don't i just permanently i just don't want any of that i don't want that laser sight ever again i think he's above me in there [Music] this is [Music] maximum means no hit markers there what this music's so good awesome love it anyone i recognize here this must be crytek right i recognize any of them i have a silencer for the sniper already i didn't realize that that could be useful [Music] oh there was a there's another door further down let's have a look then silencer cool hey cog that's way better thank you for the tip [Applause] we get into the tunnel now this song i used to listen to this on spotify on the soundtrack oh man there's a lot of enemies here he missed colby to reduce the damage maybe sensitivity is way too high yeah when they hit me with that k-vault thing it instantly drains my shield i'll do the job all right make your way through i'll see you on the other side okay they've got stealth mode now don't worry i've got fred's division it's fine silence everything silent shotgun could do a science shotgun what the hell is that a lamp why is there a lamp there [Music] and these guys go invisible on me reduces damage but you can get head shots and they won't know from where good option when you're on the high ground thank you ian what difficulty just regular difficulty difficulty it's the most sophisticated combat hardware around it does reduce the damage with that needs real-time logistical support and that was my job set up like that i got real close to profit so i know that if he put you in that suit he had a purpose for you we've got to get you into that cradle scan the suits deep layer i don't think you could just silence an rpg [Music] has anyone actually made that technology where you can fire a rocket from a launcher or some kind of missile system but it's quiet has anyone is that even possible because you need enough of a horse and an explosion's always going to make noise isn't it you could muck a little bit maybe but i don't think you could silence moving troops away from wall street this is our chance now listen i'm gonna find a way in through the lower levels your best bet is to uh break in through the roof but hurry man find a way into the cell facility can't make that jump i don't know i've got a suppressor on this though oh that's really good what's this what's this what's this it's magic in the uh what's this this how can you even see me right that ai spotted me through a solar panel which i can't see through that doesn't seem fair i will make a run for it it was you all along how could you do that to me [Music] [Applause] they're on the roof on the roof stealth it's just the same version isn't it just got a sniper on it okay let's go over there stop using game lock nano save a green future emerald people actually do that is that a thing wow did that just hit the tree really oh my god i'm sure i had some grenades i see you last one that would be very sad it would eric wouldn't it it would be very sad i bet people do it though i mean i know some games have accessibility options which you know that's fine like they're built in so people who aren't very good on controller or you know maybe they've got you better get down here fast accessibility problems controlling things they don't have much time they have essentially aimbots for the game the last of us has that red dead redemption 2 has that [Music] what is that the deagle [Applause] cool imagine if i killed myself then i actually would have just uninstalled the game i would have done [Music] c4 around the corner on my left chat look at this chat you guys i don't understand how you guys remember this little c4 knocking at your door the hell was that he's in the building [ __ ] off [Applause] use monitor [Music] nice i don't know the code yeah you can grab people you can grab people in the first chrysler skate as well you just go over to them and press f and you like grab their throat it is running pretty smooth juggling yeah like this elevator music art how did you get mate this is it now look don't don't shoot anyone in there all right okay fine i'm gonna need some technical support with the new cradle software you ready let's do it go i don't like his voice actor no no no no no strap me in coach you guys are talking about an elevator easter egg where you can see people dancing i don't more ballistic trauma to the sternum the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae he's a corpse walking gould without the suit look at that it's like it's growing into the wounds actually merging with the tissue i want you to focus on the deep layers of the suit right down into the substrate there's something going on down there looks like some kind of added data pile right opening the buffer space preparing for deep skin not the deep scan this is a memory from profit alcatraz that's your name alcatraz i'm trying to it's transmission man it's sending out a [ __ ] broadcast nice moves ethan get this door open you leave me alone nice got men all over the downtown 69. and here you are already trust and tie yeah trust and tight enough he doesn't need to be dead right yeah right wrong with his eyes commander lockhart you will stand down now he's dead geyser i'll say is that andrew wilson no it's not get him up harvest strickland was your first ever crush in a video game vladimir nathan gould always a pleasure you think people say each other's full names in real life like this i've never done that to anyone you better power him down before you let him out of that thing she looks really angry be a pleasure andrew [Music] hey sal what's up just so you know prophet you walk slow you play nice gonna have this jammed in your ear the whole way out you give me any trouble i'm gonna take your hand i'll take your damn head off now get up oh don't [ __ ] with me prophet get up and work go on get out of that chair as a matter gould i'd have thought you'd be happy now the great big evil conspiracies finally bite your ass jesus tara if your father could see you now working for these [ __ ] yeah well my father's dead now shut your [ __ ] mouth oh my god that went not to 100 real quick smart tara you do realize this isn't profit don't you it's just some grunt the suit was keeping me alive i kind of need it you heard it's such a different game to the first crisis get him across to the prison walk him in there he's hungry's problem now connor jack what the hell is the new battlefield okay so prehistoric dinosaurs with time-traveling marines what in tarnation what is that [Music] so [Music] yeah the writing could be a bit better deal hey chase i'm good thank you maximum armor come on alcatraz hit it assistance just rest myself again another one [Music] that's the t2000 alien oh [Music] get the grenade launcher [Music] i'm sorry it wouldn't let me pick it up there's one more let's see [Applause] did you see that my acog side just started floating off oh no i'm gonna drink but that's handy oh that's not handy it was a bit terminated wasn't it [Music] [Music] this is what i paid for this is why i've got insurance [Music] love that crush enemies with a single blow [Music] i'm in the matrix now with profits this is crisis one eyes and covert okay profit keep your team alive by all means that's a loyalty i fully understand i applaud it in fact but your primary function is to report back to me here all of us time for the whole human race to wake up [Music] recovery i don't believe we've been introduced jack hargreaves i'm morgan freeman at your service add your service i don't doubt nathan fools is in his head i'm bound to assume i don't remember there being so many customs but we have other more pressing concerns right now we have to get you weaponized and up to speed so you're currently standing not far from the diseased bureaucratic heart of the city and while you think airlifting all the politicians out should have a cleansing effect sadly what's replaced them isn't any better but don't take my word for anything why should you trust must be earned go on and see for yourself i'll guide you as best i can but you've got to get right down into that filthy diseased part there's something down there you're going to need nice weather effects i remember being absolutely blown away playing the first crisis game and i think it's the penultimate level you go into a zero gravity alien nest and you're kind of floating through it and fighting things and even though my pc at the time ran at like 20 fps i had to play it on auto graphics and at the time to me it looked like a cgi cutscene like you were playing a cgi cutscene it was that good fine the graphics nothing wrong with me i need to try on the remastered version i might get a save file or something load it up but it doesn't look anywhere near as good as i remember though it's like goldeneye yeah when i was 12 years old i thought the golden eye looks amazing graphics are never going to get as good as this and then you look at it now and there's literally like 10 polygons and jay's bonds head is a square and it also ran at like 15 fps so there you go nice i can't even get up there cleaning up it's ingenious isn't it two years ago all the british bse outbreak in the last i remember the bsa outbreak the issue was nice i wanted to go to mcdonald's in the uk it was easily done the problem was disposal what do you do with the millions of rotting corpses well there you see the answers the sev have involved they wipe us out they break us down they reduce the environmental impact almost to zero exemplary the sc was weird i think i was about eight or nine and everyone in the uk was scared to eat beef it was called mad cow disease and they thought that the beef was poisoned or something and it would give you a disease that's the stealth shotgun i feel like i should actually you know what yes you see i'm going to switch out my biomass processing system for what purpose well that is quite the question repulsive yes but quite fascinating ow maybe i should have kept snipe driving i don't think i can see me you think with the big aliens and way more technically advanced enough plus they would have the same nano technology i have to see invisible people but they don't it does make the game a lot easier yourself love your artwork on youtube who's the artist this guy called taisel of bleeding edge experimental military hardware loose on the streets though i suppose if you just go stealth and you don't kill them you don't get these do you you don't get the seals [Music] oh wow look at this observe you should be able to make out some exposed elements of the alien structure from where you are now the ship blockheart's pilot shut down today somewhere above ground look for anything resembling a tower or a silo they make horrible noises you need sniper here yeah and i've switched it out so dj uh [Music] oh they turn yellow look around you alcatraz look at this ecology have you ever wanted to visit an alien planet this may be as close as you'll ever come if only we had more time you still have time logan i made it through i don't like how sprinting takes your energy away what are they doing like burying into the earth or something little c4 knocking at your door it's not a big lad that's just turned up bad [Applause] there's a regular guy in front of me and stealth kill this guy don't know if i can do a takedown on the the big lad over there it looks too chunky oh god i regret my decision [Music] you dead sounds so cool two c4 charges kills them yeah i'll keep that in mind if i find one again 500 there off the big lad suppress the sound of footsteps dude that's pretty good i think i mean the game is much more interesting now isn't it it's way more fun fighting these aliens in this kind of environment rather than the typical grunts just in new york or it is for me at least this looks epic [Music] that's the main theme that's the thing that i remember the most about this game the music the dod planned to bomb out the ross and flood barrier and drown the lower city in an attempt to wipe out the seven no no in all probability this insanity is gonna go ahead despite my protests and i don't want you underground when it does you must get to the heart of the alien structure with all speed alcatraz and then exit we don't have much time we don't have much time [Music] you want cloak tracker very important for lane okay unless you see invisible aliens i guess right that makes sense iconic violin yeah it is i mean han zimmer it's hit after here it's a cheap earth what can't he do god knows i'm going to start something a bad soundtrack for a movie or a game what we're dealing with here probably answers to the equivalent of an insect high the level of alien infestation in these tunnels is likely to be high find reeves and his men i lost contact when they entered the subway system but watch yourself son i want you out of there in one piece [Music] i kind of wish there was more weapon variety in this i don't see any enemies oh yeah i can't wait to go and see june enabled it's just come out in the uk today i think vilniu makes just epic movies like runners 2049 is excellent sicario as well very good enabled how's the gas price in the uk it's going up quite a lot [Music] i got a letter in the mail a couple days ago from my gas suppliers saying that it's increasing so come on obama it's gonna explode [Music] [Music] i feel like i could have done that a bit better but we got a few kills there some of the nano stuff do you only play shooter games no i play other games as well play all sorts of games strategy games mobas action adventure games i don't really play choose your own adventure games like or real times well no i used to play a lot of real-time strategy games when i was younger longer yeah i've just shrunk when i was younger i can't talk today i think i'm just tired before the next thing play fifa occasionally [Music] well that explains why their toms went a y 69 we all make sacrifices see if you can find their scanning here might give us a little advance warning of what we're heading into here what mobas i played a lot of dota 2 league of legends off youtube i don't know if people would watch it on my channel i really like darling though it's good [Applause] [Music] no enemies here aside from tara strickland he was the best i had from the look of the rpg mass effect mass effect 2 is one of my favorite games i didn't really get into dragon age that much i'm really gonna enjoy the new knights of the old republic remake though because i never played the original and all my friends said it's really good [Music] i think that just wanted me to move back so it didn't damage me excellent now we need to get you inside the central structure the only pokemon games i've played we're ready reeves and his team managed and then after that i just couldn't get into it i just like the original 150 pokemon and then after that i'm just like the resulting to be fair from red and blue oh yeah i had red and blue i was in the playground at school with my link cable [Music] wow level design is so cool you've really seen me straight away okay [Music] i played a little bit of dragon age origins didn't complete it though this looks like luton newton's really fallen by the wayside um i need to get that big blood down there he just messes me up should be a sniper around here somewhere on a ledge ian your memory is impeccable and i'm just farming these right now there's the big lab so 2c4 you say see if i can find this sniper rifle that's one of the alien weapons how do you use is it right click [Applause] [Music] um what i lied to you guys told me 2c4 or is this a different enemy that's a different enemy maybe that's a different anyway no grenades 500 i wonder if one of my c4 didn't properly connect there so cool i'll jump up why is my emblem on need for speed heat because they asked me if i wanted to put it in there there you go that's why that seems to be working good but you'll need to repeat the procedure with the other spokes that should bring the whole system up to full pressure cheeky i think i'm going to get back at the top now this way [Music] 2100 air stomp that sounds cool we have a sniper rifle show us all on that run he said walk past me hey don see you later sandwich at least i have a sniper rifle now i bet this game is so hard on the ice difficulty setting [Music] is there going to be another big lad here i don't know low low here for a second my energy back oh no it was quite satisfying to use that gun there's a big lad there [Music] is he gonna know his name can you stealth kill the big guys surely not you're too easy wouldn't it can i do this objective without him saying good you're having the desired effect but you have to hurry those fools at the pentagon getting ready to act yeah you're right all the games don't hold your hand as much i like that thing i like the exploration element of video games that's gone in a lot of modern aaa titles okay it smells quite tanky [Music] he's different warcraft 3 i didn't play much warcraft 3 and i know that dota was a mod for warcraft but i just didn't really play it ever i was just more interested in dota to be honest old school rts i used to love it but i played so many of those type of games that i feel like i just got bored of them even when the new starcraft came out i just i didn't really get into it i must prefer tactical strategy games now like mobas didn't realize there's one right there i think that was close to death there the hell you're giving orders what's it doing bro one is so tanky i did try out world warcraft yeah i just rocket this guy get around behind him rocking about 20 seconds in just gonna steal fast i've gone 0j what the hell good now let's see what the suit will do sounds a bit like jfk sometimes excellent recognition communication exchange the protocols are compatible is the pc melting no it's pretty chill ah more resistance than i expected you'd better would you excuse me please am i ready to smash battlefield next month of course i'm interested to see if they make any changes to the specialists because the couple that they revealed yesterday like i don't know a lot of those abilities are just way too good alcatraz listen to me very carefully the decision is made the bombers are in the air get out of there i've dispatched a helicopter to pick you up but you'll have to move quickly get to higher ground hurry i'm out i need some ammo that's it the barrier is down run alcatraz you've got to get out alive you and that suit are our only hope uh tsunami okay well that's ruined [Music] yeah i'm gonna play the hell out of yeah 2042 [Music] i'll be streaming it pretty much every day after it's out i think just hardcore [Music] you missed it there collector you're in poland fishing when the base was out it was on for four days it was quite short bazer must be somewhere around here get that tracking gizmo just one more fishes and if you didn't drown in the way [ __ ] pentagon can you believe that ship can it marie there over there so it's chino man remember me that's a cool looking gun what the hell happened to you i feel like that's an english person doing an american accent it's chino man remember me sounds like that nice suit man that fifth avenue you'd be shopping without me get to it we've got to move someplace more secure we're sitting ducks here yeah no [ __ ] man assist delta reach the extraction point keep it tight isn't this [Music] get yourself some firepower you're gonna need it you coming lads oh is that a grenade launcher ghost attachment grenade launcher i'll try this bad boy don solo thank you for becoming a member it's very kind of you hey mr udaho what's up toby oh there's the arm of the statue of liberty what's that doing here [Music] marines what are you doing taking ages [Music] are they so slow lads come on i've got a nano suit it's fine delta three coffee give me a zero read you sir you've got squid and coming from all sides gotta get some place more secure oh that's not good yeah we got him just stay put we're coming to you all right but make it fast we're outnumbered here you heard the man let's go well it's starting to move a bit now looks like he uh missed the restroom shoot one of them no darius we can't our friends teachers oh squiddies stay back demon be gone with you we can't keep going it's fine don't worry maximum armor is no recall isn't it basically no recall turn the script on and there's nothing [Music] down here i don't want to try this grenade launcher excuse me was he invisible i'm gonna need my uh nano vision aren't i [Music] don't like it quite powerful little pistol this no i know what's the design of them they remind me a little bit of the aliens from independence day you know the one that's in the chamber and it's like oh peace oh you're gonna give me a rocket launcher it's please late no peace i haven't seen that maybe for ages it's a great film oh c4 huh boom good grenade that was a cool section enjoy that the snipers up there i might stick with my uh what do i have i really like that though um okay i'll go get the sniper dude just chill all right regroup and reload we're gonna hold this position underweight reinforcements next one i'll switch it out for the unica go back down there i could have ripped that off as well it's cool that there are so many options in the level you know it's a bit it's a bit sandbox i feel like as the games progressed it's much more like the original crisis a bit more open world still linear but more options compared to the start of the game where you were just fighting marines in the streets uh don thank you for the three no way we can push through with that secure this place alcatraz listen man the rally points about six blocks up that one ahead they just say listen rip i don't like the look of this [Music] if it's at all possible do you think you can please try to exercise some caution at the risk of sounding melodramatic watch the sky watch the sun goodbye i was handed i think the rocket that i hit actually push that chip back didn't use any grenades then either waste where you going mate oh this is the medium difficulty how much have i got now so i need another 4 800 to get that really big upgrade stay back are you good check i'm not missing anything oh there's a lot of differences to the original simone ray tracing to start with makes a big difference the lighting and reflections i think side by side you could probably tell like maybe watching a youtube stream i could understand why you might think that there's some i think it was eurogamer or pc gamer did a breakdown of it all and uh some really good features crysis 3 though looks the best i nearly got killed then have some of this mate [Music] there's a guy sniper is quite effective against this pretty much two shot the grunts i was sliding tactical option doesn't really make sense to me that this is true we need immediate assistance okay so we're gonna have to take that obviously any time our point is call sign out see what's up here first he'll be with you momentarily little c4 no guns there's got to be something up there look at this sniper rifle the rocket launcher i want some new guns sound effects are really crunchy yeah yeah i don't know if they've changed anything with the sound effects i don't think so he just switched like old school battlefield oh that was close oh [Music] oh that isn't good i'm gonna have to hitch this can i take it can i take that with me yeah whoa the animation was kind of busted [Music] hey gabby yeah

know when he's green is he regenerating health they dealt with him oh [ __ ] [ __ ] push ahead to the lc i thought there might be a rocket launcher what the hell is that i'm really confused by that i need more see if i can find another rocket there nope oh cyclops 7 is down repeat cyclops 7 is down that doesn't sound good we're almost there be advised alcatraz i'm afraid events are currently escalating beyond my control your suit is working at the sport now building a bio-coat bridge between our technology and the seps the lock on missile launchers we must have more time go with your fellow marines do what you can i have not abandoned you alcatraz snipe the crystal oh you mean in the ship drop ship incoming [Music] holy crap see why it's called the swarmer area coming from the

i have to reload it lads was that a waste i felt like that was dead all the grenades so many grenades number launches around good job why is there an explosive barrel there oh i could have dropped that on them i see over here i enjoyed that nice little 13 hour scenario so mctavish glad you made it no problem come on we've gotta get to the central station hopefully i'm reaching your comrades too with this i've bounced this signal off your suit to their cops who the [ __ ] is that my name is jacob hargreen mr hargrave now you may or may not be aware that alcatraz's suit is evolving into a powerful fire weapon against the aliens you face but in order to complete that process a stabilizing agent is required alcatraz you must go immediately to the hargreave rashfield uploading coordinates now take your colleagues with you you will need their support please make haste all of you the seth will not wait on us let's go liz am i going to finish the campaign today i don't think so i mean how long is it i don't i don't remember the grieve rash building but the main entrance is blocked with rubble and the building is in lockdown [Music] security systems show the parking levels appear to be at least partially unlocked and from there you should be able to work seven hours long there's no way i'm gonna do it today or five and a half hours [Music] elevator and staircase access is currently denied but you'll be able to access a systems repo from the security desk in the lobby you'll need to hurry hey what i'm very good thanks alcatraz this way man come on our grief rash buildings just up this way look at this i think chino is going to be following me because he runs at about one mile an hour i don't see any contact you know there's a contact i should have stayed lucino oh i just killed my marine i'm sorry that could have gone really badly hey channel let's go come on team waits for no man all right son the building is security center you'll have to blast your way in through the parking ballots samples wing on the 11th floor you'll need to get up there through this dragon that's the only thing i hate when i'm in there stupid advert on tv i am being hammered by something here i mean there's so many bad guys here fine you can't see me tactical option hello tactical oh no second time i've died there all right son the building is secure i didn't even see this parking garage the bio protocol sound i've been way better wouldn't it search wing on the 11th floor you'll need to get up there through the lobby [Music] go this way instead i'll be back i don't know why i went up there didn't really need to go there every machine gun hello oh no maybe that was a mistake fish fish that sound like they're just going fish fish [Music] [Music] nice fish fish where's that machine gun in the back [Music] what's under the ground is it okay in the parking lot the garage is sealed alcatraz you need to flash your way in [Music] i lost my hmg huh yes 6 100. section what the hell do you think you're doing this is jacob i order you to cease fire blow it out your [ __ ] man prophet nothing what is that hello [Music] this is a new gun [Music] i like this hmg that's cool you're fools [Music] this is my new favorite gun it's just time to rest hey nice to meet you huh [Music] i feel so op now compared to these guys like fighting the aliens is a bit more of a challenge [Music] i'm making a big deal about this hmg on there matthew can you explain why you use such a high dpi for shooters most used around 400. um i use 1600 for competitive games competitive fps games like for this i'm just using 400 it's not you know but the reason i use high dpi is because sorry i never got killed then i use high dpi because the higher your dpi the lower your latency and input lag but this has come about recently in like the last 12 months or so [Music] people have actually done tests on this where they've discovered that if you use higher dpi you have lower latency are we talking milliseconds of course but in a competitive game like counter strike or ballerina warzone battlefield milliseconds can be the difference between life and death on many occasions so that's why so you go with a higher dpi and you lower your in-game sense and you'll get the most responsive experience possible also turn on stuff like nvidia reflex play high hurts 240 hertz if you can is that a full shotgun okay right now it's giving me now it's giving me the weapons that um are interesting assaults go can you put scope on that there we go remake of bf3 that would be sick box only i mean you could say that portal is a remake of bf3 in a lot of respects obviously it doesn't have single player but at least it's gonna have two maps at launch take him down gentlemen maximum force i want this abomination ended now what are you doing lockhart why can't i shoot [Music] [Music] the elevators and security gates are all offline the video [Music] someone else did one as well there's a couple of australian youtubers who do really great reviews on mice and peripherals and they make machines to test the amount of input like so science behind it i've recorded daisy it's not just hearsay [Music] i remember you from crisis one [Music] hey john is it the same on series x um i think pc is the only version that has ray tracing of the remaster i don't know but there are a lot of other upgrades that you'll benefit from for this game are you talking about mouse centers i'm sorry i can't hold here repeat cannot hold here i'm pulling the squad back to central station get there if you can man all right [Music] here's something stomping around it's that thing we just saw fall back go go what the hell is going on there [Music] oh man that looks awesome this is delta six debate we need backup now we have civilians [Music] delta 6 this is echo 10 we are on route to your nope don't look at come me i think i could have done some more damage at the side if i'd have hit it in the back this is delta six debate we need back up now we oh [Music] you could just choose it like this [Music] you stealth mode go to the tall building for more jewels hold on cuz it keeps like [Applause] i should use the tactical option shouldn't i you can see me so i'm not stealth then maybe i wasn't oh he doesn't like me up there i presume [Music] did i get it oh i think i've got it it was a double c4 throw

it's done you have at most one hour to make your way back here after that i just learned splendor yeah that's all speed is of the essence gentlemen we are leaving town the nanites yeah i think i missed it for some reason they can see you in stealth cool right i think i'm going to leave it there for today guys this is fun i mean i've much enjoyed the second half of what we've played much more
