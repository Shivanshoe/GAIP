this is the new gun vector for this side anyway on the other side they've got the p90 i've only got two more points to spend okay or extended mag no i want a sight on it don't i damn it flash hider red dot sight quick draw grip that's all i can afford really isn't it and i have a flash pistol no armor don't have any more points okay we'll go with that welcome back to insurgency sandstorm i've not played this in a while everyone is crouching slowly up and down i believe that's what they call it but yeah one of my members in a live stream suggested that i play this and thought okay then let's do it and just have this big update where they put a new map in two new guns vector and p90 do you throw a grenade there is there a guy here or something i'm coughing boom there was a guy there ow good smoke grenades by the way if i flash in here how do i play this game oh god i'm sorry maybe i should go a different way i don't know what's over this side though it could be pain probably is now if you haven't played this game before it's a very hardcore tactical pvp game it does have co-op as well but oh look at this guy what a beard i don't really play card that much but the team have actually got a already which is good oh that's a dead guy i don't know if this is the ideal range either for a vector oh god dude you need to chill out you're gonna get shot there's someone there how did that guy die it looked like the shots were coming from there the deuce i'm so confused i'll use the smoke push up this is the way this is the way that's it hold mouse one get a lucky kill with the vector i think there's a significant amount of artillery coming in right now as well i could try and get on the point jeez what the is that an enemy i think that's an enemy we are capturing it too so maybe this isn't a bad spot right here i can hear them oh god oh the quick switch love that energy did i see people down there i think so go prone oh that's sick that sounds awesome more enemies down here yes i need to load i think we're good guys i think we can get in jump oh no you can't grab on it's hang on that guy just say they got bob i'll give him that no we can't just give away bob like that bob was a fundamental part of our team and you just stoned him down the drain unacceptable i took a few people out we pushed up is that a gun ship oh my god that's awesome how could it go is someone actually piloting that i don't remember how it works in this game i used to play it when it was a half-life mod years and years ago it used to be on the source engine oh my goodness speed reload that and then they won't stand alone with it for sandstorm this looks really dodgy doesn't it and i think it's on console now too as well pretty sure it's on console i've not tried it on console so don't know how it plays over there yes just gonna have a quick trigger finger and you can rule the world in this game i feel like there was a heyday a honeymoon period of mods though for half-life it was like counter-strike their defeat team fortress ricocheted you guys remember ricochet and that became its own game as well didn't it although that was nowhere near as popular as some of the other games that i just mentioned what the artillery there was a mod as well that i would love i would absolutely love to come back called the specialists and a funny story actually that's just reminded me i met one of the developers of this game insurgency sandstorm at e3 2016 maybe i want to say you know when there was still preview in the game that guy had actually worked on the specialists back in the day that was so cool but the specialist was a mod where you could play as action heroes so you could be like people from die hard the matrix john woo films that kind of thing you'd die through the air akimbo pistols but it also had melee as well like katanas and throwing knives it was so sick and it had a function in it where the whole server could go slow motion because there were these tokens that you picked up on the ground it was brilliant honestly some of the most fun i've had when i was growing up playing games my game crashed and my recording ended and i've had to join another server so we're playing on this one now called bab but as i was saying about the specialists i don't know if they're even making that anymore is it a thing i don't know but someone should bring that back make it like um unreal engine 5 specialists i'd pay a lot of money for that look at this guy what the soggy sock that's my thumbnail right there coolest looking guy i've ever seen in the business that must be a skin or something so this is still push isn't it do i have to attack or defend here i think i'm defending because i can't really push up that much there's an enemy there did i get a kill oh apparently i've got two kills then just from that random spray two kills okay okay well that wasn't the best start oh my god look at the mutton chops on that guy yeah hans mcgruber legendary that's a snow map i've not played this one before i've definitely not played this i would remember it or would i my memory is fading by the day what's up k-dog what are we doing here okay dog your album i see oh god i'm a flashbang i do hopefully i don't mess it up like i did last time [Music] so i presume that that kills me doesn't it if i stay there long enough can i go in here i'm not even allowed in there this is the corridor of death here isn't it ow that you squeeze no you're dead i think i saw someone up there oh my god guys they're running through he made it he made it he's dead i'm at the top here cool your vector is much better than mine look at that it's crashed again does this happen okay apparently this is a thing i just went on reddit looked it up and i ran my game as administrator and maybe that will fix it what is this am i defending i'm defending again okay i've got the p90 now too which is cool that helicopter just got destroyed and landed right here so what's the p90 like that oh my god the helicopter's right there [Applause] whoa oh pink it's gone disappeared instantly oh god yeah i'm not really a big fan of defending but i'll do it if i have to oh my god yes yes i was about to say has it got a lot of recall on it is that flash what was that grenade you killed me you got me psych what the hell oh kick from server anti-cheat authentication timed out dice what's going on okay i can't seem to catch a break we're on another server now at least we're getting a nice tour of some of the maps eh i'm not played on this one either at all and now we're back with the vector i got a taste of the p90 a little taste tasted good until i was kicked because my cheats weren't working properly so i've disabled the cheats now and we should be good you know i had the whole suite on wall hack aimbot aim assist x2 soft aimbot hard aimbot double aimbar x-ray wall hockey sp wallhack trick trigger aim off i don't i don't even know what i'm saying anymore god mode add that on as well no clip that was on [Music] strafe inbound oh that's not good yeah i said you throw that grenade to mogus we just can't just see shells in oh draw them in the head i'm in trench system this is where we go full auto left right okay we're good grenade who knows what that was it was something again no knowledge of the map enemies all around me probably gonna die within the next five four three two one i was waiting to see if that guy team killed me you know that would have been perfect apparently we won we did it not that i helped one kill one death should we try one more we'll try one more okay another new map are we ready i think we're ready good to go we're defending we're good to go no crashes no hacks nice gas mask everyone's here everyone's ready it's fine which way do they come from that way this way oh that sounds dangerous that is very dangerous [Applause] are they dead [Applause] that was pathetic can we use this what that what the flip just haloed it they got alpha ruined hang on so that means that they're all in there right now so there could be some severe backrage kills here there's one alpha's locked are they still upstairs [Music] two there was just two i think that's it three oh no i'm well in the restricted area now i'm not going to make it tony come on we've got some defending to do there's an open window there oh god okay i think that's it i think that's everything on the point isn't it yeah we're good good job scooby dooby yo this guy looks sick what the hell is that an m240b m249 what the scooby oh excuse me sir i think that wasn't anyway yeah it was seize the last objective this little cave here hey stupid stupid stupid everyone's stupid i'm going to be in the cave here and then i'm going to ambush people this is going to be great okay i haven't heard anyone and it's been about 10 years oh there's a guy there sniper you said say good night yes the vectors actually got some range on it can you it's just insults isn't it 24 7 insults when you play on defense i didn't think the vector would have that much range on it [Applause] no one here is there oh that's not good [Applause] where you going come back [Applause] that's an enemy as well yes quick reload i love playing up at the front like this oh there's someone coming just that little gap there i can hear them they see me oh here they come oh this feels so cheeky triple kill let's go this vector is amazing what though that was a cheeky little spot wasn't it i don't think i had enough damage there it's crashed again oh my god
