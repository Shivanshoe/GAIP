hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to part two of the uncharted walkthrough so we played the game for three hours yesterday and i think we got to chapter eight something like that and right now we just headed to scotland and i think we're looking for the grave of avery there's apparently some secrets here so without further ado let's get into it and see where the story takes us scottish cathedral strange place to bury your treasure though not really i mean by the time avery would have sailed here the place was already abandoned i guess that's true plus with the massive bounty on his head it'd be a good place to hide so uh what happened between you and rafe i couldn't deal with him i'm pretty sure he'd had enough of me i'm still coming to grips with your uh death and with his frustration from not finding the treasure i'm pretty sure he was ready to kill me by the time i bailed imagine what he want to do to you now yeah trying not to well i mean we did see him no he didn't see me sam listen he's ruthless even more so than when we teamed up with him we're sliding down here that's the wrong way i thought there might be a rope swing or something around there that we could latch onto obviously not maybe i just missed it sam show me the way we'll go back up that one look like it hurt though didn't it what are they doing over there it is a good start isn't it it's a great start we can't climb up there maybe we just go like this yeah it was that simple they've got like a crate down there or something hey this should hold good call the hell is all this it's excavation equipment shoreline what look i thought they were just by the cathedral hmm [ __ ] we got one of them why aren't they like these weird white costumes you think that's just camouflage okay we're good yeah nice to meet you too shoreline seems like they were expecting us and like they're searching away from the cathedral which means we should get to that graveyard pronto exactly they're in weird jumpsuits why didn't you guys search beyond the cathedral oh we did a little this place is so big oh wow and where to look like shooting in the dark what is this place the monks had several living quarters main one being by the graveyard of course location location location more shoreline equipment at least no shoreline errs hmm well maybe we'll get lucky and they'll blow themselves up now what do you bet yep dynamite boom be careful with that stuff huh it's fine isn't it bang hey got the door open that was very loud hopefully they didn't hear us well hopefully we just blend in with the other explosions yeah it's way up through the roof ah that's too high for a boost though let's find something to climb on yeah there's gonna be a box around somewhere that we can push sam's gone right up here he's just kicking the box that's cute it is just high up all the time isn't it all the time what are you doing sam i think i got something here oh he's found something hey what about that car we can use that [Music] hey you can use this to climb out of that building how we gonna get it off here dynamite again unless i could just push it through yeah he's not crazy unfortunately put that down that's that's not the right one is it yeah i suppose we've got to find some more dynamite any dynamite i wonder if it's just back where we were before in this box yeah there we are sam watch out fire in the hole there you go take that door pretty good with that stuff well i've blown a lot of [ __ ] up over the years he's very good at blowing things up isn't he out nathan yeah i mean you could give me a hand sam right how difficult this is sam [ __ ] sure there's no long grass here that we could use keep your safeties could i use the dynamite yeah either way the orders are the same i wanted to go explosive today you know oh that was good oh he's right next to me ah i think there was a dude above me as well shooting at me didn't see him perhaps i should attempt to do that stealthy let's have a look try this way instead that guy climbing up hmm no way i imagine that oh my gosh i've got an ak now just keep coming right should we go loud i throw a dynamite out oh there's another one back there alright we'll jump over now hey boys nope too late for that nice shooting song grenade i love how it goes no no no no reminds me of uh transformers bang everything's fine so i'm okay let's go all right nicely done that could have been bad yeah let's get out of here before anyone checks in on them that wasn't bad i mean that was that was pretty bad if you ask me right we're full so let's push the box over there and get through that little hole in the roof now are you gonna help me this time sam no you just don't care do you okay there come on let's go good hope you come some hey blasting more stuff over here swingy okay got it yeah it's very dangerous nathan you okay fine i'm good just follow me i can hook that there i think we have to go around maybe [Music] right we'll run across and then jump look at the sounds that you make you can do that what are you talking about i taught you that move all right let's see it then here he comes you see that's clumsy clumsy uh so where to now oh that didn't that didn't look right that's how did he even do that can i pull that down can't reach do it have to wait for some sam what are you doing sam please oh that's a dead end i can't jump up there that just kind of looked like you could scurry up there try dropping down sam please maybe that was the right way i just feel like sam should have been up there with me so we could help each other can't go around on the left can't go up sam there's a ladder just out of reach hey hold up yeah i knew it i was just waiting for sam the game didn't catch up with me all right give me a boost there we go get up there son the struggle is real come here i'll pull you up always introducing new mechanics aren't they go thanks all right there it is among storm there's the hop skip and a jump away ah don't jinx us jinx no such thing here we go a little those are fun look at the rocks the attention to detail very good it's fine i can do this all day you go where the money leads you that's cold it gets colder i'm going to take a leak while you educate our young recruiter oh so what happened with our help he kept it at base once money ran out there's no reason for us to stick around anymore whatever gets us more action i could use a good coup right now tell me about it sam you get the one yeah right i was gonna say help me out i'm gonna have to do better than that fellas let's see if we can keep this up all right sneaky beaky there's no way to distract in this game is there you can't do a whistle or anything you two done prepping the site the cemetery is ready for rich boy's visit there's an explosive barrel there she wants them yesterday have they found anything but they uncovered some stuff but i don't know the detail i like their voices a lot but i climb up to that ledge and do an assassin's creed style takedown to say [Laughter] i might be in trouble here oh no it's okay heads up when you left i pull him down beautiful there's a guy here as well nope you didn't see anything okay i think i think the jig is up the guy behind me saw me oh those takedowns are so cool could i just hide under here and then go away maybe there's a guy right above me yeah they've lost me now can't jump up there well they're on alert mode what is that look at that pistol [Music] it's a big revolver or something [Music] that's cool it looks like a unica that guy's got a shotgun let's get the high ground all right that's all that ammo gone i still got the dynamite forgot about that boom that was [Laughter] yeah definitely move on that was really messy at least we've killed a load of people today all right like that's that's fine i don't see an issue with that i could have used those explosive barrels as well this way i'm coming some i think that's the most action that we've had in the game so far shimmy along here huh big swing here perfect derrick i don't think they have bounce pads in this game right beyond those walls couldn't make that jump that's shingle so we can't go up there oh we're not going to jump this ravine down we go yeah we gotta go down and around easy boom i nearly pushed our entire crew what do you think nadine would do to you i was following her order still what do you think she'd do turn me inside out yeah exactly take some deep breaths and go walk it off stroppy prick thinks he can tell me how to do my job he's right there dude he can hear you i'd say just turn away he nearly had me got him all right let's keep going get the ammo i don't know if i could slide down and around there look at that view it is a nice view isn't it could get to this and then jump up slide down jump on that maybe that didn't work jump on that one that's it i love the detail in that shingle the way that you see it slide down okay nothing to latch onto there that's the way we came yeah so we've got to get on top of that one there i suppose we could slide across like this like so it's simple physics come on sam where is that he's down there somewhere get your breath it's more sliding up ahead i'm sick of sliding oh yeah if we fail this we're we're going off the ravine aren't we so i reckon i could make it over there no choice oh [ __ ] if he did it i can do it no but i'm sure this is better why i would never go bungee jumping this is what you've been up to all these years jumping around ruins yeah that and getting shot at blowing up punched kicked all right all right i get it knifed drugs [Laughter] everything going to the sun hey nathan god wasn't sure we could do that one can we get on that white one there let's see i think we could make that we make it to that bridge i think that's it watch out for the snow that's that ah not quite still gotta climb hide across the ravine i hope we're done sliding for a while get away buds my ass is full of gravel there's more sliding straight away i'm afraid there's a dormitory gate so we've got to get over there up and around here maybe i think that's a hook there isn't it so if we slide here we should be all right i mean that's some proper indiana jones stuff right there here he comes i could get used to this give me a hand come on i heard what sounded like a large dog then i hope i don't have to fight a large dog i don't want anything to do with that okay come on yes we are jesus look at this place welcome to the saint dismiss dormitory alleged final resting place of one henry avery let's find that grave nathan check it out this one's got a pair of cutlasses it's like the scroll from the cross let me see the dates aren't right yeah well one down and a hell of a lot to go still nope hmm okay cross cutlasses skull and crossbones and the date 1659 to 16.99 we find a tombstone with all three and we're in business well let's desecrate some grapes let's you want to desecrate some grapes i'm gonna look over here first what did you want me to come this way i thought there might be some more graves over there nope no cross swords not our guy yeah well swords are a match two swords same dates benjamin bridgeman sam come here where'd you find it benjamin bridgeman that's avery zailey's that's got to be something to push or twist it's like it doesn't belong to the stone and what's odd about it is that's not avery sigil yeah i mean the skull should be facing sideways it's the goonies now let's see what we got any ghosts down here anything i should know about uh there's a lot of skeletons a crypt hidden behind a secret door i assume the secret door was added afterwards to hide his loot well fingers crossed oh gang's all here that's the three the three crosses that we saw jesus dismiss on the left penitent thief guess this on the right jerk thief black white and brown avery sure had a thing for saint dismiss huh well everybody fancied himself a good thief right only plundered and murdered the non-british eatings guess that's what passed for good back then good enough is this a door looks like a door it's clearly locked nathan i don't see a way to open it though what are these star symbols some kind of lamp hey smokey need your lighter over here you know that hurts my feelings as much as it hurts your lungs thank you father duffy isn't that something the light's coming from the other side of the wall it's a puzzle and let's see here ah i can aim the lights so i can move it and i can rotate it so i've got to get two that line up hey here we go well they line up okay don't know there we go these okay they're quite far apart so it's probably the top and the bottom one no connect the dots does that work i think that works i think you got that one that's it you got it that's quite simple really all the lights are on so we should be able to open it now i think i hope so let's give this a shot whoa what is that wrong treasure real nice view no treasure though no but look you see those crosses it's a mop oh yeah hey is that a cave right below yeah i think avery's trying to tell us where to go next there's one problem though going back that way means we have to go back toward the cathedral and back towards rafe [ __ ] well let's not keep them waiting did you guys see that when when you shine the torch in his face he winces and looks away ah i mean come on come on now ah they open the gate up there good cause that's the way we gotta go i follow my lead i'm gonna mark them all right then so i think that's one there there's at least seven of them i can ignore edges i didn't know that all right so this guy we should be able to pull him down he's gonna see though isn't he oh get him now all right [Music] there's a guy here he's looking away damn it oh you saw the body that makes sense can i not move the bodies he grabbed on to me what that is that's new i'm i've not seen that one before that's cool this guy here gonna jump on is that death down now could i jump that [Music] check over there roger that let's go down here see what's around on the left i think i could climb up no that kind of looks like you could climb up there i'll climb up that one i feel like we're gonna have to go to the main entrance aren't we nothing to see [Music] oh he's gonna find the body come on come through all clear there's a dead guy right he might be there oh that was brutal nope oh i thought i was dead then i didn't realize that was a slidy what are you doing there sam oh you can go up and around here there's a little sneaky route did sam just mark that for me i feel like he did hey come here that's a lot of bad guys isn't it bye oh that's oh that's a long way down you didn't say nothing there's so many enemies look at them all i'm gonna find you let's say it's fine oh no i was going so well but we did take quite a few out without being spotted [Music] i think i helped myself out a lot there get against the wall how many enemies in total is here like how many was that game wingman okay i think we're clear oh that could have gone better you know you're still breathing you know what son i'm good enough let's just get that gate open i think it went quite well considering the amount of stealthy takedowns we got you know we only had to kill a few people it's no big deal it's fine ready yeah okay ronin said i did not go stealth in this part i went in guns blazing well i guess you could you could probably do it quicker if you just start shooting at people are you holding up great i was kind of hoping to find the treasure back there but it was never that easy right it's been my experience plus there was a cool constellation yeah it was cool why don't peop people make stuff like that in real life like little puzzles imagine if someone had a business where they bought out a mansion or something and every single room was an escape room i'd be down for that and there was little contraptions and light puzzles and everything pretty spectacular if some billionaire could do that that'd be great that's where avery wants us well whatever he wants what's your status hey sully we're on the trail but uh treasure is closer to the cathedral than we originally thought oh boy so what do you need me to do i'll just keep those engines warm we'll be back before too long you got it keep me posted we'll do jeff bezos could do that couldn't he just buy a mansion employ a team to make every single room a an escape it didn't look room it was built by the monks come on controller i hear him some treasure honestly if i had a billion dollars that's what i'd do what i didn't realize you would come down here be careful nothing over there no it's gone whatever it was it was a cliff wolf are they real the walls that live on the cliffs that's what it was nothing to say wait what's that a mountain goat and that's one of the blue mountain goats that you also didn't see turn away all right then just a humble mountain goat that's all hey that guy's dead where'd you go oh all the resident evil mansion yeah that's a really good point i guess there's no getting away from these guys yeah and there'll only be more as we get closer to the cathedral [Music] and it's starting to look quite piratey isn't it a little box with a bird in it put that on ebay a couple of quid for that nathan found a ladder over here okay coming here we go come on i'll boost you up there all right hell i'm too high to reach you hang on a second hanging let's see what's by that wooden structure over there what is it yeah we go all right sis thanks heavy what exactly are you doing giving you god way up ah thank you support even your way oh wow thank you that's rude that was really really rude hey you don't think the monks built this no way some kind of pulley system to lift a whole bunch of treasure to live something i can't believe i missed this yeah clearly we were meant to find it together oh so romantic it was jeff jeff did it so if i just i guess i could jump over there hey we can climb this on my way come on sam get over here i'm freezing quit your moaning you wouldn't be freezing doing this you'd be hot this is some real exercise right now i can't imagine how much g fuel nate has pounded today because he just did it a lot yesterday like it's so much g fuel uh so where do we go from here i'd drop onto that pole there what is he doing i think you could this might kill me but i don't i'm not sure where else i could go this way i see nice move right we're gonna have to do a big slide here aren't we okay look where we are holy [ __ ] look at this hey be careful coming around the corner it's crazy was amazing it was save your strength huh we're not done yet just lead the way follow me i'm sure it'll be fine there's a contraption here look at this though that looks completely blocked off there doesn't it there's a swing there can't quite reach that what about from here now can't drop down no swing over there what am i missing here there's nowhere to jump can i get back across there please son let's have a look if there's anything else around this way it can keep going up there that's useful there we go this holds oh this is a good idea it's fine oh that rock moved no no no jeez the rocks aren't supposed to here i'm move the uh the cliff thing broke yeah it doesn't normally do that especially clips tell me about it all right here we go that's gonna break yeah you okay yeah like i was just saying yeah yeah yeah and hold on ow i can't feel my hands i think my blood thinned out or something after all those years of animals don't worry it's all the drugs where's casey lose a couple fingers give me a lift there you go where would you be without me huh probably at home those big buds coco what are you five oh tell me you wouldn't go for some hot cocoa right now well i mean yeah exactly there's nothing wrong with a hot cup of cocoa is there come on here we go no jesus i can drop down here right flintlock pistol i assume that's going to be very close ranger there's some swings there i wonder if i could use those in combat maybe is he gonna move good game now maybe why are you standing next to the explosive barrel oh i know i'm next to the explosive barrel whoa oh this is not good it's explosive oh my god ow i need cover i've got to stay in cover for a second i'm dead crap let's go down here drop down mate let's go okay i feel safe here i feel safe what was that the shotgun oh i love the animation that was very cool i was just swinging around like an idiot there wasn't i whoa come down huh okay we're clear we're good for that oh that shotgun's nice saved my butt there didn't it can we get up there swing maybe yeah nope that just hurts he's so grabby isn't he look at him i'll grab it i i promise i will just give me something to grab give me something to grab it's death isn't it you go down there you can shoot while on the grappling hook interesting i didn't know that it's a good tip thank you there's snow building up on his hair yeah you can look at that is there anything that we could blow up and there's a barrel there i don't know if we could blow that up let's have a look down here i don't think there's anything in there that we could blow up oh maybe we can oh you can just jump up there careful might be unstable after the blast who does excavation mercenaries i think rafe would know better though hey sam help me with this what if it's the only thing holding the tunnel up then i'll apologize well how can you apologize if you're dead there see no problem for once oh it's opened up again slide down and grab there he's so grabby just loves grabbing everything crap good grabbing there nate good job those things look sturdy to you sturdy enough it's fine hey be extra careful on these uh can we make that jump oh crap remember extra careful was that really a great opportunity to write something down there nate [ __ ] don't pick it up how's it looking we're about to head into the cave yeah we might lose contact for a bit don't get too worried all right i'll keep the porch light on for you all right call you soon we made it it's quite the detour oh we're not gonna have to swim oh wait what avery left for us no not like this yeah but i think we're the first ones in here come on through here i squeezed her i didn't need a big breakfast creepy st dismiss statues check carve stairs check nathan i think it's safe to say we're in a pirate cave oh is that a door a pirate cave sure looks like nah don't no no no check this out don't put your hand in there a little slimy there's a handle in here or something well give it up give it a pull what could be a trap you're already in there what's the what's the worst that can happen uh i lose my hand so we'll get you a nice hook give it a pull nice hug [Music] really hello hello pretty interesting decor for those who prove worthy paradise awaits to those who prove false hold your grim fate well i guess avery was a better pirate than a poet this this isn't avery's what do you mean look it's the rhode island pirate thomas too yeah but it can't be him i mean this is clearly his sigil but two died attacking the same treasure fleet is avery yeah well at least that's what the stories tell us this really is two's mark then that means he's involved in all of this how that's a damn good question they're just trying to blow their way in so who do you think these guys are those who prove false i guess i think avery or thomas too were just trying to scare us good thing we're jaded treasure hunters good thing i don't like it i mean this is the goonies now like this is perfect for me i love the goonies that bridge looks about as safe as the others it's fine it's held up this long it's very brave little stupid okay it's holding come on don't die sam sam please has he got cold these feet are clearly not built to code sure they are the pirate code not bad let's see that one come in well i don't really want to jump in there a hell of a way to go though wouldn't it i don't know i still have rocks in my shoes from the last 10 seconds it's fine okay okay okay i'm a pro at this by now so did two build this place with avery i can't make sense of it neither can i if avery's trying to hide his treasure why involve another pirate no maybe he saw him as a part of his crew maybe he sent him one of those saint dismiss crosses yeah maybe two took all the treasure for himself please don't say that i'm gonna find out soon enough come on least we didn't get dropped in a pit or something uh this is elaborate you could say that i don't know this i'm just going to take that see it could have been the it's same pretty elaborate test trial yeah when this guy clearly failed and let's do better i mean that guy didn't stand a chance because the second he put the hand in he was dead okay a bucket i live in a giant bucket could we get some water in it maybe ah bucket filled all right pass it up to me why does nate always do the dirty work put it back in that big wheel thingy yeah don't die i mean well the three crosses are there all right let's see what these wheels do uh okay i think i see what's going on here something with the three crosses yeah i'm guessing we're looking at jesus our good thief dismas and the jerk thief guessed it i'm gonna figure that white cross is dismissed so the black one is guestus so i've got to get the crosses in the right order so the white one needs to go on the left i think so i can rotate it like that can i rotate the other way as well so that would be in the right spot there wouldn't it but i need to get the bucket back up to the top i think because that's where it came from right so if i go back to this one i'll take the bucket up to the top check it out something up there move when you put the bucket on top there's a channel running from the mechanism to the door okay so bucket on top is good keep it there all right so i'm not touching that one again said the crown hey sam was dismissed to the left of jesus well are you looking at them from the front of the back in the front then yeah he was on the left okay that's what i've got okay so if i just do this one to the right okay that's gotta be it let's find out let's so you're gonna pull the switch i think that's it i'd hate to deprive you of that privilege uh where's the switch back here i think that's right hopefully i don't die nathan look i think you got it all right see oh shish kane no nakabobs today i'd like to be a nate kebab what do you suppose it was testing exactly filling a bucket i had to know about saint dismiss my bet avery and all of his crew were intimately familiar with not that hard of a test maybe it's not the only one i don't like i don't like those puzzles i'd rather just be an adventure and shoot stuff thanks look at this environment i mean i'm playing this on a 27-inch monitor but playing this on a big 50 or 60 inch tv with surround sound and everything that would be so good i mean he had his hand out nathan was ready to grab i wasn't grabbing enough that time if we just swing down here it's fine yeah i thought i could grab that thing there okay i'm guessing we need to get up to that broken bridge good guess let's look for a way up okay hey come here i'll boost you up there coming let's go some okay i got something for you up here what you got sam holes on the wall over there okay good call can i get crushed by that no i just wanted to test which hand holds did you mean these ones maybe yeah follow me abe's odyssey making this easy are they follow me i imagine it was easier when all the bridges and walkways weren't broken i guess we're a couple hundred years late wait which way did he go how did he get there and scurry up there maybe yeah he's a sprightly one samus let's see what's in here little crawl space here there's a little ceiling here watch it watch my eye this way the size of these rats i see some light through here ah catacombs delicious that makes sense we're under a cathedral treasure no it's just a lamp it's a rusty old lamp across can you keep your torch on please so i might appreciate that what is that what can hear them talking anything noteworthy by the dormitories not unless you count some cleverly worded headstones have you finished digging by the chapter house we have ma'am the northwest sites are wide open as well and what about the southern perimeter not yet it'll take us a day to move the crane over there nadine make it happen in the meantime see what you can dig up without it how do they get in here right away good rife any luck with those manuscripts can we have a minute keep me updated yes ma'am they're just blowing their way in are they did you hear they found a whole annexed area under the cathedral i did have you seen it no why because there wasn't much left after they'd finished finding it my men have been a bit liberal with like 100 well-armed bulls in a china show but they've made more progress in two days than we've made in months progress i can't analyze rubble okay okay thank you i'll let them know they need to give you a heads up before they do anything drastic or you can tell them to sit tight until i analyze the few clues that haven't been blown up no we can't sit around waiting any longer all due respect i think i have a bit more experience with this sort of thing than you do we tried things your way [ __ ] you've been wanting to level this place ever since we got here no i wanted to steal that cross long before it ever even made it to that auction the same auction where i couldn't have my men around to deal with any surprises the auction was the cleanest way but instead of going with my gut i'll listen to you and now we have competition well i didn't think he'd show up or maybe you wanted to draw him out why the hell would i do that because you think you need him and maybe you do point is i'm done trying to do things the clean way if the treasure is here we'll find it and if not we'll maybe it's time to move on he's gonna snap hi it's not personal of course i'll let you know if anything turns out oh dude's a loose cali man he's twisted he's twisted let's get moving before they blow that treasure to bits i don't want to stop making out wait you think she was right though but what about rafe want to draw you out as long as he doesn't get the upper hand who cares it doesn't matter what annexed area you suppose they were talking about there's got to be some side chamber because we're the only ones here i didn't see any other big area it looks like someone's already been through here doesn't it don't mind me oh there's a bit of treasure there roly-poly before i do that i have to jump there's just something in my brain that says pressing l1 is boring you have to jump before you do it a little too high to jump up there unless you got a trampoline left it in my backyard oh darn wait do you have a trampoline i wish there's one here look come join me on the trampoline sam sam how rude right if we get out of this and i have a barbecue at my place no trampoline for you sorry the best rope ever big swing here ow right to the top oh hang on i thank you good sir the crates are always the same did they not have other crates well we're definitely getting closer to the cathedral gotta say this is far more sophisticated than i was expecting me too bridge is out gotta find another way across here goes nothing i pull that i can use it as a a point that i can climb up on yeah what's with these hexagonal rocks okay made it what's the plan i'm working on it do you not have a rope we can hook our ropes onto this yeah that'll work so put this over here and then rope it [Music] yeah it made sense in my head oh that was close who needs bridges oh no i i wouldn't mind bridges per se well can't go through there so how do we get through over here this place wasn't completely falling apart we'd probably be trapped again nathan look around you holy crap this must have been another test but it all just crumbled into the ocean well i guess the test now is how the hell do we get to the other side what's this it's a delivery ubereats captain of the dauntless these damned caverns i'll keep that one it's going in the attic when i get back home whoa getting glitched out a bit there you guys know that sam that character is voiced by troy baker doesn't sound like him at all he's doing a very good accent there that really safe looking wooden seesaw thing might do the trick where's the shot there goes nothing all right we gotta come this way a bit [Music] no is that far enough down i'm right at the back of it i guess we just run up we could jump to the right or we could try and go straight ahead i feel like right is the safe option make the night to stop you won't make it you're too low [Music] so i did that wrong he did tell me to stop as well jump on it there goes nothing stop you won't make it you're too low you could have told me that earlier sam i made it all right uh now what about me right now just let me look around we'll figure something out cool i'll just hang out here that's right oh no no no no no not moving cogs appreciate everything that goes into making one of these death traps don't be glimp there's being glib this is a marvel of human engineering roly-poly thank you for becoming a new member it's very kind here what is he doing all right we can wait now okay yeah yeah yeah there we go hey nice air time oh crap there thanks that's another test down at this point i'd rather take another death trap at this point i hope we're at the end of this thing okay getting a bit dramatic with the statues here yeah seriously why decorate a treasure burial site or build elaborate tests oh it's fun isn't it never get used to this oh this is the boss room isn't it nolan north is at least this one has some jewels on it right oh don't touch it what why look at it it's the only valuable thing we've seen in this cave right this is another test great yeah lack thereof okay so it's it's got to be the coins are we sure about this oh pretty sure pretty sure we'll have to do yeah just just one though careful i got it please don't be a trap you recognize the shape it's madagascar it's florida look star right here it's king's bay yes it is son of a [ __ ] he's scrolling with us what are you talking about avery he's screwing with this this was supposed to be it so where's the goddamn treasure huh i mean king's bay great what's next north pole outer space nathan for those who prove worthy paradise awaits he was recruiting who was recruiting avery was recruiting recruiting for what of course crap you gentlemen are very very noisy guns on the floor slowly must allow you from last time throw me out a window didn't do it for you rafe reef come in i'm at the graveyard nadine hey we're here yeah i'm looking at them right now what where are you come back to the cathedral follow the holes i'm on my way and for god's sakes don't shoot him yet not want to hurry then [Music] king's bay yeah but uh we're in king's bay you'll need that cross over there to figure it out but there's only two people that can tell you how to use it let me guess you two oh i'm gonna leave it to rafe you're gonna be waiting a long time sorry boys i'm not here to negotiate bring me the crucifix it's not a crucifix what technically a crucifix refers to crosstalk you know what never mind don't touch it oh no you can see that coming a mile away yeah again [Music] well i mean surely i'm ruined look at me damn it they keep moving around that's my chance yes nice god they were crushed horrible we got to go up to get out there we go oh you can cheat while you're on this keep the heads down some no no oh i'm so dead oh the double tackle that was awesome that's the first time that i've seen that we kicked it punched it set it on fire that was cool it's just you know brothers helping each other out that's all are you running into that one mate oh 12 gauge thank you yeah now it's all again oh the ragdoll was in sync very good what the hell's going on it's fine long story short version is get us the hell out of here yeah drink it hold tight be there as soon as i can that was cool i love that whole segment there sam is a bad man that's his favorite move i think i got him i was lucky [Music] usually i think you would have to flank him but i got lucky there right [Music] where's he going let's keep moving very limber get that ak back out i've got something i'm afraid now oh [ __ ] sam sniper [Laughter] i didn't have enough momentum thank you can i get the sniper yeah look at that ldr bit of sniping okay boom you reckon you can get collaterals with this two for one is that it how's the scaffolding i missed rush that one hey kids there's no place to land up here can you make it down to the water yeah set her down one way or another we'll get you there we go don't stop what all this is for you no yeah yes yes definitely always like this i mean every uncharted game is uh crazy oh that's like an m14 or an ebr or something that's cool semi-auto dmr it's got a nice sound to it victor saying the weather is lovely this time of year i can't see [ __ ] just keep heading down until we hit the water i can't be the way down there right just up here he stall slide down red barrel red barrel too slow hey yeah this is all new for sammy i mean he's never really seen this side of me before it's okay [Music] just keep sliding i wish i had the sniper again you see his butt sticking out cheers mate i can't quite see that guy have a shot there maybe if he peaks again if you hit them they kind of stumble and come out of the cover a bit you're right you can zoom with that one oh it's got a little scope on it didn't even realize [Music] ow ah should have climbed up maybe i think we've got a checkpoint right there yeah that's covered there we use that got a little red on it swings down here please bullets don't work like that [Music] get in go nick go that was a hell of an escape i enjoyed that very good oh that was a close one huh shot up my goddamn plane nathan we're fine thanks how soon can you get us to madagascar no treasure then not yet i don't know what you're talking about look we're rich jesus suppose it's a start you think the rest is in madagascar well there was a chamber back there with a giant map of madagascar on the floor so yeah it's probably there this is beginning to smell a whole lot like wild goose kid look the treasure was never in scotland okay then what was the point of all that huh of the saint dismissed it's like i said i think avery was recruiting people the cross was an invitation the caves were just some sort of initiation oh so we all passed huh congrats victor we get eye patches and parrots now i don't get it why the hell would they go to all that bothered just to weed people out to protect himself look avery was the most wanted man in the world at that time he had to enlist people that he could trust in order to keep their treasure secret what do you mean bear treasure just think about this thomas two was a successful pirate in his own right what would he possibly stand to gain from joining avery i think avery sent out crosses only to the other wealthy pirates like himself what if they pulled and hid all their treasure together that would make the guns way all look like chump change exactly oh holy [ __ ] okay so we're exactly in madagascar are we going king's bay it was an old pirate haven back in uh avery's time i know it well it's a big place anything more specific well that map chamber completely caped in so you know what are you laughing about the people who survived the caves the recruits what's the one thing they would have left with there's a volcano on this there's a volcano near king's bay which means we need to get a move on hey hey nate hi honey oh hi i've been trying to get ahold of you are you okay yeah of course what do you mean oh you know the news there's been all that flooding maybe going to malaysia during the monsoon season wasn't such a good idea yeah right right yeah it uh it grounded us for sure you know had some equipment failure but you know no one's hurt or anything well as long as you guys are safe so are you gonna start work tomorrow uh postponed actually uh looks like we're gonna need maybe another 10 days or so oh 10 days hey well why don't i just uh go ahead and buy a ticket then oh you know you don't have to do that that's fine i mean you know these guys always overestimate things i'm sure it'll be less time than that okay well you know don't rush make sure that you're safe oh i will always do uh listen i i'm i'm sorry i gotta go jamison's calling me over okay i love you love you too they always know when you're lying every [Music] time [Music] what are the satellites saying victor right now not a goddamn thing i've lost the signal hey you know what never loses signal paper all right this root right here should take us straight to the volcano might get a little bumpy though let's get the show on the road okay we're driving the car so what are we looking for oh my god well the map shows all these structures around the volcano some abandoned outposts a handful of watch towers watch towers avery was the most wanted man in the world so if he was hiding something out here makes sense he'd need lookouts one of those towers is right on the volcano with avery's treasure fingers crossed i mean this looks insane i see some ruins up ahead you want me to check them out then i'll go take a look oh victor you still do a lot of traveling these days i try i tend to pick jobs that get me away from the computer it's shocking how much of the business has moved to the internet i mean i bet you have all sorts of options to get rid of hot cargo now yeah sure but i prefer talking to clients face to antiquity master 37 yeah i go by that name the internet that's what they call me there's some treasure up here i think what is it not much to see here it's like one of those jeeps from jurassic park isn't it what's that on the front there a toe cable all right here we go nothing worthwhile come on let's keep going so with our luck what are the odds this volcano is going to erupt on us zero it's extinct trust me that's the first thing i looked up when we said we were heading for a volcano that and where to rent the cheapest format wait sully you're telling me that you actually did some research i can't let you be the know-it-all every time kid i mean the whole game has suddenly changed like what leverage there is what you would call rigid it is a rickety bridge yeah i assume we have to go across it ah this looks promising come on come on baby let's go go go go go it's a four by four we can do this come on use the rocks okay kid just don't drop us i've got this just keep it slow keep it in the center yeah there's a lot of backseat driving going we're good everything's good i nearly fell off then i have to be honest guys ah there's not enough friction there we're getting nowhere fast look at this mud you need traction here nathan the rocks i got it i got it don't spit out now sully do you want to drive here we go we did it ready i feel like i'm playing spin tires snow runners oh my spine uh well i don't really want to drive off there i suppose we could go around here look tire tracks someone came up this way oh look at the ringtail lemurs they're great there i love those whenever i go to the zoo always a big fan hey look up there on the hill got a tower or something now we're talking hey victor what were you arguing with the little guy oh your brother insisted on getting a 4x4 with a winch so you sprung for the winch but you couldn't spring for the suspension i got it hey it's important going off-road it might rain might be muddy now that we go through this whole goddamn thing and never see [ __ ] god this would be so fun in real life i'd love to do this up and around take this slow kid i just heard a what was that was that a a lion or a cheater or something so nathan you're thinking avery two and some other big shark pirates pulled their treasure and came out here because why exactly who knows maybe for protection british authorities were closing in on them there's another one maybe uh he helped them disappear i mean the guy clearly had a knack for hiding things oh that's gonna destroy the car isn't it come on oh we can't get up here and go and no that was a valiant effort right you have to get out let's go check out that tower i'll come with we could use that tree for something several hundred years old yeah it definitely ruins from avery's era what is that look that's christopher condon sizzle is uh captain of the fiery dragon the dragon out of madagascar around avery's time so maybe avery recruits pirate captains to what be his lookouts that'll make any sense no doesn't that water buffalo down there i don't suppose i could climb this course you can of course you can right bark stripped away something was wrapped around this tree can i use my rope just swings it round and round unless i have to go down there first and then climb up yeah okay hey did you know our car came with a winch no really i didn't know what you're gonna do with it not sure yet so i guess it's just like earlier where we can just walk around and round yeah i don't know how to do it so we've got an anchor point there oh that looked like thumb steeper than it looks all right ready give it a shot should give us enough force to get up here here we go look at that see sully winch totally worth it we cleared a hill it hasn't exactly paid for itself well not yet small victories yeah well i'll celebrate the big ones i just got to put the winch back we'll be on our way okay he jumped in the car rather than unwinching i mean that's very dangerous so i could have taken his legs off oh my god wow spectacular just imagine you've come here a well-to-do pirate far away from your oppressive government oh poor oppressed pirates all they wanted to do was the murder in village in peace no no they wanted to live as free men well if you're gonna pick a place to run away from society he could do a lot worse than here right a nice place hot all year round though i haven't had to get to this volcano hey do you know how those pirates got here they had to start in england sailed to brazil then cut back across the atlantic to south africa and they figured all that out with paper charts and by looking at the stars wow you're describing salem to a former squid the point is we got it pretty easy yeah still taking a long time uh stubs thank you for the 10. it's very kind here hey nathan check out that cave there all right i will [Music] oh my god what is that don't squeeze through there og gaming thanks again buddy it's very kindly i'm good let's go it was um a fat butter i guess oh i got mud in my mouth that's gross how would you look at that oh [ __ ] stop stop i see him what do we got military types poking around nadine's guys yep son of a [ __ ] yeah looks like they found an old colony outpost but the wrong one right that's the good news that means it's bad news the only route to the volcano is straight through them oh [ __ ] you do have the drop on them what's the play here nathan follow my lead i suppose i could just drive could i just drive into them like a mad lad i'm just gonna see what happens here i don't expect it to go well but you never know that's a good start i was a sniper right okay that's we have to get out now do i have another gun not at the moment that's a grenade a rafika yeah we gotta watch out for that sniper still [ __ ] i want that all right someone take out that sniper please [Music] i suppose i could just try and shoot the guy but he might blow my head off there's another sniper [Music] it could be a route round here [Music] i don't think so mate i'm hiding now here i want his rifle [Music] oh i don't see him i want a suit started now thank you so late do we try and get the high ground there's the ak anyone else around foul ah it's overpowered it's war zone all over again [Music] excellent i think we handled that quite well to be fair i do just want to climb to the top though see if there's anything up here they're following me i can't get over how good this looks i mean this came out in 2016 guys like it's it's no joke is it it's this looks better than games that are coming out today oh it's assassin's creed can we do a jump off the top into a hay bale ah [ __ ] reinforcement inbound where oh hang on oh there's a zipline hobby that's burst fire [Music] this guy's just falling all over the shop okay we're out of ammo for that now both of my weapons are burst fire drop down oh there's a sniper here cool please i wasn't sure i thought that was gonna kill me one more dude here [Music] all right we are clear i have to okay i think that's it i have to do the zipline i have to do it yes all right the vehicles back there from where we smashed those guys ah dear it was a good introduction wasn't it i'm just putting myself put my stake in the ground this is how nathan drake is playing things nowadays like a battlefield player that's how that's how we're doing things don't break jesus these pirates really need to work on their infrastructure now how do we get out of here um all right i see what's going on here now we're gonna reverse and make a ramp [Applause] come on come on [Applause] one down one to go i'll do the other one cool they really thought about the physics in this game it's very intuitive you know like it doesn't you don't really need to spend a while working things out because a lot of stuff here is so similar to just how it is in real life again with the winch sully pretty handy right i wasn't against getting the winch i was against getting ripped off no turn into it on the right easy oh it's so slippery and that's what she said sully just how well do you know nadine why i was thinking maybe you can contact her convince her to call off her goons what if we promise her a bigger cut than rape no that's not how she operates she's more of a money up front kind of mercenary the rape's got the advantage there look shoreline yeah they're definitely going all in aren't they and getting awful close to that volcano singing the same damn thing but they found the treasure already well look they're searching every inch of this place if they'd found it already they wouldn't be searching yeah you're right that is a weird looking tree hey sam you don't mind me asking how'd you pass the time in prison uh you know reading mostly there was just one guard hey you think that old building's worth checking out sorry you were saying um oh right there was this one guard saw me as a charity case i guess hang on can we just can we just appreciate what happened then so they were talking about how sam passed the time in prison but then because i drove the car forward the conversation changed and then they picked up the conversation afterwards by saying sorry as i was saying about like that's you to check out books from the library that's crazy what would you read history uh especially anything related to avery and other pirates just in case you know sure but you know besides books push-ups smoking trying to stay out of fights between rival gangs it's a whole lot of thinking that's pretty much it it's a baobab sam if you had a guard doing you favors why didn't you use them to get word to us oh i tried i asked him to mail a letter to your p.o box i never got it that would be because the warden saw it i got busted up pretty bad and never saw that guard again jesus i got my own back when the warden decided to room me with alcazar that didn't turn out how he expected i don't even know if i'm going the right way here i actually dealt with alcazar a few decades ago even before i met you two oh [ __ ] how are you still alive well he wasn't whoa looks like shoreline finds something go slow you got it at the top there on the right i think sully you were saying uh oh yeah right so well he wasn't quite the man he is today still working his way up the criminal ladder he must have recorded so many voice lines for that of course a few woodcut prince had smuggled out of japan he was into shoguns and such alcazar was the go-between what was he like soft-spoken but intense like you could explode at the slightest provocation well he hasn't changed much then has he i can check it out boys what is it cool it's a monument of some kind there was something up there wasn't there holy [ __ ] you can probably see all of king's bay from up here yeah hey look there's the city this is the river valley just want to take in the view so how are you doing yeah still in one piece i appreciate you coming along for the ride and especially for negotiating with that rental guy no problem hell i'd be lying if i said i wasn't enjoying myself it is a nice view i'll let you look at this quite the view just keep waiting to wake up and find myself in solitary it's all some kind of dream sam not a dream no guilt trip i'm just let's go find this thing back in gents let's go hey guys there's another tower just over the hill see any shoreline marks i can't tell they're hiding somewhere well it would appear we got here first no place out and keep moving the bridge is out there i'll get around there garbridge now medieval yeah well you don't put up a drawbridge unless you're trying to keep people out or protect something inside how we're gonna get that down then a zip line here so we can probably get across using that that's that weird pistol again shoreline must have been here before find his keepers yeah that thing's really good sounds good hey be careful kid i like that sully cares about you all right i'll see if there's something up here do you not see the giant zip line son i do how do we get to it i think it's on the other side i'm gonna turn around yeah we have to go all the way up there i think no way inside is that that's another one of those weird symbols so do you recognize this one it's a pegasus i do actually and bonnie operated out of the caribbean i thought she died in jail at least it's what the stories tell us right avery must have invited her too the kid you see a big crate or something way up to the top of the tower maybe that'll do the trick try this way yeah here we go i wonder if we could we have kept going that way i don't know maybe i was on the right track no you had to jump over i didn't consider it hey guys there's a massive tower just past the drawbridge biggest one yet holy crap look at that sam time was the next day that's amazing same hey day you all right i'm fine you all right yeah you got this i seen a few i'll bring the car closer i assume i have to use this as some kind of counterweight not entirely sure was it just so i can get up there [Applause] it does look like there's a uh a wheel up there hey this is cool you two just relax i got this there's only one crank you know really getting on my nerves [Music] we have company it's fine i don't think they've seen me yet and there is a sniper there i missed the shot [Music] it's a one bank oh grenade no no no no oh that was close i love the sound that makes so good there's more coming i need some ammo good job oh i didn't even see him grenade no no no no oh that was close [Music] is that it what is this is it a grenade launcher still over there yeah i nearly died then oh look at that love that all these new weapons let's get that bridge down thank you cool everything went better than expected try that again thanks for the help the second time guys i appreciate it there we go i'm the king of the world can you do emotes in this game i don't know all to cross one single bridge unbelievable big tower on a volcano looks like the end's in sight huh there's nothing dubious about that is there nothing at all oh sorry boys the rock came out of nowhere i promise let me know when i can open my eyes i'm not the nitpick but avery spent all my towers wouldn't have killed him to put a guard rail up here i don't think he was the kind of guy that cared about guard rails oh we're gonna have to give this a hot winching aren't we here it's worth a try it wasn't worth a try gonna take a look around right just how much do you owe alcazar uh half half of what well he only knows about the guns weight heist which is worth 400 million right but if nathan's theory is correct and there's a lot you never tell your partners how much a job is really worth i wasn't exactly expecting to be partners with it guys we're gonna find it pay off that lunatic and still have plenty to spare trust me there we go hook it up do it again we're all set here we go all right hang on guys oh [Applause] oh my god [Music] uh what you're okay i've been better get us out of this kid so awesome oh that was fun right yeah well i'm definitely sharing this one with my shrink wait you have a shrink no but i will after this come on you guys are overreacting nearly died it's no big deal i mean they should be way more upset about that hold on to something how am i done oh they had fun recording those lines didn't they i think i've got a gun hold on that was a nice change of pace yeah i'm almost disappointed almost smash no smash i love how we just survived that and i just yield ourselves off a giant ramp to our deaths all right this is where we get off kid now let's find our way in let's go claim our treasure boys that is a big tower a bush oh you just kicked that down couldn't you sam give me a hand with this let's see what we got here that looks like it could move doesn't it looks like there's something back here sam yeah let's do this damn it's breaked over all right let's look around hey careful with that thing kid move is one enough jesus yeah it is heads up i could have just used the grenade launcher i guess but game wanted me to do it that way [Music] that goes down are we in the tower now it looks like it i mean it's a skull that means pirate that means there's probably a trap here he seems excited he's got a lot riding on this alcohol maybe that wasn't the tower whoa magnificent don't see a treasure though guys coming it's a big dome come check this out saint dismiss we meet again so what do we got more sigils there's our boy avery thomas two and that's uh it's adam baldwich it's uh joseph farrow and that's richard one hmm pirate captains all right so maybe your pirate pool theory wasn't so ridiculous after all all right so uh let's see what do you think the trick is here gotta push a button pull something maybe maybe one of the arms or give it a shot come on boys whenever you're done fondling poor saint dismiss i think you might want to come take a look at this trapezoid is obviously the volcano the crown that's king's bay we got ourselves a map gentlemen hector you're a goddamn genius hear that nate genius yeah yeah okay so if we're here this tower lines up with avery sigil okay so then the other sigils must be the towers from avery's time well i mean our treasure's got to be in one of them right yeah but which one i count 12 towers hey uh victor huh you didn't start smoking cigarettes by any chance did you [Music] looks like we're not the first ones here somebody else [Music] come oh man he's a big one ah i should use the grenade launcher yeah that's quite effective i have to admit i've got no ammo in it now i should do the trick keep moving i don't want to let those big guys get close to me [Music] he's right there oh okay love the music it's very good [Music] oh he's got an 8 launcher [Music] it's fine jesus there's an ambush hey what are you doing he's confirming his suspicion [ __ ] look at this they've got the map already it's too late we figured out the towers too location sigils the works so now what now what now we're screwed okay because there's three of us and there's god knows how many of them and they have a head start yeah but they don't know which tower to go to yet that's great nathan because neither do we yes we do look it's a little worn down right there that's a match yeah you sure because i mean it could be this one too crap ah but still two beats the hell out of 12. all right i'm gonna take this tower you and sully you take that no no no no no no no no rave skies are all over these towers by now exactly so if we want to have a chance to catch them then we've got to split up sam just hold up a second will you matey's right these towers are at opposite ends of king's bay damn it we have to split uh if you run into any of those shoreline clouds you call us okay see you soon come on nate we gotta hurry all right there's our tower you really think all that treasure is gonna be just sitting in the middle of a goddamn market oh yeah that'd be crazy but we've seen crazy before there we have all right down we go good day sir he's coming through stop being grabby nathan stop grabbing only 15. i'll tell you one okay fine fine here thank you very much sir enjoy your apple thank you oh you've got to get energy from somewhere oh it's a lemur yeah little guy how you doing hey you like that power if it's sully come on it's a lemur come on come say hi that's all right so cute they are adorable oh i got a buddy now oh he stole my apple he stole my apple i can't trust anyone these days i should have known [Music] it's some chicken hey here we go locked i guess we're gonna have to sneak in discreetly implied by the use of the word sneak well sully you can't really do the climbing can you hey check it out that window over there is broken hey sully i think we can squeeze through here that'll work it's silly long way down he's quite athletic for his age i'll keep mine yeah well at least you got a great view right oh they addressed it okay okay let's see what we got wow this place is in much better shape than the other towers edward england's sigil just like the map said so what are we looking for good question this is a very tall clock tower yes it is yes yes it is what do you want from me now what do you bet obviously yeah scorpio way up there this is definitely the place call sam scorpio aquarius leo taurus voicemail that's the order that i've got to do it it's like we're at the right tower call us they don't have the best coverage in this city well no reason to wait scorpio first i'm a scorpio so i like that that works for me i'll be right back don't they move up and down those things they're the weights aren't they i'll be damned check it out sully the clock still works yeah i noticed try not to get tangled in those gears up there you bet uh we're going the left one goes up right [Music] physics oh you okay yeah all right okay sully down there can i climb that okay watch your fingers nate yeah no good trust me oh god i have to go through the gap that's taurus isn't it it was scorpio first is scorpio higher up than that i think no that's uh no that's leo oh it's a lion here's scorpio right so do this one first scorpio okay that is really loud that is loud that did the trick the scorpio lock just released okay moving on to the next one aquarius so leo is down there that's aquarius there isn't it careful yeah that's aquarius where always nice people are they let's see here leo yeah leo next leo i dated a leo once how did it go leo is unlocked okay one left and taurus taurus was up there so i've got to go up again hang on that's too far is it hmm i think i can get to it around here maybe i have to jump on that thing and then i can just jump backwards i hope [Music] he's probably fine he just forgot to charge his phone thank you done is it going to open up [Music] there is that big bell at the top hold on head up did that staircase just drop down the journal entry i just made the skull at the bottom okay this is like harry potter that's what it reminds me of that corridor that goes up and all the staircases are moving around that's a lever piece at last that's a timer can i not jump thought i could go to the top of that no okay we pull it down can i just climb this yeah let it move that was close that was fun uh i wouldn't say it was fun why would i want to change the time wow this is a nice view to get across to the other side maybe so i want like a quarter to three maybe that this gear isn't doing much for me i think i could use that no no no no no no he's causing so much property damage right now like that's probably been there for 500 600 years or something uh i want to go up don't i not down hmm i think i need the robot to be a bit longer i mean this is the most assassin's creed that the game has been oh there you are i'm enjoying it your ears about your ears sorry the handle broke gonna have to bring it myself just jump on it here we go swing he must have been a gymnast [Music] okay ah holy [ __ ] it's fine i think it's fine jesus christ oh my god oh [ __ ] at least i got the door open though huh that's one way to do it you all right i don't know yet you jeff come on let's see what avery has in store for us hey look the coin you want it is that it sure why not let's see what's down here fingers crossed for piles of golden jewels sam finally you okay just search my town how have you got signal down here we're definitely in the right place make your way over here are you serious okay i'm on the way he's coming good i don't believe you would have signal there's no way okay he's run it's adorable sully way ahead of you whoa hey are those our boys yep henry avery thomas two partners in crime founders founders of what worst scavenger hunt ever there are avery and two sigils these are a little different though yeah they got those star patterns on them they turn but rotate rotating supposed to go match up the stars okay should we go look [Music] yeah just a second i've seen those earlier adam baldridge and bonnie and uh christopher condont [Music] you can rotate them as well i mean there's too many permutations i say we see where that door leads still hoping for some treasure here you and me both now they've got some fancy paintings here look at this baldrige bonnie and conden splendid but why are they here in the first place well let's find out oh that mustache it's almost as impressive as yours it's all right am i supposed to oh there's a square hey look at these stars they're just like the ones on the avery and two sigils in the other room hey you're right three on the bottom one on the top there ah that's right content went by billy one-hand here's another one of those star patterns two on the bottom this one's different than that first one oh yeah good catch thank you see i'm not just a pretty face yeah you are solo huh bonnie was a redhead yeah what do you think those avery and two sigils the stars on those lined up remember i bet these line up too hmm so i have to match i have to match the stars so that one would go like that if i rotate okay right i think i think i get it so so the three are on the bottom of the one at the bottom left so if i rotate that one so the skeleton's feet are on the right that will match up right okay voila well that was easy yeah so who are these guys that's um they are uh you don't know do you hey there were a lot of pirates out there you know so we're stuck no we're not stuck give me your phone what you're gonna phone a friend close text a brother i can take a photo of this there you know these are actually some nice paintings if we don't find the treasure maybe we could sell them to a museum let's find those star patterns okay just saying william maze oh that's got loads on oh my god just like thomas too my phone's ringing hey you still in the tower yeah just uh climb back down what's with the picture you just said i'll fill you in later for now just tell me who's who well the dolphins are richard the trident is joseph fowler stay where there's good reception i might need your help again did you find the treasure no not yet but i got a mechanism to solve here i'll let you know okay books globe this one guy looks like a scholar hey richard want he was the captain of the dolphin looks like he and baldrige were in a it's like a wig competition brian cranston hey sully give me a hand you got it thanks oh that looks like captain hook is it straight who the hell cares well i care he's fancy uh where is that look at farrell's face looks like he'd rather be anywhere else oh that one's hard to say so i just had a random windows noise there there it is there i'm sure that wasn't there before okay right now i think this one will be quite complex because there was a lot of oh god uh right so what would matter appear so if i turn the dolphins so they're facing down like that white dolphin yeah that's right and then if i turn the trident so it's facing left and this one just trying to picture it so there's two at the top one at the bottom two at the top one at the bottom so if i turn that one on the end left twice i think i'll do it okay so who do we have here uh you know i'm honestly shocked you don't know this stuff don't i i do i just want to make sure sam knows you know because he likes to feel useful that's all aha of course oh they're getting fancier [ __ ] what happened here that torch probably fell or something skybrush steep wood i don't recognize this guy looks a lot younger than the other parts from monkey island oh there it is that's one take a picture of sully for a trophy oh sam texted me back ah see there sully turns out sam doesn't know everything either gloating is unseemly yeah i know let's just look at the paintings uh right i did guy brush over there no name this guy's get up looks moorish oh it's really hard to see where is that there it is i found the stars but who are you from harry potter again thieves not like that's ever the case edward england edward england great name stout little fellow oh it's hidden on his satchel look at that and can four get my my phone out oh is it only when i'm here i don't know someone said in the chat that you can take a picture of sully and get a trophy okay right this one's gonna be the hardest one i think uh right all right i got the names of two of them we should still what do we got not sure yet maybe send it to sam really hey scales yeah not chandelier sorry all right here we go come on let me it won't let me turn and face sully no okay that's one i could do it here maybe ah and two last one all right let's see what he makes of him you know that kind of looks fun what are you doing you just took pictures hold that you know avery's recruits wouldn't have had smartphones obviously obviously so this would have been the only way for them to get to the next clue is it close let me see voila oh all right these could be trade winds yeah and these look like latitudes and i would guess that we are packing our bags again boyle what produce called the center oh no it can't be can't be what oh my gosh so obvious nate why didn't i see this before this is enough for the beautiful mind [ __ ] what the hell are you talking about hang on sam you get the photos [Laughter] oh no here i am i'm calling what i thought was sullivan's phone and look who picks up how you been nate hey rafe been a long time how did you get this number sullivan leave it on a cocktail napkin i wish that only would have cost me a few shots of rum right no no i had to pay top dollar to find you guys yeah i hope you didn't spend too much on this whole avery thing i hear the competition's fierce yeah you pulled off some clever moves there but in the end all that matters is who gets to avery's treasure first well that sounds like a bet hey nate you know i'm always gay but my partner well she prefers to mitigate unnecessary risks wow ray fadler taking orders from somebody else oh how times have changed look nate i'm gonna make you a one-time offer here you drop everything go home live your life i'm willing to forgive and forget for old time's sake as tempting as that sounds right i
