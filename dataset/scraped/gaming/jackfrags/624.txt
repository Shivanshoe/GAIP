hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're checking out hell let loose they've just released a big update for the game including the new map that i'm playing on today karen tan we had some really great moments here i hope you guys enjoyed this leave a like if you do and join me as i fight for the us and attempt to push the axis out of the town right so first off we've got to try and take the train station teammate there just got killed [Music] did that guy go down i think so i'm gonna cross oh he's covering me oh that was a nice transfer that's why they put me in the army voice that's why i'm here uh random grenade explosion you're dead ah this ground is strong isn't it i'm gonna slowly walk up here my entire team are over there let's get down on this railway track i think i've got both of them ejected deep in enemy territory here oh you're a german all right that outpost is gone that's the german i must be behind quite a few people here let's have a look let's cross over i think that bullet was nearby wasn't it it's really cool to be fighting in carontan though can't believe they didn't do this for bf5 you know could join my teammate here try and get around the back is that an enemy bomber i think that's a bomber let's see if it drops any bombs it's right above me i know they've got it is bombs you can hear them dropping is it getting closer it stops right i know there are recon planes now they fly over and they mock people on the map anyways i'm going to run east i'll go with this right guy he's a medic so i know in the latest update they improved all of the animations and they changed the ballistics of the guns i'm gonna have to get used to that again was that guy hit firing an mg42 i think it was just right here he killed him i'm gonna assume they killed him that was horrible i almost got cut down then okay i think lieutenant wolf is engine broken yeah it's definitely broken clearing all these buildings and alleyways so cool that's the enemy right there mate that's another mg isn't it you can get a grenade out there yeah oh i messed that up i'm sorry don't go don't go don't go try again there we go number box uh yeah sure one second yeah yeah bro okay it's going down here thanks bro no problem i don't know how accurate this map is to carry tan in real life i assume because of the nature of this game that this is quite an accurate map enemy outpost down well i finally caught with my squad here i think he's engaging an enemy down there what was that grenade how many are down there damn it german's behind did he see me i think he did but put a bullet in his head didn't it i'm a bit worried that there's more behind us still watch out for these buildings oh his head just get cleaned off yes look around is dirty i love it thank you for the cover oh he just went down i don't know who killed him probably point is all wrong if i wait here a second i think they're on the other side the wall there squad has moved out a little bit i think that's another bombing run so in a few seconds you'll probably hear like boom boom boom like getting closer and closer to me i think i should be okay though hear it there's over that line somewhere he's just in between there nope nope nope going back in the house going back in the house here's ariana grande i didn't know that she fought in world war ii but she looks good for her age where you are jack yes see the only one left maybe destroyed an enemy outpost oh you are wow are you hiding there the whole time dude captain vodka what is it i don't know we've got to get to the ruins dude come on let's go how cool is this look at this tank oh i was just looking at the tank yeah i think there's enemies over there can i get on these walls now dice please come on i just want to get over the wall why do games make it so difficult to get over walls oh we're back at the tank now can i get a good look at it now please without being shot there's no one going to shoot me tank how wicked is that should i stand in front of the tank maybe that's not that's a good idea it looks cool though oh here's the crazy cat lady it's cool tank isn't it artillery no oh just missed again again again oh all right i feel like we're making a bit of progress here no papa jim not like this stop firing the artillery please oh i think i see someone in the field there he's doing the serpentine thing got him last bullet it's really hard to hit people when they do that isn't it there's a reason that they do it in the movies yeah oh you scared the hell out of me dude i think i hear someone on the other side this wall right there probably my god my heart is racing so fast right now i should wear one of those heart rate monitors okay relax relax everything's fine just breathe just breathe am i dying i think i might be dying i think this means i'm critically injured or something i i don't know yet there you have died of dysentery i think what's happened here is they've ruined us it's they've held onto the ruins and now they're pushing towards the farm ruins so do i defend or do i try and attack i'm not sure oh there's jones over there i just saw the move i feel like i'm gonna go this way because i haven't been this way yet could be fun uh that's how's that happened uh am i gonna die that's an enemy this is a problem nice and easy well it doesn't look like nice and easy does it it looks like there's been a major problem are you real i think there's some real germans over there i don't know but um i'm a big fan of this yeah real big fan how has that even happened how did that happen all right boys what we got here then germans out there covering fire should we run across the field like hooligans oh headshot mate oh ow maybe running across the field like oh no he's doing it he's doing it it's a spawn we need to get i need to get in there don't we what if i throw a grenade in i'll do the job on it push up just make sure it's clear whoa no don't be in the way of that you just got to push up like this watch i don't know where that guy is keep my head down look nah stop it stop that what's up step it ow i don't even know team killer did i just see i think i just saw a little german guy there that's cheeky what are you looking at oh my friends gotta check the bodies man some people could be oh that's germans that's germans then i want to go back there but they were over there look that's where the collection of germans i think were just got a couple of them there i don't have any binoculars or a scope to use they're dead they look dead hello i don't think i got that guy got him then this is good this is good keep pushing get this flank what was that and genus oh in the trench how did i not see that guy who's just in my peripheral vision well played my squad had put a spawn up deep in enemy territory here i'm gonna spawn on that see what happens hey all right let's try and get my bearings you wow i mean yeah that's that's enemy territory right there oh and another one right there and maybe more around just don't know i love how these buildings all connect and you can go up and around and in between them makes for some really interesting gameplay like that oh god clear out the rats i suppose we're the rats in this situation because we're in enemy territory okay there were two guys there i did see one run around to the left get a quick reload on us i'm sprinting here i'm gonna follow where that guy went hopefully they're not waiting for me teammates up there booboo oh god i'm back at that weird tank i don't think they were expecting me there though were they he's not looking behind him at all did you kill that guy oh it's opened up here it's war oh they're in the factory you're alive now you're dead ah [Music] oh god please let me bandage don't throw a grenade don't throw a grenade you know what i'm going to throw a grenade at you though use the smoke oh i was gonna say let's use the explosive smokers cover nearly got into the factory then i feel like they were all in there back here again we've been pushed all the way back oh that was a german grenade that just came flying out there someone right here no more grenades for you buddy oh i'm in the field here oh i imagine they've got their heads down across their swing they in that little trench again let's go oh bit of hardcover here keep moving friendly tank i think i was being shot from 120. i can move boo boo what's up oh he just got wrecked might be some more here and we're okay we are capturing the ruins here there was someone running through there too i don't see him anymore he was looking at the i think he was looking for christopherson there oh god you've got to be so quick you have to be so fast just want to clear this building oh oh christopherson just got murdered by an mg42 i think damn it know where that's coming from i think it's up to the right is that grenade they're throwing grenades in someone there oh we lost so basically the germans ruined us i had fun it was good fun i hope you enjoyed that anyway guys let me know your thoughts down in the comments below it's fun game it's really challenging but once you get used to the gunplay and the movement and the maps you can have a really good time i'd usually be playing it with the squad as well but today i'm just flying solo biggest problem for me at the moment though is the performance like the frame rate can really tank sometimes so hopefully they can get their optimization in order without said if you enjoyed the video leave a like thank you for watching if you didn't like it dislike it subscribe if you want to see more and i'll see you in the next one now
