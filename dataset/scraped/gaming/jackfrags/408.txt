today we're taking a look at an mmo squad based first person shooter for pc xbox series x slash s and playstation 5. the game is called enlisted and it's pitched as being an immersive world war two shooter with tons of infantry combat i think it's up to 100 players with room for expansion but they've also got vehicles like tanks and of course airplanes it's published by gaijin entertainment of war thunder fame they do all sorts of games as well usually free to play too and developed by a company called dark flow software so the plan for enlisted as far as i'm aware is that when it's released it will be free to play but at the moment if you want access you have to buy a founder's pack that kind of thing so this game hadn't been on my radar at all although i think it's been out for a few months now but a couple of my friends decided to give it a shot last night so i thought yeah why not i'll hop on and they told me some interesting things about it that i thought i'd share with you guys and after playing it i think there's a lot of potential here this could be something really fun if you're into world war ii shooters like battlefield for example hell let loose post krypton that kind of thing but this is kind of a mix in my opinion having played it between hell let loose and battlefield there are some incredibly realistic components to this but sometimes it does feel more battlefield more arcadey and accessible in that respect but as you can see it's actually quite a nice looking game isn't it and i was playing this on pc maxed out all the graphics at 1440p and it looked great visually the environments the models of the guns in particular look very good and the performance was brilliant too it even had nvidia dlss and reflexes into that kind of thing some of the animations are a bit clunky at times like you can tell it's not quite there if you compare it to a aaa game like battlefield or modern warfare for example some of the character models for the soldiers to definitely need a bit more work and there is a lot of clunkiness with the movement too you find yourself getting stuck on things the sprinting doesn't seem quite right awkwardly trying to climb up ladders and jump over obstacles can be a bit tricky at times but the gameplay itself i think is inherently fun and there's a couple of game modes that i tried there's one where you have ai squad mates which is a bit different for a game like this you can tell them to defend and attack points it's quite rudimentary and basic at the moment but the devs have said in various blogs that they are enhancing that ai system you can play that with friends or against other people so it's you and your squad of bots and you've got friends on your team also have a squad of bots versus real people doing the same thing on the other team or you can just play pvp if you want and that's generally what i was doing last night in terms of the objectives in these levels well there was one game mode which was basically conquest from battlefield where there were multiple flags across the map and you had to go around catching the flags bleeding the enemy's tickets when one team's tickets get to zero that's the end of the match and then there was another gamer that was kind of like rush where there was two objectives to focus on one team attacking one team defending and they had to take those objectives in order before they could push on to the next set so it's all standard fare you'll know what you're doing if you've played any battlefield or hell let loose everything this game they say is authentic as well so we've got individual armies that can only equip their army's weapons and grenades they can only use their specific tanks let's say i'm playing as the axes i happen to find an m1 garand on the ground i could pick that up and start using it but you can't spawn with that equipment but all these soldier uniforms all authentic to what these people actually used in world war ii a couple of different environments to find at the moment too we've got the russian army the germans the americans so you can imagine the type of places you'll be fighting so far and they said that they are adding more as the game develops now outside of the gameplay there is this mmo element that's why i said at the start it's describing itself as a mmo shooter this is the metagame of enlisted and basically what it comes down to is that you have a platoon of soldiers if you like for the various armies in the game but when you spawn in you're not just playing as a medic or as an assault player or a sniper you're playing as a soldier that has a name and as you use that soldier you'll level them up you can give them perks like more stamina you can give them access to different weapons equipment you can unlock pilots and tanks and then you can level those guys up so they have different stuff on their tanks and access to different vehicles you get the idea now i haven't played this game long enough to really understand the meta gaming aspect of it but you can see here we've got various upgrades squad upgrades personnel we can change soldiers gear and equipment i also don't know how grindy it is as i said i think this will be a free-to-play game when it comes out and i haven't played it that much i don't know what the grind is like but i've watched a few videos of people who play this regularly but from what i understand it can be quite grindy at times leveling up your soldiers to get access to those new weapons and stuff so hopefully the devs and the publisher can find a nice balance when it comes to that if they do decide to release this as a free-to-play product because if you just buy your way to the best stuff i don't know how well that would go down hopefully that's not the case anyway some of the cool things about the gameplay which are a bit different than other games like this so in your equipment slots you can carry med packs and there isn't a medic class so once you're dead you're dead but if you have a med pack on your body on your inventory when you are killed you go into this knocked state like this down state just the same way that you would in pubg or war zone fortnight other battle rail games and you can move around a little bit you start bleeding out but if you find a safe spot you can then start to use that med pack and revive yourself now typically in games like this once you're dead you're dead and you go back to the respawn screen whatever it's just kind of interesting playing a battlefield style game where you can do that it's beginning to blur the lines between those classic fps tropes and what battle rail games have brought to the table i kind of liked it to be honest because if i had a class with that med pack on i had a chance if i was suddenly just snapped out of nowhere by a guy i couldn't see to get into cover and revive myself it also does add an element of having to finish off some of the targets that might be carrying that gear a lot of the people that i was shooting and killing they wouldn't have the med pack but if they did you get a slightly different notification on the screen then you know you've got to try and finish them off before they get that revive off another element that i noticed although i didn't figure out how to actually do it myself i saw that you could build fortifications like sandbags make a little nest or a trench for yourself and i did come across a couple of mg42s that i could just use and i could also destroy them so i think that they were built there by players although i didn't have access to that because i guess i just haven't leveled up my stuff enough so that kind of thing is in the game too spawn beacons all that usual stuff you'd expect the user interface could definitely use a lot of work though in the game and outside the game it's quite clunky and messy really hard to read and understand when you're organizing your troops and upgrading things very confusing as a new player so they could definitely make a few improvements there but overall in the couple hours that i played i did have fun with this and i really believe there's some potential i just think that this game has to pick exactly what it wants to be because at the moment you have these really immersive elements like an incredibly quick time to kill most soldiers will go down in one bullet to the chest for example from a rifle you have limited stamina as a soldier so you can't sprint forever the tanks and planes are first person only how authentic these guys are claiming to be with the soldiers in the equipment and the gear but then at the same time certain aspects of the gameplay feel very arcadey which i'm not saying that's a bad thing but you have hit markers you have a kill feed you can do stuff like no scope you can jump and shoot and at times it does feel like you're playing the original call of duty games and it's this mix of casual versus hardcore at the same time and i'm not exactly sure if there's a massive audience for that in between maybe there is i was trying to think about a way to put how this game feels and i thought well if the original call of duty had the technology that it had today and they wanted to make a ground war style game mode that you have in modern warfare or something to go up against battlefield i think it would be something like this perhaps without that mmo element on the side in the meta game but overall though sometimes the gameplay can be incredibly satisfying it's fun to go on streaks if you get that right position with a sniper rifle you do feel like you're part of a big battle at times as well which is kind of cool other times though with certain guns it just felt a bit clunky and like i wasn't completely in control so it's a bit hit and miss yeah definitely had some fun with this one and i'll be following the development of the game and see where this goes and what kind of game it becomes and that's all for today guys do let me know your thoughts on enlisted down in the comments below if you've played it how are you feeling about it if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you
