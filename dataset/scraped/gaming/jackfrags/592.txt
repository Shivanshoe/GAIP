hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to cod 2020 easter egg reveal update plus some extra little things that have been going down in warzone earlier today the website that we found based on the black ops 4 clues and the packages that we were sent it updated and to begin with the tv just turned on that's all that happened but you'll notice over here is a vhs tape it's got a green dot on it and it says 1961-62 volume 1. there's also a post-it note here we'll talk about this in a second but what you can actually do is click on the video player and watch what happens under article 40 of the charter for the immediate dismantling and withdrawal from cuba of all missile and other offensive weapons the inauguration of abraham lincoln as the 16th president of the united states is reenacted in the nation's capital 100 years after the event there's a crowd larger than the original present this day double the 10 000 of 1861 and the bright bombing day is in marked contrast to the gloomy overcast of a century ago scenes familiar from history books and movies come to life at the capitol as mr lincoln arrives he is portrayed the following is the letter which has just been dispatched from the president to chairman khrushchev i think that you and i with our heavy responsibilities for the maintenance of peace were aware that developments were approaching a point where events could have become unmanageable so i welcome this message and considered an important contribution to peace okay it urgently recommends so this video clip goes on for a while [Music] and i assume that they're real video clips from 1961 to 62. and this is essentially the the start of the cold war earlier today secretary of defense robert mcnamara announced that yesterday's photographic surveillance of cuba indicated that the bases were being dismantled but with increased united states pay attention to this as well it flashes warzone h6 and then a code see that has become a crucial weapon against gorillas warzone h6 grid reference code in marshes southeast asia and berlin are not the only hazard areas in the orchestrated struggle of the cold war [Music] there is cuba every now and again you see a number flash on the screen as well when their ransom is paid the president visits the big missile center at vandenberg airport here's jfk he becomes the nation's first president to see an intercontinental ballistic missile fire when an atlas d blasts off its pad to roar down the pacific missile range in a perfect launch [Music] areas and then it rewinds all the way back to the start and it doesn't start at the start it depends what time it is when you click it we can play it again there's a few scenes that we missed here but we didn't see any of the numbers seized algeria in its revolt against a goal more on that later in laos the government's army suffered its worst defeat of the civil war evacuating its last stronghold in north central laos now the communists may want to begin the ceasefire talks united can once again capture the imagination of the world chicago the windy city is both windy i could watch this the whole day it's brilliant which leaves more than half a foot there's a cuban missile crisis san francisco gets the heaviest snow in 30 years children many of whom have never seen this call of duty and activision giving us a bit of a history lesson they must have had to source there it is again see code they must have had to source all these clips very strange but if you look at this here it says slash tangled weapon slash emc ii so if we actually go the tangled web this note pops up and what's interesting about this is this hey looking material here or this shredded paper that's exactly the same as what was in my box you know the projector that i unboxed it's exactly the same so the continuity here is excellent but it says walls are not one just sorry walls are one not just on the battlefield but behind closed doors tactics maneuvers strategies all pieces of a complex puzzle that means the difference between life and death conquering or being conquered codes signals ciphers secret communications used by enemies and allies for thousands of years the plot unfolding now is decades in the making it will not be unraveled overnight so that's obviously activision treyarch saying you know this might take this might take a few days while some battles can be won swiftly others will take days to unfold you have found the first piece of many relish the journey it's all part of the game the spoils of victory come not to those in haste but to those who know every battle is won before it is ever fought know your history and then if we go to the directory emc squad which i believe is einstein's theory of relativity and some people think the key to unlocking time travel there's that weird stuff again but as you can see here there's a note so that's today's date day one's crossed out 1961 to 62. so we've seen that video we've done that tomorrow day two it's all redacted so tomorrow something else will happen here don't know exactly what but something will happen but it's a really cool alternate reality game that they're running here but you guys didn't get to see any of the numbers that flash up there's like those black ops numbers every now and again the pop-up like the numbers mason what do they mean so they're obviously really important like 25 puts up 35 as well i think i'm guessing that tomorrow this will no single space project in this period will be more impressive love these old videos or more important for the long range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish the assault has begun on the dictatorship of fidel cool right now what we're going to do is go in game and we're going to use that code in the square h6 there's something there that we can open and inside our secret documents that relate back to this so i wanted to show you guys exactly what's going on here it's really cool i love this stuff well thank you for coming along guys i appreciate you being here it's very engaging isn't it this kind of stuff i love it uh you're to gaming thank you for becoming a member and bruno and chd thank you for the donations that's very kind here micah reeves something on the moon what's the reflection on the tv charis you can't really make it out it just looks like a window or something but it's beginning to feel like the next cod game will be a complete reboot of black ops hopefully this gives you guys a good idea of what's gone down today fingers crossed i can show you what's going down here f1 veteran i've always got a free bundle there's always a free bundle i had my render resolution up super high because i was making thumbnails put that on high so we're gonna go to that location where the round starts and um use the code and we'll take a look at the room someone is going absolutely ham over there with an lmg or something what is going on come to texas we'll shoot some stuff i have an uncle that lives in texas he loves it over there he has a great time i've never been though i've only been to la orlando and san francisco in the us snuggle thank you for the five right so thanks for the 50 man that's very kind of too generous scott i don't want to do it in plunder because a lot of people are going there and i don't want to get stream sniped as well so i feel like i've got a better chance of doing this in solos but if it doesn't work out we can try and plunder it's fine max we're gonna go do it now if i can get to it without dying find this building here you're clear to engage all targets hold up so you can hear loot in there as well so the code just got it on my phone four nine two eight five 163 there we go we're in okay now in here there's some really interesting stuff so there is a cipher grid with the code word zephyr you can see there z and x already filled out and it says quarry there and there is something at quarry which i'll show you guys we've also got this which is a winona cipher key this is very complex but we're gonna have to use this in some way to help advance the easter egg and unlock something i guess about cod 2020. i'm not sure what there are some more interesting documents here i wish i had a sniper rifle but you see there there's dashes and then there's a y and then an n so that's obviously a big phrase that can be spelt out and again i'm sure that we can use that information there plus this cipher square plus what's on the website we just looked at to decode a message of some kind but this is a brand new room i think they've only just unlocked this all sorts of uh russian writing on the walls there old computers it's really interesting but oh there's actually a number on that as well five three one two five i believe that's part of the teddy bear easter egg on the trenches map there is another door here but it doesn't go anywhere you can't open that can't open that one and a smash screen here csm display these definitely feel very 1970s 90s 60s this as well you can see that's that cod easter egg numbering kind of thing silver crown administers negative effects so it's some kind of agent next charge two out of four there's a vhs tape there too so that's important because that's the same style of number as what's on the the tape in the secret room so this room is really important to uncovering some secrets this guy as well i don't know who that is there's someone out there i don't recognize that character from any other cod games maybe it's a developer not entirely sure anyone know who that is is it a famous general or something i don't know i reckon that's a developer or a character or something i don't know but yeah that's about it for this room is that symbol as well that's weird i don't think i'll be able to head up to quarry in this game might have to join another match the light yeah the light could be flickering morse code i wonder if anyone's deciphered that and recorded it that does look like it could be most code doesn't it dash dash dot dot dot dot dot dash dash dot yeah it could be i don't know if there's anything else in here that i've missed i don't think so i'm not sure if that's relevant all sorts of old machines and cables but this is definitely something code word zephyr quarry you know what i'm going to try and get up to quarry that building there i think no guarantees because i might die i think it might be better if i joined a new game actually yeah we'll leave this one so i'll show you guys the thing at quarry as well the telephone the numbers on the telephone are the same numbers that are in the teddy bear easter egg on the map trench so auto jump disabled said the chemical compound on the desk is ethereum oxide a laser component okay easter what's zephyr on a number pad zephyr is the code word so you have to use that code word to crack the cipher 935 is the cod zombies reference isn't it under the hay there was there something else under the hay i'm not sure ck what happened to the little lock shed near the farm that's still locked as far as i know i don't think you can get in there you think it's flickering sos that light jt maybe a general from cod zombies it could be i swear if it's going to be called cod future warfare warfare warfare i think it's quite obvious at this point that the card game this year is a black ops game and it's probably related to the cold war based on all of these teasers and hints and doritos did you guys see that with the doritos packet someone who works at a superstore on a production line or something obviously cod are doing a promotion with doritos in the future and they've started printing the packets and they just leaked a picture of the logo call of duty black ops cold war apparently is what it's called your mission is simple what's my audio settings peter at the moment uh midnight i think there's no way they're gonna do another advanced warfare i just don't see it happening there's some computers around the map where you can enter a password yeah the laptops right so i'm not entirely sure where this is [Music] but there is a a phrase written on there it is so this apparently is new and we're at the quarry so what the easter egg community reckon is that you enter that phrase somewhere whether it's on that grid square or in that cipher puzzle kae 2106 and then two but no one knows what it means at the moment you know it's all it's all very new this stuff hello yeah no he's not in the moment do you wanna leave a message oh no no six times that's impressive anyway i'll let him know i'll get him to give you a call back later all right see you later bye i think for now that's about it i don't know if the easter egg community have gotten anywhere with this and managed to unlock anything on that website or do something else in the game not entirely sure but it's cool i love this kind of stuff uh great if you miss some stuff you can actually go back to the start on the bottom of the bar that's a really cool thing about youtube streaming i've enabled it so you can actually use the bar at the bottom and skip backwards zephyr would be nine three seven four three seven as a keypad code if there is one all right you saw keep that in mind thank you secretary warfare hmm maybe but yeah for now that is that's as far as people have got i think from what i understand there are other people who've got into the bunkers again and tried to activate something else in there but nothing's happened so uh kid collide said there was a cold war era spy named zephyr is that true the zombie community is waiting for tomorrow okay kenny yeah but super cool this stuff man i love it i think what's gonna happen is there'll be another vhs tape appear on top that says 1963-64 and then you could put that in then that has more more numbers can once again capture the imagination of the world chicago the windy city is both windy and snowy in the wake of a storm which leaves more than half a foot temperatures drop to zero during the storm san francisco gets the heaviest snow in 30 years children many of whom have never seen snow before are more spellbound than snowbound but they soon learn what to do with the stuff [Music] it's cool man i love that stuff anyways we are going to play a couple games of solo and see how it goes and i'll be looking at chat and uh maybe we can come up with a few ideas should we go n13 today i've seen a few people using the kilo i like the idea of m13 let's start with an m13 shall we i think that's my go-to build for it pretty nice build i like that a lot they were searching for more of those like the roman numbers one to four at the quarry okay adrian yeah we went into the tangled web directory yeah we did what's up shizzer how you doing hello dirk matthias the kilo is a monster you see you're making me want to do a kilo build now i'm gonna change i've not really used it that much to be honest so i don't know what the best build for it would be where is it i'll write this up i do i've got a couple of nice skins for it oh that one that's mad that's the ghost one isn't it i'll go that one that's kind of cool so we want a monolithic longest barrel which is that one uh usually on assault rifles you want to put commando for grip 60 round mag i don't like the iron sight on this so i'm gonna put a scope on it should we go gi mini get rid of the stock let's try that wow tony the tigers up in here what is that oh that's one of the new ones isn't it for lurch that's cool let's go with that kilo beautiful no i don't like the vlk guys it takes a bit too long to ads for me i prefer something that's up close so one of my subscribers has linked me to an article about that soviet cold war spy called zephyr a soviet spy code named zephyr who worked undercover with his wife in europe and the united states for more than a quarter of a century has died aged 101. whoa dude made a century agency issued a glowing tribute to spy mikhail mukasai i can't be right whose death comes at a time when russia's tense relationship with the rest with the west and its conflict with georgia are prompting many observers to draw parallels with the cold war macusai operated with his wife elizabeth as an undercover team in an unnamed west european country from the 950s until their return to moscow in 1977. that's cool so zephyr could be a reference to that travis thank you for the five any chance of a hell let loose stream love your vids yeah yeah definitely i'll definitely be doing hell let loose i'm going to try rogue company as well seen a lot of people playing that i'm going to go back to hype escape check that out again i want to play apex again but hell let loose is definitely a game that i really enjoy it's a lot of fun it's really fun game it's good game to stream as well because you can kind of tell a story with it enough training now we face the enemy for real another war game with the russians it's always how it goes down you can't get in the prison hurt yet planky as far as i know you can't do it and nova style thank you for the five thanks for all the amazing content you've been one of my top three youtubers since i was 15. now 22. you've been watching seven years dude thank you that guy got a gun [Applause] okay right the origin 12 absolutely rips now by the way i don't know if you saw my video a couple weeks ago about it but it's nuts there's a guy right outside here you know you want to come in i did see someone in the store then as well just taking my time see it does not mess around it's so good deletion protocol i call it there's no way there's got to be more people here wrong password sorry hmm i don't buy this there's got to be someone around they'd be showing up on heartbeat though no one's got ghosts yet centex is really valuable early game okay a train's on the way make a move [Music] kind of wish i had another one of those right above me drop down all right it's a stalemate he's moved away scream come on throw c4 on me or something do something do it yeah there's usually people up here as you can see there's a guy on that building there didn't even see where that was thrown [Music] from over there one man might be some loot left at stadium let's have a look there's most definitely someone here still can guarantee that come on bro hopefully that decoy puts that guy off and here's someone on my right i wanted to get my loadout quick c4 has ruined me unfortunately that's a weird rendering bug isn't it check that out what's the strike okay so i've got enough for a respawn here head up you guys think the next cod game will have skill based matchmaking in and if so do you care would you buy it if it did or if it didn't i know a lot of people talk about this it's a bit of a hot topic isn't it i'm getting fire station here ow i think he's going to kill me before i get in now we're good although i'm pretty sure i just heard a footstep in here now i've got no armor plates interesting i hope not lol i don't really care i'd bite regardless [Laughter] it's really it's a it's a funny thing isn't it it is a funny thing um that's good that's not good there was someone in there johnny on the spot i need close air support this target someone up there there was someone in the tower hopefully i don't get killed going for this loadout kilo okay this guy knows i'm here and i'm being shot in the back cool well it's not cool but whatever this is what i hate about getting a bad start in solos if you get a bad start you don't get your loadout you don't get uavs and you end up in a position like this where you're just kind of on the back foot all the time well i've got this kilo here now i'll try this out see we can get a few kills maybe there's a sniper up there i think that dude is still in there people don't move in solos i like to move so sometimes it does put me at a disadvantage but i hate playing like that look at these two they're just fighting each other someone's going to go for this quad properly right on cue you got plates yeah i kind of need it [Music] i'm hoping that that guy on the top of the stadium doesn't throw a c4 down on me [Music] i'm gonna get away from this oh he's hunting me that guy okay this is interesting i'm gonna cop a c4 though soon [Music] there's someone's up ahead there oh nearly got my head sniped off then [Music] [Music] all right let's make a little base here for a second see if i can get some loot hopefully there's no one around i've got ghosts as well so should be all right most people on their first loadout tend to get overkill so they can get a an assault rifle and a sniper or something and he was killed oh she was killed i feel like someone's been through here though i don't want to go to that shop because someone was there that's the best option i think there was some some gunfire then up to the right enemy's soldier incoming literally someone in this room or on the roof i know they were just what was that a bug i guess they could have been gulag i don't know what happened then i don't like it and there is someone here i think they were just in the sky i love how everyone drops a plate now it's really useful incentivizes you to go for kills a little bit uh antoine do i play on pc or console i play on pc i do have consoles i've got the xbox and i've got the ps4 but i usually just play single player games on them like last week i was playing on chart four i streamed that and this week i've been playing god of war which is brilliant loving it i'll probably finish that tomorrow i might do spider-man next powder shooting yes parachuting that's wrong number sorry that's just five isn't it i think so i reckon there's someone in that building are we gonna go and have a look and get ourselves killed because why they are not i do like this camo though it's nice isn't it cool looking gun the kilo it's got a bit of a retro feel to it no one behind me could be someone up in those hills that i just can't see right now got the ammo box as well if i need enemy it overhead someone's got a lot of money there okay dead guy did they just okay did they just fall down the tower look at this a lot of people do this see i just don't know there could be someone up here waiting they put that shield there they hide behind it and then they just hold that angle like that so when you run up you you're done well this isn't a bad place to chill really unless there's someone out here with ghost i don't like that i mean what was that just a random bleep there for a split second could be a goo lager again the dreaded tower yeah the tower with the high highest kill death ratio in the game how was that someone just calling a loadout then i don't know i'm gonna keep this a second there could be someone running over here i don't see anyone okay all right let's move up into the next building people fine on the left you've got to be really vigilant when you play solos just check everything because if you don't you end up getting shot in the back and then you get annoyed with yourself because you didn't check a corner all right next zone is weird man look where this is going it's just going up into the hills should i just go there into that corner i think it's this kind of situation you need a sniper man i don't have a sniper could be someone in these bushes oh i don't like this yeah i'm gonna stick to the cliff here oh it was the shield breaking it wasn't a loadout right yeah that makes sense where's the trainer that's miles away i really dislike pushing uphill horrible just trying to clear my sixth here make sure there's no one behind me i'll go right into the corner i think i'm safe here don't think there's anyone here famous last words i don't want to say i'm 100 sure but i reckon there was someone around here that has shot at me already but this is where is this circle going to go just here where else could it go good high ground though a gerard thank you for becoming a member you want to hear the most annoying sound in video games how annoying is that it's devastating that noise oh i hate it stop come on guys shooting downhill here right here probably behind a tree i guess [Applause] that's the broom for you [Music] ik bin zatar i don't think that was the guy in the heartbeat less than 10 remain you're close now ruined right we'll play again it's over anakin i have the high ground killed by bruin bloodborne on ps4 i've never played bloodborne mother i know the broom got nerfed but did it really [Laughter] i just got absolutely smelted by that thing i didn't even have chance to react and nervous thanks for the five ruined dark souls or bloodborne the only type of souls game that i played was demon souls on the playstation 3 when i was a lot younger when it first came out my friend tommy recommended it and i completed that but it was a pain in the ass it was a pain in the ass i know they're doing a remake of it though would you play marvel's avengers when it releases yeah yeah i think so i'm gonna give it another shot i played the beta last week on playstation but i don't know like there were parts of it which i thought were okay but a lot of it i was like i don't this isn't really working for me i will say i know it's on pc now isn't it so the frame rate would be a lot better on pc because the frame rate was kind of bad is this new i've never seen this before that's the shed isn't it oh is there a different shed now the the shed with the easter eggs is bigger than that that one maybe practice is over the real fight begins now hostile dropping into the area woodburn i think is probably the one that i'd [Music] play tori thank you for the two that's very kind will you be playing the new tony hawk when it comes out i know there's a demo out today but uh i'm not interested in the demo battle royale it's i know it's really sad that game because it's got a licensed soundtrack if i were to play that on youtube i would get so many uh content id strikes on my channel and it just wouldn't be worth it would i play with the doc ever yeah definitely i think that would be uh an interesting experience obviously he's on youtube now i think the ping might be a problem though because as far as i know he's west coast obviously i'm uk so unless we could somehow make it so it was on a usb server that'd be fine i can play us east i get about 95 to 100 ping on ufc so that's playable for me above me want a heartbeat sensor there's a guy right here somewhere it's still on the pitch can you see down to the pitch from this level you can right but you have to go down first isn't there an executive box or something like that a random texas game thank you man that's very kind here any tips for a new warzone player it's difficult it's difficult get your loadout sword first there are there are some guns that are just better than others in warzone that excel the bruin mp5 the foul the growl hdr is easily the best sniper power 98 it's not bad either but i'd recommend hcr just easy to use oh that's the the number thing isn't it i don't have the code unfortunately just practice like learn the map learning the map on plunder is a really good idea but on plunder you can respawn as much as you want oh it's a good it's a good way to learn the map yeah the base snipers as well have a lot of drop on them it's quite different to how they are when you've got your own build on it i wasn't a head shot he's got stopping power i'm out of sniper ammo positioning a movement really important as well obviously and that was a difficult fight shots really important get the initial damage uh mac thank you for the ten it's kind you man [Applause] know when to fall back when you have to you don't have to take every fight get a better position see if they come to you think he's a guy hunting me i've got an advantage now so i'm gonna push go on the roof there need some cover [Music] so i think the guy hunting me is on the roof yeah well i'm going to stand up and try and head shot him he's pushing me shouldn't have pushed i know you're there you're running straight at me you're gonna get shot in the head uh use your resources obviously that's a much better gun it's a custom m4 that i've got just stole from that dude it's going to be better than that that i had pay attention to audio cues a guy just dropped in it's probably the guy that i killed so they're looking to get their gun back i'd imagine i'm looking for revenge as well so what i'm gonna do is just chill see if they drop down go for their loot but if they look down they'll see that i've taken their m4 so they might not go for it but i did want to go to that bye footsteps really important use a good headset and you'll hear people like that creeping up on you okay so now that guy knows i've been in a fight he might try and drop down yeah there we go so he's dropped i don't necessarily need to take that fight though i don't just want to chase kills what did this guy have see right now i really want a heartbeat center no options though let's move on i'm gonna try and get my load out here it's in a really sketchy spot though i don't like that so many roos where i could be shot from but if you look at it there's only one load out there so that means that no one else has had a loadout drop here which means that it's likely i could get this without attracting too much attention or without anyone looking at me so i've already got a custom m4 that i stole so i'm going to go for hdr ghost and i'm going to get that m4 back and then we're going to move into the circle check the heartbeat sensor all right we're okay so this is kind of my ideal loadout now for a warzone solo match you've got a decent ar with a 60 round mag we've got ghost which is the most important thing for solos and i've got a sniper rifle that i'm really comfortable with oh there's a target wait for the shot make sure you hit him in the head if you miss that first shot it all goes downhill from there but we can use what he was doing his information he was looking over there so we can assume that he spied someone or he was just checking an angle but usually when people stop like that doing it because they've seen someone like that guy looked like he was lining up a shot there so we can use that information there might be an enemy over there somewhere i've not really run into any decent shops on the way to the zone which at this point if you got 20k you should be spending your cash uavs at this point of the game really important if we look at the map nearest one is to the south but that's a really icky one someone having a gunfight over here you use the uav to look at cars that are on the way to you it's really useful hey sorry that buy is icky because that red building people love to camp on that red building in solos and in quads so it's bad so that is my only safe buy really there just gonna wait here for a second see if anyone crosses that bridge or comes into the circle late someone asked how do you inspect your weapon on pc it's i on console i think it's down on the d-pad or something like that i don't think we've got any late comers here you can hear gunfire from that green building there i just heard a footstep so i've stopped moving i don't want to give that guy information they're just camping in the hospital right in front of me [Music] i feel like here going left would be a better play someone just crossed the road there didn't hear the footsteps too late oh not the tea bag as well i wouldn't advise tea bagging don't do that be respectful i think that was revenge though i think that was the guy that killed me before i've got a bit of cash here so what i'm gonna do is drop promenade there's a gunfight going down there people like to chill up there but there's also good loot in this area if that's not lured at the start of the game i'm just going to mark that for future i think that looks safe famous last words right no crates but we might be able to find a gun so i want to keep at least 4 500 on me on this game mode because i can respawn there's a guy in that tower there there's a bit of movement i'm just hoping there's a gun here somewhere but it doesn't look like it i think i'm out of luck i've now done my perk so if anyone's got a heartbeat sensor i'll be their number one target need to find a decent primary weapon i could try the red restaurant that's the position that people love to camp in so i'd imagine there's someone in there someone's actually in the building right there's two people here now i don't know i'm here though one above he's got an origin 12 shotgun you tell by the sound see if they come down right he's actually ran off he went southeast he's gone to a different building i keep my distance from this guy i don't know where he's gone i didn't imagine that he's in the burger shop or in there all right somebody just sniped at me then nearly got my head blown off ah there's a quad bike on the way if this guy's got guns killing him could be a good move okay so there was already someone in here got him all right okay that was a bit fortuitous because that guy on the quad bike ran in here pkm okay i'll take it and a p90 what a weird you've got gas loadout battle safe's all relocated that's as straightforward as it gets someone outside gonna get higher ground they're there on the left i kind of wish that i'd picked up that car 98 to be honest with you you still i think he's still in that tower it's difficult to tell he's still around yeah he's just chilling out of the building i'm gonna stay here for a sec see where the zone goes someone down to my left was just killed and you just opened the door did you hear that got someone out here too oh i'm screwed i better go ah tried to get down there he's got heartbeat don't have perks so he knew i was there i was trying to just not shoot at anyone make as little noise as possible but that is the last respawn for me i'm afraid i don't have many options here there's a fight going down there so i want to avoid that i know there were people in the construction site earlier i could try one of these houses but people love to camp in the attics again i need a gun that is my uav most hated gun in the game the ebr with the iron sight that's a lucky break right there let's get rid of that okay so this building's actually turned out right for me it's just about in the in the zone gonna chill wait and see where the next zone goes and then we'll move again i didn't hear anything because i was coming down in there could be someone in there though because the windows broke just keeping an eye on that window see if i see any movement there is a buy zone here but that's going to be camp there were people fighting there yeah there's no way there's bound to be someone in one of these houses that one or that one i feel like i should play the zone here and just write it in natalie i've not really tried the pkm in warzone no i've not i don't think i've even leveled it up to be honest with you overhead uav yeah he's bad so that's probably a good player who's got lots of money so i know that there's maybe a couple of uh decent players in the lobby wait here a sec i don't have any spare plates so i can't really afford to get in a drawn-out fight with someone there's got to be someone coming out of this compound i just feel like there has to be really leaving this till the last second nope you kidding i thought for sure there'll be someone there let's move this is not a bad position here actually it's not bad i'm covered from three different angles and i'm relatively safe from behind as well not a fan of this loadout though and i've got to run towards those buildings okay this might be the end for me this might be the end here there's a dude right there one there disregard that one there kill this [ __ ] that's a good kill give me some decent gate mask i know there's another one in front of me here somewhere it's done okay that's a little bit of a come up there's a dude on my right though don't have ghosts try not to get stuck by the animation shouldn't really have taken that fight getting my position away that was bad not really any cover here is there i think there's anyone on my right there's a little gap here where we'll just be in okay gas mask is out though four people left there's a guy here somewhere they're fighting which is good i know there's that dude on my left all right we gotta move up the hill three plates this is gonna be rough reset my stamina there's two people left i know there's one over here somewhere the fact that i don't have ghost is going to ruin me i think if any of these have a heartbeat sensor just keep my head in a swivel look for the targets ideally i want those two to fight before i even show where i am i would be in the statue if i was one of these guys that's a good position there okay one guy left he's over there somewhere i think i think he's he knows where i am sloan is going over here did i see movement yeah he's right there he probably has a gas mask mind the open now this is bad yeah he just had a better position there for the circle oh man that was a really good game that was a good game i didn't have a choice i had to keep pushing could have used my stun stun would have won it for me i forgot that i had it you live in your land never mind well played by that guy though jason arthur good game well there you go that's some that's some beginner tips for warzone whoever asked i hope you enjoyed that that was really fun couldn't win it but never mind if i didn't just stunned him did i use my stun did i have it i don't know i can't remember without said i'm gonna leave it there for today guys i hope you enjoyed this thank you for the donations and memberships i appreciate

the middle so it's uh just unfortunate the circle on the minimap was the the monument that wasn't the actual circle the zone was just going like forward yeah if you enjoyed this guys leave a like
