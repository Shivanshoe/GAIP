hi everyone and welcome to part four of the uncharted 4 walkthrough this will be the last episode of the walkthrough i think we are going to finish the game today so without further ado just a recap we had an altercation with rafe and nadine sam got shot i got pushed off the edge of a cliff and elena found us and now we've got to get to the other side of the island and see if we can save some let's do this we're headed to the northern side of the island yeah new devon it's home to the founders of libertalia and that's where rafe is taking their brother the treasure's probably there just need to save sam before they find it 100 million each look there's a big pirate flag up there up there i borrowed it from your shoreline friends you slid all the way down from there yeah it was the quickest way to get down to you now we just gotta figure out another way back up yeah to be fair that looks really fun i'd slide all the way down be a good laugh wouldn't it can you knock that ladder down maybe elena perfect right on cue it's as if it was scripted so have you been here long on the island a few hours now did you see the colony i did from the air pretty incredible right i didn't get the full just follow the gunfire that's what she said follow the gunfire you'll find night boards don't mind me i'm just hanging out so did uh sully fill you in on the deal with this place yep henry avery 400 million 12 founders hundreds of colonists something like that yeah that just about covers it had some time to kill on the flight over wow is that an elevator sure looks like it i swear avery recruited the best engineers of his time he must have used it to move supplies up river yeah that's a fair bet it's a pirate elevator one of the first of its kind i imagine that looks cool yeah check it out nate look there's an opening up there show me the way she's very athletic i think she's actually quicker than sam at climbing oh look at that log there's your car just need to get up there well what do you think which way let's take a look mud when i was dry but now you've ruined me sir not a big fan of that nothing we can climb there is anything hidden behind the waterfall ah refreshing there's got to be something around here there we go i can boost you up there great [Music] hey do you think there's another way up uh hey i see a path up here where there's a way through over there see if you can find something i can use yep hey i found something hold on helena what are you doing i'm just gonna drop a box on my head i don't like that thanks i did see a a grapple thing there for a second maybe use the crate to get to that fallen tree over there great tree got it i can pull it along that's cool it's not moving right you come over here it's quite a strong current so you can't swim and pull it at the same time a bit closer try that there we go we're up yeah i've got the pit on back my favorite thing i'm easy to please if i can stick things in rocks i'm happy stick it in there pro gamer move right there whoa hey nice job not bad right way to go nate piss a girl like that off idiot dumbo could i leap across there let's jump up there maybe come on i'll meet you around every damn time yeah there's a problem [Music] that's everything's under fine everything's fine alien and don't worry back up here yeah roger that roger that that's too high get the pit on in here there we go up we are yes excellent can you find a way out of there looks like a dead end well maybe the elevator still works i doubt it 300 years old been exposed to the weather and who knows if it ever oh look it works that's some good engineering then isn't it going up i think i have to climb around please don't break next floor menswear the fact that this works it's kind of incredible oh yeah it is jinxed it i didn't go all the way up i'll just uh meet you at the top i guess there's a lot of jinxes in this game isn't there i like a good jinx naughty dog a big fan of the jinx huh i thought that i could choke at that it wants me to go that way i think do the thing nate do the thing oh this is precarious nothing to see here alina is an assassin nice moves fun nothing to it fun i'm sure she doesn't appreciate that it'll be easier to spot from higher ground right good idea well that was completely unnecessary where's the big slide this whole thing powered by the water wheel down there it's quite a feat for a bunch of pirates you should have seen the stuff he built in scotland i mean there was this hold up you went to scotland too yeah i i mean you see the the last place avery was uh slowly already pulled me in ah right on that treasure a box [Music] elina's on fire today at least i didn't well see at least i didn't lie again like it's fine the lies are over i suppose we could try and climb around this right we gotta get higher up now we're getting some exercise at least right it's better than sitting on the sofa playing crash bandicoot isn't it says me who is sitting on a chair playing video games for a living and never exercises ever i should do something about that they found your car technically their car so let's get it back do you think she's with drake there was one guy down there wasn't there i think i miss one that'll be slide again and if i go down there right there is a chat down there right we're sliding into the grass nothing nothing yeah that's fine let me show you my new moves elena check this out you like that oh you like that don't you don't make sure it's nothing next contestant come on down nothing blue we're clear we go you can come down yep the dude here i'm gonna snaffle him how'd you like them apples climb up there's a guy right here we can pull him off you think we can just no in that way it's worth a shot there's no [Music] no no no don't shoot me in the head with the sniper rifle okay that's it shorelines certainly are in their reputation let's go before more of them show up elena we did it together it was great yeah we're driving again it's my favorite part you see a way out up river there's an opening by the falls i suppose surely not i can go up and around yeah i was about to say i mean i didn't just want to eat myself off the cliff there that wouldn't have been good it's another great view wow check out that elevator it's massive yeah i'm guessing new devon's at the top then let's get up there let's have it so here's my question why does ray badler want avery's treasure it's not like he needs the money he wants the glory he doesn't want to be known as a guy who only got rich because of his inheritance ah walking away isn't an option about daddy issues well rafe is a good match for shoreline he needs their muscle and they need his money they do they seem pretty well stocked shoreline got involved in a couple of civil wars that didn't pan out for them she's probably hoping that this will put her back on the map i was chanting it there i thought maybe i could just drive up there did this game win awards for its environment design it must have done right i think up until maybe the last of us too this has to be the best looking game on ps4 right god of war maybe looks as good or spider-man but so far so i don't know it's just so good enough i bet you could write a killer article about all this i could i doubt anybody would believe it oh you could take pictures too i didn't bring my camera i don't know what i did though elena don't worry we've got photo mode just give me your psn account why do you think sam didn't come straight to you after rafe got him out of prison i think he wanted to gather every clue that rape had on abram before bailing off plus he needed time to come up with like crazy outdoors i mean i just looked it up is that another elevator crazy contraption it looks big enough to fit the car well here's hoping this one works as well how are we gonna i can't just drive off that surely i have to go down and around i was about to just drive off that again i like to experiment but at the same time i don't like to die so it will come down here so i suppose we should just leave the jeep there and get out all right let's look around it ain't gonna work of course not it would have been too easy exactly the water wheel's still working either we fix this thing or we find a way to climb it let's see what's what let's see what's hot is that gonna fix things if i i mean i break it well that's a problem gears aren't connected to the water wheel do you think it's fixable i need to get up there and see what would be the point of breaking that though i have to know it doesn't seem to lead anywhere i must test mythbusters let's bust on this shall we what's that gonna do we'll find out oh i mean it's just gonna break it alina that's what i'm thinking i don't understand you don't need to get back in every time i get it it's okay oh it's a big lever well that didn't do anything stop the water the water wheel doesn't really help us though all right let's try something else i think we're gonna have to climb up there aren't we although we could use that we unhook this no okay you go back in the jeep i'm just gonna rearrange it here's an idea maybe we can use the winch on the balcony down there yes that's what i'm not doing alina if you just give me one second when i've done this 16 point turn she's just getting thrown around like a ragdoll oh dear i guess i can jump with it right yeah there we go stand clear i got it okay i'm moving bring it down elena hey nate move out of the way this is not out of the way enough for you i have to go back oh she's she's crazy oh whoa how's that looks like i can get up there now thank you so helpful elena a box another box that looks like a what is it a jade serving bowl oh very posh i'll put that on the antiques roadshow laser and see how much it's worth drake get the get the box move the box straight insert the box good job [Music] going around nothing yet just chill climb higher i'm working on it elevator just didn't fix the elevator i can't jump up to that oh no no no no no no no here goes nothing that one was close i nearly missed that oh it's so noisy is there ever a doubt oh hold on i'll stop the wheel teamwork make a dream work ready that's my girl keep going night keep going and balance i'm gonna detach the winch now okay i'll bring the car in the elevator good call i think we did it i can't move that can i look at the size of this oh he's the whole gun is he [Music] we did it uh can you see what's happening here hi there hi um now what oh we're stuck maybe i need to oh never mind oh okay hey watch out stay down use the car as cover oh just shoot him what's wrong with that one down i'm gonna stay on the elevator i like this rifle i feel like this is the strongest one that i've had so far no yeah i think you have to get off the elevator ah she's fine let's keep going around go down night go down the controls are really awkward sometimes got him so i've got to keep up with the elevator but at the same time i've got to not die i'm cool with it [Music] oh i'm dead i think if i can get around oh that was close [Music] that's me alabama i've already got my primary weapon now and there's a sniper there you kidding me [Music] okay you can jump back on get a bit of cover oh oh this is tricky oh happy geez now please please nope it's moving again sit tight here climb around and cover you want to get to the top take care of that sniper [Music] well that was close can't see that guy i'm gonna get up i'm gonna run across here ah [Music] hopefully doesn't stop me at the bottom i will pick some guys off from here you get a little scope with this don't you it's cool ow oh dude he's the shotgun guy he's not he's really annoying a second okay that's good there's one more over here damn it just sitting duck in there oh hurry move it nate gotta go fast hopefully she doesn't get killed i would hate that oh she just takes care of herself are you okay nate yeah well come on pj we'll play delano you sure you seem to be doing fine after all that i need a break if you could do the driving i'll do the shooting yeah do you think there's even any treasure left we're wondering that ourselves i mean that would be kind of ironic if there's just nothing there that would be sad at the same time elevator yeah guess we gotta cross these rapids this car come with life jackets huh well if we drive down there we are dead there's a little route we can take here it goes nothing come on there's no way look at this rubber dinghy rapids let's go mate uh where to now do i just have to go down here whoa hang on ah i don't want to go to the edge i got control again nice is that just death down there yeah that's uh let's ruin us we don't want to go down there do we we're getting there you didn't happen to bring us some spare clothes did you i did right they're on the plane not great oh [Music] you better use the rocks and get traction that's how we do it that damn we can drive through the sluice gate and we've got to open it first that's too high up swing up there so grabby okay i'm guessing there'll just be a lever here that we have to use or a big steering wheel here we go that's i'm fine with that as well there's a giant boulder in the way okay try the other one huh seen that coming physics remember those this one looked clear though so if we open this up number two i think we'll be able to get through [Music] looks like this one's clear nice work we're good go go here we go need a bigger one than that oh it's close ish you need to get more speed up and around oh come on you can do it jeep i believe in you bertha i'm gonna call this cheap all right get the angle right let's hit it watch this hang on we did it you sound surprised maybe a little and we're up boom i just like them apples it's a very robust and durable jeep isn't it so far we're two for two yeah which means we're doing for some disaster well the water wheel's working that bodes well hello nathan drake take a look i think they'll make this one a bit easier seeing as the other one was a little bit tedious why would you leave treasure there is that a cipher thing a combination lock that's kind of cool come on hey give me a hand with this i knew that make it easy uncharted give it and try to taketh away i'll hold it just get the car elena come on let's go i'm running out of g fuel here there we go there we go okay here goes nothing three for three everything went better than expected pirate engineering high five high five maybe no high five friend zoned it's my wife wow it's like a postcard yeah libertalia come for the beautiful views stay for the life or death gunfights so what made you change your mind huh you said you almost didn't come back well i couldn't leave when you were clearly in over your head and you know there's a whole marriage valve thing for better or worse better or worse here give me a hand with this all right okay you know even if you think that you're protecting me you don't have a right to check me out no matter what it is you're supposed to come to me so that we can work through it together as a team i know that really i do it's just i i yeah you know we should stay focused there'll be time for this later could just say sorry nate i mean nothing wrong with that next stop new devon [Music] there he is avery [Music] gorgeous piece of music ah very good all right elena hey we're here slowly where are you still in the air it's how about your shoreline vehicles heading north i guess we'll see them soon you two doing okay so far we hit a few hitches but so far so good all right good keep in touch will you i'm not the no-nos is good news type we'll try over and out ah dead end right there okay should be on the other side of the bridge hang on tight yeah [Music] there we can climb up this rock i got it come on bro [Music] oh come on huh so much for the car come on i wasn't trying to protect you it's just i i made a promise that i was done with this life we both did yeah but i broke it i didn't tell you because i was afraid i'm afraid of what of losing you i guess i was uh protecting myself you know we have a lot of ground to cover yeah just keep moving rest in peace she was a good jeep she bought us from the bottom to the top we started from the bottom now we're here started from the bottom now the whole crew here thank you bertha i might make that into a song catch the power on the right side of the river now yeah that would have been bad can we please pay respects to bertha the only way to go gamers know how good call now how do we get up there well every time i jump up here it kicks you back down only missed that it's another crab oh no it's a parrot it's a parry shaped crab we do get those around here this time of year can't move from everywhere parrot rave i'll buy your lonesome oh that's a proper pirate there connect the gears impressive engineering for a bunch of pirates my darling eleanor my sweet abigail should i perish here should i fill you well rest in peace my pirate friend yeah i had a bad day helena what are you doing down there helena please come on it's another crab parrot oh there's lots of bones here all right judging by the clothes they're colonists maybe it was a fight no i i don't think so look how that arranged yeah you're right they're stacked they were just shoved against the wall no respect they were already dead when they were brought here this is a masquerade nate hello traitor who is this and look at the sign traitor it's one of the rebels that's a bad way to die it's spin here's another one i can cosplay as a velociraptor sorry no disrespect more gibbets i'm sure i can hear dinosaurs i've seen jurassic park and i know what dinosaurs sound like and those are dinosaurs oh there was another battle here wasn't there oh my god new devon we made it i guess that's one way to quash a rebellion yeah murder them all this is always the plan what slaughter all the colonists no to lure them here in hopes of finding their utopia only to rob them of everything that they have we are dealing with a bunch of pirates did he kill himself that gate's not budging we need to get up and over hmm cody maycomb aries pirates in paradise or something oh that's a lesser spotted chicken look at all these see your kids i enjoy that video do you know the one i'm talking about it's like a little girl looking at some turkeys and she just goes i just need your help first look at all these chickens yes me every time like it just every single time it gets me these don't look steady they're not be careful me pogchamp didn't even see that i was hidden [Music] up and over i'm playing it for fun if you don't mind some structural problems and water damage yeah clearly some drainage issues a real fixer-upper opportunity i'm playing it because i okay played the original trilogy as well i just never got around to this that damn and then flooded the whole place you know i forgot pretty good at this all right so which one of these do you think is avery's uh my money's on that one one's still intact ah you're not so bad at this either yeah well you know a little practice read a few books [ __ ] what what the front door sam he's still alive yeah for now come on it is nathan's wife yeah all right keep your eyes open marco polo do it all right i imagine it's quite cold though you know when sully told me about this place i was picturing wooden jacks and simple homes at most it's a bit more elaborate than that elena through here watch your head hmm someone had it in for this guy another old note something bad went down dude had his guts spared that's not a good way to go [ __ ] sure get down that's not a velociraptor that's like the babadook or the girl from the ring it's not a horror game it's an adventure stay out of the long grass boom all right got in sure there was a guy over there that was john wick how was johnny boy if i've ever seen it excuse me elena please move you're in my way yeah that's it come to papa come to papa busted right it's on now [Music] i do a little flank i never know where i went people lost track of all us how is this click that was rude voice right there what's with the jaws music i'd like to get up this one but i don't know how [Music] everything's okay yes yes yes this is really confusing the ai the ai is just like what's i've never seen a player play like this before yeah i don't know how to deal with this as an artificial intelligence i've never seen any human this stupid does not compute uh oh man look at these reeds under the water how nice is that it looks incredible oh that's a grenade where did that come from [Music] helene is fine i'm gonna find you oh my god oh my god me i think i need to plan this out a bit better whoa what what i'm i'm stuck no way i imagined that let me get the high ground ow no i'm rolling around the wrong way damn it is it gonna spawn me in that weird place again [ __ ] i don't know what's going on here it's scoring me in a really weird area i'm stuck i'm actually stuck in the ground i can't get out please i'm i'm stuck in the ground i literally can't get out [Music] hitting a brick wall what what hang on uh i can't get out of there i might have to restart the whole thing try one more time guys what do i do [ __ ] i'm just going to restart the encounter because that's bugged [ __ ] sorry about that guys like there's not much i could do about that [Music] that's unfortunate that's like the first bug that i've seen in the game really that's a game breaking bug as well uh turn right around [Music] get away from shotgun guy stop donate hey that was a pretty nasty glitch wasn't it it happens you know games aren't perfect [Music] hmm elena you're gonna get spotted so huh what why don't you jump up yeah yeah he might be here all right then clothesline though the hell was that that's a grenade launcher [Music] [Music] oh really grenades i'm gonna have to get my gun back [Music] i'm sure there's someone chasing me with a shotgun here isn't that stay dead so annoying that guy show me your face [Music] let's go [Music] stand up you're a different guy okay that's a lot of them dead it can't be that many more left alive now one dude at the top there i think i've got most of the snipers with the grenades oh hello that's useful i'll get to the top and we'll jump over that's it jesus i think that's it you okay yeah that's a lot of bad guys might be a way through this cave yeah it's worth a look yeah it just looked like one of those areas where you just have to dive down up here come on elena let's go check it out ah crap how many people did you bring here nadine she does too many well let's hope not for sam's sake look there's something here it's addressed to richard watt i promise you swift retribution and adam baldridge as you've taken from me so have i taken you i remember that little skeleton thing there i was in one of the puzzles earlier wasn't it there gonna be more horrible puzzles for me i can't wait for that refreshing i assume that we need this i don't know what for but i think we need it i'm not working out yet i need to bring it up here for some reason pull it this way first if i push it a bit further can't do that it's getting stuck on the bottom of the ramp alina i'm working on it there you go come on box my name is boxy like that that's the spot after you oh sweet you want me to be your decoy no being gentlemanly there just busting your chops yeah well the chops are plenty busted already thank you my chops are ruined elaine you should know this elaine elaine oh calm down that wasn't too bad you okay yeah i'm fine you this is why we saw it again tired bruised oh hungry i could eat other than that fine okay come on let's keep going nothing there might just be the way that we fell down oh it's through here come on let's try cutting through this house yeah i'm right behind you how long did they spend making this game was it like five years six years less than that nice set of kind you got there you think the colonies flooded this place well they definitely had the motivation uh you don't think it's them i just find it odd that all these houses are underwater except for one avery's exactly flooded it all he wouldn't know a protocol on them oh we're through the other side now there's the big gate yeah let's just hope we're not too late had some serious defenses hey check it out these cannons look like they were retrofitted yeah improvised defenses guess they didn't expect they'd be fighting each other guess not thought door's gonna be locked obviously i'd like to fire one of those that'd be fun in real life i mean and in video game real life would be better nice water feature time for another swim i guess whoa whoa stronger than it looks over there that looks like an exit well that didn't go well right you are and we're going to get to the light the current is strong wonder if we can get over the top somehow climb that if i jump over there a little bit ahead and then use the current to push myself over like so can you come and weigh this down you stand there stop allowing the stun there elena please you're not helping me out here hold up now you say great yeah i already knew the solution you had to jump off for it to do that okay you're welcome thank you make a great counterweight uh i mean okay i'll choose to take that as a compliment as well you should stop this water hey if at first you don't succeed all right let's do that again okay so we have to get over there i think scoot around here i'm gonna have to like drop a box for her or something i imagine i made it i'll find a way up for you this [ __ ] work get down that night get down there do it she's busting my chopstick anyone yeah you're right let's go let's move this out of the way yep my darling counterweight she did say she took it as a compliment so it's fine hey look thomas too sigil so we're in his mansion second in command going up the pirate hierarchy it's the round table good lord they're all dead looks like we found the party looks like we're a little late are they all poisoned by avery check it out it's another sigil oh my god what it's them it's all of them elena these other pirate captains have founded libertalia what the hell happened here well i'm no forensics expert but i would say bad drinks apparently so what was this some kind of wealthy pirate suicide cult yeah not likely not these guys on behalf of lord avery i invite you to my manner at sundown tomorrow the time has come to abandon our animosities and reunite under the banner of god and liberty signed thomas too what do you bet thomas ii henry avery looks like our hosts didn't stick around to clean up their mess well that wasn't very gracious of them okay so so these guys sparked a full-scale revolt when they claimed the treasure for themselves now they took care of the colonists but then they had to deal with each other and i'm guessing things got pretty messy so avery and two invite them up here to um uh was it uh abandon our animosity abandon the animosities avery makes a grand toast for god and liberty our [ __ ] mateys and they all take a swig they're all dead except these two and just like that all the treasure of libertalia becomes the sole possession of two men these are some of history's greatest pirates they were played perished in an instant at this very table it's incredible i'm sorry i uh i'm sorry you said it it's okay so since our missing hosts aren't here at two's manor we should head over to avery's yeah let's go gone in an instant yeah it's all the dudes from the paintings from earlier there for posterity is he drawing it honor among thieves there is none hey up here slowly be careful it's fine i'm okay it's fine i got it i'll meet you up top she's a beast this is so tomb raider this bit hey hi cannons you want me to go this way that shoreline truck is still there yeah i see it keep your eyes peeled huh no we don't go down there really now sorry it's not that's not conducive to our mission and we are officially inside henry avery's house it's a break-in fbi open up oh it's fancy some gilded wall panels there very nice ostentatious so why didn't he kill thomas too was he like his right-hand man yeah that's exactly what he was can you imagine taking orders from a paranoid psychopath this sounds like my first job could i play the piano i can it doesn't work very well but the producer on your tv show no my manager from macho nachos worked at a macho nacho it was a high school job did you wear one of those hats the point is my boss was a paranoid psychopath he was the manager at a macho nacho just watch it okay what's macho nacho is that a restaurant oh look shoreline barricaded the front door and left a bunch of muddy footprints behind let's see where they went more is it's metal gear solid now isn't it whose footprint are these oh there's guns everywhere so where all the shoreline guys i know right i expected to see someone by now yeah it's like they're all often vanished you don't suppose they're pirate ghosts don't even joke about that pirate ghost that's cool man i'd i'd be up for me and some pirate ghosts why not hello hello hey here we go it's gonna break no okay baited that's the wrong way maybe bingo can't see the footprints anymore can i active camo hey come on over faceplant a beautiful statue very nice footprints go through this door let's go through crap it's blocked from the other side why bother barricading their path unless they've found something all right help me push this open yeah oh [ __ ] [Music] it was a ambush he's got a minigun look at the grenades can i use that can i use this minigun oh i nearly died then yeah look at this come get some not good for health uh dice dice where's it rich we talked about this didn't we okay that that doesn't work when you fire bullets through there they just don't nothing happens there was no hit wrench all right we're starting again so just chill m14 custom hello oh that's got a scope on it yeah i like this one [Music] the one bank [Music] double team yeah or the bartok yeah that's what you want the true one-hit kill [Music] oh that was in the groin wasn't it i mean [Music] that one looked painful [Music] where you going come back so where's that guy down there are we good elena please it's fine jesus you all right yeah they were just waiting to ambush us yeah all right let's get that door open that was tricky see what they didn't want us to find i wonder what the other guys are doing while this is happening nice little combat arena though this i enjoyed that china do you want to get on this it's got four right where was the door that they were barricading over there no i'm gonna keep my m14 custom i think okay here we go ready try again hey hello there what is it it's a letter signed by avery really read it my loyal subjects as the sun sets on our glorious paradise we must endeavor to preserve its riches the traitorous too knows our secrets so we must act quickly destroy the dam cleanse new devon here we go uh-huh and move my treasure through the passage to my ship two and avery turned on each other are you really surprised i guess not here you go thanks let's go find that passage that one's just open that's fine [Music] and that's dumbledore isn't it spin the globe spin the globe there's no more footprints they end here okay so where did they go pirate ghosts hollywood ghosts let's look around this is amazing what what have you got there it's a copy of the british proclamation to apprehend avery seems like he was proud of being the most wanted man in the world he was pirate escobar hello very fancy he's got a tiger rug that's when you know someone's really really rich and they've got a tiger rug and giant paintings and gold on the wall and that's yeah it's another level tigger sorry about that ticket it didn't have to end this way there's usually a secret button at the fireplace something like that maybe in the statue or the swords twist his head off sam's lighter oh did he drop it yeah on purpose whatever it is we're looking for has to be somewhere around here there's got to be another way out of this room the floor is that passage avery mentioned in the letter but where's the switch it's always there's always a switch it's going to be hidden here this is a switch no that's a clock nathan no nathan come on nate yeah did you find something i think so you just made the globe a bit good thing they figured that out for us how did you do that there's a bloody fingerprint right here where libertalia should be and i pushed it nicely done it's simple so the letter said that avery was moving his treasure to the ship yeah do you think the treasure's still on the island i think uh i think it doesn't matter anymore here we go i don't like this hit watch your head yeah oh looks like avery built himself a panic cave yeah i wonder where this goes it's a pirate panic cave i dig guess we're gonna find out this place doesn't look very stable avery's descent so sam's come through here then fresh footprints they must have come this way crap you can't well i have to shake the controller no no no no i don't agree with that it looks like they went this way my money's on nadine's men they'll use any excuse to use dynamite they'd have to be pretty dumb to use it in here yeah they're pretty dumb and dumb dummies uh oh you bring any spare batteries yeah yeah yeah they're in the controller layer whoa whoa hold up so some kind of death trap uh yeah but sam and the others somehow made it across you just got to follow their lead oh isn't that one of the shoreline then so we just follow the footprints i guess careful don't die and get impaled on a spike if it didn't creak so much just don't go where the footsteps aren't what just a little preoccupied with not blowing up right now and unclench what elena look footprints stop here they blew it up they must have made it through and it collapsed behind them damn it hey just gonna move this out of the way here yeah that didn't help at all i have to find another way what what if there's just not another way one day nate there's not going to be another way and then you're ruined and then that's the end of the game oh no just hold on a little longer no no no no no no come on it's not working guys i'm shaking it i'm shaking it hey you still have sam's lighter yes good idea come on come on come on come on of course he used it all up smoked like a goddamn chimney on the boat right over relax i brought some matches you did of course there we go i mean there's no light whatsoever oh sorry one sec no it's a horror game hello over here oh now that's my head over here where'd you get that from thanks glad you came prepared somebody had to come on let's find a way forward nice romantic lighting huh you have a funny idea of romantic yes i do you can't squeeze through there there's a tiny hole there nate hey this way is that that would kill me wouldn't it that's back oh here we go this looks promising boost you up yeah come on i almost died then okay here we go okay come on up okay thanks watch your head yeah it's a blood trail i can't go this way nope dead end sam is bleeding everywhere whoa what the hell is this this is creepy just a load of arms i guess the hands that stole from me wow avery's not even pretending to be seen at this point i don't like this place me either let's get out of here fire effect that looks real that's that's photorealistic again that's something else dead end back we go look avery had some gibbots left over gibbets what it's pronounced gibbets gibbons are you sure yeah well no one likes to know at all is what you get in video games when you kill someone do i have to go down here really is this what you okay i think so is it a trap what was that trap yeah avery really didn't want any trespassers down here all right watch your step me you're the one that stepped on it fine watch my step oh got it oh hell god damn it are you okay trigger it and roll back so far so good maybe i just stay a little ways back um no i hate this crap you gotta go forward oh hell god damn it are you okay yeah so far so good maybe i just stay a little ways back crap you okay yeah well now we know what caused the explosion we heard earlier no wonder so many parts of this passage have caved in hey nate i found a shortcut this is horrible i'm getting anxiety oh no no no no elena we're just in a pit and you've ruined us jesus oh avery's decorated this chamber too more human mobiles they're haunts rib cages dude's brutal i'm lost damn it more mummies don't explode okay my god please oh this can't be healthy to breathe fine i'm fine i wish i brought earplugs am i yelling how am i alive mate careful yeah and avery's gone all egyptian except this mummification wasn't you know voluntary i don't know how i survived that i think i should should be dead i should be dead well we're back on the trail the footprints go this way be ready for a fight oh i always am is that in reference to me no would you calm down you calm down you need to calm down you're being too loud copyright strike taylor's coming for me hey i guess these guys weren't paying attention it's not like oh yeah let's be honest we'll find them elena get down ow oh the big lad on the way nice job no ammo elena get it jump over get him good everything's fine this is the best gun in the game this is one that you want oh nice one well played oh oh i'm gonna get his shotgun i want that where's it gone condor there we go two bullets you kidding me oh damn he might have some ammo four bullets jeez [Music] yeah that thing's really powerful i like it a lot more grenades good good good grenades good enemies bad [Music] yup oh no no no i assume he would have just walked into that right [Music] that's it that's it can i shoot it well for once i appreciate avery's exploding mummies the mouths that spoke ill of me i hate to see this guy's christmas tree i mean this proper grim he's cut their jaws off what's why would you do that all right let's see if we can catch up hey how's it going is loops around guess so i just got your batteries this was one of avery's guys bad men tell no tails i seen that in a pirate to the caribbean movie once it was great looks like a fight broke out use the spearhead men versus avery's use the spear excuse me hello a key some kind of key take it what's that note oh right it's uh it's from two to his men hey we can use the key to get out of here that's good oh no no no there's some symbols on the back oh let's go find a keyhole death to those who stray from the path oh boy mommies i i hate this like it's it's awful please no more if i ever go to a museum in the future and they have an exhibition on mummies or sarcophagus i'm gonna have ptsd i'm not going anywhere near them you're gonna explode now huh no how about you this guy had some serious trust issues oh god oh god oh god i'm stuck you're done nice moves please thank you huh not quite as creepy as all the hanging bones still it's a little creepy yeah maybe three out of ten though i'd say four that's a six easy six i'm gonna call that a puff dinger very valuable yeah we're definitely descending okay it's another death trap yeah no footprints to guide us hmm we've got symbols on uh is it the same as what was on this note here right symbols match the ones on those posts two showed his men how to get past the traps okay so the score one the bottom right if it's the right way up is death so bottom right so i should be able to walk on these two so that's is that the same skull so bottom right so that one will kill me so i should be able to go okay to a good start follow my lead okay just be careful i'm always careful crosses says the guy who set off every mummy bomb in this place but you know not a lot of experience with the mummy bombs thank you so the two bottom ones are okay when the boat's on the bottom so far so good yeah knock on wood better not it might be rigged crosses so cross is the only safe one is top left i can't i could get to that but then i couldn't go anywhere else so top left so this one should be okay and then skull bottom right is death when it's at the bottom so if i go like this and like this i should be okay there made it in your face avery oh god i hope there's no more of those please no more i don't want to do that that's our way out of here oh god are those the rest of two's men yeah gotta be we know avery likes to make an example of his enemies he definitely likes making exploding mummies yeah let's uh tread carefully in here key use the key no use a key name keyhole key wait it could be a trap we really don't have much of a choice oh boy but i have a good feeling about this one huh do it okay you see well at least we didn't get belonged to bits you didn't bring a knife by any chance did you no oh but that guy's got a sword here help me swing this

crew right into one of avery's traps smart hey look about the whole alk is our thing just we got to save that for later okay which way on the beach other side of this town okay good i hope all that ruckus didn't attract any attention sorry what are we doing what do you think we're doing we're getting the hell off of this rock right we we we could do that or we could head in that direction which is a shortcut shortcut to what gibbets to avery's treasure oh wow i mean rape's got to go all the way around but we can't just be brave hey victor with all due respect maybe just you just don't know when to quit look we're all here for the same reason right what we didn't come after the treasure we came after you and i appreciate that i i do but we're good and we've got the lead for now we can do this nathan come on huh look around okay avery scuttled every last ship on this island you know why because he was hell-bent on keeping his treasure exactly no matter the cost of the others around him because he didn't want anyone to follow him because he was leaving look at this okay i found his map of the island okay that's his ship right under that mountain that's where our treasure is and it is exactly where rafe is headed right now while we stand around here and argue like idiots what if he's already left the island and his ship sunk somewhere out there in the middle of the ocean then we find out where it got sunk oh boy how long we've been chasing this thing huh it wouldn't be no offense to these guys but they don't get it he's about influence actually sam they do they really do okay trust me they've seen this kind of obsession before what's happening we're not those kids anymore we're not and we got nothing to prove victor where's that plane right this way um is it far not very just through this port town i still don't trust them now the whole crew said no i set up an ambush by the plane they didn't and what makes you so sure because they're heading to the mountain for the treasure this way there she is beautiful it's a long drop how did you get here i hop down a few of these walls but i guess we'll have to find another way around still haven't used a cannon yet naughty dog please it's all i ever wanted in life just one opportunity to use okay it's too high to get back up yeah maybe there's something we can put under it how about this giant cart here now don't reload absent we've done enough fighting for the day all right he's walking in slow motion there i'm not sure about that hey you need a hand hello thanks we got it that'll do wait wait strenuous noises don't worry nathan will find one he always does there's never a dead end hey guys through here huh whoa check that thing out what's that sky rail or something i think it still works there's no controls but i bet i could pull the platform with my rope how are you doing kid uh i'm not sure yet swinging maybe if you could get to that wooden platform down there now get me on the other side i'd like i'd like to get off please i would like to see the baby yeah we're getting there i can't wait to sleep in my own bed again so close it's so far could i just swing it i got an idea nathan give me a hand okay

avery's [ __ ] come on let him we're done we're done most of my men are dead rife and those who aren't have already left can you see that the end is literally in sight that maniac pirate of yours has rigged this entire cave i'm not setting foot on his ship nadine if you cut and run right now the loss of all your men everything that we've done is for nothing we have millions engulfed right here i'd say that plus our lives is something no wonder so many of your men abandoned you excuse me we're on the verge of making history here and you're willing to just walk off with a pittance of fraction of what sam's gonna get from that boat if he can walk away from that ship alive he can have it he'll i'd say he's earned it god knows you didn't oh now look we can stand here and insult each other all day or we can finish what it is oh we're finishing it alright sorry man thing about mercenaries nadine their loyalty it's bought highest bidder it's not earned now come on either we can finish this thing together or we can just end it right here let's go make history not a girl by all means awkward that dude had a sick mullet he's making a little cold what do you have in store for us captain

i've got the barnacles shoreline he genuinely looks like the guy that plays orlando bloom's dad in pirates of the caribbean he's a scarce guard i wonder if they did that as a little easter egg or it's just accidental or a coincidence maybe it's nothing i swear to god naughty dog if i don't find one of these cannons by the end of the game it's a one out of ten what's up sam where you at look at the

god help her she sure seems to love you i know right listen the offer still stands i appreciate it but i'm good i know but if you feel like you're imposing you're not we talked about it it's not about that it's a little bit of that okay but i just kind of thought that after we found avery's treasure i'd be satisfied uh instead i've uh left with this strange feeling of emptiness yeah yeah well you know as thrilling as the next adventure might be in the end i always left with that same feeling sometimes you just gotta choose what you're gonna keep and what you're gonna let go well i guess i'm just not there yet and besides you know you've got a few ancient cities on me and i can't let that slide i left a couple out there well thank you oh that's that's all right yeah uh sam you've come far we sure have a little brother listen don't do anything i wouldn't do all right get out of here good night so victor what's next for you hmm well before i got dragged into this i was working on a business deal of sorts of sorts dangerous with these people yeah it's up there well i just so happen to know a certain someone recently out of prison who might be perfect for this kind of work oh i don't know is he trustworthy more or less how's this portuguese condo marido what's that mean how long before your husband gets home [Laughter] that'll do come on hey you got any more of those cigars

you're through you got it hi hi you you're buying james and marine we are buying james and marine oh okay how why well i heard this rumor about a salvaged job off the coast of malaysia and i thought it would be right up our alley no honey look we barely got out of libertage alive yeah hey taking an illegal job you know what that leads to who said it was illegal look this came in this morning is this legit yeah some of my old contacts out there they worked their magic with the malaysian permit office it was great i didn't even have to bribe anyone well that's good because i don't know how we

sneaky one of course most of them are gonna have to go into our venture here along with all the new camera gear camera gear yeah you know i figured as we're pulling all the cargo up from the dive we could hire you know a small crew we could film the whole thing and resurrect my old show underwater what happened to just living a normal life i think in our attempt to lead a normal life we may have oversteered look when i was on that island i missed the adventure i missed us and so now we have a chance to do what we love but from here on out we are going to operate on a strictly legal basis all right and i will be doing all of the shooting with my really expensive gamer no more guns night but the gun's down you've really thought all this through haven't you more or less but listen just say

okay look if you guys were into some shady stuff it's totally cool but i think i'm old enough to know about it right old enough how old are you again ah funny mom all right well let's see um for me it started when this guy called me up with the scoop on a massive historical find it sounded like a complete fraud yeah handsome fraud i hadn't even met him yet she knew she knew so this fraud says if you fund the trip then i'll give you the coffin of sir francis drake and for the record i totally delivered yeah he delivered us into the hands of indonesian pirates oh come on you know i had nothing to do with that guys time out you're saying that you were attacked by pirates after you found the coffin of sir francis drake is that right yeah that's pretty much it [ __ ] language crap better all right so keep going you know what the sun is up boat's ready wind is just right you want to continue the story i say we do it on the water come on wait what would francis drake look like was it gross actually he wasn't in there yeah just his journal with a map to el dorado the city of gold that's the legend turns out it was just a statue a cursed statue no way seriously yeah seriously but i'll get back to that later [Music] [Music] wow very good enjoyed it a lot some great moments in there i thought the combat was massively improved from uncharted 3. epic set pieces graphics detail it's really good the soundtrack as well is excellent i do wonder if they'll make another uncharted game because that one feels very final [Music] and obviously [Music] they're a lot older there and they've got what 13 14 year old girl that was very good i would give it a 9 out of 10. excellent game anyway guys thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this if you did hit that like button below we're going to be doing more walkthroughs on stream published as vod coming up very soon i thought it was great subscribe if you want to see more and i'll see in the next one bye
