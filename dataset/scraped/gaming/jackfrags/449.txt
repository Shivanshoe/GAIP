this way make sure nobody takes that spawner god he's firing shells into the woods i've got a lot of bugs so what is their artillery they literally literally basically have spirits does someone have to man it yeah two people you have to have a loader and a fire where is it on the map just uh in the in the very very bottom squares there's three points i'm not sure you can hear it firing that's on the right that's to the 200 205. well she's your co-location like that's you're half black aren't you jeff yeah well you're like that's not a real point killing them because they can just spawn on it and get yeah but you can keep let me destroy i'm not sure transport truck on the move i'd like to see the baby so that's great let's go find them then i mean it would give them immense frustration if you just rocked up on them and killed them so that's that's exactly what's going on yeah that's what i wanted because their artillery is boring well get to me get to me i don't know here just get to me oh he's shooting at me he's shooting at me you guys are here all right that's one dead do you kill a guy with a thompson guild two guys oh that was that good pretty dead i got them all yeah this is
