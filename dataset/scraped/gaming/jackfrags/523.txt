hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to apex legends season seven big thanks to ea for sponsoring this one today we're gonna be playing with jacksepticeye dive again for the first time season 7 has just launched it's brought with it a new map called olympus and also a new legend horizon and she's kind of cool she's got a black hole she's got gravitational dinghy that like pushes you up into the sky and she's got a passive that means that you can fall from heights and you don't lose any momentum you just keep on going you keep on going so we're gonna have some fun with this today i did get the battle pass this is one of the new octane skins octane is my favorite character in the game so naturally i had to get that skin because that's sick i think that's actually the best skin they put in the game for octane i like the power ranger one as well but that one's pretty neat so we got that there's a couple of like skins for like wraith looking a bit sharp in that one and that's a horizon skin as well but we just talked about that there's all sorts oh let me just show you this uh this r 99 as well r 99 is back in the rotation and that's a reactive skin i think or maybe it's the one you get after that i don't know but it's sweet oh no he's back but thank you for coming along to the stream if you're watching this as a video hi how you doing i'm looking forward to this you know i haven't really played apex in a while so be fun to get stuck in again and have a laugh with mr jacksepticeye let's see if he's ready sean sorry uh how's it are you good to go okay no problem so have you tried this shirt you need to click the heads don't you because you got to get the damage a non-stop headshotter i've heard that you have a 100 headshot ratio all right okay um no okay 100

okay you're a lot meaner than i am uh okay i send you an invite we should be good to go let's go toss boy that's me does it mean oh wait i have my my camera is all over the place uh where's a good place for camera you don't have to worry about that a good place for a camera like i reckon just right in the middle for like scale it up so it takes up about 80 of the screen right that's good i think right on my crosshair so it looks like i'm biting people that's it i can't remember where stuff shows up on screen so i'll just uh do that there check i need my sponsor thing up on screen i'm very bad at this the smaller that is the better just kidding right underneath my cam ooh that looks stylish actually i'm a professional at this more people should sponsor me um all right new mode available yeah so you can just play that's the preview that's like a passive version of the map where you can just like run around it and check out the new map and test the abilities and stuff oh no we're we're going straight in for duo's baby oh you want duo's okay okay i want to there's a lot of cobwebs on these fingers right now i need to like dust these bad boys off and get in [Music] when was the last time you played this um it was after they brought in the ranked stuff oh man that was a while back that's scary uh yeah it was right after revenant came into the game oh yeah reverend is cool um i'm trying with the new one why not yeah do it horizon is from scotland oh and she ended up in space i see did you see the little cinematic they made for her uh yeah it was cool yeah interstellar too i call it introducing your champion it does it's it's us we're just going to see ourselves on screen all day here we go without saying whoa i mean i mean marco all replicator zones oh what's a replicator do jack oh so you can you can get crafting materials and go to a replicator and build gear for yourself oh hell yeah you want to go there yeah let's go let's do it speed is key all right this might be a disaster jack i don't even know if my sensitivity is good i love how you say that when we're about to hit the ground locked for fine i'm gonna go here we're dropping into a very modern nice looking apartment yes i'm sure there won't be any hostiles at all none at all i haven't oh i have an r301 already where are they oh we've won the game then you're getting into the fight damage on him dude i've never lost it there's a blue shield here i might be a bit too cocky for this i think it's fine just tell me if i'm overbearing tell me if i'm like going too hard and like rain me back in when i need it so the good friend will do i'll do none of that so you've got a couple of cool abilities where's he press your queue sean look at that look at that certain upstream oh dude if i can hit somebody from here you're gonna fall down in three two one it's fine i don't think you know how time works my own version of time there's someone fighting down here yeah this guy's over there and there was one guy right i knocked one down there should we go rush them like maniacs that guy hated me rush the mic freaks well i'm shielding up because that guy melted me oh this dude oh i've got it i mean i'm in trouble sean i've got a hill oh you went behind a pillar jack there's nothing i can do against solid walls yep you can shoot through those using science i think yes go up into that thing it's huh right all right i got it yeah i mixed our abilities i'm a legend what guns do you have i have a hemlock and an r301 sweet that's pretty good is the hemlock good now um it's okay yeah it's got the it's the burst fire one isn't it yeah i think so yeah yeah the prowler is the other one oh look at you i'm dropping all the things oh god you're like santa right hold on i've just got to get a bit of shield back did you kill one of those people um i'd like to say that i did just for the clout and people on twitch would think i'm really cool uh but no okay here's someone yeah see if i can get a few shots on with the the wingman grenade on our left here knocks down one i'm gonna heal nice this map is dope looking it's cool isn't it it's very colorful oh right right below me oh there she go she's right here i'm down jack she's hurt though she's hurt you can get her but you can get her i think you mean you can't kill her you're terrible well to be fair that's how i look when i use the wingman i need to get used to the movement and everything man it's so fast it's a lot quicker than i remember it's fine good effort good effort it's not a bad first game not mad at all uh yeah let me move my cam again i'm blocking the map for everybody yeah i kind of wished i had like an r99 there or r301 or something yeah uh you want to try it no no you go ahead go ahead i want to see you put that black hole down that's cool isn't it what is her alt it's a black hole that sucks people in i think i had it ready that time i should have used it we're warming up every time you throw it down you have to guys black hole black hole okay remember me friend the chet master yes i am the chat master guys non-stop winners all right so where did we where did we land then on the map we were got no idea were we there we landed like right where we are now yeah what's this swirly whirly should we go there i got something sure for a jack there we go that look oh that looks nice i don't know what this is but we're going for it okay let's go through the oh lord oh that's not that's not loud the game's like stop it i care oh you got the car sweet i want to see what it does i don't i think you can just can you drive into that it's like a portal really low orbit i'm jumping oh i jumped out you've been sucked in you've gone um jack i think you're gonna need an assistance i went through where we tried to land oh god oh there's people here oh that's funny i heard them though they had no shield drive into the black hole he says you'll be grand uh i don't know where they went i kind of went belly up real quick there jack it did didn't it yeah i don't it didn't suck the car through for some reason is someone coming through this what does that mean right dude you're cracked you're unreal at this game that was such a difficult kill for me why did that open by itself is there a poltergeist right i'll get you back in don't worry run jack i'm not messing with any ghosts do you like people i'm worried about if there's dead people as well i don't know what to do there's a giant gap there i'm not sure about that jump into it you seem to like crazy tactics if you want to end up on the other maps again maybe do hmm back in the game there's some loot around here as well back in baby got a shield here you could use mothers lock up your daughters jack's back hope you guys all enjoyed getting the kills while i was gone because you're gonna get none [Laughter] ah dude mozambique it's over oh peloton bikes no these are actual bikes i don't think you can ride them though unfortunately that would be funny i'm so lost like where where do we go what do we do i don't know the map yet you lead on you're the first one all right let's go this way i kind of want to see i i feel like this ramp here is for a vehicle you think it boosts you if you're in a car maybe i mean i know you can boost the car but can octane get across it that's what i'm thinking yo he's a quick boy i'm gonna put the jump pad there oh god look this is for science okay okay no one's tested this before i'll get a good angle on you all right i'm gonna drop all my stuff just know that if you fall i won't be able to get you back uh okay here we go it's fine it's right it's fine for science all right for science here we go all right quite a bit more speed there jack i was so close i was so close i really thought you were gonna make it it's slow motion yeah listen these things need to be tested that was like an action movie yeah allow us to be dumb so you don't have to be yeah now the audience knows don't be an idiot like jack yeah you met yourself right yes not you okay good sean when you're playing with me you're sure that's true wait what oh you marked this i thought this was a thing that works uh there's one there's one like to your left or there's one up by the orbital cannon i heard gunshots oh those guys right there all right hey pick me up jack that's cool that's not bad i was so close dude so close you actually were to be fair you got much further than i thought you would but you still died so i'm gonna have to uh revoke your game record sorry could you go i could have made it to the other ramp maybe that's where i went wrong isn't it and that's where it all went belly up yeah that one decision is what messed up that whole thing it cost me everything it's okay i'm gonna pull up in this trident this is the phase runner or the trident the trident i think it's cool i'm jumping out here jack i don't hear your character's voices and it it's making me sad that's why i'm redoing them thank you i like her accent i would like some better guns ooh a treasure pack what does that do i think you've unlocked like a comic book with that or something dick i love those i don't need this all right i'm starting to get like the the flow back a little bit yeah should we go loot that in there i don't feel like i have arthritis anymore is that how it felt when you started playing a little bit yeah a little cold you know you're when you play games and your hands get a little cold you just can't do anything that's me right now my face when i don't like playing games when my hands are cold i have to agree with you there yeah just something not right about it oh that's the mastiff that's really good wait you can get the mastiff just on the ground yeah oh that's new well for me at least well it used to be it used to be ground loop and then they put it in the crates and then they brought it back ah interesting that's kind of fun yeah it's a cool shotgun the best shotgun i want to see you snipe someone with it don't know about that attention oh we need our car again look at this racetrack where's it gone where's the car it's back over where you spawned let's go get it yeah you can put things on that car as well like what well abilities so you could put the uh you know caustics gas traps you could be a mobile gas bomb or you could put ramparts machine gun on it sick is it two-seater three let's go watch out for the gas dude we're going for it oh it's in the gas now i mean would do a chicken nah we'd die that's fine you got the boost as well we're doing a jack now this is part racing i feel like i'm on racetrack at epcot in disney except i haven't got a little charge in there jack it's i'm kind of worried 60 miles an hour go grand we made it bosh did it oh lord can you um if you put your gravity time to tell you i don't have my license maybe i wish you'd told me that before oh look at this love village though a love village what do they do here profess love to each other oh can we test them get out of here though because i'm worried that you'll come on to me a little too strong no it's okay oh there's a ramp there though come on there it is now we are oh lord come on can i drive over them in this uh you can try nevermind never mind never mind they hurt i'll use it as cover instead sweet lords they instantly i see that one behind you up top i'm sorry dad there we go you can do it okay you know we're just trying out furniture i know we're trying to drive around ramp around and everybody else is like oh i want to win he's just one dj with a wingman or something yeah he melted me oh hell yeah requiem for a smiley face what's that it's the comic i unlocked oh cool you're not allowed to read it though oh did you get a comic book i think so where where would it be too late ruined okay next time wrong game kill em all if i all right i'll pick rampart i want to see if you can like how good this is mother of god see i might imagine that but on the vehicle you've got a tank dude you can't you can't lose now this is your champion can you see the calls on the map straight away you know what i look like probably they're on like little spotlight areas like little pedestals [Music] your character just said something about enemies parents never loving them she's mean also she's got some kind of a hoverboard i don't know what that's about well you just sent a lot of metal into the air that'll come down and kill someone later good right okay so will i get the turret straight away if you want to it's the ultimate isn't it all right let's take this you jump on oh lord let's get some loot i forgot that i'm not uh third person oh if i can sentinel someone while on the car the drive-by sniper shot three little bikes they used a rampart for them shots oh there's some crafting materials around here okay here we go crafting materials i don't have any armor yeah i just got an evil shield it's very nice here this time of year it is beautiful i think what i like about this map is it's quite a different color palette to the other two yeah they're always really good at that i think their map design is pretty decent uh did you get those crafting materials from before i did not they're on the map you can use that machine there ah i see oh i just got sniped um what's the vault like uh it's pretty cool it's a little smg i think i got a shot from there oh big snipes hey they're open that window judging my shields trying to get a cheeky peeky cheeky cheeky pk up there his was a lot stronger than my all right let's uh can they please just stop shooting at us that'd be great i'm going to try and get the car lovely jack come pick me up people are the kids are shooting at me okay come in not that's the wrong i'll come around this way there's a roof on this i think i'm safe yeah would you do it right now we've got oh yeah baby oh you can get four people in this wait where are we going uh just towards the uh the saves area i guess that way okay okay okay here we go wrap your ramp bosh it remains to be seen how effective this will be i expect it will be completely useless but you never know don't say that all right it's gonna be 10 kills deep in this tunnel oh that's okay i got it should we lose see if there's anything we could get i know you were worried there for a second but i got you don't worry not a worry in the world sean not at all as long as i'm alive you'll never die uh there's an r99 here if you want it oh sweet i'm dropping some sniper i'm going heavy if you need it i'm doing volt r301 i want to check out what it's like a dangerous combo i wish i was better with the wingman oh dude it's so cool what those like i want those montages you want them you want something to make a montage of you someone do a montage of me from this stream where i miss every shot did my target just disappear hold on sorry oh it's still there yeah it is you're right hold on uh operate nope operate there we go there you go you want to go up the water slide oh dude yeah now it's a reverse theme park it's lou here what's for what what did she say whoa a mobile respawn beacon whoa beautiful there's a gold gun there as well scout i'll take it you didn't seem convinced i i suck with the scout man it's difficult but it's gold so that makes me way better yeah r301 turbocharger is there not a secret behind the waterfall ah come on respawn you let us down if they add one in it's because the jack frags totally not because of every uh 1980s goonies rip off come on really hop in the trident i'm ready are you feeling a few kills hey linda i've got my taste for blood maybe there's somebody in here i saw the scottish people just turning off our streams and unsubscribing no baby please don't go i promise i can change there must be somebody around to shoot the face there you go no there's a guy behind as well okay so i nearly down that first one i'm whipping around jack i hit him with a carrot and nothing happened you went for the road twice in the face but he had a lot of sheep one of these days one of these tactics will work yeah that i mean it didn't really do that much damage to be honest i'm really good well lesson learned it was a good effort a good try it's an interesting decision to not have their cars run people over did it just like boop him out the way or something yeah i guess you kind of need it because it would just be too overpowered then especially um okay try the i'll try a pathfinder so i can get out of danger faster all right carter hit move and target isn't it oh say that sentence as well apparently i know what we can do with him we can do a super grapple with the car yes floppy thank you so much very kindly man i hope you're all right okay that's a shark okay they don't allow them to have it in game because it's broken sauce boy toss boy let's go those boys uh let's go to the oasis hold your breath if you have no battery tall jack cost a cam down all right this is serious there's no time for fun and games he's messing about isn't he's having a lock uh i don't know what to do with them jack just spin it send us right down there to the ground so what's the difference between what's the blue chests now uh so that's the crafting resources and the one that's shaped like a hexagon is the the machine that you use to craft stuff you getting in a fight there i'm i'm unleashed god gamer uh hitting every shot i don't even have a gun yet sean it's fine jack you'll never stand a chance when i'm here okay i've got a [ __ ] i hear them i've been ruined [Applause] oh no oh one of them's so weak i've got one there's one of them upstairs he's coming he's coming ah my god i have this thing where every now and then my screen will just freeze and when i click it like re-centers that's a peculiar problem to have yeah so wait you click in game yeah it's like my like all i can do is strafe but my mouse doesn't move and then when i click it like relocks back on hmm is it is your mouse going across to you or the monitor are you in full screen mode oh that might be it it would be fine non-stop wins let's go yeah we've won every match so far we've played three matches in half an hour won all of them and died zero times if anyone news shows up in chat just tell them that we've won all of them just be a homie let's do this actually oh bloodhound okay i wanna i wanna sense people if you haven't played for a while bloodhound is really good now oh really yeah so that pulse there's a massive area now you can see people from miles away i'll see people in the next game apex legends 2 20 20 25 i think it's coming out can't wait for that right let's land let's get some loot get some armor let's actually try and play let's play let's try and play the game now not that we haven't won all the others already that's true uh where's a good place though i don't know the map well enough i know that's a hot spot for sure yeah i mean this yeah we've been there yeah let's go there whatever it's fine uh we could go there and work our way back okay prepare for the battle the battle lies below do you see everyone's spamming gg in the chat because of the game that we just won yep blood is anyone else here doesn't look like it there's some people like here there got it all right little let's get some armor let's do it just got a scope for my fists i'm just laughing like how would that actually how would that work easy jake you just throw it more accurately look everybody else might be like killing us but have any of them had as much fun as we have oh definitely not no surely nobody else is streaming the game either i don't think i think we're the only people in the world right now streaming there yeah we're big shots ea sponsored us nobody else was allowed stream when we were on then you this is prime time gaming tv right here it wouldn't be worth streaming when we're on um so we've looted this now uh shields and stuff over here oh cool there's an evo how are you how gone are you all right cool good talk yeah i just don't know what's real anymore sean because you could just be saying that to yourself oh there's no high stairs here jacqueline excellent i was worried for a second there right let's get the car i just want to like find a team and just ruin them you know just getting to the side yeah yeah got me to drive i'll drive actually i'll sit in the back because if they're going to shoot us they might as well shoot you first okay and you're back in the front no never mind i didn't realize how that worked is this like a half pipe thing here [Laughter] maybe not dude sick pop shoved i'm dismounting here thanks again sean no problem in about 15 seconds i'll be able to say it again uh do you need any shield batteries or anything you good i need a backpack now four and one big one okay okay did you have a long bow maybe you should change that out triple take boom no no no no no no no no no no no you don't fancy doing a bit of sniping well have a long bow uh triple take not a real big fan of the energy weapons yeah they've got slower travel time on the shots go through checkpoint eight jack there was no hostile did you hear me i did yeah i heard you okay good because you didn't like say anything so i was worried just keep me up keep me updated regularly about the hostiles okay oh my god look at that it's a long way down isn't it reckon you can get on that platform down there we call that a shawn hall yeah because i fall into these all the time laughs like jimmy carr just now oh legend i saw like a video clip of his sister his sister laughs exactly the same does he yeah she yes i said she i think you said he did i hate whoops my bed yeah there's a clip on twitter where i think i i mean they said it was his sister i'm assuming it was but yeah they try and make a laugh and then she doesn't laugh and then she laughs and it is exactly the same as jimmy carr it runs in the family apparently oh any hostiles uh it says not on my screen but i heard that so i think the game's lying to me now you think there's someone uh that's an explosion right in front of us oh they're hot shots sean oh god why is everybody a gamer game of god i mean we could back away if you want they're pushing over there someone else is over there i'm healing up one's only got white armor but so have i sir is above here i think you're the one doing the black calling on the roof uh one of them's low they're both on the roof sean please oh god i went way further than i thought it was good luck oh god are there any hostile shows are there any hostiles around hold on not that i can see joke none at all it looks like there might be don't try and revive either no no you're good ruined jeez i can't i don't know what to do against wingmen you just have to shoot them in the face i need to get used to the speed of the game again so fast should we try uh trio with a random let's do it one lucky gamer one lucky gamer let's go another win dude we're five to five for five now five points yeah if you don't play this game for a while it's really difficult yeah well it's the fact that we haven't played for a while so i'm rusty and then everybody else has been playing for a long time so everybody else is really good mm-hmm oh it's got cross-play now though that's kind of cool yeah i think is it out on switch as well it's coming soon to switch maybe i can't remember right who you picking toss boy um i don't know i'm kind of sick of winning as the other characters yeah just somewhat different maybe bloodhound i guess i might try the new lady go first when you're a master of black holes relativity it might troublesome there jack just shoot a black hole near a mate no and it'll go down it's uh the last remaining scottish person in the chat gun one of them stayed hey it's us oh we're playing with a carrier we're gonna carry us to victory okay uh where have we not been uh right dead oh no we dead center like here oh this is a gamer squad i'm going up top oh never mind there's people everywhere was there people up here yeah there's three up at the top and one right into the bottom well you can't solve the eternal mysteries of the universe without breaking a few eggs shouldn't seem that common but you didn't did you no i i do like the fact that they've got an actual scottish person to voice that character yeah you know sometimes they don't uh i got the vault i'm about to get a load of craft materials yeah we could build something here how much is it to build something uh depends on what you want to build it saves the cost if you go and access the machine it'll tell you how much stuff is i think it's purple armor and purple backpack at the rotation at the moment oh purple helmet is off ooh 75 for that i only have 50. noice there is a new kill leader there we go i need an extended life don't we all andre don't we all extended energy mag here level two that's not what he asked for jack mozambique here you can take the mozambique and be happy with it look santa only comes once a year it's not like we can return his gifts is santa going to be here for this [ __ ] i clicked on the bag do i have to actually pick it up oh yeah creates you should be able to pick it up i think he just i think he might have taken it on me no oh no it's here there we go thank you andre oh he took my purple when i gave me a blue one what they stole it look i i don't want to say anything bad about andrew but it's the end of my sentence you have to like it's fine i didn't get how it worked it's my fault really he deserves it but if he goes down first you're still in a bloody murder and it's not my fault oh jackie's gone we should we should just follow andre and just see you know will that you know will we lose our first match of the day if we follow andre there's only 10 squads left we got this that's easy it's only 27 people to kill look i don't like math in school and i don't like it now either i was terrible it was a far less number than 30. less than 30 seconds rings nearby seven times seven sean 49. yeah that's an easy one though isn't it yeah but if it's like nine times nine ruined 81 something like that i'm embarrassing myself no i'm not going to talk anymore this guy is uh having a little fight yeah there's a black hole on him i have a shotgun yeah they buffed it i think there's a new attachment for it oh a car i hear it it's got a call stick bomb on it oh i ruined that guy there's two teams they're above me oh my god they're everywhere i don't like the fact that i get pulled into it as well oh my god i got bodied by people behind us you know what jack i probably should be using my abilities you should be using them yeah they do help with the uh death situation see that was my problem i didn't check to see those hostiles in the area where's andre andre where are you going andre please sean what's he doing over there winning what what did she say then he killed one let's shift the robots that way all right they're right above me oh he's detecting enemies nearby jack oh no i don't want to win another game kind of boring if you win all of them yeah yeah you got to lose every now and again andre come on use the phase use the phasing phase use the face feel like they're just getting further and further ruined don't worry see if he had given me my purple backpack we all would have been fine yeah he stole it that's why we lost obviously i said hours somebody said he's top 500 in our region oh well not anymore we've just dragged him down ruined him yeah i like i put the black hole down in a room and it it pulls you in as well i thought she might be immune to it or something hmm i've not seen that skin before that's pretty cool yeah like android bangalore yep see i actually have stats on this character 77 kills that's a lot of kills all of them were tonight yeah jack and chat are pointing out that no one's immune to a black hole not even light so it kind of just makes you look foolish really okay sorry i should have paid more attention in size don't let it happen again okay see if only you knew what eight times eight was 64. [ __ ] off where are we going other you're the jump master oh i guess so what's it what's there what's that yeah like that's one of my specialities hold on tight go over here onto the the giant lily pad god imagine if it wasn't 64. how embarrassing embarrassing for both of us 11 x 7. hundred and sixteen what you can't be giving me easy ones [Music] this is how stupid are streamers [Laughter] yeah i really need to do more math to get my streaming career to take off do you want more r9 i've got one thank you who gave you that i found this in a box there no fair play it here a good man jack do you just talk like that all the time i'd prefer that yeah i think many people would are you trying to say my regular voice there's nothing wrong with it why don't i talk in the queen's english come on mike do one you need to do one son get out of it don't go get next one extended energy mag here i don't want that jack what do you want god you've you're okay keeping all the extended energy mags over in this map i would like uh better armor oh never mind got it you've got some wicked dude katamoto has gold armor already pro gamer streamer loot he's just getting our streamer what is that like flowers god that must be a pain in the ass to maintain that especially if people like us are running all over it and yeah just shoot it stuff look there's a cabbage patch over here a cabbage oh my god jack they'll never find me oh okay he wants to play seriously whoops katie moto yeah pro gamer oh he just did a streamer move i'll go behind how do you get in here there must be a way down right nope there's no there's two out here all right guys lagging hard oh my god there's another gummy was the pathfinder that i weakened a lot okay we're good that was kind of cool yeah please work i did 11 damage at 1 13 on another phoenix what's that chat what's the what's the math on that eleven and thirteen forty eight ah no one will ever know battery here math is a complex science we don't need math do we like humanity doesn't need it you know what i mean no it's not not necessary you know when they were teaching me math in school i kept thinking like oh it's because we're going to the moon yeah and we're going to like live on mars when i'm like 30. well i'm 30 and it kind of feels like we live in hell sometimes we're not really any closest to mozy they're always there no it's kind of just sitting out there at the same distance all the time so you're saying just delete maths then maybe not deleted but like teach something else right like streaming yeah how to be a youtuber no don't face the class [Laughter] that's how i validate myself everything else is pointless i've got way too many grenades we've got way too many kills honestly why can't i pick up the treasure pack just let me pick it up i want my comic books oh you've already got it you gotta wait an hour episode of comic book in the next video we're playing with a we're playing with people who really love sprinting yeah this dude is off i'm not a sight on this so many big medpacks here yeah i hate that because i'm i never know what to prioritize now shields are better i have three phoenix kids i don't think well i may go down i'm gonna go down a lot so i'll probably need them i am i'm gonna go up this ramp in a car and see what happens are you okay i'm okay with that like can i check you're your own man i'm not going to stop you from doing anything i will make fun of you though if it goes wrong oh that's terrible you can't go over the top oh no don't mean to be a bother but get in there it's distracting you because you need to play the game oh lord oh god hold up i'm coming at you okay i'm in got it charging how are they doing then so when you're in a vehicle and someone hits it it just spreads the damage across anyone that's in it unless you're aiming directly at them oh that's rough buddy yeah that would explain why my head is full of holes right now someone's shooting the tires and suddenly my leg falls off doesn't really make sense does it when you put it like that no it doesn't make sense it's another math situation just doesn't make sense who do you think the first streamer from mars will be the first streamer from mars elon musk uh yeah it was a bit of a stupid question wasn't it he's doing his crazy satellite internet stuff isn't he yeah that's cool i wonder what kind of speed link yeah starlink just like a train of satellites that fly around the world and just beam the internet down that's kind of madness absolute madness well let's hope the hustle stays over there i'm gonna change out one of these phoenixes oh dude interdimensional oh jack we don't have piston time around here katimoto's gone he's off already it's dude just gonna do it he's in the next round already he's done with this one i thought he's in the next realm not too i feel like i'm just going to show up and not help him at all is he fighting yeah okay maybe we should help with that i have a mastiff that's good laying here he wants to touch my stiffy oh they're up there jack hop sounds nearby yeah they're up here are they oh here cracks i hit him in every shot that i have all right oh i got to mow down someone here all right ready for the black hole oh god oh lord hey i got an assist good job you're not totally useless someone called the president they got a job for you math teacher where'd the other one go nevermind i was just dealing with everything it's no you know i wouldn't wouldn't oh this is nice this is the apex i like where i'm carried to victory i need a cheeky light mag for my gun need an extended light mag if you find one let me know oh look at that thank you over there oh my god kadimoto can see the future katamoto is like such an apex name as well let's go all right we're on the flank here sean we got this are you with me i don't think we do jack are you with me oh [ __ ] up let's go let's go give him the chimney jack give it to him oh you're faster than me when you got that passive hell yeah i am i think there's a dude above me oh we can go we can follow hold on hold on there you go look at that that's mobility there that's what you want to see where'd he go oh he's scared of us huh i don't know i think there's people up at the waterfall here yeah those are the guys who were shooting us before this building is massive yeah how do i get around dude we're in the top three oh katamoto is pushing he just told us to go as well on voice comments oh someone i mean oh no no no no no no no no i'm coming some nades get out of there get out of there are going is it just one guy i'm going behind taking a knee i think i lost him i can hear him he's right here is it just one dude yeah insects is a horror game though you were being hunted oh my goodness no fight science okay here we go i've only got to go 100 190 there's a window there not in oh lord i hope there's no one here attention get you back in the game it's podice's revenge oh let's go toss that boy back in oh he's mad at you jack hello hi right listen well he doesn't know that oh lord i mean shot out again i think this is fine just know that you're reviving god's gift to gaming that's true i feel like there's enemies yeah there's enemies we're ruined that's it you go on that zip line let's say you go you go you go see that's it oh even the inventory stuff is all different like the guns are up top now i clean this banner in the name of god uh it's 300 meters away jack right but we need to go that way anyway have you got some guns yeah i got all my stuff going good good good now i just need to figure out how to get out of this building yeah i think it's uh yeah that way you got it well they're fighting something over there is that a giant hole yeah that's a shawn hold for sure oh lord how do we get around this oh they're firing at us from up there that's the plane jack oh he's got the beams airplane let's go charging my shield oh lord oh no no no no no it's okay i'm getting our friend yeah you can get him back dude that one almost went to the next dimension oh no does fear protect me from bullets no no it doesn't oh lord i didn't pick up any of my ammo oh the new inventory system is weird you'll be fine you got this let's go i have 10 shots in this one don't go that way oh they just dropped in what are the odds that you and katamoto win this match what do you think hundred to one hundred to one okay oh god oh god not like this that guy's a beamer because the last time i played ammo and stuff was all in the middle but now it's all up top so it's all so confusing and new scary honestly this area's cool like with that red lighting yeah i like that well none of this ammo helps me are there three still three squads left i think one of the squads is already in the new zone and the other one is right there jesus christ that hurt it's a friend that thing ah i should have took the prowler then i didn't realize i had no ammo third place there sean that's not too bad it's okay wait is the powder good now yeah it got buffed i think oh yeah if you get that attachment for it the one that makes it full auto i think it's really good nice i've got so many apex packs but i never get a chance to open them purple bag helmet so i like to have a little fun so what all right mirage mirage got buff as well time for the big leagues so just warming up really huh here we go here we are yeah there's us there's dicey well done jack there's katamoto looking good toss boy is the jump master that's what you want to see when you load around about apex isn't it fastboy is the job master oh you're making fun of me but i kind of like it can we go into that building there how about there heard that i mean you can do whatever you want jack no but you're the jump master so i mean you can fall on your own if you want no i wouldn't i wouldn't dare where are we going on it yeah that doesn't answer the question should we land up top or go in the middle maybe or the bomb yeah oh i think that's an area you can go in i'm guessing you just go inside it who needs wins when you've got friendship huh our enemies down there oh you can go inside no fall damage i missed that what no fall damage yeah i think i can hear another team yeah i'm gonna come downstairs with you guys the doors are open down here oh i just got scanned from where i'm not sure i think they're coming in i went back up hit one for 40. we could go back up if you want if you want to disengage where am i getting shot from you want to come back up yeah let's go oh okay let's go back down oh let's go back up that's horrible jack oh good lord they're everywhere they're absolutely everywhere they're up they're down they're inside me they're all on you oh that was horrible just another win in the bag [Applause] gonna get tired of winning honestly when will we find someone good enough to beat us i don't think they exist all i want to do is open those stupid apex packs but by the time that we've cued it just gets in i can't do it your life is very hard jack oh wow look at that skin what the hell oh dear little scale next time come on what are you waiting for should i go car stick then yeah people were traps there's the big lad like my skin that is sick i mean it just turned him into a robot there haven't they yeah i see i'm sensing a theme with my skins like the robots the music is very good in this game i mean the game in general is great yeah i just need more hours in it oh not again you just gave it up straight away yeah just think is that anyway we haven't been it's too much pressure i don't like being nominated i mean we could go to the volcano is that a volcano nah maybe something you know if you want to go there let's go there wherever my heart takes me there's no point half-assing it well they completely disagree with your decision well screw him i'm going to volcano yeah you think you got a cool skin you can call the shots this is streamer time baby oh watch out oh this is weird this is new where's all the loot give me the loop oh god there's a man after me i don't know where any of the loot is sean i'm bringing him towards you i'm scared turn around is he still chasing me no he's gone he's okay okay this guy's up top though where are the guns yeah okay i find some over here get it get it hey i've got a gun i mean i have two but they're not very good oh here we go oh all right oh i hear them but i can't see anybody i'm so dead i got scanned then are you kidding oh god we've been hunted down like rats go on watch out there's a guy here let's go here trying to get behind oh i see him another variable for the lab rats [Music] he's cracked it's two oh you got the bleed out on the other one yeah good job that kill was pleasant reloading i didn't think we were going to make it out there because i don't really have armor do we no i think i hear someone else sean so do i aim oh i thought disconnected no what was his name uh john we'll miss you john do it one more minute can i hear people i'm sure i could hear someone they might be above us i don't know very accurate there it might be above us i don't know i think i hear someone forgot how slow i feel as caustic he's a chunky boy oh that's a mastiff what i want rings around am i hearing the ring moves you see the uh the western remake of the ring yes yeah what do you think of it it's not bad yeah i agree there's um there's a bunch of western remakes let's games for movies like that that are awful but the the ring one is pretty decent yeah i mean i think i was about i don't know maybe 15 16 when it came out and i watched it by myself late at night when it came on like rental or whatever and uh scared the hell out of me i've never seen the original there are worse western adaptions have you seen the new grudge uh by new nude you mean the one that came out like a couple years after the ring remake oh go right here or is there like grudge to samara's revenge or whatever her name is no there's like a brand new grudge from the start of this year oh right no i haven't seen it any good uh no ok i think they're coming sean yeah i'm trying to place traps so they walk into my doom zone the doom zone all i have is an alternator and a mozambique perfect i was gassing them one broke and they're hailing got one nice reloading should we push we're up against it remember two b3 oh a broke armor yeah he's weak machine i thought he stopped me with it [Music] get my armor back you in trouble maybe he's behind you sean oh he's behind me reloading oh he's weak he's making his weak armor they're underestimating us now really yeah let's be honest i'm the only real champion here i like the fact that you're putting those traps around because it makes me feel safe it's weird it's at least some sort of buffer yeah it's like i know they can't run over there because if they do they're gonna get charged gas they're gonna get gassed it's pretty good uh close to compression though pretty good thank you recharging shields i need some energy ammo you know what i'm just gonna take that alt is fun i've never really used caustic before but getting like digital threat through the smoke oh he's brutal yeah very good i'm kind of getting back in the swing of it now i think a little bit you've got to play it differently to the other br games yes sir gas is here i'm just trying to grab what i can i've got so many shields too many yeah oh i have a bolt accelerant i don't need them i keep trying to figure out what to take and what not to take yeah difficult to know isn't it when you're not playing it was so massive does the massive just use regular shotgun ammo yeah it does yeah it used to be gold and special though i got rid of my r301 what am i doing i want to just not get zoned you need anything um i mean a little bit more light ammo but i'm pretty good on it there you go oh thank you uh what do i not need you want a phoenix kit uh sure okay phoenix here i never feel like i have enough time to pull them off anyway yeah you need that gold is it the backpack that gets you the fast use yeah or the armor i can't remember the backpack one of them this feels very tight and full doesn't it this area yeah reminds me of titanfall 2 single player for any of you who don't know titanfall and uh apex share the same universe they've never had a titan in this game yet that might be cool if they ever do like a limited time mode where one person gets a titan um that'd be kind of cool where are those shots yeah with the push that way i just can't believe there's no secret behind the waterfall i feel oh someone come up up to you yeah broke his armor god damn it all three of them came up are they they're alpha blood dead yeah he's trying to finish me damn it i thought once he saw me up there he would have gone back down and then his team wouldn't have followed because there was another team back down there that they were fighting i thought they would have just stuck on them nice i got your banner you got my bruce i got it one minute okay no one around okay you might be able to go back up there i don't know where the other dude went was it no it was two people wasn't it it was a wraith and a man three okay and a pathfinder was the first dude shot i'll see what i can get down here and then i guess make our way up i don't see anyone on the way in yeah they're back down towards the big circle building down there right because there's another squad down there i think yeah that's what i'm surprised they came up and fought us maybe they were just trying to get away from them maybe shane there's no zip line back up although we could just run up the wall here oh cool 10 seconds still ring close let's go let's go let's go i got a mastiff there nice oh yeah i forgot i'm caustic i could have just trapped the zip line yeah yeah you're all outside your ultimate is brutal as well it doesn't slow teammates down anymore oh the gas is here by the way around we're fine jack don't even worry about it all right on the zip no i already had hopefully i don't get sniped someone over there yeah that's not a good idea there's people on the other side of the zip there sean okay i think they've got a crater as well yeah that's our rough positioning i guess we should just try and get them [Applause] uh they're kind of low cool sticks low nice come on sean you can do it let's go i'll try and get behind this oh they're pushing they're pushing i got two of them nice try i love that you just heated a a gas trap right at the end there i mean i was reloading it's either wait for that or try something i forgot my ammo again what you ultimate no no i keep like spamming my um i keep spamming the the list of stuff in my crate that my ammo is up top now yeah i haven't gotten used to it because i could have got him with the mastiff i think unlucky i downed two of them though yeah he did well uh mr bulldogs thank you for the 50 please send chet definitely you've got to watch out for the chats thank you for tuning in guys hope you're enjoy the stream i just can't not play octane it's too good the mobility is really nice yeah plus that skin is lovely oh a lifeline not bad you don't see many people people lifeline who's my main i don't know if i have a maine anymore it used to be bangalore yeah then i searched over the pathfinder for a long time but then they they nerfed him a while back has he gone back up again yet uh no i think he's still post enough i'm sure he's good i was devastated sean you were devastated yeah sorry i i just realized that's completely out of context uh so uh you know wetter digital the uh sorry no yeah one of the rings people yeah yeah the people that make the uh the core models and stuff yeah uh about like eight months ago they started selling like really detailed apex statues oh nice and they have like a pathfinder a wraith and a lifeline i ordered the wraith and the pathfinder and the pathfinder turned up and uh his legs were broken oh no yeah so i emailed them i was like guys it's turned up and the legs are broken they were like oh don't worry about it we'll send a replacement but first you have to smash it into pieces and take a photograph of it we just got absolutely dunked on then yeah i landed on the top ring and i asked them you know what would you like me to smash it to pieces with and they said a hammer so smashed into pieces with a hammer and sent them photographic evidence and then a week later another one turned up and that one was fine oh come on how are you not dead nice come on the game's tough i kind of like it if you drop with a pistol yeah that would be nice i just died so fast then jack i got gifted uh 50 subs by play apex that's nice of them isn't it is that the real it is yeah it is the real they do this when people are streaming they just go around channels and gift a load of subs thank you you're already sponsoring the stream though you didn't have to do that that's sweet i'll pay it forward apex with non-stop wins now that they've done that now the player packs themselves have gifted 50 subs yeah and now raven just did 50 as well jesus christ now we're gonna win okay let's go this is the hype that we needed uh jack [Laughter] i don't think that timing was great um but i'm back welcome back he's out there looking for you i'll find you if you let it er what's happening to you what'd you mean oh you you're not in the game yeah i got timed out as soon as i said that we were going to win oh is crossplay steam origin or consoles i think it's everything isn't it i'd imagine so yeah before we linked our steam because i i hadn't played the steam version before so when i loaded it up i thought that i wouldn't have any of my stuff yeah um but i i still i linked it with my origin account and had all the stuff that i had before and all my skins all my characters unlocked seamless you got everything back now yep wicked it launched on steam yesterday i think right i think it was today oh is it today okay maybe yesterday it launched with the new season you think they'll do cross play for the switch switch do you think they'll do cross play for the switch i hope so switch versus pc at least between consoles yeah very well yes very well we're landing here hospital independent variable oh oh lord that's okay that's not an accessible area that's fine i don't think anyone landed here i think this never mind nobody landed here at all from the people that landed here there's someone in a car as well all right you know what i'm going in yeah why not there's something going down here sean oh feral berry is in i see his muzzle flashes through the window i hear someone i think they're above me outside maybe oh you can jump out here come on outside no one on me nice good job nailed that whole squad now don't forget the ammo at the soft shot shut up dad i don't get it thank you i actually would have forgotten maybe we should switch the vault out get your resources as well craft yourself something nice i don't know what to pick yourself a bag grab your mother a bag craft your whole family a bag back bag and the dirt is gone what happened to those adverts and the only reason i ever bought philip bank and now they're gone you just call them dad verts adverts no not dad birds but that's it's a new thing that's selling lawnmowers to you have you seen nick gray with his uh vacuum cleaner that's on daytime tv all the time i have not oh i need 75 only a 50. i wish i could drop you something that'd be good wouldn't it i mean that's the problem with this show we just hang around and our teammate just goes and they've gone everybody else just wants kills i want to just survive oh he's getting in a fight already oh deal we should go and open it takes time to craft it i see how it works now i get it this dude is yeah full warfare i realized that i keep using the weapons that i know from before like the last time i played it all of the weapons that i'm using are were the good ones i need yeah realize that stuff has changed i mean the 301 is uh still pretty decent dude i mean this guy is full sending it sean i i can hear the frags going out i don't see any kills in the kill feed though they just send in his alt as well yeah i'm going to try and help this dude's a lunatic he's a man oh god i didn't even realize well i definitely have weapons that are helpful in this range he's low nice two of them are down come on toss boy let's go let's go toss boy yes no i altered him get him come on fairy berry let's go this is awkward everyone seems to have actually just shot him but i'm determined i was determined to get the play we're good we're good you can actually craft a child i'll do that next time you've got uh all right decoy just 3d printer child you wouldn't download a movie so don't download a child you think could you 3d print a 3d printer and then just infinitely make money from doing that it's like a perpetual motion machine it's not loud it's not allowed it's illegal jack i keep forgetting all my buttons jesus administering medical aid oh there's a purple extended is a nice skin come on administering medical aid he does have a fantastic voice he does i used to think it was the same guy who did soldier 76 oh yeah nobody fred ashore that's a hell of a name that is uh anybody got a light ammo yeah i can drop you a bit she am i yo mate someone wandered into our safe space who's not with us you're pointing at the ground and saying he's not with us oh you did i said hey amigos this guy's now with us there's no one here there's a ton of light ammo on this i think you're losing the jack why are you doing it all oh my god there's 700 dead bodies here that's a lot of dead bodies what happened here i'm going to bring more grenades and arc stairs all over the map not thermites i'm sure there was a grenade in titanfall was it two that did a similar thing to what horizon's old does where it like sucks people together i can't remember it's been a while since i played it yeah i don't i don't remember what it was called though uh maybe we should go to feralberry oh maybe not nope [ __ ] [ __ ] i have no cover i have no cover are you ruined not ruined but where are they charging right on me god damn it there's two of them i'm stuck oh my goodness yeah i was in this laneway i should have just jumped over here gonna try and get your banner feral berry left us why feral berry oh okay no no no no i thought they lost you for a second that zone is unfortunate it is so as long as i've got yours about time we got ourselves a fight wait february leave yeah he died oh stinky yikes i was up against it there that was unreal didn't make it out alive though man they just came out of nowhere and i know where to go uh i'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick okay no worries now that was unfortunate chat wasn't it i nearly made it out of that one i hope you're all enjoying the stream so far it's man it's difficult to come back to apex because if you don't play it you just get so accustomed to other battle royale games that it's difficult it's really difficult you don't keep up with the meta the movement the gun handling hard game odd game is hard might as well open these packs did we get anything good what are my graphic settings up uh zack i can show you it's i think it's mostly maxed out there isn't it oh i'm back oh it might yeah i almost got to open all my packs no unlucky and then ruined gravity star was the name of the grenade in titanfall 2. oh yeah i remember a cool name 87 silent i quantified tell us boys i got the need for speed and the octane i mean we've won all of them so far sean so i think we got pretty close to losing one of them let's just fight that's just fight omirage me ragi you know what there i'm ready to drop in uh okay our teammates turn into a crate well i'm riding that ass that's sick oh lord oh lord that was a that was a bit wild to control there well this guy's like going for it it's people in here no one of them there's one near me i think oh they're sliding over to you maybe watch out i don't have any healing all right right outside the building behind you oh he's in front of him never mind i'm stuck oh oh that's the new revive this bangalore should be weak i think oh my god i was just getting stuck on everything then i forgot that lifeline can just revive and leave now you can revive yourself no they revived their i thought it was a bangalore i guess it was a horizon i think they revived them and ran around oh is that what that was i was so confused i was like what so you're saying that lifeline's got a device that revives people yeah like they they revive with the shield but now they can like get up and run around so they're not locked into it anymore no way i didn't know that yeah i mean it shows how much that we played yeah because i knew that she has to revive where she starts and then the shield comes up but you have to stay there but did they update it so she can just put a bot down or something yeah so it's the same revive it's just that now she leaves it and runs away and the bot gets them up oh that's cool like a passive revive oh my players are then yeah give it a go give it a go let's go and i have a drumstick so we're we're sorted it's more damage is there many fireworks where you are jack um there was some last night but i haven't heard any tonight [ __ ] i do i live out in the sticks though so i mean i don't think people are likely to do it right last night here was until like 2 30 a.m they were still going off what pandemic yeah we're in lockdown two as of today season two lockdown season two all right i feel so sloppy jack i feel like i met in the side down hey it's all good so good i'm very sloppy as well so we're all sloppy here what is this place i don't know we've not been there have we no i was going into the middle of it it's like a mall or something maybe it's so fun to play though surprisingly there's many other battle royale games that i'll play where i just get kind of pissed off after a while but i like the maps and i like the the speed of this game very quick uh let's go over to the right actually energy depot oh we have been here did we get ruined in here we did yeah i blocked it from my memory we ruined he said we need to change the position we don't have anything but he replaced anything with a swear word what a dirty stinker he's swearing on my apex sponsored stream potty mouth there are people over here i still have literally nothing okay i do need to heal though it's fine [Music] i want an irish character in the game oh coming soon apex can you put an irish character in and i'll voice it that'd be so good hold on dropping a portal over here drop your shield there's a mozambique over here lads i guess i still have literally nothing it would work so well you've seen how they're putting like uh content creators in cyberpunk yeah apex is next i think so big potential yeah everyone's in cyberpunk you me neither of us oh lord this guy's serious yeah i just got scanned here as well oh yeah i'm not caustic anymore close he said you see someone no oh they're fighting down here they're fighting each other leave them out oh a mastiff i would buy all of your skins that's all i'm saying you would simp for my character i just got a big grenade up there one knot you know i did 13 damage on one i think there's more characters here where are these grenades coming from anything there's a guy behind us as well you okay yeah yeah good gonna need heels though so nothing speed there's another squad behind me right next to me trying to hide crack the shield of a guy in there i think there's two other squads out there yeah they're above me i don't have any nades or anything god damn how do i get up to you i'm good i'm good there's just one guy that's gone it might be more what what the hell was that i like people everywhere uh somebody else here yeah oh i broke a shield oh there's two on me the master doesn't do as much damage as it used to i think okay we're good we're good did you get him yeah i'll get your banner i'll get you back straight away dude you're ruining people we're doing okay yeah i hit him three times at a massive close range and it only broke his shield i guess it's not as crazy as it once was now that it's a regular drop yeah it doesn't seem as ip anymore still pretty good though yeah no it's still good it's just i i think i expected it to end that guy without running away [Music] there's a lot of loot around here as well thank you how many kills do you have um just three huh i've got a couple of knocks but they didn't get finished off right i actually feel like this is the first game where we've got decent loot though yeah there's a mobile respawn beacon here if you fancy it yeah uh maybe if i have a slot for it trying to get better guns r 99 i'll do ah no i didn't need to do that and i think the massive will ruin someone though if you just stick it in their face and pull the trigger yeah probably uh is there any light ammo uh i can drop you some i think yeah thank you not a lot but love that all right looking good you get these crafting materials maybe yeah let's just show my crafting materials uh top right the blue ones oh yeah 60. how many

game yeah that's fun got one kill i i was like you know when you're like following someone and your aim if it was right on them you would hit them with every shot but you're just a fraction off yeah i just commit to the same curve that i have been i missed all my shots you just gotta keep playing and you just get used to the meta again yeah yeah it was weird like i i think i had a shield but i couldn't slap my gun or something strange i don't know all the tricks it is coming back though we're getting further each time yeah envy less than average what's that just this guy's name strange name

levels can you get through that way uh yeah over here on the right oh are you caught yeah i'll be all right i think i can get around here just about but jack you're the glue that's holding this team together what are we gonna do without you die there is a big chasm between us let me tell that oh i could actually get the baby ruined see that's it gonna find out how fast can go replicators only way

oh one behind you as well ah we're done for good luck less than average they'll never find me can you rest yourself no only if you got the gold it's alphas yeah oh there's two squads see what he's up to he's uh got the phoenix kid out well i'm still alive at least yeah i feel like when you get in those vehicles you just end up dying it feels like it yeah and your next champion is right here i will make it to you oh come on ruined he's saying he won't make it he never even tried honestly a bit of that bit like rotate come on come on buddy you can do it the squad's all here let's go let's let's go i don't know if they're still here or not you'll be fine just pretend they're not there and it'll be okay i think they ran away actually well his sensitivity is high yeah that i'm getting motion stick just looking at his screen what the hell was that like turbo kind of like it what's the push to talk button hey t yeah altay does it work no i think if it turned off i kind of wish you could run people over with those vehicles i doesn't really make sense especially if you're able to get hit like oh are you kidding me immediately engaging oh god there's nothing okay i got a flat lane i think he's south african oh they got a crater do you want to rotate left yes please can you rotate left legs all right cool i want to heal up here still fighting there we could get behind him let's try wrap

extended like mag oh we're in trouble are there like above flat lines now that's not what i wanted i don't know how they were here but i mean we could just stay there for now yeah there's only three other squads left there sure can we go under smell of wind we need to kill these teams he wants to kill him don't have the best weapons but we'll make it work he's going up he's crazy oh this man is the lunatic are they still up there let's i don't know that's what i'm trying to find i don't know kind of sounds like vickster he's uh south african i think hmm it's a cool accent yeah it's very nice

got the best weapons here using my shield did we get everybody on this team yeah oh yeah he knows what he's doing i think we should just follow i think so they're gonna have to push towards us yeah they will you got any uh shield cells sean i don't even know where he's shooting man yeah the other team's over in the backside we're good in here we're gonna be safe time to check any crates have you got any spare chilled cells less shields recharged in this bush i'm just here in a second uh he's going after himself i just got a bunch of shield souls nice i might drop me to take all the [ __ ] [Applause] that's me oh cool what do you think is over here i really need heavy engaging and if you have any spare i know none of you run heavy yeah i dropped there's some here heavy ammo here oh thanks i've got like 30 bullets ten seconds dears the ring's close and we're cutting it all right we're gonna have to make some movement yeah we have to push the walls in here he hates it as much as we do yeah i don't know where the last guy is could use my uh this guy here in front of me oh two of them here i cracked one one here and one at the bottom i know with the sentinel for 60. i wish i had all right one one team left how about getting out of there he's like distracted by me he's nice job hell yeah good game i don't know if i did much but we did it john you're an important important part of the puzzle god damn you are the apex champion he was a good player yeah i mean you've got to lose one match right i mean we won all of them up to that point but losing that one you know just
