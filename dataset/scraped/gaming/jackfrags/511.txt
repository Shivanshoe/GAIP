this is call of duty warzone running on the xbox series x at 120 frames per second so i did a video about four days ago where i checked out the game on the playstation 5 and series x and whilst they both looked great i was kind of disappointed that neither of them had a 120 fps option but between the course of then and now there's been a cheeky update and you can now run warzone on the series x at 120 fps and 120 hertz previously the game was locked to 60. i've tested this myself today that's the gameplay footage that you're watching now and if you see here i am going into the menu so i can prove that this is indeed 1440p 120 hertz and you also get the option to play it 1080p 120 and if you've got an hdmi 2.1 tv 4k 120. i think this is awesome the fact that infiniti would have gone back in unlocked the frame rate there and given people with the hardware that option whilst i can't show you what 120 fps is like on youtube i can explain how it feels the game looks and feels more responsive there appears to be less input lag things aren't quite as blurry when they're moving fast across the screen so it's kind of easier to track targets and it's just an overall better experience on the eyes for me personally i've been using 120hz monitors for years on pc and going from 60 to 120 is an absolute game changer some people might not notice it as much as going from 30 to 60 but lots of people do and this is a big deal in my opinion whilst it is maxing out at 120 you're not going to get 120 all the time though and i could definitely feel that when i was in certain busier areas you notice a drop in frame rate digital foundry published a article on this earlier today and it looks like they've done some testing there already and by their records the frame rate is dropping to around 100 at times so not a massive dip still really impressive but you will feel that little diff every now and again in terms of playstation 5 support it's not there for warzone yet you're still locked at 60 fps and there's a lot of guess work as to why this is some people think it's because of the backwards compatibility and how that works on the playstation 5 and they reckon that at the moment if you run warzone on ps5 you're still running the ps4 pro version of the game so for 120fps to be enabled on the ps5 it seems that infinity ward or raven who also work on the game will have to make a specific ps5 version of the game hopefully that comes for the playstation users over the last few days i've personally been trying black ops cold war on the ps5 and the series x on the series x it's really easy to get 120 fps 120 hertz you just enable 120 in the settings on ps5 it's also possible too i've tried it running at 1080p 120 and it's really smooth feels great but it's a bit more difficult to enable you have to disable ray tracing and then you have to go into your playstation settings and go to app preferences and put the games on default performance mode so it's a bit more of a hassle to do it on ps5 but it is possible so what does this mean for warzone and the users well if you're playing on xbox series x if you've got a compatible monitor you'll be able to play at 120 fps 120 hertz for me that's just awesome i love the fact that that's a possibility and from my hands-on experience today it doesn't feel quite the same as playing on pc of course on pc you can get 240 hertz 240 fps and have a much more consistent high frame rate you can also change your field of view so i think it would be cool on the next gen consoles if the devs went in and added an fov slider there because it does appear that these consoles can handle that kind of graphics load you may have noticed too that i'm playing with a mouse and keyboard here i'm not trying to pull the wall over your eyes and trick you this isn't pc gameplay this is real xbox series x gameplay it's just that you can plug a mouse and keyboard directly into the series x and it natively works on games like modern warfare warzone and cold war it's not exactly the same as playing on pc because it does feel like there's additional input lag and a bit of mouse acceleration even though you've got it turned off in the settings but for someone like myself who prefers mouse and keyboard it's nice to have this option so going back to the 120fps thing why wasn't there a big announcement about this or anything on social media or in the patch notes for example well i've got a few ideas first of i think that this could potentially take some of the limelight away from black ops cold war because this is big news ultimately secondly playstation and activision have a relationship where there's some exclusivity for playstation users that relationship has been going on for years and we've most recently seen it with black ops cold war and the zombies mode that i believe is a timed exclusive for playstation users and maybe they're worried that this could look bad for the playstation 5. so that might be why they haven't made a bigger deal about this but i think infinity ward and call of duty should be talking about this i think it's something that should be celebrated and i'm sure that at some point in the future they will enable this to for ps5 but as i mentioned just now it might take a bit more work because of how backwards compatibility is functioning on the ps5 and so i'm quietly confident that eventually playstation 5 will get 120 fps support for warzone just a waiting game a matter of time a lot of you might be thinking well does this work for modern warfare as well well i haven't actually downloaded modern warfare yet on the series x you can get warzone separately i've not tested it myself but i am downloading the game now and hopefully i can test and give you guys an update in the comments below on this video i expect that it might though because if you think about it modern warfare maps are way smaller than warzone way less players as well so there shouldn't be any technical limitations there look into the future i think that the 120 hertz 120 fps feature set of these new consoles might cause a lot of confusion but it's definitely something that people are interested in when i've done any of my streams on the ps5 or series x over the last couple weeks one of the most popular questions in the chat or on the live stream is are you running in the 120 fps mode so consumers are definitely interested in this i'm just not sure everyone knows exactly what it is yet and also the difference between frames per second and hertz just because your screen is running at 120 hertz doesn't mean the game is running at 120 fps or has an unlocked frame rate and in regards to the confusion there's a lot of that related to what tv or monitor you've got or you're going to buy so for example today i was running this on an hdmi 2.0 monitor which is an hp omen x27 and that only has hdmi 2.0 on it but on that you can still run 1080p at 120 hertz and also 1440p at 120 hertz and on pc it will go up to 1440p 144 hertz hopefully i'm not confusing you but if you want 4k 120 hertz you're going to need an hdmi 2.1 monitor or tv and yes everything looks great on that but you might not necessarily need that or want that if you've already got an hdmi 2.0 monitor or tv because you can still run that 1440p 120 and that resolution and frequency is a nice sweet spot i think for the xbox series x because although the screen is outputting at 4k 120 warzone won't natively be able to run in a 4k resolution and output 120 frames per second so it'll be running in a smaller resolution anyway ps5 unfortunately doesn't currently support 1440p i don't know why but i think they will add it down the line because i expect people to start pressuring them for that feature so make sure that you do some research and read up on this get your info correct get the facts right before you go ahead and make a purchase on something expensive make sure it's the right monitor or tv for you and your plans and with that said that's all for today guys thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this one do let me know your thoughts down in the comments below how
