it's been about a week since i last played warzone trios and in that time something strange has happened i tried the game out last night and i kept getting killed over and over again by the doof doof now if you aren't familiar with the doof doof here it is the r9 this is how it sounds when you shoot that's why it's called the doofdoof so apparently this has been in the game for ages but it's only the last couple months or so that people realize that you could unlock dragon's breath firearms for it and if you get those you can do stuff like this i'm pushing i don't think he needs this man the first shot hits and breaks armor plus you get damage over time from the fire effect and then the second shot knocks them the fire will even keep burning them when they're knocked on the ground it's insane i watched the dude on twitch get 60 kills and win the game solo versus squads and most of the kills were with this thing it's crazily good right now and i simply didn't realize exactly how good it was and so i went away i leveled mine up i got together with acolyte and tomographic and decided to give it a go in some real matches and let me tell you we had a damn good time so you're gonna see what happened in two of those games now absolute madness and with that said a massive thank you to all of these legends using my supporter creator code in the cod store for warzone if you buy anything you use jack frags in all caps and i'll get a percentage of that sale thank you and tweet me a pic if you get something and i'll feature you in a future video and here it is then the r9 shotgun the doof doof if you enjoyed the video leave a like and subscribe for more let's go there's someone on our level here connor right i think he went out the doors i just got shot in the back flanking down
