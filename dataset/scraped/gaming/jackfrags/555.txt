hi everyone and welcome to call of duty warzone season six the update went live earlier today big download as always i think it was about 54 gig for me today it's crazy man the patches just get bigger and bigger and bigger but today we're going to be diving in checking out all the new stuff i purposefully haven't played any proper matches today i did the easter egg thing unlock the new brewing blueprint but i haven't played any real matches today so this is going to be first impressions looking at the map changes looking at the new guns so obviously with the new season we got a new battle pass i've got a load of new cosmetics and items in the store the main battle pass skin is farah from the campaign if you played that so you get that straight away and then where is it the first one is the spr which i think is an r 700 sniper rifle you get that level 14 15. and then can we just appreciate this takedown edward the bat just look at this that goes in for the kill explodes the guy's head i mean why wouldn't you want that so i'm definitely going to be putting that on and then the next new gun is the asval which is level 30 31 [Applause] i haven't got any unlocks for it i haven't got any kills with it same with the spr so this is going to be quite fun i was speaking to study earlier watching him stream and he was saying that the sbr is pretty nuts it's basically hit scan so yeah it's going to be good there's a couple more blueprints in here too that's clearly based on the rock by the way not sure how dj feels about that but there's some blueprints for the new stuff so i am just gonna oh there's nikolai as well that's the other new operator along with pharah so i'm just gonna um max this out get all the tears use code jack frags in all caps if you get anything on the cod store i'll get a bit of kickback from that thank you i'm not going to go through all of this but we'll just listen to the sound for a second some satisfying noises there isn't there i like that i like that a lot i will go ahead and skip that gg completed it who should we be should we be nikolai or pharah that's gas that's not it's far where is pharah oh is she in the um allegiance yeah there's nikolai [Music] nice farah i think we should play as pharah so those are alternate skins that's from the campaign nikolai oh man so many [Music] so many choices to make i just don't know guys i think we'll do pharah first where's the bat edward why is it called edward i mean look at it edward's a great name for a bat right we'll try and get some takedowns with it i'm sure there was a like a hound dog as well like a hell dog i don't know where that is that might be in the store there's this one here hellhound look at this that's for halloween come on that's halloween i mean the head explodes there too that's kind of cool i will try the i will try the bat first though oh you get a little zombie charm check that out edward because of the batman actor do you think that's what it is niall it could be for the twilight saga yeah it could be that makes sense right i think uh john thank you for becoming a new member and goucher as well appreciate that guys yeah it's edward from twilight isn't it mike yeah i get it now yo there he is look that's a big bat i have actually walked through a couple of bat caves at zoos and it's i i don't like it because they fly around you and they use sonar they can't see but they can't see but i'm on edge the whole time like is one going to fly into me i just don't know i just don't know i'm gonna see if the boys are ready hello like with without a doubt hey jack jack just crashed again he just crashed again okay are you guys uh good to go then when you're back up yeah still just finishing his match okay have you seen the uh the music packs jack the copyright music pack i have seen the music packs and i'm not going to preview them on youtube no yeah don't don't yeah it's what is it skrillex and tiesto skrillex won't mind jack he's been trying to sell his old music for years yeah but i'm sure his record label will and i'm sure that they're in the content id system like that that's good oh man so the um the new the new weapons then have you had a chance to use them much i've got mine fully ranked now pretty much what both of them it's 11 a.m yeah okay uh i haven't really i've been messing around multiplayer leveling them up but the vowel is it's it's it's an absolute melt machine in the multiplayer uh but because of the 30 round mags i think it's gonna have the same issue that the vector had in war zone in that you kind of get through that mag so quickly that you're stuck if you fight mobile people so maybe solos duos people will like it right but um i'm gonna use it today anyway with the sniper secondary does it always start with a 10 round mag or is that the blue it does yeah yeah that's just a blueprint um so you have to unlock the 30 round mag 30 rounds it's a really quick unlock so you'll get it today okay um 30 is the max though and that sniper rifle have you used that's ridiculous yeah yeah for real what do you mean actual hit scan actual hit scan there's no way it's uh it's ridiculous jack but it doesn't warn her headshot is the trade-off but it has a really fast bolt time okay i don't know if it's like no one can confirm that it is hit scan but the bullet velocity is higher than the hdr right and there's no like there's literally no drop off okay and yeah it's it's pretty crazy and i think stud will probably come in here in a second just screaming and raving about how overpowered it is yeah but he loves his snipers right now and he was like something about this doesn't feel great like the bullet velocity feels really bad i was like yeah wait till you get the mags to make it really good because it's all in the magazine really right because otherwise the bullet boss is pretty slow but there's two magazines there's one that's um it's a five round mag that it says it what is it ammunition with superior external ballistics for a flatter trajectory and longer range and then the other one says it increases damage but it's across all ranges okay um i think it has a slower idea speed and more recoil i do think that the middle one is probably going to be best for that it sounds like fun so i've been crashing a lot today like i think about five or six times i'm about 10 now right 10 deep haven't played any war zone yet though so just on multiplayer just in multiplayer right yeah just multiplayer have been crashing but stardom westy have been crashing all day in warzone so i should expect a couple of crashes there then yeah for sure yeah it will it will affect all of us so at least we'll be queueing together and this might be one person left out mid match okay have you tried this uh armored trucks mode or whatever it is armored royale maybe we can give it a go hopefully it's a bit like um yeah i think you need four to play that right yeah you do it's quite quad fill required yeah okay interesting this is pretty crazy from the trailer some interesting updates today yeah for sure how to start getting on let's have a look see almost it was like top 10 last time i checked in with him he's gonna win another squad now okay let's see the win guys thank you for coming along to the stream today if you're watching this is a video welcome we're just waiting on study to finish his game and then we're going to get into a match it's gonna my first actual warzone game of season six i'm looking forward to this thank you for coming along sigmund ryan misfit robin hood what's up swaggerson active shindo guys thank you so much for coming along today i really appreciate you lump thank you for becoming a member it's kind of interesting that the asl starts with a 10 round mag i can't imagine that's going to be very good in warzone but we'll give it a go i need to level it up don't i like wait at all because it's a little bit different you're good to go jack yeah you're good to go all right okay he's studying no no he's uh i think it's a slow game okay are we just going to do a trailer as well yeah we'll do a trick yeah let's start with the trio let's do this oh you got the bat as well i love that connor tommy get your bat out oh where's my baby yeah do you not have a bat get my bat out that's not an innuendo tom please yeah all right keep it pg yeah connor your eyes are uh interesting on my game something something not right there something interesting there i know what you mean one's going to the left one's going to the right and they're really white it's just enough dave it's kind of secret jack yeah it's good i see everything all of the targets is that how you look in real life edward it's called okay edward edward the bat yeah i didn't realize this but my chat told me it's because twilight like their character is edward yeah i've never seen the twilight movies my sister was obsessed should i keep it that way or should i watch them look at this three batty boys if you haven't seen them now then yeah keep it that way jack i can't imagine on the target demographic no no so robert patterson the actor he's just been in um new netflix films doing the new batman isn't he yeah he's an about man do i um i don't know i'm just making the class real quick here um i don't have it leveled up enough but okay i'm looking forward to trying these new guns out man it just should be fun they're a bit different you know they are that's what i like the most i'm glad as well but i mean maybe we'll get it mid-season but there was a lot of discussion about there being an a12 okay i wasn't looking forward to a new shotgun the terry crews probably the best introduction of this update is that origins have been removed as flawlessly didn't they nerfed the shotguns as well a bit yeah close close range damage okay for the origin has been nerfed yeah the slugs have been buffed though thank god uh prevail thank you for the five how's it going i'm good man uh brinsta gator jack thank you for becoming a new member i appreciate that thank you it's very kind of you so we're gonna be doing lots of cod streams this week there's a couple of other things coming up too that i can't talk about yet but you'll find out soon it's going to be a busy couple weeks for the gaming industry this battery boys yeah three look at these guys we're loving it what's up punisher hey michael love you too bud the marksman is okay big you know work like that holding for deployment take this time i told myself i'm getting early night it was like 5 a.m there were no early nights it still counts as an early night with what we do there's no early nights no there's either 3 am or 5 am a oh deagle it's a bald eagle a bald eagle yeah yours might be italic i can't hit anything with this yeah does it even fire real bullets in this game or i mean i think they've got like the dealers tough to use the hammers are actually like they have a bit of a delay don't they it's a trigger delay it feels like it yeah yeah with the revolvers and eagles you need to put the lightweight trigger on if you remember it's only like exclusive to the pistols i think you guys got nvidia reflex on i turned it off i thought that was what um i think you can connor i don't have one of the new cards you need though i don't think you need the older cards i think it's uh 20 70 is oh really yeah as far back as you can go well don't you have to turn it on windows or something first no it's just in uh graphic sense oh okay uh sheila and jack thank you for becoming new members i appreciate that and zach thank you for the five been following since the battlefield days love the channel that's very kind here right where are we going i don't know what the regards are there's the whole new train station isn't it yeah yeah trains is the one near cory should we drop corey is there one near quarry i don't think so maybe there is there's a search there trying to think of the map that we saw but yeah we should probably bring a map up i'm probably not gonna go for that because there is a mouse it's at the end of the trailer isn't it you want to go orange some two three guys there also i'm being chased here i might go down no that's a great start i got ganged up on you going around i did see that oh it's stunning it's a good start that's a good start i'm straight in the ghoulie within 10 seconds oh no our games will crash in a second we'll be right with you remember how you're saying the origins not grounded anymore it totally is yes there's an epic one well yeah but that'll be in a box right surely it's not like common at least although there's different variants no but still you've at least got a rare version of it but yeah it does come with some attachments is it slugs or is it normal bookshop oh that's actually a good question yeah because if it's kind of useless all right let's get this goo like okay right they've changed all the weapons haven't they of course it's time got him no the voice comes i love it wow i'm coming back boys well i'll loot safe jack if you had any i didn't well i think i had an s80 but i got about two bullets off before i died that's all on the bro no you're cleaning up for the origin oh no yo he's one hp oh no he's last on the bridge just like that right now there's two on the bridge though tom yeah should we get out of here should not be jimmy you are you in trouble there tom looks like in much trouble there's actually multiple men i'm getting the hell out of dodge you should probably leave yeah they cleaned up the two that connor mentioned and then or the last guy that kind of mentioned it's unfortunate yes damn i was doing so well too you guys got very unlucky i have to start there wait is is you guys still playing yeah yeah yeah kilo on the ground okay that's going to make it even more better you can just talk about i don't know sp man for five minutes or something usually gets you going i don't know what he was doing but whatever okay you got one good leg on you right now oh my god okay thank you for playing i supposed to do the melee um you just coming back in there connor yep oh we need to get some cash how do you turn off the music on those well you could do the free rest thing with the timer listen that building oh yeah that's a good point do you want to grab that suppressed shotgun i'm just going to get this box in here connor yeah no worries i can just take the quad over what is that the other one the thermal sight yeah the slowest ads speed in the world is it was it initially like that after the start or was uh is there anything in here um why you can't vault these no this place is looted i don't know i have a pistol and an uzi so let's send it then yeah you want to just send it i mean starts here so yeah yeah let's send it see if we can get a couple kills get the buy maybe if we die just leave also did um did you get any server or no yeah weren't they oh you might need to um wrong with me then there's nothing wrong with you start you're perfect don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise thank you i've got 120 ping what's your ping connor oh no there's a couple guns here a terrible decision i lay him up he should be very low okay i'm healing listen for that rose finish on one punch line two yeah people are down was that that wasn't a team my footsteps near my dead body like in front of you tom is downhill tom give me money i was active give me money do you need the ir uh no no i'm good i'm good okay it doesn't show for me still in it so i don't i don't know where this guy could be then did we not see it just behind here on green hey linga yeah yeah my eyes on it i'm gonna go around on the right right that's a more accurate ping sort of his head for a second see if i can get behind him about behind the building it's running away by the looks of it why are you running armor why are you running let's see if i can head shine open the eyes i was just trying to keep him keep him live for you guys well played guys uh we're gonna get free lowly very soon perfect we are i still gotta buy and try out those plates and stuff i'm not sure yeah there are a couple of places well this is an exciting start to the game isn't it guys thank you for tuning in uh peter thank you for becoming a member man i appreciate that so where the hell did that come from then does anyone have a ar he's gotta someone dropping in as well only two one southeast could be up above us yeah okay yeah he's like this way the other one's towards the house is east all right let's run you ready ready three two one go yep no eyes in the bunker side inside broke broke let's drop down down septex oh are we going to get trapped down here he's right above he's right above no yeah i'm sure i heard someone then watch out see you know we've heard him now i got a heartbeat uh southwest southwest lovelace all right free loadout let's get the new guns hey okay oh hey it's dad hey someone just took a shot at me oh that'd be cool wouldn't it 20 grand and you can buy your friend from the lobby i'm sure i took a shot from there someone's taking shots is that the sound of the new sniper oh yeah new season six guns okay here we go give me that i broke him he's on top of gas that's right cause i got a hit scan sniper on the move oh i shouldn't no he's there he's there i see him well he's got team wipe i told you how do i get a team wipe because you're a legend he's falling back i think he's going to res his buddy on yellow unless he already got him i've only got 20 rounds in this okay he just absolutely drilled me you're an accurate paying jack yeah watch out there's a jeep coming as well he's like here right i am a safe res if you can get to me but you might just be careful broke another one close to another one closer get him caught police left side i mean where was the other guy though somebody drove up he drove off he went on it was green as your thank you there we go are we sure are we clear yeah yeah yeah okay teamworks now there's just another team sneaking up on the team that had just been teamwork good job guys this is going to be like such a fast loadout yeah they'll be the quickest in the west yo this little drop on this this thing sounds incredible you've got the mags gonna what are you using that oh right okay the new sniper stuff yeah it's real nice this sound is amazing yeah this sounds really crisp suppressed it's pretty ridiculous stars like i don't know about it it's broken it's going to be really annoying to play against because it's going to be hitscan headshots like i don't even care that it's not a one hit down if that is what people imagine i think it is up to like 150 meters or something right yes it's like it's it's basically just not good for long long range but it's insane there's ammo here guys ridiculous the ammo crate my new favorite weapon in boston season six a new car 99 do you need a specific type of mag in this for the hitscan yes it should be yeah it should be pretty quick i've got five rounds the last one you unlock jack because is it on the blueprints both do it both do it oh do they okay what are you firing at here guys i actually think the second one might be better than the last the one you're using increases damage at all ranges broken one but the one i'm using um has a flatter shot it says i don't know in the bus [Music] yeah he's buying the truck it once jumped my bullet get some elevation here still behind the truck i'm gonna push a little bit nice it sounds really good too you got a monolithic on that tom i do was that a team wipe no no uh down to finish all right does anyone need sniper ammo because i got fully loaded no i'm good thanks um i'm okay i probably won't be using it as much as you guys don't have many attachments and if it can't one shot headshot i'll just pick i'll just pick up the same loadout it drops they're escaping on a quadcopter oh yeah i like the inspect animation that's a unique animation they haven't they haven't done one what that is is like when you get into a match for the first time in the multiplayer your character does that and his specs like oh yeah that's checks the uh the bolt action and does that stuff so they haven't done the inspect where it's usually just like thrown around in your hands because they still have time for it so okay that animation as they inspect but it's really cool yeah it's unique it makes it a bit more interesting the animations in this game are so good aren't they [Applause] i don't know if there's any more money here let's play the airplane i got 400. yeah uh that quad bike is uh a little suspicious oh yeah he's coming back what's he doing i can't hear him he's on fire he's got the new uh tesla quad oh that's it zero to 60 in 2.6 seconds that's it you stop the quad here do you guys hear this i hear a crying baby or something a crying baby right here yes right on me yeah i know i heard that what did you do dude what the hell is that that is that's zombies yeah that's a is there anything you can interact with here i'm trying to find it there's a face here a face sounding yeah there's a face right here oh that's not okay i see i see what you're going for there tommy i was believing in what's this here by the campfire a little can it's just uh leftover budweiser in the bush why can't you vote this i'm so annoyed dice will you please fix this there's gotta be something worth interacting with here well is someone just drop in right here it's horrid oh maybe my bullet is i'm not going where they should go or something yeah my child is saying it's samantha samantha oh yeah that directly below us he's in the top left with the r700 yellow building it's because you're leading jack that's the problem yeah you literally just aim straight on them there's a guy down here on orange i can't really hit these guys the outside or in no he's in the bunker dare i go in yes you're gonna get the bat mate it's edward let's go your head's exploded your head's gone it's a bit excessive hang on you're you're dead i am dead we are up on the hill and there was a full team below you oh good oh no and the gas is coming so i'm ruined then no no you're fine they don't even know you're there probably i think they do connor demon guns for me i don't know jack jack's got demon guns for me what does that mean i can't see anything like you know and triangles and geometric shapes all over your screen i don't like the prospect of leaving this building right now you know nice you seem quite happy i'm dead oh they're fighting okay oh yeah they're up the hill i'm going to just join these uh this squad for a bit hey can i join your squad free plays okay don't worry he's dead dude [Music] hey you want it completely fine uh you have to i'm really loving this ground wall you know that was a fun first game i enjoyed that yeah it's not about all we saw we saw that exactly tom we found samantha we had some nice sniper shots i think maybe that is the easter egg not that we need to find anything just that it plays that sound yeah because people know what that is in reference to uh i sent you an invite as i left yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it hasn't been crashed it hasn't crashed that's unfortunate it will it will not that's exactly what happened to me and then yeah did you win some games earlier stud uh no uh we crashed on two really late game okay and uh got second on one 4v1 4v1 really can expect the crash but not the crash yeah if you get a crash in a crash that's the problem you hit you hit the gold mine and then crash in crash crash in the crash yeah yeah i find a shot with that new sniper rifle and the bullet looked like it hit way below where i shot yeah i mean it looked like it i think it's visual i don't think the bullet is accurate to where it actually goes is it the normal magazine it's the um 0.300 norma mag yes yeah yeah five rounds right yeah that's the one that i want yeah okay that or the lapua which is what starts using which is the next one but that's level 50. i need a nymph yeah let's get started sorry yeah so check that start to check the ammo for the sniper you'll see that one literally just improves the damage for and everything ranges those numbers mean nothing yeah hey that was a good first game guys i enjoyed that i really like the bat takedown the fact that it just like explodes the guy's head can bats do that probably not we found samantha as well that small child don't know what she's doing in war zone but there is some kind of halloween event like night mode coming so i'm looking forward to that whatever that is uh battlefield stream soon yeah uh brandon thank you for the two travis peter tyler thank you for becoming new members i really appreciate that hey ryan how am i liking the new season i've only just started playing i mean the as val we got a couple of nice downs there the ttk seems really quick on that i wasn't quite sure about that sniper but i think i was leading too much like tomorrow and study are saying just point and click don't lead [Laughter] uh mohammed how did you get the blueprint that jack was using you just level up the battle pass and there's a couple of blueprints there for the new guns mike is halloween popular in the uk it is yeah it's nowhere near as popular as it is in the us like in i've been to the usa during halloween and you guys love it out there you absolutely love it i'm a big fan of halloween as well october was my favorite month though because my birthday is right at the end of october so it's always been like a halloween treat for me but yeah we do have halloween parties in the uk but people don't care about it as much as the us i would say but if you go to uh if you go to certain stores you can find loads of halloween stuff i remember was it two two or three years ago i was in uh orlando on holiday and we went to uh one of the malls there i think it was called the millennium mall or florida mall something like that and there's literally just a shop dedicated to halloween all year round like the whole year is halloween they had everything in there are there any plans for modern warfare to be compressed i can't install season six because of how big the file is that's a problem isn't it with this game little p i hope they figure out ways to make it smaller yeah you guys missed that on your childhood son clearly there's not much loot on them i will say that's the only thing so are we full setting on this are we coming to this one yeah and you come back out on the other side so we're not going to be those guys but they won't be camping already surely no no no no yeah well if they are not they don't mind i'm very impressed oh don't touch the train tracks so they'll zap here that kills you there's a ladder here as well is there nice all right all aboard choo choo let's go in the train this one is going to the torch block how there's a little map here you have the torch i'm scared of the dark hold my hand it's okay connor don't worry that's all right is there people is there people in there there's people in here they're already shooting their limbs they're gone they got oh they were going that's lucky oh they're going to have fun entering the station wait i got kicked out no guys how do i get out no jack can i come back um only if you take another train on the other side of the platform there's gonna be a full squad here oh no it's okay [Music] it's weird though because he went north and ended up south wait which one did we take the one closer this one on my side this one on my side sure yeah yeah i think so oh there's a ladder there that goes up to the stream went north and then ended up south where does this go i guess it goes up to the street i gotta go see every day when you're walking down the street yeah full squad just waiting for me oh yeah he's gonna miss every wrong isn't he oh he's not even gonna see it he's just gonna just plummet one so it should be like 20 seconds before he goes what if there's a team on this one what do we do i think we melee we're good this came from our station right we're coming jack please we're on our way i'm scared i think we're going the right way [Applause] let's you go the package yes mate oh wait now we're out of the zone i don't mind back on the track back on the back on the train it's kind of cool yeah it's fun it's a fast travel system you know just wait forever well that's yeah you were saying like it might be a fast travel system mechanic don't have the first trouble forgetting but only advanced top well when you think of fast travel you know it's like you point click it's like would you like to try my argument you're like no no no no they're looking at me teleport well yeah it didn't make any sense but i guess that works okay no it does it works in theory right um is this jeep that's in here the one that's just stopped if you guys saw that uh maybe i wasn't really paying attention okay approach with caution yeah there was a vehicle yeah yeah happy silence smg loot in here this is unlucky i'm taking roof that's a good point connor they rest on purple you need some money you mean the store near me yeah yeah that's the one your app stored look how much cash that we've got they're on you may yeah you mean how much cash you've got let's find a buy station i hear someone open a door near me oh no once mine is yours [Music] right i'm looking from upper right now you should be okay i mean they did yeah it's fine absolutely fine everything's fine do you see anyone do we just take the train station back i think i mean we could maybe all right it could take us to a bike actually it would take us longer to yeah let's go to twins let's go back to twins i think on the train yeah let's just run it no no it'll be faster if we just run it because we're gonna have to wait for the train what other modes of transport should they add i want to scoot overboard futurama tubes everyone dislike that and you can wallbang them oh there's people here i guess i already did that we can go up oh they're fighting each other you can't go up there you guys on each building um i don't feel like should we go i don't feel confident i'll be the bay i'll be the bay okay you're gonna get stopped by a guy right now moving here okay no closer yeah down going up watch out there's there is guys on the left of that as well like here yeah there's one right now coming up yeah i'm gonna run it horses question mark and also orange threat you say horses jack yeah why not oh right turns ball yeah let's go for a transport going purple they're really behind the sign i don't have plates either swag ways yeah i don't have plates roller skates chimpanzees are riding on them jack some roller blades oh there you go red red threat so i think there's another team he's just turned up that was chasing you they've got to be underneath the back there's one behind the sign here two guys connor there's three people coming up the stairs no joke my side no outside outside oh can i'll be debating i told your life was gonna be this i haven't i have like flashbangs and everything so behind the purple sign started jason didn't have a snipe ball nope he's probably gonna jump over my arm here down there's another one in there uh are we safe yeah let's get inside i think we're allowed to have fun here come another coddle inside we'll be all right ow i don't like the screen shake there are still guys on purple yeah i don't think we wiped that other team right no okay hi never mind we're fine hi bye i am in an origin though thanks for playing someone just bought it he's right there you know all i ever wanted was a loadout so i could find the new guns oh look at that thank you [Applause] he jumped off he jumped off well we've got a free one but do you want another one um probably safer to get another one all right i'll get one put it down oh there's what guys up on the hill slowly here yeah roads get pushed with me oh they can come out of this station can't they they do appear to be sharing the hill with me yeah be careful tom yeah okey-dokey yeah i see one damn one oh that seems fair broke one one okay one oh okay there's been a real sounds good i need to go there i'm probably dead here i'm definitely dead here come on give me some points one self rest one self rest i'm trying to cover your tongue yeah yeah i think there's guys underneath us but he needs to rest

they knocked you by the garages then oh yeah we should have finished them off then and there ah that sniper is throwing me off not like any other gun well yeah you play like this whole game with like a car 98 for example you got a lead full body ahead yeah right another one let's go it's like that laser cannon there is a bf4 oh the gore's rival in the final stand dlc yeah destroying planes that

matthias thank you for the 60. good evening jack do you feel like the gun play is a little uneven sometimes like you should kill him but then they get you uh i don't feel like that that often in this game it really depends on what guns you're going up against samson thank you for the five have they removed the origin from ground loot yes but you can get it in loot crates uh jack thank you for becoming a member uh t-show could you show settings yeah of course so 240 hertz 1440p uh i've got this on as well this is new low latency reflex just makes it feel a bit snappier texture normal anastopic filtering normal and then most of the other stuff is on low for better visibility sometimes i turn a off it just depends on what moon i'm in motion blur off as well david thank you for becoming a member is the new update good ready i'm having fun so far my friend hayden have you guys not crashed at all i've crashed about five times today when i was playing earlier filming the easter

you for the 100 from india you think you're the best youtube cod streamer thank you ash i mean each into their own you know some people uh have different tastes some people won't like me some people will everyone's got different preferences right hey jamie what's up winter hey nino thank you for coming i liked a bit of conversation we had and i put it in a game that was actually good cut it out stuck it somewhere else well there you go would anyone ever known the difference no it was it was me and you doing uh alfie solomon impression stuff people loved it oh wait i've forgotten already oh yeah that one who is alfie solomon you're not watching blind as jack i haven't seen tom hardy's character oh yeah you can barely understand what he says yeah yeah red chubby [Music] i mean his accent not your stuff yours is pretty good yeah yeah yeah mine sounds like it but his accent doesn't sound like it is what he's saying the impression sounds better than the he's yeah he's saying yours is better sounds like actually kind of voice that someone would put on for a voice of the cartoon character or hardy anything like we were saying he's just tom hardy and every everyone and he just gets more and more got me yeah he's pretty good at inception you can understand what he says then yeah but hey um [Music] [Applause] everything is a meme come back come back can i get a large big mac fries strawberry milkshake and two apple pies and a loadout oh my god oh cheers thank you is that your time usually i have to wait for the apple pies but i mean that was fuss do you want a 20 twist a twist what's the twist you've done the plain mcflurry apple pie combo it's going on before i have actually done that tom it's very nice yeah it does not sound good at all dude it's incredible connor okay right you know yes ice cold mcflurry the apple pies in the u.s and canada are not the same as the ones that we get in europe the ones that's insane yeah okay they're very different there's a difference oh dude there's there's subpar in the u.s tom i've never been in the us they're like baked pastries they're not it's not the one oh no it's like they're thrown into a toaster yeah oh no others are absolutely incredible and cinnamon as well right on the cinnamon oh yeah so good have you ever been to the uk connor no never if you ever come mcdonald's apple pie do it stab fest then you can go home corner and then you can go home just come specifically for that yeah i think it'll be worth the 500 flight yeah if you like i could mail it yeah mail mail it might and you know what i i'll send you guys back a bag of money mcflurry is i don't like that you have milk in bags stuff to the shop to buy a bag of milk but they have bags of milk in like coffee shops in the uk though yeah i put on top of my car yeah and the coffee is so weird though because in stores you can't really buy bags of milk connor it's more of a commercial thing in the uk it's milk in a bag i have 13k holy should we load out so we can get everyone the good stuff let's get the good stuff should we do that we should be close to the i know we're gonna wait three minutes yeah whatever you want and yeah one way one loadout something's barely acceptable in multiplayer oh it's gone oh yeah these guns have always been these ones are nuts they're shooting there you go jack your valve's down which one is it tom oh that's a beautiful nice should i have that daddy i mean i could give him my bell as well cheers boss it's like my that's lovely that is yeah it is nice nice looking gun i put reflex back on but the shadow tracers too are the best i've seen you seen these kind of yeah i need that yeah it makes me tingle in places i didn't even know existed you didn't know they existed no i think i just seen it yet i think i've just hit puberty welcome tom welcome that's the halloween tomographic there you think they're gonna put zombies in warzone i hope not jack because what i'm thinking because they've obviously teased it in that trailer assume you've seen it yeah like i don't want because they did it with apex if you remember the first time we got a nighttime mode yeah i remember had infected in cod before so like they could do it but there's too many places in warzone especially these new zip lines that you can just camp out and just farm zombies all day that was a nice pickup going out like that all right where are we going um train station right so it might be more sense to just use this train yeah where do you want to go over the twins where is this station now is it it's over here way back here we passed it just feel like you know i might as well make the most of the new features oh of course someone's rest right here though uh justin flores thank you for the 10 get that dub i'll try and get the dub in this one justin see if we can do it oh yeah this is a fair weapon oh yep yeah mental right that doesn't seem legit i have to be honest with you he was doing the dying hold on well done this guy okay you're welcome man you're welcome for the kill uh that's all me i'll take the credit for that can you send me the clip and i'll put it on twitter i mean it does show that i have the kill oh i'll just don't forget hold out your gun yeah because if you pull out a sniper and then you have to fight you're doomed yeah i mean have you seen this like we're all running and can't switch within a sneeze someone's been here have you seen the easter egg by the way my guns are broken before jack finished a bit of multiplayer i have them put down by my side like i'm sprinting around you can get two specialist tokens if you do it which gives you every single perk in the game that's fine mental that seems bad doesn't it start fine no i just know what you said right i can't [Music] uh take my weapon are they on this really maybe what if i down myself does that work uh someone said show fbs where do you do it is it in general fps frames per second there you go i was running around like a cinematic then he ended up on top of the eye so damn earlier didn't he you want to get any thumbnails not the time i faded to black and johnny didn't even spawn inside a train he was just outside at the top of diamonds in the zone okay um somebody needs to catch me on the bottom okay i guess i'm going back down this stage i need to pull a quick stone because you're not c4 where's the guy that was shooting i'm not gonna waste a c4 this is free damage baby let's go connor come on then all right i'm recording 360. nice drop my weapons last second nailed it sick yeah but now you're first oh okay timing they didn't see that it's fine i don't even know i don't know it's still broken of course you're still broke you have to die he's bacon um well this is fun i can't like the room this is weird i've heard it's quite buggy probably because you're n a i don't know i think i tried to swap weapons like as the train doors were closing or something and it might have that's it knowing me is the right weapon he's right on me yeah there's people here and people on here is he coming he's running after him i'm mailing with my bird huh see who needs weapons this is great nice work connor i love that from you assassination jack's pogging off i'm trying to pause but i'm getting more he has to ride the train again do i well according to twitter which is always right oh okay i mean if twitch chats does it where's the train again underneath there one day should we get in the train again or do we have something with me let's fix connor's game i don't like this i'm coming up come in jenny plays yes please you know what i feel like okay this is kind of what normally happens in our group when something new comes out we just meme for a whole game yeah and then break stuff and then have to fix it for the rest of the game and win the round yeah this is a high calculator game right here guys we've got two yeah well acula's got two executed and hit by a train can you get him yeah yeah that's not very sound sure apparently it just knocks you onto the electricity and then it burns you where's the trainer can i email you can i give it a few seconds do we have to call it no it's not a timer it just goes and comes it comes here it comes thomas thomas [Music] oh nice jack wait hang on we have to make sure we don't we go we don't go the wrong way how do you know how do you know which way i don't know well that one goes to the default stick hang on is coming as well the train won't go though if it's into the zone i read that in the patch notes okay oh yeah you're right there is is that the right one oh well yeah because jack went another way became south there's two oh jack it's one minute we need to get this one this is yes is it fixed victory oh my god oh yeah thank you twitch chat twitch i never thought victorious by the way i got killed last time went over this jack so just be on okay so i'll die full teamwork wait is there a reversal can you do the old i don't know if you can get really willing i'm gonna do okay no you can't grab that one behind hmm that's a shame that would be sick though so you can both come up at the same time do you want to buy a selfrest or you'll be a summit connor oh yeah i guess i could do that but that's the thing connor like the one that's behind isn't doesn't touch absolutely i'm getting got a media he tried to do the long range c4 it didn't work and he didn't go anywhere hey look where it landed it literally landed here and he threw it from the wall i don't know how he didn't die then i absolutely railed him with that asphalt let's be a c4 meters announced does anyone want money for something i could do with some places 7k um i'll go five i can drive you some money here okay 3 400 down thank you you guys might be able to buy 70k or something i'm by self and then have you guys okay i was just talking to tom about this earlier have you guys noticed the sound here oh yeah on top of the new stands on the left then i see him yeah you're on your own sword for a sec left climb these come on blue okay i was just looking back i still don't play head down right down down downs i'm blue marker team's shooting from up top it's like a weird jump isn't it yeah you got land on this right you press push blue you guys coming to me do you want us to come see you soon jump on the satellite snipers oh you knew the satellite the secular he was right there on green heading this way okay never mind no visual obviously i'm seeing him he's crossed directly behind the news standstill to get him finished team on the roof still which rooster i still got one your way starting list yeah yeah right on the other side of you broke he's gone now look at the roof now look at the reef up here i'm blue watching yes over here there's just one guy up there there's more there's more there's another one there is a zip on the back of that all right oh one's floating you'll float through wow no it's not this game there i genuinely think it stops ringing i've been down from reaper where yeah from the roof i think oh okay yeah yeah fully around the corner there let me see if i can i'm not i can't see this guy peeking can you finish the rest yeah you ready you know he wants to pee yeah yeah come on he does i think it's one guy i've only seen the same guy peak each time yeah he's on top of here broke again wow i'm doing full self do we want this fight i broke this man so many times it's just one deal vehicle to our west it's not going to go anywhere because we'll just keep training places yeah we're not in a great spot here just i'm off the roof he's driving to our left now you never know this thing is loud can you install drop money from place did you hit him too yeah i i found this guy okay it's a weird round dude anyone need plates it's actually if you don't have one yet it's not a gas mask uh yeah let me ask i don't think this is i kind of do you want to take that roof yeah it's gonna when he was on yeah yeah oh yes this is where the sniper game play comes in lance is there a rappel here i don't know sniper gameplay is our target i'm probably dead by the way so see you guys later there's a guy there yeah he's going up staircase beat him jack on the staircase yeah he's on the staircase he's only got one ping okay is it safe to go up there i can't i can't hear anything yeah i think you're good on the back you can do the indoor repair oh you sure he's not on the roof no because i can hear him oh he just got wasted dude ran into our arms didn't he all right this is going to be out of the gas yeah that was his first mistake ruined there must be someone up we can see from here he didn't have the r700 wait i'll bouncy let's get him come on okay here we go here we go i believe here we go oh me excited from the back tunnel behind guys from behind if you come over to me they can't see you ow in the window okay there it is fine he's that's the ruin my fun the guy down here on green i'm moving left you guys bailing huh uh we can stay on the street right oh no it's landing on top is there a guy in this building on the shop there's a guy here on green somewhere i don't know if he's in the building or what jumping down broke his armor found him nice pentagon green this is the most fun i've ever had in a video game redowned him it's like playing caught four in warzone hey my mother's a nice lady oh oh what does he mean to you he's gone blue bounce are you kidding me no are you calling me they want disgusting it's gone the video game there's no behind us actually we're actually playing call of duty though it's not war warzone hey i'm uh can you really see somebody over there yeah i'm walking yeah is your spot in that tree so many trees he still hit scaling tom no he's out of the range now do you think the ball is yeah i think i'm right sure he does i think a d renderer doesn't exist yeah i'd say so that's still horrendous it's it's a massive drop-off is what it is it gets to its like range then it's like nope but enough we're not going to get the pacifier just though yeah i think it's why that middle magazine is probably the better one for range has the most damage there yeah but the last one is good for is increases damage for all ranges but the middle one says it increases damage for long range so i'm thinking okay more damage than the one that does all right let me ask you this are you happy that it's currently in the game no would you happier it's gonna ruin our games oh absolutely but what if they just kept it in for like just a few days for weeks that's what they do right like they're releasing it's going to be really bad that's fun and encourages people to buy the battle pass and then on there think about how of how we thought the hdr was you know yeah yeah this is insanely broken hmm it just feels like multiplayer in more zone that's a problem usually don't have to deal with i'm not gonna lie another one okay with it right now there's another one behind red he's raising his teammate what behind the cylinder here yeah i'm burning him one he's in the building he's gonna run through i think he went in the right room he's running moving why he kept moving yeah one hit and him further back here on red on the g with him yeah there's one on the jeep tom what's up i saw a movement there i'm red as well by the way guys let's cross over to center building here many people hiding in this building too he's right there behind that thing there you go headshot he was resting he's being rest you must've got the other guy but did he get no he got shot by somebody all right what team wipe nice the screams that silence there can i drop ammo for us am i down extra gas mask i'm gonna try to get in this building or at least on the roof or something still nothing on heartbeat only two other teams guys that there is i don't have a chance to shoot anyone in this game that's why i felt the other game check into someone in there hold on i've got a uh robota give me a second there's someone on there well i heard shots down on green somewhere what do you see stud what do you say yeah there's one against them oh my god yeah the timing on that oh we shouldn't have i'm stuck behind a thing jack you're good let's get on i don't know what i might be able to get just chasing me oh god there was two downed i'm down for some reason i couldn't hit that guy we shouldn't have pushed my gas mileage jack selfrest stop selfrest i don't have stuff right there there you go no no no no have you got gas mark jack doesn't know i don't know i might be able to crawl in though when it resets maybe i'm so dead i'm so dead i mean the other team hasn't pushed you jack you got this 1v3 [Music] and they're just gonna hold zone yeah unless i've got to pick one really you said they were over here stud they were on all the way on the most west side of the circle but anyone's game now she's a mount machine nice on the right oh i didn't see him nice try it was really well played good game again yeah gg the second place curse with a push up on the house yeah did they have mp5s and obviously then you would have been okay i think i was just going to try to get the finish on that guy yeah but i i need you to get into a fight because dodger said there was a full team there so it just comes back to work she's already run you've already made the decision well i only pushed because i had dead sounds right that was a bit of a meme game that was yeah that was a talk that was a meme that was oh my god i can't believe this is hitting game i mean i shot that guy this guy and i was just like i just shook my head in real life it was a bad moment his face palmed and your hand went through your head i was like oh my god this is real this is a video game in 20 this is not a joke this is what happens when devs work from home no no no this type of stuff happens all the time i'm just wondering if it's a glitch or if it's an oversight you know somebody put in the wrong number yeah i think oversight something like that i don't think that's a glitch i mean it could be i don't think i get the glitch either yeah it feels like an mk2 with a bit more um that's it guys we haven't crashed you said it oh they might have fixed it that's that's a good point actually tom man they could have fixed it because it wouldn't require a patch would it no you're right but the fact that it's sending people to their desktop and closing the client completely that's the problem marshall i bought the pass with your code today thank you marshall zack still using the 3080 yes i am indeed my friend right there hey ruby how you doing what's up crazy kermit again hey john swift curse now pajama shirt it does kind of look like it doesn't it uh david allen thank you for becoming a new member yash thanks again justin flores thanks for the 10 and monkey favorite female singer of all time i don't really have favorite singers to be warm honest is over stand by for deployment to the war zone i think there's a few it's when someone asks a question like that it's difficult because you're kind of put on the spot aren't you i mean like stevie nicks from fleetwood mac probably one of the greats tina i really like an artist called regina spektor if you've ever heard any of her songs she's very good i don't know if she's made music recently but she's

guys want a parachute over here they're fighting in the street on bluetooth there's people on green as well they were seeking us for little like you know oh i'm still in that's in but do we want to take these three from green yeah and then i'm thinking we go over here and repel up no we're just going straight to it then well being beamed from the roof though up there growing up yeah they love me

on green did we try and go um onto this level yeah did you even put a bullet in him jack nope didn't get a chance oh no what the hell is the rest no one's on heartbeat either everyone's rocking goes uh we have to go back the way we came i think another bee and these guys can just sit on the roof that's sniping at the other guys my body hurts in real life that's hard you know it's really really jack that's probably how everyone else feels too freaking sniping 24 7 with that thing holy guy just dropped some green okay let's go let's go back oh no no no no no no oh no i can see him he's like underneath but up i don't know how old sticks with him oh i see him say i'm a samson i believe you guys will win this round i believe that you will is it safe that way yeah if you run it underneath you're fine once parachuting off yeah you might come down these sides not the origin covering i'll finish your research okay no he's on the roof on the roof no they got c4 yeah downtown endings are fun for the whole family i'm so ruined man stud believe one was ground level probably underneath in front of you or he's like in the bus they're gonna have to drop oh they can just stay on that roof no oh guy in the corner there was a guy in the corner and oh nice try he literally just sat and waited behind the door yeah do you want to try a round of uh mad max see what that's like let's do it yeah the armored yeah was that third place it was decent game that gun is at the top of the zip we sit wow one man there's always something that's more broken like it beats out the previous season i'm just glad we've got a new sniper to be honest it's not the right deck okay as long as your squad's truck is still running your squad will respawn okay your vehicle is taking too much damage head to the nearest repair station to fix up your truck use the buy station on the back your truck to purchase truck upgrades okay if your truck is destroyed head to a buy station and purchase a new one uh stay in your truck use it that would run the gas okay we'll figure out yeah let's do it we don't follow the rules you ever put a desk together from ikea connor i think i shop at ikea sorry mate wow good what no i'm just kidding wow no i don't think i would buy a desk from ikea though just because i don't know i don't think i would trust it well you'd buy like that just because of how much weight is on it i've got the uh people do they buy their kia worktops like the kitchen tops i've got the sit stand desk from ikea the new one it's pretty good do they sell one yeah they they bought one out um like a new version earlier this year it doesn't wobble goes up and down it's a desk looks good it works it works great you're easy to please aren't you jack i think it was 500 pounds something like that that's not too bad yeah for raising and lowering yeah quite easy to build as well you can bluetooth it as well so if you want it always set to a certain height you just use the app on your phone and it just goes to that height so if you're one of those gamers it's like my desk has to be 34 centimeters precisely above the ground you can be that guy station are you reading this you can i'm feeling attacked right now our truck is a boy station what do you mean for the back of the truck there's a little screen and you can go up to it and buy stuff like uavs self-righteous loadout you literally just said you don't care about me reading the rules and i read that specifically yeah but i read it like we all need to read it unbelievable you know you shouldn't tell the group i was i was exclaiming something that i'd read that's the difference do you listen just so boring wow that's the canadian you're super light about it i i interrupted your conversation and said guys look at that what's happening to you used to be so nice to me so we're gonna win our first game of mad max absolutely as long as tom's not driving we're like a married couple connor you know this hang on i'm a pretty good driver in this game are we live wait what is this how come we're spawning in the air this is our truck stop right see this you see this in the back station okay station on the truck do we have any money upgrade armored truck yeah you got to upgrade it oh my look at this is that a bloody add a portable radar to your armored truck trophy system yeah this is really good i'm trying to look at the upgrades hang on we'll never get sniped out heavy armor heat resistant barrel on the on the turret oh baby self revive spawns on the ground wait wait to drive the truck into this gas station there's a trophy system already on it is there because you can refill the trophy ammo that shoots stuff and you can repair the armor truck is there a loadout or i think so do we get all laid out let me see i mean yeah we play the game as normal but this is our truck there are many like it but this one is ours yeah but we can rebuy our truck as well nice reference i like that why do we care about the truck because that's the truck if you lose the truck you you're out of the game you lose the game oh but but how can we can buy another truck you can't that's it because you know you can can get destroyed you can buy yeah that's what that's what i don't like about this i can drive someone has to drive you got infinite ammo on this does it work as like one of the normal shield turrets though i don't know it it sounds a bit different what's this i'm refueling repairing yeah okay this is where i go to repair my vehicle i am the truck um are they repair stations though yeah yeah i stop at the gas station it repairs my truck enemy trucks played there you go bottom up jack i'll keep it steady yeah oh my god it's over here all right let's stop here for a sec quick station nice nice uh no what we want is the heat resistant barrel for jack someone dropped me their money quick are we just not gonna buy it thank you oh okay heat resistant barrel for jack it won't overheat now vehicles can you move it up yeah i could do that goodbye jack how [__] oh here's speed poggers let's do this what are we doing let's do the scout contract where is it i don't know what are you talking about what the hell disabled mechanic needs to revive nicklin coming oh no he's gonna try and run somewhere about to revive him no there's a missile locking it's disabled down down the missile there's a missile there's an incoming missile right now and i'm probably about to it's fine it's fine everything's good guys you need to play that's not funny nearly exploding trucks not smart one hp it's fine can you repel no no no no no go drive it away i gotta drive away from lock on yeah yeah bring it to the repair bring it to the repair yeah you probably need an rpg do you need to spend money to repair no no you'll stay here it should repair me oh baby look at that i think the money is only for upgrades you can't buy a loadout no i think you can buy a load i just mean for the vehicle oh okay i don't think it costs a lot to repair or refill or my fov is 85 or 86 something like that i did not say hey siri did i so why have you why it didn't sound no not okay it didn't sound anything like a siri and you're still activated um it just dumps out half the lobby usually not the whole one oh something jack are fine what are we doing here tommy i need to loot jack i mean you've got a fantastic loadout as in the turret all right let's go two lads in their truck wait they both crashed yeah they both crashed yeah oh ronnie impact's 50 in the lobby so all right risky play for me jack is this was this
