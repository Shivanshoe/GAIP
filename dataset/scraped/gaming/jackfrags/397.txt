can we just sit back and appreciate this model and animation for a few seconds someone has spent so much time on that but this is a new mastercraft bundle in war zone called the necro king and then it there is a skin for the creek called the eye strike and it's got the ice dismemberment effect as well now at the time of recording this video they released this yesterday i bought it went to equip it and it was kind of messed up the barrel looks all wrong and everything but i realized that if you equip the takedown barrel it actually fixes it so i think the default blueprint has got the wrong attachments on it so in the meantime they've actually removed this from the store so i don't know how many people in the world actually have this right now but i bought it before it was taken away and it's what we'll be using in today's solo match this was a really fun match though and the ending has an interesting situation to try and break down exactly what happened so i think you guys will like this as always a massive thank you to all these guys who've used my code in the cod store if you buy this bundle or any others using my code jack frags and caps tweet me a pic and i'll put you in a video like this one also before we start an old friend of mine hit me up a couple days ago and suggested we do something for war zone loadouts where you guys pick what loadout you want me to use we've done this a few times many years ago with battlefield but i've never really done it for warzone so if you've got any interesting weapon loadouts or guns that you'd like me to try let me know down in the comments below and upload the ones that you think could be quite entertaining i'll take a look and maybe we'll pick one or two for some gameplay thanks for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like let's get into it right there now i played this game pretty late last night about 1am so i didn't do any live commentary at the time so i thought that i'd just riff over the top do some play by players kind of explain what's going on drop the silos because there was a scav here unfortunately two of the people here dropped two that was the guy that picked up the scout but i just felt really confident without fire because the uzi actually pretty good at medium range sir took the challenge managed to win heard one singular footstep there which prepared me for that fight and i almost lost it almost it was a close one there is another scab that i pinged further on i just decided to leave it see if i could accrue some money found a heartbeat sensor pinged a random dude and i thought you know what they've got to be in the garage or something pop the dead silence come around the corner this dude actually nearly kills me that's a good player you can tell by the movement how quickly their crouch and then went prone like drop shotting is not really something that i do because i just feel most the time it's detrimental but in circumstances like that it can actually pay off but unfortunately for that guy i had an ffar and they had an xm4 so i've got my loadout i thought i'd check out that animation again just wants to fly away from you man just trying to get out of there so cool carried on moving around the hangers here there's a jeep coming behind me random dude out of nowhere here in the ghillie suit i did get the down but the guy in the jeep behind me jumped out and there was another jeep so i quickly disengaged from that fight these two are gonna have a scrap i'll pick up the pieces dead easy the guy that i downed has self-rest and now oh god this was so annoying we've got a bit of cat and mouse on our hands here two people don't know where that second guy was actually not sure just armor back up keep fetching they run in have a little fight he takes out the one guy in the hand and i thought i'd chase because i'm assuming he's gonna be low hp and he dips in between the hangers there and i can hear him running around still got him on b i'm just not feeling this one i wanted to fall back take this green and white build and get the high ground usually a good position in solos this get some overwatch here see if i can spot this guy i'm just seeing there running through the windows no clear shot though so i'm not going to open up yet see if they come up the stairs he jumps out head glitches the wall almost takes me out there i think that bullet was very close to hitting me in the face which would have downed me i think you know i can tell this guy's not a bad player so i'm just approaching this cautiously oh man the timing there i'm just getting sick of it now so i'm going to push in screw it what will be will be kcra get the crack got the advantage now now i can push there it is mp5 coming in clutch there at the end get the finish corner of the uav enemy spot someone right in front of me here [Applause] and i assumed that they would have gone for that loot i'm thinking it might be someone that's just been killed and come back from the gulag through the window not facing me maybe that's someone playing on the tv you know just not caring no headset just trying to push the advantage try and make it an interesting video for you guys to watch and i went for this fight because it's two people having a scrap there's a truck i know there's a high chance that if i just roll up there in a tube they probably won't be paying attention to them anymore but this guy was and i just did the old jump out right before you get to them although to be fair they didn't do a bad job of tracking me when i jumped out the car sometimes you'll find that people just end up shooting the car because it's still moving and you're actually out on the ground at that point beaming them but that player was wise to that unfortunately this build of the craig or the creek has so much movement speed that just able to out shoot them dance around a bit on that hill picked up a bounty it's always good for getting intel even if someone's got ghosts you get that bounty you'll see where they are on the map this guy rocks up in a jeep i think they're just coming to the bye they've jumped out there hit the thermite on the car trying to jump over i'll get the armor break go with the thermite mp5 for the down quick reload no cell present for you but the car explodes and nearly kills me that could have gone really badly if the timing was a bit different there that car exploded and killed me before i'd finished him he would have self-rest and finish me so i've got to be more wary of burning cars that are about to explode next time it's not like the single player of call of duty hasn't taught me that about 5 000 times over the last 20 years i'm getting towards the end game now i know it's only circle three but the lobby just died really quick happens most of the time in solos nowadays there's a little fight over here and i wanted to come and get the recon so i'm trying to find out where the circle's gonna end up see if i can make the most of my positioning so i want to try and win the game of course but the shooting stops so there's probably only one guy here caught unawares behind the skip you've always got to try and pick your fights in solos if someone's just had a fight and you can get there in time they probably won't be prepared for you especially if you haven't given them advanced warning that you're on the way by firing a shot or getting in a fight or whatever so i did get a different recon flag and i feel like i've got time to get this random dude jumps out of hangar wrong place wrong time just didn't see me didn't look left look both ways when you cross the street okay i teach you that when your kids i think it applies to war zone as well if you're on your own playing solos keep your head in a swivel and you'll hopefully avoid situations like that so looking at the recon the zone has moved far northwest and i do not like that area at all so i pushed up got another recon just to get a little more information and yeah it's going really really far north west up to the police station there so ping the car that's my play and here i got someone 7.4 meters in front of me they've got to be in that little bit that goes up to the plane right above me i'm just being sneaky beaky you know i don't want to make any footstep noises and they've started to move away into the plane so i know that's my opportunity i can go up these noisy stairs because they do make a hell of a noise and this guy i don't think they know that i'm here i've got ghosts if they've got a heartbeat they can't see me so i'm taking the advantage pushing him get rid of another player anyone that's on my side of the circle when i'm trying to make this move for the car is a problem for me so i'll get downstairs to the car someone's put a proximity mind in front of it so i'm screwed right like i can't go this way because the gas is pushing in i'm not gonna have time to get out and get back in without dying from the gas i thought you know i'll i'll shoot the proximity of mine maybe it won't destroy the vehicle of course it does and i've gotta run now i'm up against it just been really cautious because someone could be camping that if they put the atm on there when i come out here i hear someone on the left i think you know my best play here getting the gas and what i did there when you're in the gas visibility is really bad if you're looking in the circle so as i started shooting i pressed alt on my keyboard to ping that player so that's going to give me that nice red diamond above their heads and here i hear someone on my right down below i'm gonna wait for them i've got time we're gonna do the same thing ping shoot so i can track them nice and easy if i didn't have that red marker there i won't be able to see what i was aiming at basically so that's a really good tip for you also someone else behind that guy shot at me then that's why i'm using this trucker's cover let's play it back up do a little jump here see if i can spot anyone no one there and i just wanted to check the front of this truck for a c4 proximity mine because it's that kind of lobby there wasn't anyone there and we jumped in pretty strong to have a truck end game like this and i did notice that there was a player in the barn didn't want to challenge that heading to the zone there's bound to be someone in police station already but i wanted to check the high ground could have been something in the shack there nope and this dude here who gets stuck it's just one of those annoying dice please situations where you just can't jump over something i wanted to take this building just checking it no one's peaked yet so i think it's clear get out and i heard one footstep so i was like nope i'm going back in notice the enemy truck on the minimap as well so pop my stroke out the back it gets destroyed and i managed to make my way into the ground floor of police and clear it i've got three people left one is above me i've got a guy in the building that i checked out with the truck and i've got a guy in the truck on top of the hill so i'm just chilling biting my time his own bounces towards the south going the truck gets over there early i can hear the guy above me start shooting i know that i've just got to try and put damage on this guy in the truck try and kill them because it's it's that kind of solo player they will just stay in that truck as long as they possibly can so i'm just beaming it i know that because i don't have a suppressed weapon i'm going to be on the mini-map guy above me smashes the window i've got to watch my back no gas mask it's a bad situation to be in downs me but then gets killed by the guy in the truck the other guy was in that previous building is dead now too i selfres i know where the last guy is and i get cover i'm hiding here thinking okay i'm just gonna wait see if they run past i'm in cover they're not gonna see me reload check the heartbeat and then i just start getting big and i was like how like how did that guy see me on my screen i'm completely behind cover couldn't see any of his model at all but on his screen he can see my head and my shoulder and just gets the easiest kill ever to win the match but there it is i've learned something just because you think you're in cover sometimes the game doesn't work like that and people can see you when you can't see them it is what it is you're living you learn so there it is guys i hope you enjoyed that i haven't used the krieg in ages it's not a bad gun it's okay for solos i don't know if i'd take it in trios or quads though i think there's so many better options but pretty fun to use that build yeah not the best for war zone of course no suppressor but i just couldn't resist like that's such a cool skin and animation man i love that with that said thank you for watching guys if you liked the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike leave a comment down below thank you
