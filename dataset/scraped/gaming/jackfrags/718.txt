another week has gone by and there's been so many insane clips posted of cod warzone on the reddit and sent to my Twitter and today we're starting off with a couple of really weird ones have you ever seen this ECM baby Yoda found a custom kilo and mp7 in their gulag doesn't seem fair really but how does that happen did it fall down from the game somehow is there just a rare chance that some guns can spawn at the back I don't know it's weird but they actually end up getting the kill with the semtex anyway so fair play the next clip is from scorpion PR they find something that I have never seen before oh really first I thought this was fake because I was like wow that's not that can't be right but check this out they opened a legendary crate and they found a redeploy token for the Gulag this is probably even rarer than finding the grenade launcher but apparently what it does is if you die for the first time and you're carrying one of these you don't have to go to the gulag you would just redeploy straightaway it's kind of cool so look out for those this is also a first for me from cranberry sauce it bursts out onto the roof with the c4 this guy's actually got incendiary shotgun shells what even are those apparently you can unlock a secret mission or assignment to get these up they seem kind of cool get to the execution with the dog oh there and jumps off just avoiding the precision airstrike great point in the past week I've seen some brilliant crossbow clips it seems like more people are actually using this and taking it seriously but this one from gnarly I think might be the best long-distance one so far they managed to hit a moving helicopter that's about what like 150 200 meters away three seconds of travel time absolutely nails it just see the body fall from the sky you mop here though coming in absolutely clutch with their crossbow so they're just chillin at a bi station spending that cash all of a sudden a truck comes along this guy's got one shot left they have to nail this squad mates got the RPG ready he hits the down on the driver and then it explodes instantly it just looks like something straight out of an action movie so good another clip from you mop here though demonstrating rage in its purest form every time it just cracks me up then the death chaser is such a good feature this shot though from southern us is absolute dirt the prediction and timing on this so that that is ridiculous to actually predict the movement of that guy that they couldn't see through the building and get the arc of that shot right that's really impressive final crossbow clip this week from Basha Henry nailing three shots on the back of a truck with the explosive bolt the first shot downs them the second one eliminates them that's clever I've got to check those out for myself I'm sure we all know at the moment is how strong vehicles are in war zone and there are some inventive ways to use them as the Furious one demonstrates here I seem they've just come in from the gulag there's a squad on the roof with just a pistol you're probably not going to beat three players but if you throw a helicopter at them that's a guaranteed win right there look at all that loot look at all that cash they can probably buy their teammates back cheeky t-bag at the end there to Underwood followed suit here though with a quad bike off the ramp up the ramp off the quad nice little booth so with vehicles being so strong what's the best way to counter them well there's a few clips here that hopefully show you cheeri here with the peeler observing two helicopters seemingly I think of midair fight but right place at the right time two helicopters taken down with just one rocket Roy's keen here also taking that approach you can dumb shot at two with an RPG spots attacker over some kind of Mad Max world occurring here master two for one right there very good maximum star points here though for cotton so they're capturing a flag they notice the TAC rover coming over on the mini-map throw the c4 detonate at the perfect time that right there is a mini-map assisted c14 wipe but surely this is the best vehicle takedown of this week hulls here is chilling on the airfield they're about to be run down by a car they've got other plans they throw the c4 down remember where you put it wait for the perfect moment boom didn't even turn around that is ice-cold brilliant timing got it absolutely right dead Zedd here about to be attacked by a squad in a helicopter is he gonna get crushed not today patiently waited absolutely nailed that c4 sometimes though nature takes its course and life finds a way Clint the great with the squad here over watching goodbye station maybe they've parked the helicopter there and they wanted to buy something there was another squad they've taken them out but the gas is pushing in they've got to think about moving as soon as possible so they hopped back into the helicopter that's a bit of a close shave to be honest because they're all almost dead if you actually look at the health one of the teammates is unbasic aliy no help at this point that was milliseconds between life and death but the games got other plans for you my friends loadout dropout nowhere takes up the helicopter in one fell swoop I think they were just meant to die you know it's one of those final destination LUNs fate decided loadout drop goodbyes bringing it back down to the ground now though with je estas so they've spotted D squad that comes on the air traffic control center in seemingly every single game nice down there with the sniper calls in the air strike to try and seal the deal and now they're forced to jump off because they're not gonna be able to provide their teammate in time gets the first mid-air and then gets the second without even blinking that is some incredible accuracy right there but if you do find yourself downed on a roof this clip from quick srt hopefully will show you a way around it another quality's not great but one of their squad mates has been knocked on top of the building if they call off they're probably dead but check this out did you know but if you actually catch the midair and hit the revive button before they hit the ground you can safely revive the mid-air and they won't take any full damage that is a nice tip and could keep your squad in the game here's a recording of what happened to Alex hyper and Max when they've been in lockdown for maybe just a bit too long so drive time left zum-zum I'll have whatever they're having please but Sarah Fez here is having a standoff with the truck in solos attempting to maybe blow them up with a claymore either the guy in the truck knows what he's doing here with the Claymore or they just keep missing but eventually the Claymore hits and it disables the vehicle enemy is forced to jump out they get hosed serfs are happy land unfortunately the Claymore blew the lorry up and set them straight to the Gulag unlucky for some these are the two easiest kills that corwin will ever get wait for the sound there's something just so satisfying about that buzzies teammate here those not so lucky this is bad all they wanted to do was test the shield turret because no one ever does but ultimately this is what happens when you use the shield turret guys your teammates are killed take note Mirage smoke here with the perfect revenge story so they killed out in the middle of the street by camping here called backbreaker take note of the name Mirage gets sent to the Gulag and of course they win that nice and easy they're back in the game parachute down pretty much where they were killed before so maybe this guy is looking for the loot that he had could he pick it up again just chills very patiently on the roof he knows there's a car over there but someone just got up let's see if we can take advantage of this spots the wookie up to the right goes for the takedown gets it knife in the neck bullet in the head that's lovely and there's a load of loot for you now that wasn't the guy that killed him before that was someone else the guy that killed him before he's driving around in this TAC Rover Mirage has got blood in his eyes nails the headshot on the car is it gas by that is how you get revenge smidgen here towards the end game in there match unfortunately big boom there killed by an RPG but after seeing the killcam how can you be mad at this that was a crazy shot well played the final clip for this week comes from bond house and this is one of the craziest endgame circles I've seen is one player versus four squads and this guy here isn't exactly in a great position right now with squads all around up and above him it gets really intense and there's some great use of the underbarrel grenade launcher which I just never see I'm gonna let you guys just watch this one though because I think it speaks for itself and it's really intense kill or be killed probably and it's gonna be a gas out another week let's cover just a fantastic play from bond house there and a great way to end this week's episode with that said I hope you enjoyed this guy's I want to say a big thanks if you
