battlefield 2042 moments ago dice dropped a load of new gameplay details and information about the game and i think this is a response to the large amount of questions that they received after the reveal and in this we learned several things including the name of the robot dog specific song crossplay ai and more there was some repeated info in here too but i'm not going to go over that and we're just going to be looking at anything that's brand new so we're going to start off with the most interesting parts of the post here beginning with loadouts so we all know how specialists work by now they've got their unique gadget and trait and then they can choose any primary weapon any equipment secondary weapon and throwable so they gave an example of a loadout that mckay could have they went with the m5a3 assault rifle that's the all-around rifle in the game the supply crate of their equipment their secondary as a g57 and the throwable as a frag grenade and then they elaborated a bit on the equipment slot because this caused a lot of controversy i think when people realized oh any specialist in the game can carry a rocket launcher so does that mean that vehicles are just going to be dunked on the second they spawn for example you could opt for a car gustav m5 which is an unguarded rocket launcher effective against vehicles at mid-range or would you instead like an anti-air approach by the film 33a missile choosing a more explosive approach for your equipment slot would mean you won't be able to carry a medical crate or a supply crate and thus leaves you without health or ammo replenishing options so choose wisely so they've kind of explained that that if you're taking a rocket launcher then you won't be able to take health and ammo so you'll be relying on teammates in your squad to do the same so hopefully there's just never a scenario where everyone is carrying a rocket launcher they clarified that squads will be a maximum of four players and they said that in conquest and breakthrough squads can contain more than one unique specialist so you can have duplicates of specialists within your squad they didn't say hazard zone there though so i'm assuming that in that game mode you can only have one of each specialist in your squad and i guess that kind of fits with the high-stakes nature of it that they've been talking about squad revives are returning too they'll take longer and they don't bring back players on full health next up robot dog the name of robot dog is ranger and we saw that briefly in the reveal trailer got a lot of question marks is it a vehicle is it player controlled what's going on well they said that ranger is neither a speciality or a trait and it won't be unique to any specialist instead everybody has the opportunity to call ranger in when in need of support however when you make that choice you are choosing ranger over other options available within the calling system there is of course a limitation on the amount of ranges available at any given time so i don't think you'll ever see a scenario where you've got 128 robot dogs in the battle although that would be hilarious once safely on the ground a ranger will follow and protect you and even put your life above their own you'll also be able to issue orders such as scouting a location having them return to you and follow you if a situation becomes dire you can also command ranger to self-destruct this gives you several new interesting tactical options such as do you send ranger into the line of fire or maybe as a decoy in order to flank the enemy your choices are critical as ranger is a light unit designed for anti-infantry combat but can be easily knocked out by enemy fire explosives or emp and yes before you ask you can place a c5 explosive on ranger and send them into an enemy squad i don't know if i could do that to my robot dog but that's a new battlefield moment right there the next bit is really juicy it's about the ai or the bots in the game so they confirm that there are three distinct experiences with ai there's a multiplayer and in this ai soldiers are used for server filling capabilities making it easier for you to match make when you want to play players always have priority over ai when playing multiplayer co-op that allows you to play together with friends against ai soldiers and solo if you wish to perfect your skills for multiplayer you can even play alone against ai soldiers if you're new to battlefield ai soldiers are a great option to learn the mechanics of battlefield at your own pace without the pressure and competition that comes with multiplayer and then they elaborated on how ai soldiers will actually play on the battlefield ai soldiers are intended to play the game like how you would play it yourself however they're not designed to be specialists and cannot use traits and specialities they're their own class of soldier i suppose the default looking grunts that we saw in the trailers you'll see them undergoing certain tasks such as using the vehicle calling system and engaging with vehicles or capturing objectives and whilst they can't use a wingsuit they do have the intelligence to decide between engaging with you via enemy fire flanking throwing grenades or even reviving a down squadmate so it sounds like the ai is pretty advanced and we know that dice have been working on this for a number of years now implementing self-learning and pre-programmed ai in the game so can you completely opt out of using ai soldiers in the all-out warfare set of experiences of conquest and breakthrough ai soldiers are used to backfill servers and you cannot opt out of playing with them however there is a cap to how many of them you can encounter in a multiplayer match in general you will not experience more ai soldiers than players unless the match is still filling up or almost empty players will always have matchmaking priority over ai as an example if there are 120 players out of 128 players currently in a server eight ai soldiers will join the match to help even out the teams should a player leave another ai soldier will temporarily replace them until a new player joins the game we're providing them as a helpful option to ensure that you won't have trouble matchmaking and you can fully enjoy the all-out warfare chaos that you can expect from a battlefield match and another popular question about ai was okay well if i can play solo does that mean i can play offline and they've confirmed here for the first time that battlefield 2042 is a multiplayer only experience so while you can play solo against ai if you'd like to practice it will be in an online setting so no offline mode for solo or anything you have to be connected and online to play solo versus bots cross play here we go one of the most frequently asked questions is about cross-play we can confirm that it's a function we're looking to build and test for battlefield 2042. to accommodate that we've made the decision to move the technical play test to later this summer so we'll have the opportunity to test the crossplay functionality this means a few thousand participants will join us to help test some of our new features and functionality that we're building from the ground up for battlefield 2042 and i guess their first public test of that will be in this technical play test they said originally that was going to be early july that hasn't happened and now they've moved it to later this summer they didn't give a date for that it says we'll test a subset of crossplay functionality during the technical play test this means during this we will test pc xbox series xs and playstation 5 consoles they'll all be playing together and that makes sense to me because if you think about it they'll be running the same version of the game with 128 players and they confirmed there what i just said pc and next gen playing together xbox one and playstation 4 playing together and there's a little note there look at that pc and console can opt out from playing together that's massive news for the console players because i know there's a lot of console players out there who just don't want to play with pc players because of the possibility of cheats and also the advantages that pc players have like mouse and keyboard higher fps lower graphics settings that kind of thing so i think it's cool that dice are giving people that option to opt out if they want about cross progression and cross commerce alongside crossplay we're also building cross progression and cross commerce for battlefield 2042 which will be shared across all platforms and travel with you wherever you go for example your unlocked progress and purchases in your playstation copy of the game will carry on over to the xbox or pc version and vice versa that's awesome thumbs up from me there was a bit about vehicles here do the factions have their own vehicles yes the iconic vehicles that you come to know and love will be faction specific and this means that you'll get to use iconic russian or us hardware depending what side you're on for example tanks russia will get the t28 versus the m1a5 on the us side you'll also encounter vehicles that anyone can play with such as the nightbird helicopter that's the little bird i think or the ebaa wildcat heavy ground vehicle will there be naval vehicles and sea warfare you can expect to see naval oriented vehicles such as the lcaa hovercraft however there isn't a focus on naval specific warfare right now we've seen your comments about how excited you are for naval warfare so stay in touch with us about what you'd like to see in the future so the only naval-ish vehicle is that hovercraft so no actual boats at launch but that comment there it does look like at some point down the line we'll be getting boats it's a battlefield game so i'm sure we'll see naval combat at some point in that live service how does the vehicle calling system work while you can still spawn directly into vehicles from the deploy screen one other important change we've made to accommodate the increased map scale is to make it possible for you to call in vehicles when and where you need them and this system is accessed via a tablet and it's available to all players no matter what specialist you're using and there's some things to keep in mind though it's dependent on the map and the mode that will have a specific budget assigned to each team so don't expect to see again like the robot dog thing 128 tanks at once which seems that there's a limit you'll still spawn into air vehicles such as aircrafts and helicopters from the deploy screen and once you've called in the vehicle you will incur a cooldown so everyone has got a fair chance to call in support so you can't just spam vehicles over and over again and then there's a couple things here specific to conquest how the maps work and also the differences between the 64 and 128 player experiences so on xbox one and ps4 old gen you'll have access to the same gameplay features that they've announced for next gen and pc so that means weapons vehicles specialists and gadgets will all remain the same no matter what platform you're playing on as will dynamic weather events like the tornadoes or environmental hazards like emp storms sandstorms the main difference between console generations is that we made adjustments to the playable area on the maps to ensure a fluid play experience on xbox one and playstation 4. can you farm every floor of the skyscraper you'll not be able to play on every level of a skyscraper but you can expect lobby and rooftop combat which can be accessed by elevators and zip lines as fighting on all levels of a skyscraper would be an entire map on its own this prevents detracting from the rest of the map another big concern from the community was can you differentiate between specialists on your own and enemy team because people thought well if they can pick the same ones as my team can then how am i gonna know who an enemy is well they said here that there's gonna be blue icons for teammates green 4 squad mates and red 4 enemies there are also other options and systems that we're still testing that will assist you in distinguishing enemy players on the field and i think what they mean by that is what i talked about previously in the behind the scenes presentation that they gave us we saw some snippets of gameplay and the enemy team did look a bit darker than the friendlies on your team that could be what they're referencing there there might be some filter in place there'll also be plenty of options available in the form of skins which can alter your appearance to allow you to choose how you'd like your specialist to stand out on the battlefield so the same two specialists can look vastly different is what they're saying and finally that bit about conquest and how the maps work they've talked about this idea of clustering and they've introduced this to create deliberate areas of activity and capture areas for people to engage with they've talked about sectors which changes how players gain control of an area so in order to successfully capture the sector a team must seize and maintain control over all flags within that sector and they gave an example of a more fluid and targeted combat scenario in a conquest match where you're attacking a sector you captured the first flag and in previous games you and your squad would immediately be on the move then to the next capture flag a different area of the map but because of the changes with conquest in this game you've now got to establish a foothold in that sector and you can spawn and confront the enemy to take further flags within it so it creates a higher intensity fight for the full sector and only when the full sector has been captured you can then make the decision on where to go next and they say that this will reduce the back and forth running between flags and puts a focus on the sector itself oh okay so there was a ton of new information on there loads of gameplay details and they've definitely cleared a lot of stuff up there and gone into a bit more detail people were looking for answers based on the reveal and the gameplay and hopefully for now everything they've shown they've kind of answered that but do let me know your thoughts on this down in the comments below how you feeling what you think about everything with that said i'm out of here thank you for watching if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one [Music] you
