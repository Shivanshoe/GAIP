welcome to wolf and dog this is the final act of the nordly's campaign in the battlefield 5 single player and it's one of my favorite missions in the entire game the story is based around the norwegian heavy water sabotage a series of allied-led efforts to halt german heavy water production via hydroelectric plants in occupied norway during world war ii and this involved both norwegian commandos and allied bombing raids in the game we play as a norwegian freedom fighter whose mother a scientist has been taken hostage by the germans our objectives are to continue their work sabotage the heavy water supply and production and ultimately discover the mother's fate the mission is open to the player out of the three objectives presented at the start the player can complete them in any order that they choose but most tend to start down here with the destruction of the shipping trucks now i decided to play this stealthy because all around the main objective areas there are alarms and if you go loud if you start on the guard there's a potential that they can raise the alarm luckily as you just saw we came equipped with throwing knives and the great thing about the knives is that once you've thrown them you can retrieve them so i've gone ahead and disabled the alarm there we'll take out this enemy soldier and look to climb up the ladder to the roof and from this position as long as we're not spotted we can drop a dynamite down onto the objective and get ready to blow it up so far so good just gotta get down now without alerting any guards quick take down here keep it quiet and then we're going to blow it confirmed and then let's get out of there now the cool thing about the skis is that they're quite stealthy so you can get around the level quickly and quietly so if you're gliding around on these things the enemy aren't as likely to see or hear you believe it or not ski warfare played a key role in world war ii and the most common transportation for norwegian soldiers during the norwegian campaign in 1940 was skis and sleds and during operation gun aside an operation which the nordley's campaign is loosely based on norwegian commandos covered large distances using skis in order to reach and sabotage heavy water plants these sabotage missions were incredibly important because heavy water was a vital part of the german strategy for creating atomic weapons so we've made it over to the docklands objective here and what's cool about this is the amount of options to the player i could have gone through the front door guns blazing maybe kept it stealthy instead but i've opted to go underneath and all we're gonna do is place one dynamite on the wood there underneath the shipment as long as we don't get spotted we can get away and make our way over to the second objective in this area [Music] now you might be wondering why didn't you blow it up well the reason for that is that as soon as i do the alarm will sound and if that alarm goes off it's a lot harder to cross the ice there but we've managed to keep it quiet we're going to drop in interact and that's another objective completed we've got to get out we're going to blow the dynamite make a hasty retreat there it goes luckily for us there's a vehicle down here we'll steal that get out of there fast you can find a secret collectible hidden in that ship there they're scattered all around the level and there's also an easter egg which we'll talk about a bit later so our next objective here is to destroy the state police intelligence and we've had some intel that it's inside a bunker and you may have just seen it there that red door that's where we've got to get to again you can approach this from multiple angles do you want to go in on a truck do you want to shell the village with a cannon you could go in gums blazing with an mg42 but i think that this mission is best played from a stealth perspective so that's what i chose to do we've nearly made it to the bunker but we've got an enemy behind the truck and one right around the corner hello unfortunately for them their back was turned this tends to alert the guards though [Music] so it's time to go loud and we'll take the truck get out of there as soon as possible it's not the quickest vehicle though this one doesn't handle the best but it'll do [Music] so that's all three main objectives complete and now we have to move over to a rendezvous position and scout it out there's been some intelligence that something might happen there we're going to go see for ourselves now about that easter egg that i mentioned takes place on this frozen lake all the way over there on the right hidden on the level are three gold coins and if you collect them all a giant blue whale falls out of the sky it's supposedly a reference to hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy perhaps one of the level designers who worked on this has a fondness for the book or the movie boots on the ground again here as we work to infiltrate the bunker but there are enemies already patrolling we did make quite a ruckus back there so they'll be on their toes [Music] we're gonna go for a nice big white flank instead [Music] i can hear an enemy just up ahead of me here quick take down with a throw knife we'll have a peek and see where the rest are i throw out a decoy make a little distraction [Music] okay so their attention is elsewhere that gives us an opportunity to take them out [Music] and with that we're going to move into the bunker quick check around the corner here just in case nobody in the office we're looking good we'll move on monster foreign isn't here [Music] and now we've got a chase on our hands the mother is still alive can we save her though now these mortars can't actually hit you and kill you if any of them directly contact or hit near enough to the cat and crab that you're driving here you will explode and have to restart the checkpoint we're gonna veer off to the right a bit more cover jump out see if we can destroy those two final trucks plenty of explosive barrels there the strongest ones will eliminate the first truck quick check looks like we're clear i'm gonna throw a dynamite on the final objective complete the mission drop okay come on hi guys [Music] [Music] um [Music] is [Music] [Music] you [Music] thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this subscribe for more i'll see you next time
