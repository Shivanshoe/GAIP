to call of duty black ops zombies i've played a little bit of this already just one round but i wanted to jump in it again and learn it a bit because i've watched so many videos and streams over the last couple days of people playing this and it looks like a blast and there's all sorts of crazy easter eggs in it too so i thought that we'd go in again have a bit of fun today i'll be playing with tom and adam from the two angry gamers been good friends with them for a very long time and i don't think they've actually played this yet so this could be quite funny i have to say as well big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this one today we are playing on an rtx 3090 graphics card and i'm playing on a 4k 120 hertz monitor so it looks great should look really good on the stream or on the video as well and we've got everything maxed out this setting here for some reason i put this on high and it just resets back to low i don't know what the deal is with that but we do have some rtx effects in this game it doesn't have real time reflections but it does have ray traced shadows local shadows and ambient occlusion so it could look really nice i don't know if you guys saw my single-player walkthrough but i think the graphics in single player are actually really good at times so that's what we're doing we've also got dlss turned on and dlss uses nvidia's ai to give you better performance but also make sure that the image still looks good works great i've tested it in a few games and they've got it in black ops too so we'll be using all those shenanigans today and the frame rate is in the top left hand corner i've kept my fps at 90 because i tested it and i don't think we're getting any more than that so if you want to keep an eye on the frame rate it is up there but thank you for all coming along to the stream today i can see all you guys in chat i appreciate you being here thank you what's up general kenobi kane lord helmet great name izu hey jason we're gonna have a good time today all right let's see if the boys are ready last hello hello yeah hello jackie are you guys ready hello youtube sweet um what should we play i've invited you bob i think we should just go into the endless one to start with just the 20 round what's the difference i guess the 20 round you get the x fills is that right i think you get you get the x fills in the endless one as well you can just choose when to go you can be that right with we're ruined here let's leave i think it's every 10 rounds you get the option to do okay well i don't think it's going to go are we going to go just as long as we can we're not going to mess about trying to do any easter easter eggs at the moment i don't know i watched the video guide earlier from ruffle waffles i feel like it's going to be difficult if you want to do that we get milo in we just call him up and go come on milo be the fourth come on come on oh yeah i just want to play the game for now and then we can surely do all the easter eggs it's easier to upgrade your character and stuff anyway because you can actually like level up on this and yeah do your weapons in zombies level up for the multiplayer and yeah okay yeah it's cross progression have we got youtuber stone i don't know who that is that's a random let's just keep them whatever wait uh hang on uh yeah i didn't know how to do that wait no let's do i don't like that i don't like that i don't like that i don't like that how do i take it so it's just us i don't know party maybe party private or something you can make custom zombie loadouts as well i don't know if you guys knew that well i'm level one oh yeah i can't do anything yet okay i can't see anywhere to make it a private lobby there's no there's no button anywhere it's just party friends only but when i click featured uh there's no way of making oh here we go private so you guys haven't played this at all but i need uh cold war play privately with your party or go alone rank weapon and battle pass progression is awarded in private matches so it is awarded yeah we'll be all right i'm confused i'll just start the game let's just go i'm starting i'm starting jack okay it's doing it all right we're doing it six seconds five seconds i guess it's easier with four people but look this is this is us three now i don't know what happens is that's good play i'm just doing battlefield strings so we can't do that we've done that now we've completed that i've decided after yesterday i cannot get involved with that it's too much yeah i'll just lose my life basically like i can't i've got too much work to do i can't get involved with it it's done for me i wish everyone looks not for me at the end of round ten and f for five rounds after yeah so from what i know the knife is really good and so the shot because the knife gets you more points oh okay my game's loud hang on you have your order strike team investigate the sight contain the twins i don't have a knife so that's a great start can we just melee these zombies to start with uh game pool okay if that's me i think because i'm just doing my saying sorry that's kind of cool though that the party leader can pause [Applause] oh this is not a great start is it no it's not my fault it's my fault sorry am i saying something figures off pack a punch to spaz 12 apparently is the one there's all sorts of perks there's a ray gun as well right pew pew pew yeah shotgun everyone's saying the shotgun's super open this master give me give me a second oh it'll be fine it'll be it'll be all will be fine it is great timing it's fine everything is fine everything are you doing your game settings yeah i just i'm not really okay we're back we're back we're good we're back we're good we're good okay right there's one more because my melee is supposed to talk oh no am i right in saying this place was some sort of hey sorry i did i mean what do you want to do i can't me like people all right keyboard and mouse i didn't realize it was the same thing sorry i'm sorry sorry youtube god you're so impatient god oh they're all good nah nah nah they're kicking off let's kick off big time where's the melee bun help me help me find the angry gamers always ruined jack's streams where's the mate where is it oh there crit evil nazi science project correct i've already got rifle but for me later you've got your fiscal yeah [Music] just bash them but should i be shooting these first no no just punching my knife i think i mean i'm not a priority dude i've only played it like once before jack you're impressed you shouldn't he completed this man yeah okay let's open this i've opened the uh oh can we still barricade up drawers or not steam shop the world at wall sometimes they drop they drop loot and you can pick it up i can't seem to hold e on stuff too oh you can unlock the door there there's cash i mean i've started mp5 i'm quite pleased with that experience is it like is it good to unlock as many doors as possible i don't know i don't like that pausing the game pauses your game though it's annoying me i want to just fiddle my settings played it before oh what's this z so do you get more money for doing i think so yeah barrier you get you get points if you melee them insta kill right you definitely want to melee him now i like this uh graffiti isn't this the original world of warm up this in here oh you can do that yeah you can buy you can barricade are we supposed to be getting to the facility then over here well you can turn the power on and i think that lets you do stuff like pack a punch and upgrade your perks yes we must do that we must do that punch that guy's head off but he was pulled in through the hole i didn't like him planning an explosive oh golly right insta kill's gone now yeah it's all right we didn't need it come again there's something over here that i can't get to [Music] you deserve that interesting interesting is it you can also do the zombie train as well you guys know the zombie yeah yeah just like heard them around yeah and then you just line them all up headshot new that's a new it's lovely their heads have all exploded guys what's up these stairs and then in the corner up here something there's something like glowing i can't get to uh looks like a insider i i did an explosion you made an explosion happen yeah i did i've done an explosion jack i'm back trying to make our way to the facility but i'm not sure i think are you guys here i could unlock this bit maybe i think there's an mp5 there get back you must turn on the power first these guys these guys are rubbish like that's the way i think this is the way i think to run faster all right guys okay i've i've made it through guys if you come upstairs and then come through here i think this is progress right here max ammo his name sounds good in your ear max ammo i've been damaged full how am i full for the power 77 [Music] power first is this the power button have you got it jet i don't know no we need to come up come upstairs and i think we can go through to the facility oh you can buy an mp5 though i've already got an mp5 is it this purple arrow do you think yeah come out here i think it's down here because we just follow the uh the signs then we have to go in there maybe follow these sounds it's explosives is it oh here you go chris sublamo we're in [Music] zombie [Music] okay stun grenade frag grenades build equipment and support crafting table you could build a monkey bomb there and a decoy what might be a little monkey with the cymbals oh they're all locked for me they're all locked all the numbers for the rounds in the top right started in the roman numerals they went ah but let's just use numbers oh there's a quick revive here oh it's just head off i'm gonna get this i'm gonna get this i got quick revive now guys i am the medic are we supposed to be going into the bunker then i think we can sorry this is the last time i just see it's so loud like it's literally so loud there you go why this game paused by partly to not fit on the screen have you got that joke yeah it's it's kind of out of the bounds yeah zombies is fun we should have left him alive actually because he was the last one but where are we going we're going to go down to the bunker what's what's this little like um oh look at this guy it's an evil bunny rabbit so the point of this coming out there was for the um that's the second evil bunny rabbit i've seen jack so that's something that doesn't mean it's evil bunny found where'd you guys go how did you get down there i just went down back into the bunk oh there's a zombie here did you believe it oh course they're getting stronger oh yeah so this is the facility the facility notorious activities okay oh i'm low on ammo actually oh jolly oh god there's no friendly fire okay this is bad it's quite satisfying this i got a bomb [Music] don't be afraid uh can we barricade this initiate a trial i don't want to do that i've got like an ice gun it's a frost mine isn't it that's your equipment ability uh initiate a trial go on then i'm over here tom i don't know if that was a good idea it just says kill zombies with equipment guys have you got the equipment a grenade uh i think that was equipment ow i know this okay i don't have any more equipment though there's an ak 74 there oh my god look at the facility jack yeah but how did we get in there well presumably are we equipment right now i don't think this is the right way i mean a gun is technically equipment i don't think it's the game kind of as such that's and that's and that's out of ammo found you didn't have a head and he was swinging okay okay no it's bad it's definitely bad i'm just gonna go get the train and get the train without a gun very bad very bad i'm bleeding out oh well we should have saved that well that's right i walked into it back soon as i killed him nice video of the hammer tomahawk we have to unlock this guys here this bit got enough trouble here missile i think we can go in now what the hell that was a legit jump scare for me there legit i think the powers around here somewhere right oh is this uh in here or something powers in here okay let's go jeff let's go baby baby i think we need the money to open the door yeah i've got cash turn the power on how's [Applause] [Music] level two [Music] yeah activate that why is it not like any cartridge fed shotguns right now why does it always load like the others one thousand to do that that's what project inspiration was you would like me to touch thing right now we need to figure out why omega group reactivated it oh my god can we get zombie powers now what the hell is going on i'm sorry what's going on we're in the upside down part uh it's there's a tunnel at the top oh that hurts that gas and there's enough train space there guys here you can use that to [Applause] i think we have to go to speed let's see upside down then we're gonna go to the ether tunnel out here right here right it's jellyfish then what does this mean why is that floating jellies we're in there we're in the ethernet faster reload now oh there's past 12. guys i've lost you juggernaught's really good come to the jungle if you can afford it i've just paid money and i've been teleported somewhere you've gone have you time oh there's the mystery box as well i think you can get like ray guns and stuff from there oh machine part there you go got it okay what you're back to the absolutely i collected some intel i think we have to go back to the machine guys now i've got on the team part where did you find it tom teleport down into this um i just followed the objective i got teleported somewhere i think it just it spits you back out all right we're back in the real world there's a lot of zombies went through the portal oh my god yeah the graphics are nice are we found in the intel yeah i found two pieces i've got nothing left anomaly radio i think we're about to shoot these bunnies nice glue bunnies must mean something where does it show you how many pu costs one thousand yeah did you guys get juggernog out here no no it gives you more health if you are we could use anomaly and you said there was a mystery box as well it was but that's over here tom mystery box if you need one press the guard down pack a punch i don't know how you get pack a punch it must be away oh there's a whale oh it says attempt computer password on this that's probably easter egg found mystery box give it to me oh my [ __ ] just killed i've been instantly matched by the zombies they're getting very strong now get the train get the train get the train going that's it get the train no that is throw that down somebody come and save me uh you get okay so you get pack a punch in the other my child telling me in the upside down yeah upside down [Applause] that might get forever i don't think so i think maybe there's a way of us getting you i couldn't find it went down here but it was just disgusting wasn't it where are you jack i'm just outside trying to train all these boys they're going drink to improve aiming down sights pack a punch is a lab upgrade when the zombies are getting tougher [Music] do we know if there's a way of getting bombed i don't know will you respawn next round well yeah that's actually yeah i think that's right get back in the room i've got an insta kill here but i don't think it's going to go reports here three damage going i think my tier one i've got a tier five tier five greek all right [ __ ] table yeah yeah yeah i know i've got enough i've already got i've got no dogs and you only have one perk sorry um i don't understand if it's a one percent job radiation signature oh there's a giant man next to me vaguely okay i'm coming it's me it's megatron across mine uh i need more ammo man you can get ammo the thing over here yeah more cash down [Applause] fire thing down [Applause] did you make it hey [Applause] that's fine did you survive bonk you did oh yeah tommy got me we have to kill megatron look where of megatron shoot him in the face yeah i mean i'll do something damage a hit to his head in the face i don't remember he's nearly dead oh god what's he doing he's immune there was a one-and-done type scenario right i'm completely out of ammo we'll come back to the ammo i just like that i'm gonna go build the pack-a-punch all right yeah well let's go together well okay yeah come down hold on i'm just trying to run away from these probably we have to do that in the other though yeah comes the anomaly i'm gonna go suck it up says i think we're going to the anomaly [Music] it's crazy right so how do we pack a book there's a megatron voice in here we should leave one zombie left and then we can try and get the upgrades i'm going to die here guys suck it need some assistance i think i don't know where you've gone minnie normally okay we've got that scene i know something's above us now look yeah because i had to run away because there was so many dogs in there i do mean dogs machines the machine heavy metal that's pack a punch [Music] that just sucks everyone on the map yeah you can you can come downstairs and upgrade your weapons it sounds like a laser beam now oh my god so many zombies yeah i'm outside i'm outside everything megatron bomber's dead we dropped something good keycard sentence what do you do with that keycard across fifteen thousand ammo mods see damage turn ally enemies and allies i've got the fire one we've got level one of the electric i've got the gold glowing shotgun nice there's the ammo armor thing okay my shirt comes really good can we upgrade our armor here that's what i'm trying to find over here i got surrounded then i mean i'm still getting i'm kind of i'm kind of take it to the bomb room tom apparently okay what's the bomb room hold on i'm dead yeah i got surrounded both [Applause] zombies on me at the moment oh god hopefully i don't hit a dead end well you've got enough money to open anything you got any grenades i've got some grenade oh he's done after a certain range in this they just seem to have zero ah there's not that many left i think we're okay i mean the squad it's lovely it looks like there's more spawning there it will be okay will we come zombies come not there we go are you back uh not yet oh yeah maybe that's not the end of the round there's one zombie left i think oh yeah right okay now stay down here stay down here apparently there's a there's a a room with a bombing or a new kin and you can put that card in somewhere tom okay i've lost my gun now and i need to get a new gun um we have to pack a punch this one today yeah i'm gonna pack a punch to the shotgun there we go massive damage increase it's all uh there's a car for the nuke well there's a picture of a helicopter with the radio so it says i think i've done it can we go through the anomaly yeah i just want to find this room it might be up here tom no that's outside that was it that was the right that was the wave [Music] probably the other way maybe let's say how many enemies are left i think come here [Applause] [Music] downstairs come downstairs done okay yeah i just once you go down and lose your pack upon this weapon though you just basically reset to zero because you lose all your perks and everything as well yeah i found the spot where we have to put the card in i think what it is if you if you use it you get like a secret weapon it looks like the gravity gun from half-life okay try again yeah i just need to make sure we go for revives because otherwise you just lose everything [Music] [Music] crazy no doubt create a class okay zombies loadouts yeah you get separate loadouts so i i think a knife would be good but you'd need to take that perk oh you can't tell that book frost blast oh two ethereum crystals of a i can't i don't think i've got a lot to level nine okay we'll save those yeah a lot of stuff's not really unlocked yet how do you can't yeah you can't take a knife you got your field upgrade and your assault rifle that's it maybe you can pick up oh there we go melee jack's not in our party for some reason what how do you do melee jet well you just have to go to the to the end scroll across and then to melee then i guess when you're in the game you buy a gun like you buy this bus 12. i'm going to try it i'm going to say level 13 for us yeah oh yeah i've got it unlocked i get what you mean because yes you can just get guns off the walls can't you so that's probably a better idea that means if you die you come back with no gun yeah that's no go and that's no gun found unless you could pick yours up um could you invite me for this oh yeah i can just join you sorry yeah uh skills i'm just saying i mean weapon classes they all start sub machine guns and then that's uh that's sad isn't it it's quite fun i'm enjoying it yeah there's a lot of there's some progression as well it's just that you can't um can't really do anything with it at the moment because you need to be quite leveled up to do it let's do it again right this time you know sort of what we're doing it's [Music] personal thank you for tuning in to the stream guys i hope you enjoyed it so far appreciate you everyone being here i know you probably tuned in and gone who are these noobs well yeah we are very new to zombies i mean i've seen a few videos from noah j and uh milo ruffle waffles so i know a little bit but you know i'm still learning it myself playing and watching is very different because you don't know the map you don't know where all the upgrades are which guns to get but why is everyone asking me to say baba booey i don't understand but we'll go there you go i said it bababoo whatever that means what's up aussie knife is op is that right phil hey matthew easter egg on megatron let him hit the mushrooms right i don't know what that means all right round two let's do this the bloody mess okay heal the zombies bounce all the zombies and fight the green light strike team happy holidays zombies so level 17. i can get the chopper gunner and everything zombie elimination dead man down knocked his you played a lot of the multiplayer then i played a little bit yeah i mean i've got mostly unlocks you played quite a lot that's what the war zone is that you want them for the war zone yeah content i like sniping sniping in the multiplayer is the only thing that i really like doing to be honest otherwise you just run around with an mp5 and then watch you play uh with an ak on it on a map with a tank and um you shot some grass i mean the visibility is not very good in the multiplayer it's just a play i think it's very i thought it was a man as well but it was like a head of you know like a what do they call them cat tail things i've uh just planted the explosives oops was it matthew hey lord did you buy the chat i don't i don't know what that means dave just fire up that king tiger you'll be fine yes uh four but the just the instant snipes was was just i was not found you can make that tank out there shoot that's that's one of the parts of the easter egg really it's a king tiger apparently is that right big dagger then war in it just looks like war to me we're gonna go towards the facility i don't know what's up here good graffiti like everything else in germany come to the explosive wall here is there a lot of graffiti in germany oh in all of europe this is the place guys we need to follow the purple arrows and come to the yeah well i've got any money there's a stamina up here sniping them up later i'm trying to becoming a bit gunny now it is isn't it i wonder like up to that level yeah right to the facility yeah there's another one here the faster we get it the easier it is just will we have enough points that's all how are your last ones about this now i hope not trial we don't need to do the trial do we i'm out of points now human left one alive we should really get the power on before we make any assumptions there's blood everywhere man we don't need to spend points to turn the power on do it now that you just push the button yeah to make bullets trigger random ammo mods let's accelerate and stabilize oh is it like a hybrid slider we're going through it doctor do you know you just farm them in here until we've got enough points it's quite a lot of high production quality in this house yeah right so ether tunnels upstairs i think i think it costs 500. like if they just release card zombies as a standalone like it would do really well yeah like free to play or something i'm you're making it towards that um even if it was just like 25 quid or something i would i would genuinely buy it over the whole package but maybe that maybe the fact that this is blocked quite blocked this way we need to go back out the way they're just floating and you kill them [Music] oh you guys go back outside i'm trying to go back through to finding the machine part i'll get through i swear one of the other zombies game wasn't there a number that showed you how many was alive or was that sniper elite i don't think this has ever had that hey think it costs 5.00 there's a mystery box here guys 9.50 i've unlocked that door there i've managed to get to the 8th tunnel area with him oh my god the floating tank playing dog oh no no no no taking us away yeah we're too slow are you not staying up forever all right [Music] then you have to kill enemies to reopen it uh mystery box is here for business i've got nothing's attacking me okay look that's too many now um ideal but we'll go for it oh that's useful ammo all right so yeah 25 kills to go back and reopen the anomaly [Music] does that mystery box stay there forever oh no it moves around the map fine are you gonna get some enemies it's like that here for me this slows down oh no that's anomaly found that's memory leak found as well i think this game's got i'm getting i'm most lagging slowly over time so we need to get back into the other and do the packer punch don't worry yeah you need to kill 25 people first [Applause] [Music] the uh indoor bit for a second 2500 yeah is that enough for the juggernog outside what's this here is that there's a bottle oh um yeah i know what that is so we get the we get the half-life gun and we suck it and then there's always sucking together we get the half-life and we suck that and then we put that in a pipe and then we have to get the zombie dogs and bring them over to it and then kill them and then it sucks their essence up and then produces an upgrade for the half-life gun oh it's so simple yeah well first of all i just want to get juggernog so we've got a bit of so this lag has made my screen permanently shake that's good [Music] [Applause] sound good yeah it's just just permanently [ __ ] all right we're getting back to anomaly yeah let's go you deserve that downstairs let's go yeah again we're going oh it's lagging again i wish you would also pick up stuff on the ground if you haven't got anything in our equipment slot become more shaky what speed cola is that reload faster i think so yeah i think so yeah that's we need that the lag is just causing my screen to shake why is it lagging on it's very odd i'm normalizing right here it is is this it so now we go up to the ather tunnel up there where the machine part is go baby let's go baby uh we might need money to unlock the doors though because it a wrong [ __ ] way i don't know which way it is uh this is wrong this is like a dead end of the earth come out here oh upstairs here we go yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 500 to go through though i don't have enough money i'm gonna all right get in there someone 500 quid in the machine park just one person within well you can both go on the machine parts on the other side i've got it right now we can place the machine but you can go back through the anomaly just hold it on it this is so weird let's ruin my game machine there we go how's the combat though sets things on fire it said oh my god right activate the machine my screen doesn't shake what's this shaking i don't know it's very strange why do you like shaking your stranger no [Music] slowest reload actually ever oh my god i've got lmd's but you can just completely reuse that tomorrow just keep keep using it pick it back up yeah our game is twerking so you have to have the weapon out and then you select it yeah there you go so i've done my shotgun here i've done i've done my lmg psychotropic thunder it's called now i got a terrible roll on the uh mystery box which just ruined me what we need to do is kill megatron get his card and then we can start building the secret weapon maybe i need to be knocked down or something to fix this because it's quite annoying okay oh towards the end of a round like there's not many zombies [Music] actually the worst oh wow so strange after this whoa whoa look at this zombie it's freaking out but it's just i got a window for chops hello paused it yeah sorry i'm trying to work out my games just get literally slowly getting more unplayably laggy as it goes on really annoying should turn some settings down see if that helps second yeah this is called zombies special task hey general kenobi hello there westy it's something to do my game lagged like the connection to the server lagged and then when when it unlocked i've now got a shaky screen whenever i run forward so i think maybe i need to go down or something what was it because i just changed some settings uh let's just fix it a bit maybe that reset the cache or whatever by changing the settings yeah i would like to flag the baby is this megatron might be something the megatron drops so now the second one did they count okay as long as it don't move it doesn't shake it's not like they constantly chase you and try and murder you should we try to getting you not down meme where are you uh upstairs yeah outside now we thought we just started the round unfortunately hold on could i just kill myself hold on let me try i'm jack there you go oh my god all right is that going to stop the shake get back into combat it's still shaking fortunate wow that's fine we'll just keep playing it's really annoying towards you this is um he's punched me he just one banged me calm down oh guys don't worry it looks like we get to restart anyway oh god this is horrible what is he it's just hell isn't he he's like a hazmat zombie or something i've got no upgraded weapon sadly because i just got i don't shake when i'm on the floor all right bonk all right how's it going yeah it's quite nice here it's all right weather's nice today isn't it yeah look at that sky yeah beautiful zombies are a problem though aren't they well that'll be that's just an occupational hazard you live out here in the in the zombie mountains let's see the sun okay i'm spectating tommy and the shake is it's tripled i have to punch my lmg there we go maybe it's for the best i think my shape will go megatron just came out of his little hole and just went yeah and just smashed me horrible well he punted me across the whole map yeah everybody don't go to me lady with megatron you would be late dude it's fine um do you guys want to do nice oh you haven't unlocked it ever no we can't disgusting slither off level six i'm going to upgrade my submachine guns yeah we're discussing i mean you probably want to friend us i'm going to use my i'm going to upgrade my smgs and i'm going to use apparently you can buy armor as well i didn't even know where you can do that where'd you buy the armor is that the crafting bench outside um no it's it's in so where the anomaly is you go up the stairs and then left if you were leaving walking away from the the central well the pack and punch machine to start the pack-a-punch machine turn away up the stairs i don't know what you're saying i'm already lost all the way around the corner and then it's a simple right the left then right again and then it's actually really close to the back of bumps right oh you can upgrade your um perks as well i didn't realize that where'd you do that uh skills field upgrades so well and you create any loadout click skills field upgrade uh skills perks and you can upgrade juggernog and speed cola uh you could revive stamina okay yeah i've upgraded my ring of fire but you're object pretty [ __ ] go upgrade the ring of fire only private guy what's the dead ops by the way what's that about no idea i'm wearing mods yeah there is some progression like you said tom

that so we got a donation from mind scrambler thank you if you have any questions i'm on the geeky pastimes discord thank you mind we're just kind of learning it ccv thanks for the five nw thank you maxi thank you for becoming a new member hey emily how you doing good morning from m.a welcome back emily good to see you you're an er nurse so you need some entertainment good for you hit tweak thank you for the one right try and do better this time actual stretch team is on the ground it's time to continue what did you get tom what did you say oh this is mutual animosity blueprint isn't it it's cool oh the uzi yeah that is kind of cool well it's the only thing i've not great at the moment because you're low level so basically just might as well yeah stop shooting i like chicken if you get more money for me this place is the cause of the outbreaks we're encountering better get inside and solve this case for the game's size my team can handle this they'll explore the site and find the entrance oscar thank you for the five would love to see a bit of how the panoramic has affected the gaming industry oscar the gaming industry i think in general is like i know it's kind of bittersweet but it's benefited from it loads more people are playing games of watching games on youtube and twitch i think working from home for a lot of game studios has actually been quite a i don't want to say smooth transition but from what i know about the industry uh some game dev teams have actually said that they're more efficient now because they're at home they've got all their equipment there or their own equipment which is better and you know they're happier working from home so i think the gaming industry has been fine with it it'll all be over in in 12 months or so i reckon you know whenever when we get wide distribution of vaccines and all that stuff but it's so it's definitely changed the world forever i think a lot of companies are gonna just say to their employees hey you know what if you want to just work from home from now on vaccine or not you can there's a lot of people are happier working from home we'll see it's going to be uh really interesting how it changes the world this one no no no there's no time there's no time folding them no time to explain why i've got no time to explain this one here yeah yeah yeah who's clicking can i hear now is it jackson no no i'll be because i was quite aggressively pressing me lately i've heard of the whole stream i just wondered why i can hear it now and not before uh there's a mystery box down here is it just what i'm doing this is when you move uh yeah yeah they're pretty much so i was just wondering why i thought maybe you were from constant transmission or something you shouldn't be able to i mean the game's pretty loud yes i'm talking it doesn't transmit but i'm using my keyboard what's up joey how you doing mr know it all there you go i mean that's a good example there i work from home for america's largest insurance company we're saving so much money by doing this yeah that's it isn't it i think one of the big things as well especially for big businesses like huge corporate stuff is that you know maybe they realize you know what we don't need to rent this really expensive office and have fancy furniture and wine and dine people don't agree you can hear that judging from the creatures transformation yes you know i just guess your voice from my perspective it's been it's been nice because i like going to events i like meeting people and seeing people in real life and you know going to capture events and traveling but what's been really nice this year is that i've been able to do that from home so we've had lots of remote events where you know if there's an early game to play like assassin's creed valhalla or watch dogs legion or even call of duty black ops instead of me having to get on a plane and fly 9 or 10 hours to america and then just really stress myself out and be tired and then have to fly back a couple days later i've just been able to do it from home and it's great because i've got all my recording equipment here i'm not stressed out i'm not tired and that's better for me zombie melee there's more at the top here guys i'm just meleeing all these guys down here oh there's loads up here the tunnel counts me oh my god that's happening ah there you go award station claim reward and also that kind of thing is much cheaper for the companies as well because they don't usually they pay for the plane tickets in the hotel they rent the space so it's a lot cheaper for them too the game publishers um maybe it's it's i think it's an individual thing because i have not got a reward oh i got a monkey i didn't have a knife i was ruined hmm no there's a rule for me we need to go into the actual meme station now we do all right this way in it we've got a lot of points now well the silencer tom let's all stick together because this is not armored or anything yet oh turn on the power first i'll open this door oh my lords turn it on the accelerator is being stabilized i've been enabled there's a terminal because one zombie alive here we need but if you pack a punch like a higher tier weapon and it just looks right here i thought that's no you could have a quick gold you can tear up the weapon on the upgrade bin that area with the armor as well well we're going in little krieg was good that i had found oh the mystery box can have like two goods yeah yeah reuben thank you for becoming a member hey jack what's up all right but so we gotta go upstairs i've got this upgrade on the right there the reload upgrade i'll get it i want the juggernog right here look right on it this is the juggernog here it takes so much to kill them now even just one banger with a knife i haven't got a knife jack i've got a 47. it's kind of weird isn't it how that like why does the knife want it killed all right very helpful i've created the sucker job where it's cool [Music] purple crystals on the ground what do they do well they're ethereum what happened malfunction systems are showing residue oh dear you didn't go through the portal oh did you and then my then we go down to the what's this go downstairs why are you waiting up here because i want to get that spas 12. i need points oh two that needs money yeah i've got some here as well i think i need 2 500. [Music] you deserve that satisfying now you can upgrade your tiers on the weapon here as well sorry from here you have to keep buying the armor thing again i'm sure that i've seen videos where people like their armor plates drop on the ground like a radioactive specimen is moving towards you yeah then some of the enemies dropped radiation levels are through the roof that thing's practically a walking atom zombie threat neutralized did you see that the chemical megatrons appear with me you must oh god she i'm down damn it no oh it's the clock no jack that's right it's the jacket at the top outside you said well you suck away yeah i mean i killed a lot of the zombies but megatron's out here so i gotta walk all going all the way around oh nice nice uh he's on like half hp coming it's i'm gonna it's quite a long way around yeah you might might just make it get the juggernog as well jet megatron cheats oh god he's coming quick oh my god he's megan oh it's gonna be so close just get him let's go for him i'll award slide slide oh god that was really close he's coming unfortunately all right kill everyone thank you hey is he firing green so fast okay now he splits yeah now come on just keep running keep running stim actually zama up here isn't it i need to go pack a punch this i think as soon as possible i got the card zac you got the key card okay good what do we do with it we need to go to the room with where the big nuke is downstairs in the facility oh yeah i think well i know i've seen it yeah yeah i know of it uh how do we get these crystals it's crystals isn't it do we go together let's go together downstairs where's jack okay you need a stem is this some kind of red wrong way isn't it yeah you've got i didn't know you were going wrong way but i i didn't want to be insubordinate back in range it's like a big um a big bomb hanging in the sky i know they just come out of nowhere and just ruin you well they literally pop out the walls really turn here hold me he's okay mr bond don't worry don't worry check it out i'm glitched on the stairs texas please check i'm sorry this is what i can do it's all on tom tell me i'm trying i'm coming i'm just trying to win the round time just trying around yes you got a nice gun there oh no oh no no no no i need a medic there's no way out i thought it was the the way you go left and right get outside i was trying to try and get you guys yeah that was a careless death from me oh you sleep edits into the desert you let us into a horrible room of i don't know the map so i'm like just running around trying to find this place where you put the stream i think if you go back to the anomaly it's easier to find it from there like it's just a room off the anomaly room we need ruffle waffles suppose not [Laughter] available this is great thanks man i hope you're enjoying it you can't run down the corridors when a new wave is starting is that where you just get ruined either like that i've upgraded my frost blast as well although it's a bit nap anyway again another one i've got tier one speed color and tier two juggernog yeah i should have upgraded those oh it's not really messed up that's permanent upgrades on your account isn't it yeah yeah that's it that's just i think we did i mean we don't buy the first round just stick next to the machine really and uh keep going in and out of it i got a really good steer weapon from the pack-a-punch first game they're the mystery box first game though then i pack a punch that so it was a tier five pack of punches instantly it's it's the only round i've managed to do that so far must get to the nuke yeah i think so yeah all right repairing armor is number one priority i'm saying yeah yeah we keep just letting armor destroy and that's it i should not be surprised that and the juggernog obviously just so that you got more survivability around the globe of course it comes back to this facility is in the chat what's up pam how you and jim doing are the kids good to see you i hope that that art gallery you wanted to open was a success what do you mean why just because jack just knifes everything that you used to build that's green oh that's the blue i don't know what the blue is that's what i'm that's why i don't know it is it's going out hey diva this is the same thing different rarity yeah i think it i think it's yeah i think green's common etcetera right just keep let's go through the purple let's follow the purple brick road then guys follow the purple brick road follow the fall someone smashed this through the explosives oh yeah oh that's good for me let's there is a mystery box oh nice i blew that up but i can't afford that the mystery box that you have to go [Music] it's a random one isn't it i heard the rumors of the research that transpired uh uh here so this is where you put the key card in here i'll try and make sure to grab it and i'll do that like that we need to go to the machine [Applause] i think the building of the barricades can be removed yeah it seems arbitrary it doesn't matter it's not it's not like something that you actually do or worry about on this one world at war right you want me to do the challenge the trial do what we get or just leave it i think we could drive might as well all right rebuild oh we've just had carpenter oh we've just got carpenters that's a joke it's gone because we've got also it's it's rebuildable yeah so it's completely pointless it's good i'll send that challenge goodbye let's just leave it we don't have to do it let's just need to blow up the uh this bit got an obstruction here i've got enough money honestly i think there's a power button oh i can't get through this vlog tyson zombie testies have you seen that ninja game where you pretty much like do that yeah you tried that no i'm sorry i'm sorry i need money to go through the power guys where are you guys are you trying to do them rebuilding the things i'll press this terminal that's slightly better then you could go and get someone i think what the hell is that what the hell is that i think it is um oh it's 500 scrap to do the armor [Applause] yeah i've got one shall we go through the anomaly jack oh let's do it yeah that is travis space and time time hey kevin am i a real boy yes i am kevin this let's go upstairs and get the mean yeah the machine part otherwise it runs out of time and we're in this isn't the way it is faster than that i think it's this way it's outside tom yeah yeah yeah at the top somewhere let's get back to the way and we came the ether tunnel yeah get that go there you get the machine part i'm going all right here we go this is horrible i like it i've got i've got no way to kill yeah you go pop the machine part in i'll do it i think there's time here you go um machine parts in five grand like punch isn't it yeah i need a little bit more yeah the wonder weapon is what it's called the big the big thing wonderful i got signal lock on just hang around this room do a nice circuit information suggests they traveled beyond our diameter again are you killed last time jack if you recall let's all stick together why are you just staying down here and next to the back of the box and upgrading our goals cause that guns are terrible very good thank you [Music] yeah go get your armors guys you must have enough scrap now [Music] radioactive radio megatron here yeah oh yeah i don't think this is a good area to fire though isn't it no no run outside on your own staying here together we'll be all right [Applause] beautiful that zombo is found too happy just touched it where is he i haven't seen him yet oh god you've seen you i don't want him to see me go away i'm sick of megatron all right an excel window open strike team call it in if you need to bug out oh make a ton not megatron yeah but we call him megatron that's fine how strange is [Music] off the ground i thought it was just an extra armor slightly to get that's the that's not the right rule that's level one armor found are you going to it tom the the meme yeah the ui i can't [ __ ] deal i've got two pack of punch guns now so i'm all right let's go to the yeah let's go together is it oh no no no this one with me you're purple yeah come with me come with me yes come with me i'll get lost in this place because it all just looks the same oh i am here yes no windows i'll let you know when the next one's available and then you get that and then what we do with that is we go back to the stein area all right well let's go up this way then hold the zombie still everywhere i'm down oh no i'm is [Applause] oh that's so annoying so is that hosted on your connection then yeah it must be what's this private private meme is it we just got the uh the key card as well yeah i tried to turn after you but because they've spawned in the room between us they just all turned around and sandwiched me doing the train that was after me ruined that's fully crushed my game is really freaked out it's actually a night yeah well i think that was a good run there yeah i had my best guns there the two pack of punch guns were good so many zombies yeah that's completely crashed my game yeah it must be a local host then but yeah no no it's classic no no no error just it's gone and ruined andrew no it's not branson it was just a game crash but because it's hosted on my connection i guess it just uh did crash your game as well bong nope no i just waited it did it took me the big boy yeah that was fun i was enjoying that i felt like we had a good uh good thing going then yeah now enough that i could have got time up as well unlocked shotguns on the uh weapons which is nice i have to pay respects yes it's interesting like you want to play another round back home yeah yeah uh like noah j and geeky pastimes they were the first people who did the easter egg and completed it uh it took him two hours and 45 minutes to do it the first time well they worked out so yeah yes um and that's not very long it usually takes days it's the main easter egg is quite straightforward because it guides you a lot but what's interesting is that now people are doing it in 20 minutes so once you start it it gives you sort of it sort of shows you what you need to do right it holds your hand a lot yeah but there are lots of other side easter eggs in this that people haven't figured out yet i quite like their hand solds because i don't like that you can't complete it unless you're absolutely mad on this usually yeah but the bit we're doing isn't the easter egg just to be clear yeah but the bit with the key card is the easter egg oh okay see all this classified stuff if you go to challenges and dark ops that's all the easter eggs there's loads um invited bong i can't see you online jack i can join nothing herschel the dark ops lost connection to host equipment kill 100 to the mystery box oh yeah yeah requiem intel dark intel fuel spectral reflections hmm d-pad so is zombies good for leveling up guns in cold war yeah it is you can level up stuff in this it's got cross progression so if you didn't really like the multiplayer but you wanted to level up your guns for war zone you could do it in zombies i don't know how fast it is but it's an option i guess hey potato assassin's creed when um i don't think i'm going to play anymore with sasuke on youtube potato but it's really fun you know i've done quite a few videos on it already i enjoy that game a lot uh brad thank you for the five that's very kind to you i appreciate that how you doing man the rap was hella funny you're on about the battlefield versus cod rap michael you finished the easter egg yourself good for you man that's awesome warzone versus bf5 now i think the next if i ever do anything like that again it will be when there's a good battlefield game and a good card game released at the same time because that's when it's most interesting you've got a green light strike team happy hunting what's up canyon how you doing my real name is jack giuseppe campaign is worth it the campaign's good but it's only three hours thomas it's really short it had some cool moments in it jack is cold war better than modern warfare i prefer modern warfare the cobras hey jake what's up fat bernie what's up martin new round new look you got it can you use the tomahawk yeah although i've got the knife at the moment what's up tom just gotta do my sayings it didn't save any of myself right i think so i'm gonna redo them again yeah probably because it crashed it didn't something's gone i've until about the sixth round no it's around 15. someone said on my channel [Music] so can you get anything that just makes you swing faster some sort of i guess you could pack and punch the knife right science project correct slashes can be traced back here find a way in team can i just let you guys get some points then i don't know level 17 you get the knife there's a nuke there it looks just like a little mini nuke gosh that's very kind you man thank you been watching since bf1 the f1 is really good man i went back to it recently i've been playing it are you ruined tom murdering zombies okay probably do this one here done let's go let's go let's go i'm really glad that zombies aren't real i wish they were i you know i want them to be here after that um the overlords preview thing we went to i too wish that they would be employed as waiters overlords yeah oh yeah i remember that yeah there was some nice zombie waiters that would bring around brain cocktails and stuff so i believe with horses aren't actually blurred but they wouldn't tell me they wouldn't break characters i was like look i'm vegetarian is it blood or not is that what they were doing yeah yeah uh i don't get this past 12 the jaguar covert so you get the packer points and you get the fire tom that's gg that's gg we're just gonna pretend that's not even i need to reload for this studio yeah speed cola whatever power i can see why people like this that way i wasn't sure but some people just literally only play zombies i mean that's very good i just found an epic sulphur mile on the ground epic self rest that's cool yeah just got it so you can actually get some of the more warzone upgrades should we do a trial or are we just going to mince through power in stopping power why is that spas again it's upstairs it's out on the side of the plane yeah you need one oh yeah i got it we're all getting it i've got it's team spaz 12 then yeah if you go prone here you get some more cash so what someone said go pro in here and you can get some cash you get it ripped because mine's um no i don't use left control by default [Music] i like the silence nature of this shotgun that's a silenced at all and it's the default one that i just bought gallo sa-12 well certainly mine isn't kill enemies okay murder haven't spent no one here well they're coming eventually yeah i think you should start that like at the start around well i didn't know no no we're just in experience sorry we don't just saying in the future that could be really good oh it's nothing because if you wanted zombie crawling somewhere they're coming now challenge we've got a common reward you've got to kill quite a few really to get a better reward let's get out of it that's good we've got enough to get the machine means now okay oh of course because it's four players that yeah so there's a shotgun there it's terrible [Music] need someone to open the power door jack you got the most money [Music] is activated then we go into the suck zone and we find the uh enter the suck zone the egg [Music] sorry that's the fastest you like an assist yeah nice uh are we going in zombie elimination hey tim thanks for the five what size

deadly area to be getting in where is that here it is okay so you turn that on okay now we need a zombie train guys we need a zombie train do you want to collect their holes their holes collect their souls and then they get sucked into this machine you need to come downstairs we're trapped japan we need to come down need to keep sucking sucking the zombies off i don't know where to go man i don't know where right okay so that cools down we didn't do it that time because we didn't get enough zombies bring them in as a group yeah because the more if you have three trains going i end up going to the back of your train and get a full thomas train within a trip get thomas it's just horrible out here oh [ __ ] oh that's the one thing we didn't want to clean yeah it's all right it's a new round and it's uh outside jack and then we train them out here and we all go together we don't shoot them it's lovely what do we want to do can i repair my armor at this station here i don't know i need a laughing headset sitting there trying to like beyonce this is perfect no you can buy a slumber vibe there guys you've got the right idea son all right no don't don't hit them leave them alone to be

armor guys the way you found the materials to do that i mean i feel like a million zombies with this gun too i can't pack a bunch of diamonds yeah you have to do the easter eggs what's the point of going into the sap zone now then and what would it do for us uh i don't know you you do the easter eggs you get upgrades then you can export what's the next stage i feel like we can do it should we just try and get your next package right with 15 grams apparently you can charge the suck thumb wow i'm stuck in the bloody menu toxic so this i guess is i'm going into the dark yeah i'm going actually no i should upgrade my gun first shouldn't i i want to upgrade my spaz to a new i've got an ammo for the die shot i want to go into the dark either what's that a kgb video tape what yeah

somewhere apparently what are you talking about yeah i'd be deadly serious give it to the ghost how do we get to jack uh unsuck what didn't it there's jellyfish flying around out here and ghosts this is horrible down here i had a great time yeah i think that's like let's just like cover jack oh my god you've done it you've only gone on you've only gone done it i'm using the suck zone or something it's very slow oh armor plates yes that's good oh no no no one of those guys the um the juggernaut you can break their purple crystals to get essence like our strike team found part of a device any idea what it the other is welcome to the sup zone that's so weird but it just absorbs zombies yeah you just suck them through we've nearly got 15k well i've got i've upgraded oh you've got it next is 30k what's the next part of the look if you've got an objective over to the left oh yeah i've got any perks mckenzie and come to me tom you can suck this over here look flag the fleshy i'm coming but i don't want to get trapped in here jack look see that yellow thing there tom could be useful i mean can you just look behind him that's a problem that's a problem that's how you get the upgrades just did it right now we need to go and put that in a wall somewhere and then kill the dogs next to it what's that right that makes okay yes well i don't it's downstairs somewhere are you guys gonna get your upgrades you should go find your more more armored daddy [Applause] the mystery box and get you get you guys [Applause] another instant kill because i can use my terrible aches okay it's me in the mystery box where did i figure out what to do with the knicks [Music] wait i sucked a canister though as well yeah yeah if you see a zombie don't kill him because i think maybe we're okay leave him leave him leave that zombie so we can have a little explore for a second yeah is everybody kill it's relaxed uh armored upgrades are down here aren't they that's a fast survive until yeah it's really fun bugsy it's a great game mode okay there's one zombie nearest tom yeah he's all right he's here is that max hell okay i've maxed out my chisel you want to use the mystery box over here 20 grand jack buddy okay i'm going to come and see if i can upgrade stuff on the table as well i've got fast hands quick revive and jugger yeah and then it's a really good one if you've got like obviously the shotgun is not really that good but by the by the top door uh over here it's like each bullet fires a random elemental effect right so you can't remove those i don't know where you put this kind of straight [Music] oh it says you can freeze and shatter these weapon crates oh no i don't want to freeze you oh no i might have killed a zombie guys i know sorry which weapon crates there's a weapon crate and apparently i can freeze and shatter it i've got a freezer are you trying to do the easter egg what's going on i'm looking for this do you want me to start i've got the kind of stuff i've got it here so you want me to start yeah okay so if you what what we need to do is when the dogs come we need to kill the dogs in here and then it'll drop up the thing and then you can upgrade just the deadshot crew at the deadshot daiquiri [Applause] he don't like you should we kill him i need to get juggernaut because i i went down didn't i yeah it's outside you ever got enough money for it you'd kill the zombie to get it oh god okay let's kill them let's kill them outside then the next wave outside 20 is a dog wave right i think so yeah it's easier to kill him out here right uh here it is go to the roof and shoot the box with the gun what what what i don't know what it is i'm just gonna sort of do my best to just suck as many things that's megatron dead [Music] that's megatron when you said megatron was dead you mean he's very much alive at last i'm sure i killed him unless there's two there's two i mean it's really split the dogs are here we need don't kill the dogs there's two there's two real megan [Music] give i didn't mean to do that i don't know what have you done teleported underground on there can you teleport back up and can we get me uh [ __ ] [ __ ] i think i'm dead okay [Music] [Music] i wish you can cancel [Music] the suck isn't uh he's like a question mark here what's this kill the man kill the man kill the man now he's gonna blow the man down oh he's he's real look i want to leave this area i hate this area behind you oh god why are there so many of them i just do it they're just a basic enemy now i got some stuff okay that's probably easter as well i've got the fuse you got a fuse yeah fuse right so the dog wave so and and i need to suck more or what what's going on you can suck a zombie if you want to should we go into the ethereum world is that something we should be doing hmm um zombies yeah we need the dog wave is what we need we i don't think i think that's like is it random i'm in the um the main room now we just got one dog then i think zach got excited yeah it was just one dog additional parts required full carpet is good for your armor there is somewhere that you put a fuse as well oh tom come here come here move on my waypoint where's here downstairs in the machine room i pinged it okay i'm coming i'm coming there's a lot of babies [Applause] i'm downstairs zombies is that anything happening tom no maybe i would like to skip the head down i mean this is quite good this bit down here you can kind of play as long as we stick together yeah because if you cut them onto each other you're ruined yeah maybe you need an upgrade to shoot that team got another extra window how do i prepare to get my armor back there's our station yeah it's important to do that right uh top of your maximum yeah yeah yeah i need 30 grand for the next stack of months uh yeah i'm down down to five you need to do some steps first you need the crystals for that one oh my god end stage approval letter ultra oh oh um i think we can continue the story a bit here okay yeah if we go into the we need to go into the other okay let's do that let's just blot it out yeah how do we not do this round i don't know what's the storybook meme we need to go into the other ether at the moment the thing to activate isn't here though is that because it's every 10 rounds or whatever also upgrade it at the oh this is bad can you also upgrade it at the upgrade station i'm getting in a mess here dirt completely dead penthouse i don't know where that is speed cola do i not have speed cola yeah i've already got speed cola repair your armor jack quick uh where was it there's a box here fantastic right loads i want 30 grand okay i want but should we go to the ether then jack lead us yeah but i don't think we can do it this round though what can't we do because usually it's in here isn't it where you travel to the garrett says using the dye gun blast the wooden box off the top of knacks at first i don't know what knacked it is oh this is blake dogs around should we go to do we go to the dog area jack yeah it's underneath somewhere the dog i remember where it is don't you've got to remember use your brain just keep crying you've just gone around in a second i mean i've got so kill some of them oh that goes outside i mean i got i don't know where i'm going oh shut the door it's inside yeah yeah it's inside like downstairs somewhere under the nuke room isn't it yes yeah okay i'm in the new room i'm going under underneath yeah and then there's um and what you have to do there's like a drip on the wall and what do you do with it just kill dogs near it the dog's training me here it is tom come here come here we need to kill dogs here kill the dogs kill the dog and then they get sucked into that see oh yeah that's lovely i think that's enough yeah so now have you got an option for that gun this is i think maybe it's automatically done it don't know can you change like modes on it or anything uh i have no idea i don't know it can suck now go up near jug yeah we need to yeah that's it we need to take the canister and put it okay do the juggernaut they're coming they're coming [Music] okay near jug and then what uh there's like a little it's a place that you installed it i think okay go to the main area box is covered in vines you need to find the box it's the boy the boys here point and you can install the upgrade i think did you do it there's no there's nothing there's no button on it already no you have to shoot it maybe i don't know shoot it okay yeah you shoot it with the with the suck [Music] there's too many enemies here okay okay thank you use bullets yeah you have to use bullets yeah let's go he's gonna split oh switch to die number five yeah there you go you got it now you

can't i can't do anybody damage no that was really fun though i enjoyed that a lot we got level 20 which is you can extract it that can't you yeah well you can extract it 10 or 20. um never mind oh god oh god oh god okay that sounds great i'm going to end there guys uh thank you for playing that was really fun that's good so if you want to go check out these guys over on twitch to angry gamers tv go check them out there's two of us it's like games i know i'm not giving up until the fat lady seems long and that's tommy not giving up until the fat lady sings there he is well guys thank you so much for watching uh this was really fun i enjoyed this a lot i think we might have another attempt in the future where you know we learned the easter egg properly and try and do it i think that could be really good but um yeah apparently you guys like watching this we had like 10 000 viewers there zombies is fun i just hope that they add more maps down the line you know because just that one map is uh i feel like once you've done it and you've done the easter egg there's not really much point to keep playing it unless you get like all the side easter egg stuff right so there we go can't connect to card for some reason are we in yeah and uh once again big thanks to nvidia for sponsoring this one as i said at the start we were playing at 4k 120 hertz with all the settings on high apart from this one that just stays on low i don't know what's wrong with it it's broken um cold wood does have some ray tracing effects shadows in particular they look really nice especially in the campaign and also we had um the lss turned on basically means that you get better performance but the image quality is still good uses ai it's really smart anyways um if you enjoyed this guys hit that
