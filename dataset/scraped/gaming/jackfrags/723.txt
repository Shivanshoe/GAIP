hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some more call of duty war zone today we will be playing solos but there's a bit of a twist i know recently there's been a bit of a debate a discussion in the cod community about whether call of duty war zone has something that they call skill based matchmaking and this debate has arisen because some people feel like a lot of the games that they're getting in now after the third week are really challenging really sweaty as it's called and for some people that takes the fun out of the game for others they kind of like it because it's more of a challenge i honestly don't know if it's in the game or not i've got no definitive answers to that question and i don't think we've had any official statement about it or anything like that but i wanted to just see for myself based on my experience playing the game on a new free-to-play account is it actually easier do i get more kills on a brand new account am i encountering higher level players who are maybe employing different tactics and more advanced strategies against me or is it always just a random mix honestly i don't know but what i wanted to do today was just play for a few hours and and see how it goes so without further ado we're going to queue into a game this is a brand new account i haven't played any matches on this but i can't even edit my loadouts just to prove that this is all new i've got nothing guys i've got absolutely nothing no operators just the you know the basic ones that you start with haven't even bought the season pass i think there is like a free version of the season pass as well but yeah i've got nothing zero zilch so we're gonna queue up for some br and see what happens should be good fun so at the moment this is a live stream so i can see you guys in the chat thank you for coming along and if you're watching it as a vod afterwards as a video i appreciate you thank you for tuning in it's gonna be fun i'm really interested to see how this goes okay so we've got a mix of players already lots of playstation we had a few xbox players there i just realized i need to cue solos rather than squads so nearly i nearly made my first mistake there didn't i but in that particular lobby yeah there was a lot of console players and some pc players in there too hello underdog how you doing what's up michael basotti fabian hey sam okay so nice mix of players here too i think that was mostly console to be honest from that initial just scroll down there i didn't have time to check the entire lobby but that looked like a lot of console players obviously i'm playing on pc but this game does have cross-platform between all three platforms that it's on what's up hello bella goal from saxony what's up because i'm batman hello peter jarrett daniel zariano what's up how's it going guys thank you for tuning in i really appreciate you guys being here so i did a little warm-up earlier in the day i was leveling up mp5 class on my main account because i wanted to see how how viable the mp5 is in warzone because obviously in in multiplayer the mp5 is just it dominates it's so good but in warzone i don't know because you know it's an sng it doesn't have the initial damage potential over range at least as something like the m4 [Applause] and because you've got armor on top you know could could be quite a big deal but let's get this first game on the go and see how we do right then so we got what i was upside down there okay got a very north western zone here it's probably going to end up around middle base or dumb and where should we drop i don't want to go somewhere that's too hot because i want to loot up a little bit obviously with this being a new account as well i don't have any of my loadout stuff i've got none of it uh deepak thank you for the 40. i appreciate that man hello larry smellman how are you doing great name what's up zachary ultra links [Music] matt baume what's up i appreciate you too man so i reckon go west of the airport eric e thank you for the two eric said what was the first cod that you played oh man i it was the first call of duty on pc the one that was where you were playing as the americans in france would say i don't really know this top area very well i don't often come to the uh airport terminal here i can't stand these mgs either like i just don't like the machine guns in this game so slow like the uh the crosshair on them too like the iron sights because you've got that big i guess it's a rangefinder isn't it it's an old-school rangefinder on the left it confuses you anyways don't have to worry about that for now because we've got ourselves an m13 and the m13 is one of my favorite guns in the game uh nicholas thank you for the 50. you've been following since my sony vegas tutorial and that was a long long time ago bro uh pulse thank you for the five do you have any videos with brandon and matt yeah you mean x factor and timmy oh yeah we played some of this i'll get down there well this is a cool room like i've never even been in this room before there's still areas of the map that i've not been to you know i'm gonna set the rpg rpg is so strong right now on armor plate here does this go around yeah it does [Music] and here's someone above me [Applause] definitely someone in the terminal right above me should have the advantage if i go in a one-on-one here because i've got that stopping power it's not just right here [Applause] i think they just killed that dude there all right it's been quite methodical here trying to clear this off [Applause] he's still in there oh that guy gonna try and boot me [Applause] watch out for the helicopter please don't land on me i thought i was in trouble there that money all right and then we'll go back in see if we can finish this mission off guys we just unlocked the support helo unbelievable i don't believe it and the uav what year is it another stopping power put it in this aka why not we got a new member nicholas thank you for becoming a new member and mike bates thank you for the five that guy got an rpg in the face didn't he he really did i ran out of ammo but rpg does the job if you shoot him in the head with it move to the next location we've got 14 thousand two hundred dollars here guys fourteen thousand two hundred what's up morningstar thank you for streaming the game keeping my head during all the madness in the world yeah no problem i think during april i'm gonna stream a lot on youtube i'm gonna do a lot of streaming on youtube in april there's a dude in here i just saw him on the mini map see that stopping power is just so good i mean that guy was low though he must have been no armor i love this area it's cool right the detail in this map is mad primary objective accomplished all supply boxes considering it's 150 players i do wonder though i remember were rumors about 200 players do you guys remember that i think it was one of the gaming press websites they did a preview on this game and wow he scared me that was like a horror game they did a preview on this game and they were talking about 200 players per game and originally i think it was just for groundwater like that that never happened because ground war is um radar in the air how many players is ground war 100 64 64 isn't it i actually get this guy he's absolutely lasered me there i wonder if that guy had stopping power maybe uh kerwin thank you for becoming a member i do wonder at some point though will they do 200 players on this but they do more could they do 300 double the player count maybe that would be too many players for the size of the map hm thorne jack what do you think about modern warfare 2 remastered well i saw a trailer that had been released on the internet today like apparently it was um it was leaked somehow but i'm pretty hyped you know it looks real i don't think there's been an official announcement yet but yeah i think i'll definitely play it capture the objective [Applause] are we going without stun [Applause] [Music] where were they that guy just give me that i don't know thank you again cohen uh should i go for that loadout i mean that's right on the edge of the map ralph lopez said they said they're doing four and five player 200 lobbies is that true ralph can you imagine if they did four player squads with 200 players on this map that'd be crazy nicholas said how do you feel about the increased price of loadout drop should it be more or less so recently they increased the price of the loadouts to 8 500 i think that's good because i think loadout should be a little bit more expensive but maybe there should be a bit more expensive than that maybe like 12k 10k 12k because it's so easy to get 8500 there's actually someone over there now would this be in a new account i don't know what loadouts this will give me i'd like ow i've not like unlocked anything there was a guy just camping that's cool so first game we came 44th i mean that guy seemed quite competent he's got a custom load out here that's a pretty decked out m4 this guy's level 89 so it would seem unreasonable to match someone who just started the game with a level 89 [Laughter] let's see how the next game goes yeah but i definitely think loadout should be a bit more expensive like 10 or 12k [Applause] one what the hell was that effect tier one boys we're tier one now uh peter thank you for the two all right round number two uh jeremy g thank you for the 20 man that's very kind to you thanks for your streaming during this crazy time love the content and i wish i was at least half as good as you well jeremy i just got killed and came 44th so probably all better than me and jm11 said they're making duos is that true uh chris crosby these streams give me life as a uni student which is better call of duty blackout or war zone i definitely prefer warzone to blackout gregor i played a lot of blackout when it came out but it quickly dropped off for me i didn't like the time to kill it i thought it was too long and i like this because it introduces a lot of new mechanics to battle royale like the gulag like the loadouts the contract system this is more sandbox than blackout was i think it feels that way to me anyway we'll be deployed soon what's up potato aim how you doing hello one two one nicholas remember maverick's proving grounds yeah that was supposed to be a lot of players wasn't it uh tim thank you for the two best most chill stream on youtube [Applause] some crazy person shooting at me on that roof can we hunt any ducks here what is that is that a person that looks so weird like that guy's high level because he's got that uh he's got that ghost character model unless they bought it i know you can you can just buy those skins straight away what's my favorite gun in warzone my favorite gun in war zone is mp7 [Music] hello my staffer how are you doing what's up ismail what's up brothers do i think the armor mechanic can be improved i don't mind it the way it is phil i think it's okay the only thing i'd like to see is if you've if you've got like uh you see down here the blue bits if you were like 80 on a blue bar and you use an armor plate i think it should give you 100 of a new bar from where you were so you don't just waste a plate to get 20 back if you see what i mean [Music] i don't know where to go i feel like somewhere hot would be quite fun but it's risky let's do it let's even get some action i think this is going to be really hot give me a good gun oh no sniper all right [Applause] do snipers kind of there you are i not hated a suppressed weapon in this game it's in warzone having a suppressor actually takes you off the minimap when you shoot whereas in the main game as far as i'm aware it doesn't but it's really valuable to have a suppressor in warzone at least i don't think anyone's been in here [Applause] there's the mp7 eagle yeah they put the deagle in war zone now too olympus thank you for the two such a cool area this like a a drone that's crushed a laptop what secrets do you hold laptop uh sebastian thank you for the two jack binault thank you for the turn massive fan been watching a few years fellow midlands guy i don't know that place jack no sorry [Applause] the gap with this mp7 someone in here i think this area is really rough so campy i think they're in that plane there maybe they just moved went to the buy station [Applause] have a look now we're good did that guy see me i push i was shot in the back as well then that sucks i was just getting absolutely hammered in the back then [Applause] should have killed him though etta thank you for becoming a new member it's very kind to you chris r said there's a laptop in military base that gives you free ammo what no way i've not seen that marco what are my graphics settings i play mostly on normal and high on pc you're up next mate get ready uh my sensitivity is nine 400 dpi well there listen up soldier win here i've got the deal [Applause] autumn my friend says ax50 sniper is really good yeah the x50 is good i prefer the hdr though i wish i didn't have that mission i don't really want to go back to the boneyard because it's so messy storage town's gonna be looted someone's over there people fighting there hmm maybe you're at hospital i i wanted a mission really but i've got to wait for that one to time out now at least that's a uh you're having a laugh you are absolutely having a laugh was he on the roof the whole time i did not see that guy that's crazy all right so that's second game 35th i think that was but didn't feel like 35th uh chad thank you for becoming a new member nicholas where would you recommend finding friends to play with discord maybe nicholas look for some modern warfare discord communities there's a lot of nice people out there looking for squads maybe on the cod warzone reddit as well that could be good hello james what how you doing ida marcusen please tell me why i like so much after the new update i don't honestly i don't know it depends on your setup and everything doesn't it if you're playing on pc i'd recommend just updating your warm up we'll be drivers soon there is a dragon breath shotgun now yeah i saw noah jay was using that i've not found it yet though it's a shotgun with uh incendiary rounds i've never actually seen it myself i have found that um grenade launcher like three times quite lucky with that [Applause] uh [Applause] fest i'm doing good thank you what's up shane mckee how's it going what do i stream with i use obs theo i use open broadcast software it's free and it's honestly the best it's brilliant i think without obs people's ability to stream would be severely hindered and limited probably behind paywalls so obs devs are the real mvps battle royale you have to do a mission to get that attachment do you right you've got gas closing i'm not done any of the missions to be honest with you if the missions like trapped retroactively and i didn't have to pick them i'm sure i would have done loads already but i just can't be bothered with them because you have to like individually pick them i'm skipping out on that this guy behind me so i'm gonna dip where did they go if they come in i probably got a gun as well i had a reload maybe best uh get out of here unless i missed i hit that shot i think i could have challenged that guy at last i did not oh is there a gun anywhere remember guns there's a deagle down there oh of course it's this my worst enemy [Applause] probably still there anyways and get some cash there's another one in there that's better that's a real gun like i just heard footsteps interesting strat so i felt like that guy maybe was a less like no no offense but i feel like he was less skilled because you know just going prone isn't really a good tactic works in the normal multiplayer but not so good in uh warzone there's a guy up here i've got to get out of this area [Applause] i've got to get me a suppressor stay away from the rooftops you got any of those armor plates for me love one of those there we go save that proximity mine hmm not a big fan of this 20 round score we got someone on that corner there can you shoot through this i bet you can shoot through that you know someone coming in boo still there that guy got beamed i need to get across here though i wish i'd killed him then actually got a sniper already [Applause] uh i don't know if that's did he jump like i feel like he jumps off the roof [Applause] i think oh no [Applause] guys i feel bad [Applause] like the sounds in this is so crazy like that sounds so close to me but it's just not i reckon that was a go on the roof i think i saw someone then where'd that guy go [Applause] you go in the crate nah look at this it's adorable a little easter egg or is that just a bit of set dressing well i'm going to take this uh moment to just look over at the chat what's up yaya how you doing hey prabhu jacob he turned into a plant yeah he did he did turn into a plant yeah yeah i'm sure i saw someone run past here they just like kept on going not sure your game took seven days to download this objective that's crazy where is this contract taking me man what the hell going all over the shop i grabbed that for the meanwhile [Applause] we get a load out enemy uav overhead great contact can i possibly get to i can't get to that bi-state look at it look at this buy station what is that i need a car don't know i'm just out in the middle of nowhere there's jeep up here oh it's so weird playing on a new account because i'm like i don't have any of my loadouts i'm not even going to have ghosts am i whatever don't need ghosts well you kind of do but it's okay oh the loadout is right here [Music] and i'm dead [Applause] look at these these are all are these the ones that you start with in the main game do any of them have ghosts none of them have ghosts guys [Applause] kilo141 i suppose i could um [Applause] steal a loadout are you red no you're not red well that guy didn't have a custom loadout you know what i'm going to do i'm going to be really mean and put this here see if anyone falls for it what do you think i'll drive well i'm gonna find myself a buy station i'm gonna go buy a uav i don't want that one though that one maybe oh you go to default at the top oh right okay so i've never played on a new account before so that's all new to me oh [Applause] [Applause] all right passenger there's a helo coming as well [Applause] where'd that helo go i'll drive actually that's really large for don't like this oh iron sights are great that's a strike okay i think i attracted some attention there don't you if you survived your freedom you should have got out of there he looked like he was going left but i think he's faking it yeah i should have picked up the uav i mean lumber is a really hot spot i think like there's definitely going to be people here but that's a bounty mission might be able to get something from this [Applause] all right we'll chill here for a second he jumped out of that hilo got out on the roof there [Applause] see at this point in the game i'm at quite a disadvantage now because everyone's got their custom loadouts and because i died i do not see if i can buy some armor plates maybe from here hopefully no one's watching it look my target's dead ahead someone on the right is a truck come in enemy vehicle i need money guys i need that hot cash try and get the bounty again i know i'm coming though [Applause] it's quite a nice mp5 i think [Applause] this guy is continuing to move so i'm just going to follow him probably in this house now okay [Applause] where is this dude put the decoy now down there it might be in this house yeah they're upstairs there's a flash or something here flamer at the top of the stairs let me just parachute in i always get my money i was getting shot out as well oh god wait this oh that would have been embarrassing the stun didn't destroy the claymore i thought they'd do that oh well i've got sniped out didn't i what the hell is that someone guys am i just seeing things i'm sure i just saw a monster like walk around that corner maybe i'm just going crazy maybe not all right something just happened there there's a truck coming over as well come on shoot that truck shoot that truck [Applause] they just run that poor guy over this is what solos are now we're cool uav uav entering the ao that's a custom buys on there rpg is really strong [Applause] custom m4 yeah i'll take that i'll drive come on truck you can do it are we back on the truck live now is that there's a guy here he's just chilling in that building hey hey i'll drive are you gonna come out there oh i just want to get a loadout guys look at this dude oh just hiding in a bush what chance do i have you've got to become the meme this what is this area i've never been there before look at this [Applause] i'm gonna go there where is that on the map that's cool it's like northeast of lumber [Applause] like the guy that killed me died so i'm happy now we're up to level 11 so we can actually make a loadout now i don't know what like what guns i suppose i have access to everything don't i just level locked idle thank you for the five would it be appropriate to say your rpg snipe from the heli oh onto the heli is a i will never do this again video was it a 1 trillion iq killjoy moment 1 trillion iq i think if anyone had one trillion iq their brain would explode that's you know i think 500 iq is probably the max doc fox i want to be able to crouch one like in bf5 yeah crouch running like a goblin run that'd be cool i'll level up these new guns on this new [Applause] [Applause] account [Applause] ugh [Applause] ah medic [Applause] did i like playing with stone964 taylor yeah it was great it was really good fun stone matt he's a really nice guy he's a good player we have a good

tree now there could be a guy around here because i disabled his jeep and then it blew up so maybe someone here defender if you need equipment oh be careful you know boys gotta be careful here oh [ __ ] [Applause] [Applause] just inbound i had cold blooded on as well [Applause] be advised kind of want that sniper this guy's got look at that m4 that is sick what is that [Applause] guy's sick load up right i think the spy station's okay now i've got so much moneys on the roof up ahead i wish it stayed in the menu why does it not stay in the menu enemy uav over here uav entering the ao uav

for resupply [Applause] our revenge today purple angels sorry all right so there's someone on the roof in front of me here [Applause] i feel like should i just get the um just get the car and go [Applause] that guy had been in that building for about five minutes no tell me i wanted that nice is there a claymore and a bouncing betty ready to kill me no i'm gonna move you've got gas moving in [Applause] i think i'm pretty clear unless someone's running ghosts dude there [Applause] two people in this building [Applause] one's dead enemy uav overhead at the back enemy uav overhead [Applause] i could not see that guy at all like his camo like he blended in really well that was very well played if you survive you earn your freedom i didn't check the box i should have checked the box i thought he'd run out of the back door oh it's such a rocky mistake that is should have just checked it idiot uh tim and g yes i'm playing solos [Applause] i am blind what am i using for stream i'm using a second pc with obs [Applause] you win this fight and you return to the front line if you lose you're done here sort them out or capture the objective [Applause] oh he won it killed me must have been a head shot yeah nice shot well played be still my beating heart all right so that's game number five i like c oh i've played four games so far i think i i mean that last game felt quite sweaty to be honest but it was my it was my thought that i died then because i didn't check the box should just check the box it's not like uh oh here we go warzone not bad stats really for the first four games but i do feel like it's sweaty i don't i don't think it's any easier being on a new account carbon t what do i think of the sounds of this game i think they need to improve the footstep sounds yeah if that's what you mean i think the footsteps sounds need a lot of work sometimes people just appear next to your building entire squads outside your building and you don't hear a thing and it's not that everyone's running dead silence like not everyone can have dead silence at every point in the game i just feel like the audio balance is a bit it needs some work it needs to prioritize enemy footsteps rather than the the air strikes and every all the announcements and everything else going on but i think infinity ward have uh acknowledged it because they've got a they've got a trello board where they have all the things that they're working on and i think footsteps are on there uh eric thank you for the two always likes your content keep it up mate eric that's very kind to you yeah robert we have a lot of people watching hey casey just doing solos today i'm sure that i'll play with the westie and stone in the future that'd be a fun squad uh myself aculite and stone played some games last week and that was really good fun i enjoyed that a lot play time's over you're going to the war zone undead gaming i think hunt showdown has some of the best sound design for a game yeah i'd agree on dead hunt showdown has brilliant sound in it that was fun at the start though we went to superstore and had a good time there we've not been too damn in a while could go down try and get the helicopter and just meme on people that could be quite fun for your team what's up limited rolos how are you doing i've never tried this before see if it works oh there's a kill straight away [Music] that guy landed on my helicopter [Applause] what the you see that [Music] [Applause] oh that's too much fun that is so much fun guys why have i not done that before oh that's brilliant there's more up there it's the air trunk yeah you're right [Applause] demo there's someone here [Music] [Applause] now where they've gone the fire station yeah yeah there's a dead body there

should i go back i'm going to go back i mean you're right there was an rpg in there surely they're not still there though [Music] surely [Applause] i don't see i think they've gone yeah they actually they moved but where did they go [Music] [Applause] i don't know [Music] i'm looking for a vehicle i want to see if i can throw the helicopter at someone [Applause] i don't see any moving vehicles do

[Music] please let me over that wall [Applause] [Applause] i think there's still a guy in there i don't want to stay to find out tell you what though that's strella it does nowhere near the amount of damage that the rpg does the rpg is just way better is he coming move to the next area and secure the perimeter i don't think i've even like unlocked the rpg yet though [Applause] yeah these games are sweaty you can tell because people aren't like actively engaging in gunfights [Music] [Applause] maybe that was the guy from the building before i'm gonna move now though because someone would have heard me i'm just gonna wait and see if anyone comes this way josh thank you for the five really kindly thanks let's see i think i'm gonna be in the gas here so just gonna watch my back for a second i say no i haven't got any wins yet not tonight nothing i thought i'd find someone pushing in there must have been that quad guy gas is get to the new safe zone depending here if you need equipment all right let's move through i've got to be really careful here look at that self-rest before or two kind of like this scope i don't i wouldn't like take a scope like this on my normal loadouts but it's just on that custom one it's cool for scanning sandra thank you so much for the two that's very kind here i've got time to buy something here without being killed hello there i was thinking about going for a shot but maybe not [Music] might be used why can't i use it is it bugged i would really like to use my uav please game why is there a restriction on that must be a bug right it's really useful for stuff like that i can't reach the objective scrap the contract and nick thank you for the five give us a meme nick i'm trying i'm trying to give you a meme right now i'm trying to concentrate a don 100 donation don that is ridiculous dude thank you so much been watching for a while and really enjoy your content keep up the great work don thank you so much man it's very very kind to you i really appreciate that man thank you not the best position here trying to work my way in without making too much of a stink he's right there [Applause] i got lucky there because there was actually someone else shooting at him come over here somewhere is that in there i think there was another guy up here i can't see though no it's not 20 seconds gotta go elo's up as well uh mad cow thank you so much for becoming a new member that's very kind here of course is there anyone behind me jason thank you for the 30 that's very very kind thanks love your videos thanks for being you it's hard to find gamers who can aren't completely toxic nowadays well i tried my best thank you so much man i really appreciate you thank you for being here [Applause] we've got a guy over here this helicopter is just been an absolute mad lad i'm gonna need an rpg aren't i a dead man thank you for becoming a new member i can't use my uav still it's broken [Applause] i'm going to get killed by him aren't i [Applause] get stopping powering build up yeah my game is both like i can't i can't use my uh stopping power upgrade [Applause] either all right so he's got an rpg might need that rpg but at the same time [Applause] i like the sniper someone like here oh man i feel like i should take the rpg give it give me the rpg i won't let me pick it up guys sorry i'm gonna need that as well can't use my uav can't use stopping bar oh man guy with the high ground that is such an easy shot for him i can't believe i stood still for so long that was a good game though i enjoyed that was a lot of fun even though i couldn't use my uh couldn't use my my stuff at the end there for some reason i was bugged out uh we got um another crazy donation uh matteus fernandez fifty dollars matthias that's very kindly man thank you been watching for many years always enjoying a lot incredible non-stop warzone content cheers mate i'll cheers to you as well montes and that guy actually came out of the helicopter i think does he want it yeah i got one okay that's good fun know what i'm going to try a random squads game let's see what that's like for the matchmaking so far i don't feel like my games have been any easier compared to my usual account which is max level let's see if it's different in squads i don't know i mean hindsight is great isn't it like if i if i had that uav maybe i would have won that because i'd have known where that guy was but they could have been running ghost are those guys really level ones or is that a bug no there we go so look this is matching me with level 132 137 players and what that indicates that there's no skill based matchmaking at all because unless it's actually looking at my stats and and using my stats rather than my level it could be doing that it could be looking at your gun stats your accuracy your kills your deaths how many shots you hit versus how many shots you shoot it could be looking at that kind of stuff as well you don't know i mean so far though i don't feel like the game's been any different uh kev churchill just dropped a 100 pound donation kev that is insane mate thank you so much that is ridiculous kev you're a legend thank you and daniel mixer with the 10 thank you so much daniel number one fan a tommy robertson can you continue the lyric you pilot the plane not call it an in you not call it in with an earpiece

you're going to the war zone innocent what's the name of the thermal vision scope um well it's it's called the thermal vision scope i think it's got a better name than that but that's what i call it uh vinay thank you for the five that's very kindly ddm first time seeing jack live yeah this is uh this is me unfiltered we are live right now let's see what these guys want to do i do have voice comms turned off because i don't know i don't want people to say something that you know i wouldn't want them to say on my youtube channel so it's turned off but we can communicate with pings i'll just try and stick by them i think they just want to go for that tack rover i'm not sure is that what they're doing yeah you know this is my first random squads game like i haven't i've never played a random squads game before so we'll see how this goes imperative isn't that someone from mad max i feel like my textures haven't loaded in just wants to go by the looks of it i got stuck on the ladder there's a guy in there uh tom moore thank you for the fire you've had it for 12 days dude well i hope you get better man sorry to hear that uh exterminated thank you for the 100 are you excited for modern warfare 2 remastered i heard it will drop tomorrow exterminator i did see some leaks about that i don't know if they're real i assume they are because there was a trailer [Applause] yeah i feel like my game is [Music] you're up next uh get ready it's not running as well as i wanted to soldier i'll do this afterwards sort them out i'm just gonna parachute and then i'll change that back it's emperor in german interesting so both of the guys are in the gulag where do we go airport does anyone need this it just means emperor [Applause] hello michael mizzy asks how you doing man and do you play halo i do play halo yeah i'm really looking forward to halo infinite [Applause] i played a lot of halo 1 halo 2. halo 3 is probably what i played the most on xbox 360. i was addicted to that game so good your teammate all right so both my teammates have been killed yeah my textures aren't load again for some reason and they've just instantly left the game cool i could have bought them back soon try my best i've almost got enough to get one of them back but they're both disconnected maybe it's because i'm not using voice alright so this is now solo versus squad so let's do it let's get some [Applause] uh cookie yeah my day's going good man thank you i did a bit of editing earlier working on some new videos for you guys and then just straight into the stream to be honest can we win solo versus squads i don't know i don't think so like 1v3s in this game is so difficult dude that's probably a good spot for that handgun only dylan i don't know about that yeah pack thug this is going to be a rough one if you were the real jack frags they would have stayed maybe chilly maybe david thank you for the 20. just got home from the lab the lab okay you must do something important then it's so cool cool to see you guys still playing with tag after they win some of your very first videos yeah david uh me and tommy and adam have been friends since we were 15. we've known each other a long time unknown one thank you for the five waiting to play modern warfare and bf5 again on a new ps4 hmm well he got ps4 pro or something i think i heard someone down there [Applause] i don't know guys i think there's someone down there i'm gonna leave it for now put this down just in case [Applause] if they come in enemy uav overhead next objective located the fire hose maybe i should keep this versus squads what do you reckon lmg i don't really use lmgs uh dot c thank you for becoming a new member i hope you enjoy the uh the little icon there and the subscriber emotes oh one wants me to go down there guys was there someone down there there's an enemy oh great i'm being tracked all right i'll tell you what i'm gonna stay in this building see if they come for me i've got a proximity mine at the front door let's have a go then come on i think they can come from above me as well if the threat gets to two i'm gonna stay if it doesn't i'm gonna move i'll give it like another minute or so still see exactly where i am me master what have you been watching on disney plus mandalorian clone wars i like all the disney documentaries they do like the imagineering story is really interesting because that kind of shows how disney built his empire and then how the the theme parks were built like all over the world it's really interesting i'd recommend it i think there's like six six episodes i'm not sure they're coming over it's definitely something going on with my graphics card because the textures have taken like so long to load in protect not jack frags so i've got to protect myself a bit of a mine job that is all supply boxes found solid work solid work gas is moving in new safe zone located get this yeah this is one thing they said they're going to improve as well this kind of thing [Applause] i've got a buy station behind me there's a loadout drop up ahead try that package just put in the gear package i don't like these guys uh this guy's a voice it's weird i'm used to hearing ghosts who sounds like this it's nothing you talk like that for long enough and you lose your voice i do have a jeep here i think i just heard someone could have been ambient not sure have you not yeah this uh jeep is always there yeah i didn't pick the gas mask up that's the one i had before quite like [Music] this [Music] bender here if you need equipment [Applause] there's a little fight that just went down there can i get that one there i don't know [Applause] oh they just switched look at this okay [Applause] how did i miss that crush i can't believe i missed that one that was shocking i just turned left a little bit so close well i'm not going to keep solo squads again because that'll probably happen a br glad to see you having fun again and your channel is doing well after the bf5 dumpster fire our br thank you for the kind words yeah bf5 it needs something new it needs like a fresh injection of content and new gameplay experiences because at the moment i just um i've got no desire to play it obviously solomon island came out the new map but you know i had a few fun rounds on that but after that it was just nothing i didn't i didn't really want to um play it anymore like it needs a new theater of war or something destruction darby it was a bit damo wasn't it hello mr fish how are you doing you should reinstall the shaders on the options menu to fix the texture bug yeah i'll do that after i've finished i'm bit scared if i do it now i might mess the stream up boxer robert yeah it was so close so close uh brandon doolin what did you miss before this last game um we had uh we had a few really nice games we haven't won one yet the revolver with the trigger delay i hate it so much [Applause] why is that revolver in the game yeah we've had a few fun games already no wins yet hello nicholas hey robin how you doing hello jordan ball miller dead silence finish move someone i'll try and get a finishing move for you this game ball okay daniel thank you for the three [Music] bf4 magnum flashbacks yeah thin madog in um was it bf4 when it launched the magnum the revolver had a trigger delay on it oh so horrible so so horrible benji now i'm glad my daughter woke up so she could watch peppa pig i'll get to catch a jack frog's stream benji thank you we've not been to um park or downtown today really does anyone need this sports will you do a playthrough of the modern warfare 2 remastered campaign when it comes out tomorrow sports if it's out tomorrow yeah i will i think the modern warfare 2 campaign is like six hours maybe something like that i missed that yeah it could be quite cool dude i just got trolled so hard do you really have to prone to get in there come on how do you am i just being dumb can you jump in here yeah you can jump in there all right 725 then i can't leave the mp7 behind guys just can't do it it's my boy go hunt for this target even get him i'll drive i'll drive moving probably just in the building hey that was mean that was really mean [Applause] just lost my armor now good good i'm very close range right now [Applause] you get how did you get up there [Applause] double threat they're right next to me [Applause] i'm being hunted but i've got my own target this building of all [Applause] down well buildings [Applause] oh so he was the one hunting me as well that's interesting i don't think i've had that before uh what is what level is my mp7 samuel i think it's max on my other account i'm pretty sure it's max level was it azire well you'd love to play with me and matimo that's a legend a living legend defender here if you need equipment this is exactly the same as the ground war map isn't it like this area they've not changed it right it doesn't look like it [Applause] anyway i could get some was that get some armor plates i want about now i'm not not doing that i'm going to try and get to that buy station so i've been spotted by that then someone's already been here as well because it's open i'm probably dead here here we go quest recon fly over i'm actually good uav entering the ao load up drop head in your way no no another like interesting one oh that's the best one to start you know be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for reason chemical scoped ar i need a bit more cash so i can get some armor plates might be some boxes in here [Applause] someone's been here might be upstairs enemy personal radar in the air enemy crystal radar in the air that flashbang opened a door somewhere i think what's up dealtown champ how you doing you went to four stores and no toilet paper left ebay that's ridiculous yeah i don't really like the foul iron i need to i need to leven the file up on my own account and then once i've got some nice attachments for it i might actually take it seriously i feel like there's someone on the roof here i don't want to go up there and find out [Applause] hey armor plate give money plunks shame you can't kick that giant football around did i see someone there enemy personal radar in the air i don't know because the thermal doesn't work through glass maybe [Applause] he firing at me then there's someone over here that's the problem with this scope [Applause] if someone's running cold-blooded like that it's really difficult to shoot them [Applause] [Applause] what where did that go need armor plates is he just camping in there the whole time it's just dude in here david donkey yeah this is live dude this is uh completely live thank you for coming along i appreciate you being here and maybe there wasn't anyone in there i don't know and now i'm even more screwed because i still don't have armor plates i need to get i wonder if this guy had some how do you get on that roof all right ladder he's got armor plates guys how do i i suppose i could drop from up there there's no way i'm gonna go to the roof hello i don't know where that guy went i bet there's someone camping here you watch no we're okay the things you got to do for some armor plates one armor plate i can buy some more now yeah chunks always around though isn't he chonky's everywhere [Applause] at all times all right there's some mad lads over here doing mad max there's a helicopter there again that's the guy in the truck from before oh man he saw me fire that shot i think has been a bit too uh if you survive you earn your freedom [Applause] basilis sk did you build this weapon or lose it no i didn't build that one that's one of the default loadout options because this is a new account it's one of the defaults what's your right he's on your right he's there ah well played listen up soldier win here and you return to the front line but if you lose you're done time to earn your freedom soldier [Applause] you gave yeah i'm doing good thanks want to camp in that fire station hospital start at the top there's a teddy bear look at this [Applause] what does it mean i'm kind of mad easter egg isn't it i mean there is a crazy easter egg here right but no one's figured it out yet gas is moving in new safe zone located go all the way around there i suppose you could anyway oh what's happened here something went down here a custom loadout right there can we see anyone i just want to get a cheeky snipe you know i'll get shot in the head myself that'll be good nobody on rooftops i don't believe it that's not that's not true this isn't the real war zone some kind of pretend version i don't think i've got a 725 kill yet that window there it's so cool request recon fly over nobody uav entering the ao okay i should be more careful when bursting through doors because i suppose there could be anything on the other side right [Applause] like a zombie i think i heard a footstep then guys recon device nearby there's someone around but where i do not know this hospital area is so cool man it's got like resident evil vibes really cool feel like a zombie is just gonna pop out me any second it's a bit scary you know playing br game solo it's kind of like a horror game at times i don't know if any of you guys feel that way but i've definitely been jump scared playing this game and also playing games like pub g pup g in particular is bad because you don't get any respawn like in this you know it's not as bad because you go to the gulag right and then you have a chance to come back but in pub g you die you die you're done there's a heli behind me in a random spot it's probably someone on that roof i'd guess [Applause] why not not the best roof to be on this [Applause] should i go after that guy i don't know i don't really have any explosives to take him out if i had a rpg and some c4 yeah i would there's gonna be someone in here isn't and the that entrance [Music] accomplished all uh boxes found bender here if you need equipment could go for that oh there's someone right above me hopefully i don't get laser beamed here [Music] is that the guy in the truck i want that buy zone man we've got a loadout drop inbound [Applause] what what happened then i just fell over and died [Applause] [Applause] that doesn't seem fair that does not seem fair whatever happened there oh man i think what happened because i was in the back of the car it glitched and just ran me over i don't i don't really get that i was surfing the vehicle i was going to shoot the guy in the back of the head the truck is chunk it's because i betrayed chunk that's why just fell over and died [Laughter] it makes no sense yeah oh well never mind so i'll tell you what we'll have a look at our stats here so this is a brand new account and the point of this stream and video was trying ascertain is there some form of skill based matchmaking in the game i don't think i can definitively say yes or no based on what we've just experienced but i don't think those games that i played then were were any easier than on my normal account where i'm max level and also the people that i was playing against were also pretty high levels and look like there were some skilled players there as well and there were definitely some people who knew the meta of the game but we played how many games did we play then i thought it said the number of games played so we played seven games 38 kills 13 deaths i don't feel like it was any easier or harder than my usual account to be honest in solos at least in squads i don't know but i was matched with like a level 139 and 40 players so maybe not i think it's just random but i i can't say for sure either way guys that was really good fun and i hope you enjoyed watching we didn't get any wins today but we had some fun moments and uh some close calls but that was really good fun i want to thank you all for coming along and watching uh internalicus thank you for the 20. i appreciate that bud with that said i'm gonna leave it there guys i think we'll probably be back tomorrow if the modern warfare 2 remaster thing is real i might stream that because that could be really good fun anyway boys and girls if you like this leave a like if you didn't leave a dislike thank you for watching subscribe if you want to see more do post regular videos and live
