hi everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to uncharted 4. this is one of those games that i never got around to playing when it first came out i'm quite excited for this i did play the original trilogy but obviously this came out in 2016 and i just haven't had a chance to get through it but this will be a full walkthrough of the game here on youtube this is part one and we should have a good time here without further ado we're going to get into this now we're going to start a new game and see how it goes i am a man of fortune and i must seek my fortune henry avery 1694 that's a long time

instead of going on their treat with everyone else i don't care yes that is the crux of the problem i don't see why i'm the only one being punished because you started the fight he wouldn't give him back my book i told you to leave those books in your room you only have yourself to blame doesn't give him the right to just snatch it from me does that give you the right to start throwing punches it wasn't just about the book what was it then nothing i'll save it for confession no matter what i try you seem insistent on going down the same sad road as your brother what a waste sounds a bad influence sam but he is adventurous we have to get over there i see you galore adventure up and around we go that's too slippy too slippery hmm looks like we can climb that nice camera change and that's the other side where is this place it looks like something out of arkham it's a batman game or is this uncharted okay nice and quiet oh we gotta go stealth mode oh isn't it our job to help boys like him in the meantime i'm neglecting the other dozen boys under my care what do you want me to do you know my opinion i'm not ready to give up on him yet you can't keep avoiding it look i'll talk to him in the morning okay good night father good night sister catherine they must have heard that let's see you go away i'm busy sneaking damn it locked wow it's my file can you flip it around i can

creaking it's a nice view huh yeah not bad you ever been up here before this particular roof no but you do know where you're going right more or less i don't think he knows where he's going all the way to the top yeah you wait here can you watch me gotta time that one your turn okay you got this you got the snake i would not want to do this just don't overthink it here we go nearly died again yeah of course she did follow me you know what how about you take this one i guess really yeah really i'll follow your lead a wrap it round there nathan i guess we swing across to the balcony yeah

[Applause] beans [Applause] right at the end oh now he's annoyed come on [Applause] yeah whale on [Applause] hey give me a call when you're tall enough to ride the rides solitary the motion capture in the animation is just phenomenal come on how long am i supposed to be in here huh where's the toilet you're looking at it have fun i will gracias the entire room is the toilet that's not it's not hygienic now why is he in jail [Music] get up man i was having a great dream too hey hey hey all right easy ah hey any chance i can take a shower morning boys or is it good evening it's hard to tell down here get up the stairs get up the stairs hey nice to see you not very friendly are they right humid ah welcome to panama hey gringo filo gustavo looks like you have some fans yeah my adoring public is do speak a little spanish you know wait what did you say you'll find out soon enough then what are you beating that man up rats oh are you taking me anyway [Music] i thought was about to be tortured yeah this isn't sketchy at all hey you know this doesn't look like the warden's office go left yeah i'm on it what if i went right through there outside [Music] here we are all right okay take these cuffs off or what i won in in whatever you hoped to find up there i went in vargas the deal was just to get us in and out of here that's it just i'm sticking my neck up for you gringos yeah and rafe is paying you a lot of money for your trouble see but not nearly enough you were told not to open that yes i was also told not to take bribes not to bring anyone here and not to beat on my inmates but here we are just be careful with that it's 300 years old [Music] i was a member of captain henry avery's crew you know who that is he was a pirate the pirate who pulled off the biggest heist in history and got away with it i looked him up it's great over 400 million dollars worth of gold and jewels all from one single ship the the gun's way yeah yeah familiar with the story can you get to the point uh-huh i occupy the highest sale in spanish prison here i hope someday you will find your way into this infernal place bear my cross and discover the riches of paradise what what do you want the riches of paradise it's a metaphor no no no no no you and your friends did not pay to get into this infernal place in search of a metaphor i won in all right i'll tell you what let me go up there check out the prison cell if there's still anything there after 300 years you can take this up with rafe come on he wants the gold there's always gold letter por favor how you gonna get up there anyways climb oh unless of course you want to do it since you want in and all just don't break your neck that's the plan i don't think he cares if i break my neck hey did you bring what i asked yeah hit it just over there under the work table uh by the crates great thanks so him and the prison guard are in on this together there we go piece of cake that's a long way up that's a long way down ah it's the rope that's what we need bingo now we're in business the grapple on the end push this all right this should do the trick what do we i mean what do i do with this just you eat it off the edge surely not i'll push it down there nope nathan please you need to calm down now we can't jump up there i think we just have to go there and that'll allow us to swing across maybe there we go right so l1 and there's the prison cell how do i get up there use the rope nathan no here we go what impressive oh look at the waves down there it's quite treacherous no one does this sort of game play better than naughty dog no hood required looks like i can slide down there look on that post not sigel [Applause] i think i nearly missed that one wait till sam hears about this i don't think he'd believe you nathan onward and upward oh just taking the view so i'm playing this on ps4 pro so it looks as good as it can i've got to go up too high it's very simple tell isn't it just put his hand up and then you know that you can climb over there now i've got to find the highest cell this burns out a nice view before he was executed i wonder how much of this is rooted in real history though i don't know if we could reach that one we go down and then across first hmm try again come on nathan you can do it we gotta go higher no no no [Laughter] that was like a little song wasn't it no no no no hard to believe there were dozens of pirates holding up in here just waiting to be hanged okay where to barely believe this place is still standing i'm sure you sure knew how to build a sturdy prison it's going to crumble apart any second i don't know how many pirates down here got it let me just jump to that all right not gonna lie this is pretty awesome to be fair if you were a pirate and you were trapped here you're screwed there's no way you're avoiding that execution are you you're done where'd you go oh man sam is missing out here we go burns his cell oh a puzzle cell more like a sweet okay where to begin v equals seven weird m equals three eagles and scratches must mean something then m equals two there can i interact with this sun and moon alchemy symbols for gold and silver wait a sec i saw something like this on the letter huh well that's part of the symbol ah there's the other half now then right folder that's more like it okay got a zodiac symbol sagittarius and the scorpio sign so we've got up to the right and a squiggly end roman numeral two ah nope there it is two x and i i couldn't find the twelve treasures inside [Music] no it's jesus on a cross or someone on a cross [Music] it's on the other side i guess this is it all right turn the head back is that really what you were looking for well that's gonna be locked isn't it can push it gotta watch that first step i repel down this yeah that's awesome down we go huh now what i suppose we just drop is that death down there i don't know maybe that is death down there climb over this i was about to drop down then but then i thought i better not careful oh yeah i have to balance on this come to jump over there i guess okay right we're gonna have to slide and jump here i think all right one more time i don't think he could naive him ah goes my shoulder yeah he's getting on a business there's vargas i want a gut i want in i'll give you in uh what oh slide down there and then use the rope oh crap he must have really bad arthritis really bad now we're talking you can shortcut some of them i think that's safe to drop down yeah you made it i'm back fargus what'd you find drake what place was pick clean if there's a clue hidden up there somewhere i couldn't find it are you sure were you looking in the right place maybe i just i missed something in the letter there could have been another tower that collapsed centuries ago yeah he knows he's lying any plants at this place you know like blueprints uh could be there's a bunch of old files okay great great go look through those okay see what you can dig up meanwhile i'll talk to sam he's our avery expert maybe he can make sense of this whole mess right i'll look through the files yeah turn around i mean surely they're going to search him right all right are you done talking to him come and find me you got it green go if i catch you fighting one more time one week in the hall for you nice section first as good um just another day at the office come on hey whoa whoa you're gonna keep me in suspense are you you were right no we were right you just got to find ray foreign don't don't start please oh come on like you said we did this you and me now this rich [ __ ] comes in on the tail end how long we've been trying to get in here we had some leads no we didn't okay not one so like it or not no reef no vargas and no getting in here speaking of vargas we got a problem what kind of problem did he let you into the old prison yeah yeah he did after he read the letter so how much does he know enough that he wants a cut oh [ __ ] brave if anybody else finds out about this i'll work it out with vargas don't sweat it right now let's just let's get on to more important matters all right let's find somewhere a little more private all right coast is clear okay so what do we got show them the thing oh [ __ ] huh hey may i just be careful okay wood with gold and silver inlay it's well made it's hollow why would one of avery's men go through the trouble of hiding a cheap crucifix that's not a crucifix technically a crucifix is a representation of jesus it's not jesus huh you're right there's no crown of thorns he's tied to the cross well if it's not jesus read the inscription it's the kool-aid man dignifactus we receive we receive we receive the due rewards of our deeds look at you here's the benefit of growing up in a catholic orphanage that's saint dismiss yeah the penance and thief but what's the connection guys let's just pretend i skipped all of sunday's school uh okay uh during the crucifixion jesus is placed between two thieves okay one of them mocked jesus the other one this guy was penitent okay he accepted his punishment with grace and jesus brought him to paradise penitent thief what you figured it out there is a cathedral of saint dismiss in scotland wait the last sighting of avery was in scotland it can't be a coincidence [Music] you know i had my doubts about you too but let's find vargas get the hell out of the shuttle let me guess this is the guy you picked a fight with he's got a knife didn't know he had so many friends tell me now jesus [Music] come here now they don't exactly want at a time like in most of the games [Music] oh the flying superman punches yeah he's gone where are they coming from oh there's the boss man sam need some help here nathan why don't you get him in a hold how about that oh dude yes foreign who do you think you are should have gone for the nuts it's all about the nuts ah took you long enough we almost got killed you know you still might vargas seriously oh i didn't find anything it must be in a different tower well what can i say i was raised catholic i always carry one funny hey hey hey look it's worthless all right you think i'm an idiot okay you want to renegotiate fine stop acting like a third world thug put the gun away thank you we're willing to give you uh ten percent [Music] think half we're doing most of the work 20 and you'd never find it without us 25 equals dale take the deal that sounds fair guys i suppose i can live with that sure maybe 400 million divides nicely by four looks like we have a deal yes we have a deal and if you ever cross me oh dude what no why did you do that that's that are you out of your goddamn mind you want to find out guys what are we doing here we're sticking to the plan was this part of the plan just follow me come on come on it's a loose cannon i mean that wasn't damn it ray where are we going here the lighthouse vargas said the boat is right under the lighthouse if the which way i don't know we'll get outside and figure it out [ __ ] get in uh the window i don't see the lighthouse right now let's just get away from the guard come this way [Music] through here watch yourself [Music] behind you keep going i'm on your butt some damn yeah after you i don't like this rave guys follow me [Music] oh no no oh no [Music] oh sam jumped down and helped me let's clean house you get them near things like this like walls you can take them down quicker it seems all right we need to catch up with break quickly i thought you trusted him i do poor point we got to pull it and push it he's going to leave without us isn't he no come on i mean it doesn't seem entirely trustworthy i have to be honest they're everywhere all right just keep going okay looks clear damn it this place is like a maze yeah it's like they don't want us to leave or something after this stay out of prison oh [ __ ] guard hold on amigo right good to see you there we go that ladder for us lady he's hooked us up there just keep searching over there don't find us oh man go go stop come on i'll pull you up same no no hold on hold on give me your other arm come on reach up i got him we gotta move oh

damn sam oh god no no okay okay i'm coming i'm coming [Music] so nice introduction did you know [Music] i like this version of the theme it's very good wasn't that from the previous games it was like a bit of a recap there 15 years later it's a big gap [Music] we're underwater made it to the bottom okay according to your signal you're at the coordinates no not yet anyway you got any pinks from up there all right i'll just keep heading downstream copy that keep me posted you got it hey i might watch you down to a quarter tank you want to come up yeah i'll be fine can't be far if you don't find it soon i'm calling it i'll find it all right can we just appreciate these graphics i mean come on 2016 this game came out what this looks insane found a treasure what is that it's like a dinosaur something else down here hey i got something here no rust bright color maybe hit the rocks tore off before tumbling hey you're mumbling sorry it looks like a piece of our wreck must be close by you're teasing me just think about what naughty dog could do with playstation 5 if this is what they did in 2016 and then they obviously the last of us part two the graphics on that are ridiculous we'll have to go in here maybe ah there you are i found it all right how's it look that's beat up but intact well the axles are in good shape let's say we use them to lift the whole thing get in there all right here we go there [Music] morning fellas all right i'm in watch out for sharks a lot of it's still strapped down okay but my count we're shy two crates i'm gonna go round them up hold on how about you come up first get a fresh tank ah the crate's gotta be nearby i got this i found one well that was easy crap the crates pinned beneath the trailer tell you what secure the other crate first then we'll lift the trailer up for you yeah you see that's why you get paid the big bucks so how would we secure it the audio is brilliant too crate wouldn't have drifted this far it's gotta be nearby there it is found the other crate it in the trailer we're nearly at your position all right see you soon i'll pull the whole thing up it's like i'm playing that weird helicopter game when you're in school on your internet browser you have to tap the mouse to make it go up and then release the mouse to go down we have to attach it i guess this can't be that deep underwater then that was really quick okay it's in position look up the trailer we'll raise it up a bit for you we've got one winching point there swim around it all right that's one all right you watch your oxygen now it's simple physics okay got the cable i'm gonna try looping it around one of the axes that should work in a lot of other games that would just be a button that you press and it did it by itself but in this trailer you have to do it yourself all right get clear we'll lift it up let's get out of the way [Music] [Music] it's like raising the titanic yeah plenty just don't drop it on me no promises okay i got the other crate i'm gonna strap it in with the others i wonder who does this in real life underwater salvage come on come on it's a hell of a job isn't it there you go [Music] oh boy all cargo present and accounted for and with five minutes of oxygen to spare jesus hey maybe you should hang out then see if you can find some other treasures down there nah i'm good wanna ride up a loved one let me know

camera i thought you'd like to have it it's alina isn't it elena shambhala was that uncharted two miss your pal yeah it was reminds me of that ride at disney expedition everest so many men killed each other for a piece of this very detailed isn't it oh there's the what was it called what was the guy's name bismus is it really hollow is there nothing inside it [Music] first aid kit this looks like a real it looks like a real attic there's not much detail in it not really my style anymore looks like a big house now this was a crazy ride was that uncharted three sri lanka another lifetime chloe maybe two trying to remember what happens can we leave francis and his elaborate puzzles oh yes things that i hate the most yeah is that a nerf gun they come take cover surrounded bullseye take that and that eat plastic right gotcha oh that sound is brilliant back in business yeah bring it like a pro i shoot the glass oh it just goes through he's having some fun isn't he so long why is the ammo for this everywhere i guess you can just pick it up afterwards it's a massive nerf gun yeah [Laughter] great time's over that's the real uncharted experience oh this is a properly detailed house look at this real-time reflections looking good let's get downstairs [Music] you were up there a long time well i was researching something oh is that what we're calling it these days i was hey would you mind grabbing the food i'm just wrapping up here oh yeah sure thing thanks spicy dumpling there we go [Music] you're gonna drink that of course you put the soda can down and done okay oh finish it

sorry i'm sorry how was your day oh it was fine mm-hmm typical day in paradise um i uh i got to pull a bunch of garbage out of a river yes at least you got to go for a swim did you find any exciting garbage oh it was some brilliant stuff it was a um early 21st century truck we got apparently the natives called it a semi our dear lord awesome so boring stuff tell me about the article well it started out as this fluff piece about tourism in bangkok but i don't think the magazine is gonna like the angle that i'm taking because everyone immediately commented about how rude the smog was that it was like shocked to the lines like the second that you got off the plane oh he's zoning out [Music] ah what where are you i'm in here being stabbed with a fork oh really what just keep going it was it was interesting um you weren't listening interesting what's my article about what this one [Laughter] uh the people of of uh bangkok and and the smog and how they they can't uh can't get a flight anywhere and people can't breathe wow all right i'm sorry no it was valiant i was in the ballpark right in a different state but yeah you were in a ballpark asked you about that malaysia job again jameson always asked me about the malaysia job look nate i really think that you should take it you know what i don't want it really i mean he doesn't have the permits and we agreed we're not going to take that kind of work anymore it's just worth it it it doesn't sound that risky all right if it's just a permit no way you could call sullivan you haven't seen him in two years could we please drop this okay i just don't want you to not take it because of me i'm not taking it because of me okay i appreciate the gesture it's just i'm gonna go ahead and do the dishes just stop i'll do them no you

the treasure can you do it say it three months have the treasure now if you run but try to hide the treasure i'll kill you something really stupid like go to the authorities oh no and when you least expect it i will be there at that point death is not a mercy i will grant you dude is dangerous here come on now the nearest town is 10 kilometers in that direction towards the sunrise it's been a while since we've seen the sunrise outside huh mama when i find it then what don't worry when the time comes i'll be there to collect buenos air does that mean good luck so alcazar lets me go and here we are this is bad let me just pick up the trail where we left off and wait trail sam there's no trail after rafe and i escaped he took his parents fortune and bought up all the land around saint dismiss cathedral we call them that place for weeks avery's treasure isn't there not that that stopped rafe warren's been digging for years still hasn't turned up squad not really surprised what does that mean well i just you know happened to do a little digging of my own and uh i bet your wraith doesn't have this hmm it's really amazing what is it fine on the internet these days oh just the saint dismiss cross oh is it because the one we found was broken and hollow remember there's another one holy crap it's still intact avery made more than one cross so what i was missing from the one in panama is probably still inside this one all right well where is this oh this exquisite piece is going up for auction in three days at the rossi estate the rossi and talia know it uh yeah and how do you plan on securing an invite to an exclusive heavily guarded black market auction don't necessarily need an invitation per se huh yeah and where are you gonna get the money to outfit all the high rollers i could take a second mortgage out on my house and it still wouldn't be enough to yeah you're gonna try and steal it huh no we are oh no oh man listen i i can't i'm i'm out what no i i i just don't do that kind of thing anymore besides there are plenty other guys that are much more equipped to handle this kind of thing like who um i don't know like uh anybody charlie cutter no no he's my go-to guy for this absolutely not i don't trust charlie or anybody else that you've got on that phone with my life okay i need you on this one sam just got to be another way not with the time i got left three months certainly not with alcazar [Music] [Music] hey hon it's me hey how uh listen you're not gonna believe this [Music] jameson just walked in here with the permits no he's lying to her yeah i know i know but uh it's like i'm gonna take that malaysia job after all got some nice cars out of the front there it's a lamborghini porsche maybe bentley rolling up see anything yet there's a bunch of high-class low-light criminals all cleaned up for prom and no sign from sullivan yet well there's still plenty of time looks like the storage room's in the building behind the manor you see it from up there just the very top of it oh i wonder what they got tucked away in there let's just focus on avery's cross okay no you sure you don't want to pick up something for the wife that's cute just keep it simple right simple it's a good old-fashioned heist and it'll be a whole lot simpler if it was just the two of us sam we could be inside already not cleanly well who else is here thought about a backup plan in case uh sullivan of course no because he won't or if he got caught sam he knows the people running the auction he's gonna schmooze his way right through that party get upstairs unlock the window and we're in it's a solid plan all right fine good say it what if he stole the cross for himself not in a million years victor sullivan same victor we're talking about right yes he's double-crossed people in the past but not us no not you i know you two have never seen eye to eye huge understanding but i trust him all right he's family no no no no i just need you to trust him too fine bye he'll come through for us eventually come on you have to at least just for one second consider the possibility he's schmoozing there he is see trust let's try to keep the ducks clean thanks okay let's get in there [Music] one's a thief i like that jumpsuit i can't believe i'm out i can't believe i'm here you mean with you in italy huh yeah me either just wish the circumstances were less tense you know well now the sights are a bit more enjoyable that way oh uh so this this isn't your first time here oh it's more like uh third had a couple of odd jobs with salt well yeah okay these environments man so good man there's no way up under that bridge uh we got rope well there's that exposed beam underneath you think you can rope it do i think i can rope it watch this i'm watching

by getting this cross huh yeah uh about that what what about that come on let me show you something take a look that's avery's cross they brought it out of storage just before you guys got here they changed the lot order take a whole pile of cash to make that happen well how long before they start the bidding 10 15 minutes tops well it's got to be some way we can grab it there is just a small manner of a few hundred eyewitnesses okay but we just need a diversion mike like um like i don't know but there's got to be something well if the gods see us making for that cross but they don't see us jesus you guys act like you never spend time in prison if you want something dirty done then you wait for the lights out yeah where's that electrical panel for this place has ventilation electrical that's it up here so we just have to climb up there and kill the lights grab the cross in the dark there will be an emergency generator and that'll give us a few seconds of darkness to work with meaning we'll have to be right next to the cross when the lights go out there's no way we can get that close without being noticed antipasti [Laughter] wouldn't get noticed sam's got an admirer that will work all right all right i'll i'll get to the breaker room kill the power i mean i'm the waiter you're the best pickpocket right you head down to the floor keep your eye on the prize okay let us know if anything uh hinky goes down roger that all right listen we still got this ready ready all right follow me i'll cut through the cellar hitman gotta say victor the years have been kind to you thanks their environments are so good what's up fellas you see i thought i had a reasonable grasp oh he was bloody english wasn't he was just through there let's go i love sully he's an awesome character this place is where'd you go sully yeah here we are hell it's locked it was open earlier now what can we pick it no it's electronic we're gonna have to find another way i mean that's the most dubious thing ever you see that back left pocket yep i'm on it you sure you want to do that there's a lot of eyes out here i think i can handle a simple lift all right excuse me nothing to say here damn it oh real smooth i'm not even trying yet yeah i can tell i'm just warming up just chill [Music] snatch jk nothing to see here and he doubted me [Music] something to watch professionals at work oh thank you i got the key card okay all right let's try this again we'll still need these great good luck we'll be in touch hands in the air uh-oh hi victor hello nadine pleasure to see you again only this time i've got the drop on you well i guess i should be glad that's not a real gun hardly recognize you out of your fatigues yeah you know how it is every once in a while a job requires us to get all dolled up looking sharp by the way not too bad yourself feels so out of place here can't tell you what a relief it is to run into another english speaker even if you are american you'll have to blame my parents for that one i was on my way to the bar can i get you something yeah scotch on the rocks be right back she's south african i think date catch all that yes i did or chad for the prawns trying to buy you a drink yeah nadine ross is buying me a drink ross wait doesn't she own that army for hire what's it called coastline shoreline yeah right but you got to run in with them he's putting it mildly fortunately she does not seem to be holding the grudge i'm good to go here all right listen we're all set sully you uh stay out of trouble okay i'll try ready yeah let's do it right stealth mode i gotta find where the waiters and caterers are hanging out i learned one out of the kitchen probably then let's go find the kitchen man there's enough food down here to feed a small town i love the touches on the animation where if you go near a wall like he reaches out touches the wall oh crap just more heavily armed goons [Music] sneaky bk the hell is this skate wasn't on the blueprint that's why they keep the humans locked of course okay plan b can i just use the key card no i told you it's locked fine but verify and it's locked you never know it could have been a little easter egg or something 2013 see some fence up there nathan come check this out what's behind door number one here we go let there be light on this joint i need leds i suppose you brought it yeah that'll do [Laughter] i guess it's always a good idea to bring a smoker along reminded me of indiana jones like this need to run man i'm starting to get a little drunk off the fumes in here oh good thing sully's driving dead end maybe the vent access is behind these casks that's a lot of really rare vintage yeah maybe alcazar can just settle for some good wine golden lighting something tells me that's not gonna fly sam you gotta keep up with me let's go around this way push this out the way dead end can we climb on top of it hey uh she'll be worried that victor is chatting up nadine ross i mean i've heard some pretty scary stories about the crew don't worry about sully i can talk his way out of anything good job [Music] and that's back to where we came isn't it so i think what we have to do is jump up on top of that from another direction maybe damn dead end oh there's no monsters here i don't want any of that no he did say good job so i assume i've done something right there can't move that one you can pull it a little bit there you go and now we can go back around and get through i think this way it's really hard to see it's very dark jump through this way that's what we were missing i kind of wish i had the flashlight to be honest okay look the vents that's our way out now we can pull this and then climb on top of it i think i got it no need to give me a hand or anything i'm holding a lighter hold the lighter yup there we go we go nice and easy right there oh it's aliens hey sam our white shirts are going to get all dirty and baldy looks like [Music] there's no shortage of waiters around here it's gonna be a fair fit we can take him out so many dead ends okay after you shhh i've always wondered in games and movies when they go in the air conditioning vents are they actually big enough for a human to fit through i fresh air here we come hey check this out see that building with the radio tower yeah i mean the cell tower what whatever listen that's the power room yeah you're right let's see how we get past this gate look at the light say i'm up here i'll boost you up all right all right good thing you kept in shape it looks like he's struggling a lot there you go thank you sully we just got out of the wine cellar heading to the power room now how's it looking sully you there must be a bad spot for a signal hopefully he's doing okay around the kitchen and of course it's locked pacino is that italian for kitchen i assume sir sam look maybe we can use that find a window drop into the kitchen that's a good idea got it oh i mean he's just hanging there hey bonaceta he's the only civilian sam what so he wakes up with a headache in his underwear people have been there before right right oh i got mine you get yours all right that's a hell of a punch okay let's get to the power room up there i guess damn you good yeah these paints are just a little bit too tight it's fine yeah well that's the style these days really oh i'm in rome nah cause we're in italy i get it uh-huh sam you there sam signal's bad great that's the power range guys if you can hear me just about at the power room should be there soon ish okay so it looks like there's a route up around there maybe we jump across here roll oh you gotta roll nathan have you not watched any of those parkour documentaries i have to get up there that's where the birds live isn't it i think we could run and jump across there monkey bars one more yikes you can see that happening i believe you got away with that oh we did not no we had our liberty taken away for a month and what
