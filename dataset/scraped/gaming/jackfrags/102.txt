hi everyone and a couple times before on the channel and the videos have always gone down exceptionally well i know a lot of you guys that watch me actually play this game whether that's on pc or console and i wanted to jump back into it today i did do a video recently with the latest big update i don't know if they've got another one coming soon maybe but if you haven't seen the game i'll be doing a bit of a walkthrough bit of a demo today i suppose for you it's a tactical shooter and i personally think that it is one of the best on the market i used to play the insurgency mod i think it was for the source engine so it was a half-life 2 mod god what year must have that been like 2006 maybe 2007 i'm guessing that kind of time it's a very hardcore immersive realistic fps pvp but you can also play it in co-op you can play it single player as well and there's mod support so there's a lot on offer here the menu music is funky yeah it is what's up kaf thank you man also guys as always with these live streams i have to say a big thanks to the epic game store for sponsoring insurgency sandstorm is available on the epic game store link below and if you guys pick it up or any other game do consider using my creative code jackfrags and i'll get a bit of kickback from that also epic games have been very kind and they're giving me four codes to give away for this game the gold edition and i'll be dropping those in chat over the next few hours as we play it's gonna be pretty chill it's gonna be relaxing i'm looking at the chat you guys have any questions about anything gaming related real life stuff whatever it is let's have a conversation get yourself a drink kick back relax and enjoy so there is some customization here you can change the gender and also of course the way that you look so there's several different heads there isn't a character creator in the sense that i can't start messing with this dude's nose or lips or forehead or anything like that so you know you just kind of pick from the presets i'll go with zoo zoo looks pretty cool of course you can change the hair mop top pompadour swept back none go for that buzz cut faux hawk i'll go for the sweat back i like that look facial hair goatee uh oh my god the wolverine mutton chops i'll go with a clean look filthy soap thank you for the four man five even i'm doing good thanks love watching you through the years and it's great you're playing insurgency because my whole my homie told me to get it it's a good game good game hair color a bit of gray there dark red go dark grey tattoos as well and these are cosmetics i think like micro transactions i don't know if that currency is currency that you pay for or do you just earn that from in-game i can't remember change your voice as well just a couple of options there you can also customize your loadouts here there are different classes in the game and you get a number of points to spend so if you wanted to play with m16a4 you could then choose to add a compensator lower that recall maybe an aiming grip extended magazine side rail put the laser sight on and that's pretty much a decked out gun but i don't have anything else to spend so you can add things here too think that i'm level zero because i'm playing this on the epic store i have played it on steam before but i think it's like a different system so i haven't got all my unlock so we're literally starting from zero here it's also got a server browser as well good to see that you look like a young timothy oliphant maybe maybe hello stu you own currency by leveling up cool all right we're going to jump into a versus here that's a limited time mode i'm not sure i want to play that so i've just ticked all the other ones for now we'll get into it is it cross play with the steam version i think so sam yeah what's up ferguson hello gabriel do i like star citizen yeah i do i loved it i thought it was uh really fun it's quite buggy i think there's too much ambition there but uh the time that i spent playing the game was really fun it needs performance updates though it runs like crap but it looks great right um we'll go with salter so we just keep it simple with the m4 to start put a hollow sight on suppressor compensator i think you've got a 30 round mag in there you can get tracer rounds as well different camo flat top what does that do oh that just gets rid of what's that called there on the gun [Music] i don't know enough about guns to know what that's called flat top removes the weapons triangular front sight post hmm extended mag and i've got a frag i've got a pistol ammo carrier i think you can pick up guns we'll go heavy armor to start maybe although i'm going to be a lot slower [Music] accessories gas mask here's my pistol round is that a well rod oh my god deagle you can get a bloody deagle why not there we go we're deploying it okay the match is already started this is domination so this is like three capture points i think i played this map before this is one of my all-time favorite shooters yeah it's really good so you're gonna see hopefully i don't get killed before i can shoot someone there's a lot of recall on the guns oh my god and the audio is absolutely fantastic but also scary at the same time you zoom in a bit as well ruined there's no kill feed either so really you have to look and see if you've got the kill you know it's that kind of game we can lean as well i think we can throw yeah there it is i think that was an enemy wasn't it open up from b if i go down and try and take b i can be do it you can do a quick reload as well i think you can check your mag by holding off there it is there's be captured [Music] most of the servers have friendly fire on too so you can easily on purpose which i wouldn't recommend you might get kicked or accidentally shoot your teammates i want to try the snipers out as well oh my god horrible [Music] the audio is great i think my teammate just took out someone there i suppose we should move and try and get a then killed me with a foul i did hear him but at the last second yeah you can do fast reload as well you just double tap r and it will drop the mag but it's quicker is that guy dead that killed me i presume sir that building is horrible i don't think i've been to this part of the map before [Applause] oh that was a head there it wasn't should i move i'm gonna move i can hear a sniper oh the gunplay is so good i didn't see that dude he going with the tower seven right there one shot is all it takes to die yeah matt you can die so quick in this game this would be a nice sniper spot here though if i get this map again i might try sniping on it i'm playing on high graphics as well whoa [Music] wow that dude just dropped us both but yeah i mean the thing i like about this game is that it's it is a hardcore shooter and a tactical shooter but it it doesn't oh my god look at this dude what the hell it doesn't go too far in that direction in my opinion i think some tactical shooters stray too far from being a game you know and they take away that fun element but this has always retained that for me personally i know other people might not enjoy that but i do camo is really good as well it's difficult to see people the grenade [Music] what was that grenade launcher oh i got the kill then sick yes that mags like more than half full sir not gonna reload yet just check here if there's a sniper oh that's going into their spawn there the shotguns are brutal as well you know in a lot of games shotguns are just pathetic and they have to be like super close range to kill someone in this game the shotguns are actually effective at medium ranges i think there's a guy in there is he behind that wall [Music] there's someone right here where'd they go i knew it we're tucked in can you make a video on squad come on dog not played squad in ages man it's been a while since i've played squad i know they've recently had a graphics update haven't they but i don't know what else they've been up to what's this guy got head up to be enemy just killed my friends there's an enemy here oh you just got absolutely ruined oh it's so brutal see if they come up here excuse me there was another guy in the building with me did i not see that dude david thank you for being a member for two months that's very kindly dead [Music] let's see the deagle there you go oh my god what the hell what is that sound i've just been watching reacher on amazon prime man walks around with the deagle oh now i know why you could do with the sign on it couldn't you red dot sign doesn't it i was reading chat we won the round yes first game in the bag uh joel this is insurgency sandstorm hey gabby what's up mike miles good to see you again hey sir yeah the vector is pretty new as well i wouldn't want to use the vector on that map though because it's like medium to long range isn't it what's up korean how far along am i in elden ring about 45 hours [Music] actually i'm going to leave this server because i don't want to play domination i want to do like all the different game modes so you guys can get a good idea what the game's like uh blind optimus thank you for the five cheers for the sunday stream jack always love your content that's very kindly man take domination off now hey val what's up boopadoop what's up what's up dax i'm gonna drop a code in the chat right now this is a epic game store code for insurgency sandstorm gold edition this map can be quite close quarters i think mp5 oh that reminds me of rainbow six like the old rainbow six games and those on it you know what let's put a suppressor on it recall grip oh you need a bit more for the extended mode light armor there you go try that can i inspect the gun it does have vehicles as well and the thing with insurgency is squad leaders i think get to use callings like airstrikes and helicopters the explosion so this is the wave game mode and we've got to defend this point here that's the last point i think i've done the server they're already on the last one maybe are they yeah i think we might be on the last point here see if we can defend it where they're gonna come from though i just saw one then whoa what the hell crack that there's no reviving or anything like that either you know in games like battlefield and warzone you can survive can't do that in this game once you're dead you're dead quite a little aggressive defense here push up a bit i don't know where they're going to be left or right what do you think right it was right qb thank you for the one is it cross play i don't think so at b dooms thank you for becoming a member gotta wait for the respawn now young knight you were just playing these yesterday that's cool this is just hell let loose but in modern age um it's a lot smaller scale than hell let loose it's a it's more focused like if i show look at the map so you can see a b c and d there so they started attacking a and now we're at d so hell that loose map's obviously a lot bigger than this they're actually on d i missed [Music] get down here yeah we lost it damn it that's annoying there must have just been like one guy left oh goodbye get that pick and fall back here oh cover this top area not a great position though yeah the gun playing this game is great very good oh my god that's an artillery strike i think you can actually hear the enemies comes observer get over here now cheeky double kill love that quick reload oh nearly got my head blown off there you just throw a grenade they're right underneath me i think careful i feel like now what might be a good opportunity to get behind him let's see no one shoots me in the back i think there's some in front of me here based on the audio we should really call for fire support is that an enemy i can hear up there oh they flushed me out hey bridge love this game recommend it to everyone who enjoys tactical fps games yeah oh we don't have any respawn waves no i like this mp5 though he's got like shotgun shells on his on there i feel like this guy's a pro hey thank you for becoming a member people raise quit this game it's too intense for new players compared to other fps i mean it is a difficult fps game but like the team play element of it i know i'm not playing with any teammates at the moment but you know once you get that locked in and you get some flanks on the go it's really really satisfying what should we use this time g3 g36 vhs hollow site extended mag get a flashbang smoke i'll take it yeah there's there is gore in this game and dismemberment you can turn it off though if you don't want it oh my god that jeep just got ruined we're attacking now the molotov oh my god i feel like this is a really ill-advised push here from me they're requesting smoke artillery as well it's not a bad idea smokes coming in brothers roads are coming wait till they drop see where they land and maybe we can push is that a good position magma oh there was a little gap there look at that tiny little gap in the lorry jon for me i realized knowledge of the maps counts in this game when you're new to the game you don't know where the enemy's hiding hey glitching yeah that's totally true john you got to learn the maps hey ellie 42 what's up don't drive this is going to end well isn't it and by well i mean terrible why would you stop there okay drag the corner watch out what's the smoke down don't go buddy don't go oh my god i told you not to go am i gonna get killed here so left isn't a good call at all that isn't going to work sorry right maybe we should try left again we've got some teammates there see what i mean about the audio though the sound design is fantastic there's a whole lower flank here that we could use oh my god that's so open just go for it i guess didn't even realize you could go there look at that little sniper here oh this is so cool i feel like these enemies here oh crap smoke they're gonna grenade it don't they they're just gonna put a grenade in there come on push in now push in grenade he's right above me someone's got a gif i either rush and die or they come and push me or i go a different way oh wrecked correct could be in the window up here still always clear let's go get inside need to get upstairs nearly on the point we got it we got alpha oh my god that was so heart pounding loved that so much i think they're on this level they gotta fall back okay awesome oh my god so good see that's when this game really really excels when you get moments like that that really came down to the wire as well yeah it has bullet penetrations [Music] didn't realize how you guys finding this so far you enjoy watching this as i mentioned i have posted videos on this game before but i've never done a live stream of it anything can happen did you guys play ghost recon by the way like the original ghost week on games i'm not talking about the new ones they were the first game that i saw that diamond shape for teammates i just see an enemy there am i going crazy i'm not going crazy you can kick down doors as well that guy's been super tactical like i am hey buddy okay i don't want to suffer the same fate let me go this way oh my god dunk that was an underbarrel grenade launcher no i just got ruined by that 40 millimeter explosive damn that was horrible thank you dude six months that's awesome i'm a legend is they can shoot that down as well with fingers and stuff heywood thank you for the five this seems like a really difficult point let's see when they've got noob tubes like that that's why i've died before there's an enemy on the point oh one angle through that window dude let's do it i think we've only got one wave left is this on console yeah i think it's on next-gen consoles i don't know if it's on old jack hey matt what's up game over have i played the original insurgency yeah yeah i used to play it on source engine it was a mod you know like tommy rage and bong and those guys that i play with i used to play with them a lot this is open isn't it here i remember this teammate just got ruined oh he was up on the top wasn't he on the balcony there's one right there too yeah we're not going to take this it is on ps4 is it on xbox one as well or just ps4 jen [Music] is on last year [Music] many people play on console i don't know honestly don't know this guy's gonna get killed see that balcony at the back there that's where the sniper was they've got me he's right there he's right there has he gone afk so now if i get to respawn again they have to take the point and then we can continue it's unlikely to happen unless the team is just really good oh no does it have aim assist on console i know the maps a little bit luke i've played the game uh a few hours before probably got about like 50 60 hours in total on steam what's up meditating gold on viva evening jack i find it nuts that i knew bong in high school did you it's a sniper if i'm defending next round i'll try the sniper if i've unlocked it it's the last guy it's the last card i'd say see if you can get some kills why is that is that the m4a zero oh no i'm so dead m40 maybe [Music] oh good shot right in the stomach i mean this guy's got 30 seconds to capture the point with the sniper rifle there's no way he's just playing for kills capture tomorrow eight seconds unless they're the flash machine gun m24 that's it that's what i was looking for hey mr frost what's up velkas i wish they made rainbow six vegas three oh empty rainbow six vegas was great i didn't like the sequel as much but the first one i thought was good it was quite the departure though from rainbow six because it was very arcadey went third person still a cool game though but it moved rainbow six away from what it used to be and a lot of people weren't really into that hey john hey jack it's me the person who broke their leg again thank you for your streams and uploads i loved your elbowing streams and your commentary no problem who this i might do a video on rainbow six vegas you know that'll be fun wouldn't it going back the nostalgia of it push i mean it may have been pushed then might be push actually playing this on pc scott do i play valorem sometimes man yeah sometimes tom is a small world isn't it yeah i haven't unlocked marksman yet unfortunately okay famous six points for the phallus why is it so expensive is it really go on give me the good actually good about it i don't know where i'm gonna run into them maybe this is one of the new maps i'm so dead i'm so dead look at that dirty camper look at that oh i've only had to look left interesting lighting on this hey be careful okay let me go back there let's even get revenge oh he's dead someone killed him teammate died i thought i had a teammate with me covering my ass never mind that mass is really good in this okay hopefully i can make it work not off to a good start really difficult to attack there we go yeah i don't i need to learn where they are i'm getting a sense of the map now where they can be first time playing it i know where to expect people famous was great on bf4 yeah it was it was like was really good on bf4 it was incredibly fast rate of fire carlos any plans to play tarkov again yeah if i could uh i think the only person i'd play it with is probably like acula and tommo um just because acolyte's a really good teacher and he's very patient so he could help so they can be on the left down here they smoke that now there's a window there they could be in there upstairs area here oh my god is that a flashbang oh my god this is horrible this is just a full assault on the senses and this gas as well [Music] what kind of gas is this [Music] jesus it's almost an smg okay come on capture it let's go kill nice kill yes oh there's another one right this dude's sick he's putting up p90 to work good job oh no tough tough dude i didn't even get a kill [Music] i know i did i got one maybe it was the grenade or when i dropped down evan i can't play promo i just get bored like in these kind of games like i have to be moving around if i'm just camping prone like i just i can't play like that it just bores me i'm defending now all right here we go now we know okay ready okay let's go now the punishment they're pre-firing grenade launchers there can i go this way maybe they can come that way i don't know that guys see me i will try and get the flanks buddy that's what it's all about isn't it that's what it's all about before come on it's pretty good are they actually going to get this point it's clear and it's clear okay cool that's clear thanks man never been here before i can push up a bit further it's like a really aggressive push here oh my god smoke there push up a bit look how effective this smoke is obviously not effective at all man's got a smoke hack apparently hey glenn oh that flashbang's horrible with an lmg capturing it this way jesus christ oh my god guys i'm so scared i'm clearing it though yeah boy when where did he kill me from where did i get shot from there go in the point don't lose it go in the point everybody go in the point don't lose it get on the ghetto risk brisket sacrifice yourself go go next so risk it just kid for a biscuit don't be afraid there's a top window i had no idea be cozy [Music] holy crap [Music] i'm gonna stay here you know i feel safe i mean people do take this game seriously fabi it's one of those games is this guy with a rocket launcher look at him go on fire that's it i don't think anyone's coming that way bring it out come on push that door get some smoke [Music] guys i'm actually so scared right now right there jump on that one kill there oh my god he's right there guys i'm just a terminator that's what i do i just terminate people actually on bravo i nearly got team killed then didn't it am i right oh my god i don't want to go that way [Music] i peed this uh yo bunny bro you can actually hear their voice comes it's horrible i mean it's good because you know you get where they are but at the same time it's quite terrifying knowing that they're there because i just thought there was going to be someone running through and there was we're clearing [Music] see anyone here can i go down there that's kind of bad towards that spawn isn't it what if i go around and then on the left no it's blocked off okay gg [Music] hey aj it's horrifying hearing someone running around the corner yeah it is [Music] are you real no i'm not real was a bear big fan man how do we do it please can i have an autograph man how would i give him an autograph how would i do that he's my father is he a streamer of some kind or a content creator yeah youtuber this is weird isn't it never heard about him i don't like this it makes me feel embarrassed gap i love you i love you too ivan i know you can't hear me but i appreciate it bro once i have no respawns left you can run into the outer bounds area and restrict it i didn't know that white zone thank you give him an nft here you go here's the jack frags nft never gonna do it what's up murray is this like call of duty no [Music] i'd recommend the new lobby yeah maybe um i can't snipe yet because i've not unlocked it i'm on a new account because i'm using the epic game store today i need to be level 12. i'm four i think so i don't think i can even snipe which is uh sad i have played this before are we defending no we're attacking do some stretching exercises here time to go am i gonna play the new destiny expansion no i don't think so on the right there oh my god look at that position you see him there did you see where he was jesus i was nerfed hard use g3 instead thank you for the two [Applause] i don't want to go down there now i'm scared [Applause] squad leader he was in the corner why why i think i've got two then oh capturing the point let's go [Music] i can't give you an autograph kill them it takes so long to capture blocked by enemy where are they oh watch out for the grenade this is getting so violent right now i love this oh my god that was an insane kill streak how many did we get i don't know maybe like seven or something and we got the point yes okay again that's one of those situations where this game is just there's nothing like it honestly i don't i don't think there's anything comparative in terms of like getting back into the action that quick obviously there's other games like squad hell let loose all those hardcore type games but yeah i just it doesn't really have anything that stands alongside it in my opinion in terms of this mix of like it's like 80 hardcore but 20 accessible fun casual that's what i love about it [Applause] and then i'll get rid the sound design is amazing thank you for the three months man that's very kind appreciate you buddy thanks for being on discord as well man pvp cara i'm not gonna play pve we're just gonna play pvp i feel like if i'm showcasing the game like you know most people are gonna want to play pvp aren't they so i was just about to look left it makes sense to show pvp right thank you for the 10. hi tom boss yeah yeah playing on the epic game so i think it's like 20 bucks or something on there he's linked in the description as well we're taking it but not that we've got many people there pve is broken why is it broken yeah this is pretty nice why is that a restricted area there um oh god did they follow me it could be on my left i think [Applause] it's a friendly there isn't it nice job pbe isn't broken okay yeah i questioned why i haven't heard anything about that but the drone you're back in is that a friendly or an enemy drone what the hell i've never seen this before what is it we've all learned a valuable lesson today you all ready that was a friendly ied drone and that was a big team kill but now we know when did they add that to the game oh my god okay smoking coming hold on geez that was funny jdm car thank you for the five let's go jack been watching you for the best part of six you're years [Music] well not not friendly not friendly like that i'm but friendly i think it was a team girl mistakes were made yes indeed what the that didn't look very realistic oh that flake though that's a really built-up area here [Music] we are capturing this nice i got you now come out with your hands up hands up the hell [Applause] is this guy oh he was right there he was just hiding in that room slide booster wilson yeah i am playing elder ring i'm gonna do a big video on this channel but i'll be posting clips on my eclipse channel her hands up and up i got you now sounds like herbert come on let me count the point very good on today i like this map it's cool map what fps am i getting i don't know it feels like about like 120 maybe let's have a look it is actually 120 there you go is it locked to 120 and i didn't need to do that artillery barrage don't kill me don't kill me please this is like really intense claustrophobic fighting here how do i get up to the point those guys have got clogs on very noisy of course there was a guy all right go get off that was a rocket barrage was it okay that carry handle is disgusting is it as it not very good or you just don't like the look of it yeah i don't think it's full price game not anymore smoke ow try going this way just threw himself off that roof is he dead yeah he's dead good shot uh psycho i'm doing a setup tour yeah okay let's them up well it won't be like a tour it will just be like a setup video i'm not gonna do like a whole tour of my room because there's nothing in my room just computers that's it really you can't notice the difference between 4040p and 4k aj i think it's uh it's a big difference 700 to 4k 1440p from 1080p is the biggest difference i think but like for me personally like if you've got a good 4k screen especially when you're playing a game i think native resolution you can't tell the difference wait wait use the smoke is he still in the bus he's got a suppressed revolver or something i mean we're in this is the palace am i my own security [Applause] there is a layer above me here see if they come down the stairs they know that i'm here i'm dead that was a good shot either the boneless what's that from is that from something like for me though in terms of resolution i'd always prefer 1440p with a high refresh rate where you can get those frames 4k 60 is fine but if you're playing a pvp game like warzone or pubg or this whatever it might be having 1440p is a big deal like you can really see a lot more and then you couple that with like high frequency high frame rate and it's uh it's a much better experience there's one right here i think i just killed either the boneless i want to try and get in that prank again he finally just looked to my right he was a viking oh wait isn't that guy in assassin's creed valhalla i'm pretty sure he's in assassin's creed valhalla isn't he why did we get a wave back then what happened where's the observer 4k 120 is really nice as well yeah you can get tvs now which do 4k 120 and monitors hdmi 2.1 big deal i've not even been on the right-hand side i don't know what's there so i'll go over there that left-hand push though is really nice i just messed up because i got shot in the back can you even go right i don't know i feel like you have to go up these stairs yeah i'm playing this on high graphics as well i'm not playing maxed out so the guy's not in the bus at the moment can i climb that i don't know someone's gonna be camping this here oh okay check all my corners hopefully we can cap it now [Music] i think i could mount as well if i had a bipod i've got to actually get on the point though capturing let's go oh no i think that was just a lucky grenade what's up dj how's it going man what are the guns in the game there's loads yes we just got wiped off that point we've got one wave left it's not good no it doesn't look like they pushed up yet try this side plank again let's see i can try and get over to the other side maybe underneath oh another one behind me i think i got three i'm trying to clear it out i'm trying to get it done we've got 23 kills oh that guy's got 23 as well no respawns left either i think i just missed the wave let's see what the boys can do then oh my god this is such a difficult point to take though because the balconies i think if i had someone else like in that upstair bit with me just topping my back that would have been great this guy needs to go and try and do it clear out that top area oh my god i see all those enemies shoot anyone else on the top floor yeah we do have some people on the top floor molotov oh god get your head down it's got a flying card he's right there you get him he must have got him [Applause] crushing stalemate oh there's an enemy on it we nearly had it then still a stalemate he was covering him he's there he's there he's got rocket launcher are you mounted up i don't know if that's a good idea oh no oh behind the that was a really good game i think that was a decent run i enjoyed that putting the fan master good use there are we defending now try a different gun g36 hollow compensator extended mag um i've got flashbang incendiary frag already got a frag gas mask what's the gas mask button guys i don't know we're defending now i thought it might be t because the battlefield one so we're on the other side here where do they come from i'm gonna drop the code in the chat here guys this is for the epic game store insurgency sandstorm gold edition b for gas mask thank you hey clarkson i can't keep up financially with all these awesome games jack street hopefully i don't get hit by one of these motors it's okay cool oh is this the spot enemies [Applause] bro where how did you see me ambush is good yeah we'll try ambush after this is that a pvp or pve if it's pve i don't want to play it someone using fire spam macros really on a semi auto just running around in circles with a knife a knife stick together bye i just see someone then no it's just some flowers i'm a great soldier mate really good sorry holy crap there's a nice defensible position up there with the sandbags is pvp okay oh my god what the hell is to protect the vip mode yeah yeah i've seen that in the trailer i've not tried it enemies [Applause] that's where the guy killed me from i assume that they're dead looks like it i can't see my legs one out of ten this would be a really good sniper this position i'll get through to that building there safely try here maybe leroy [Applause] someone just ran past me there [Music] i mean dice i may have gotten there through the mail kill here [Music] i suppose it would kill me either way wouldn't it so it doesn't matter [Laughter] they took p as well no what's up best baller thank you man just want to say i love your content can you play this with the controller yeah you can chew if i wouldn't advise playing it with a controller on pc but on console of course you'd be using controller i've got no experience with using a controller though so i don't know how good it is on controller i think i asked the question does it have aim assist does anyone know anyone who's played it on console i should have just hip-fired that guy in the room after i got the first where they come from [Applause] they got me okay there you go try answering your questions i wonder if they have the developers said that they're like trying to improve that or anything for controller i'll do blogs this is the alleyway that i got killed at before [Music] don't shoot me [Music] i'll get to it [Applause] bastard all the head glitches man people complain about key balancing i mean i've not really seen any problems with team balancing but i've only been playing it like stick together yeah hour and a half or something so far you need to learn all those head glitches click on [Applause] now he's dead land down man down i think we took it back jesus he's friendly oh there was one in the building already hey look out can you read posters on the walls uh yeah do anything stupid now there you go rent a car now maybe i can get to level 12 before the stream finishes and i can try the snipers out i wish i had my uh my normal account beautiful gas mask are the we are stairs it no one there at the moment they're fighting the firing mortars good good that's cool very not cool new magazine they're south east you can hear them they're underneath us paula oh the moors are coming of course he looked through the gap when i turned away this guy has not moved like he's been prone there the whole time fair play like that's a lot of patience all right let's go don't be stupid it's cod timing guys isn't it you look out there you hold it and the second you turn around someone peeks it inside [Music] they're capturing it now i think [Music] what do you mean sign your profile give me an autograph how could i sign what does he mean does he mean on steam 31 kills we got the 30 bomb sign my river please sign my revolver how does he what does he how would i ever um how do i type to them i don't know i'm gonna try ambush good game ivan if you're watching if you ever see this i don't know ambush single life elimination the extracting team needs to escort the vip that sounds really sweaty i don't know if i'm gonna like this in this game i play that kind of game mode over and over again in counter-strike let's see loading loading so this is the vip they've got a suppressed pistol and these guys have got to protect them and get them to the extraction i think a orb is there friendly fire in this game booty snorkeller yes there is one there is yeah i don't care if he's stream sniping me titanium like it is what it is it's just a casual game and nothing to stay i don't think he was anyway i just think he just watched my videos what do i think of boundary it's fun vigilante i think it's got a lot of potential um in the demo there wasn't much choice in terms of the guns and the operators you could play as the attachments but i've read some articles as i mentioned in the video about what the developers plan for the game and they've got like grapple hooks bigger jet packs which you can fly around in space with which have more health and then you get like smaller jet packs where you might not have as much health but you're quicker and you can do a little boost and stuff lots of different types of ammunition as well what's cool about that game is you can pick the order of the bullets in your magazine so you could say i want to start with like five normal ones and then go for like a high explosive and then a penetration shot or something so it's got a lot of potential you know don't know what the the voice over ip okay i'm the vip i think get to the extraction points what's the voice over ipvan team radio v [Music] so they can go no they can't get around the back there maybe i don't know is that my friend there jesus no peep you keep you [Applause] i guess i just have to let them take people out right is it time to kill so quick [Applause] okay [Music] i mean that bullet guy was sick there he just killed the guy that was shooting at me bust down the door ran in there killed a guy in the corner and then killed the last guy that was running into killer sick gamer you've got there's ambush 10 out of 10. where's the vip this guy yeah why does he look like james bond yep affirmative hello move back last month defend b [Music] we're gonna run into him soon i think that was pretty cool there's the vip james bond over [Applause] i here there's an enemy next to him hey where is everyone only just got killed is he the last one yeah he's the last one can james bond clutch it he'll make it spamming through the wall did you get two then behind you oh he nearly john winked him the screen quality is nuts jack yeah it should be zach paid a lot for uh my internet connection and computer hardware so it should go should look pretty good your timing's good tonight yeah this trend isn't it advisor i've unlocked this guy sks ace 52 alpha ak what is that is that like a modern ak quick draw grip don't let the vip escape these guys know all the prenates i saw a guy there hey hey and the attackers can really push up here can't they i'm not sure this game mode works for insurgency because the time to kill is so quick what a great performance this match has been for me zero zero zero loved it [Music] you run faster with the knife do you everybody runs faster than that dummy just give up let's go that's not true by the way i don't think you actually run faster with a knife copy the music screen as well pain that looks like pain to me come on jack get one he must be watching [Music] i think this game mode isn't very good or i don't like it anyway it's uh a bit too i think the time to kill is too quick and insurgency for a game mode like that i'll give it a try uh firefight let's do it this is everyone's favorite game mode i think firefight a lot of people would say it's their favorite game though do you guys remember fps doug will you play boundary when it comes out yeah i will i think that that mode as well maybe the other team just didn't have microphones or something because they just died straight away i mean everyone is just holding a building  where are you guys holy pastels you know i did a video on that uh oh no don't do that what the is he doing he just killed two dudes brilliantly and he's going into a to lose this guy seems nice oh look i gotta go to b let's take out two dude go back to a ggs oh it's a us though you wi-fi is decent with a good team if your team isn't ptfo it sucks but we'll see because in this version of this game everyone respawns and you cap an uncapped base oh really yeah yeah so we're all right that's a good map random yeah random's a great map farmhouse i feel like domination is a good warm-up mode from how casual it can be yeah yeah for sure and broom hi mr frags i just wondered what your views were on cheese on toast who doesn't like cheese on toast that's what my views are why is this already fully kitted out i don't think i built one of these did i watch it thank you for the five love the channel keep up the good work appreciate you man i'm ready i don't know what ping i'll have because this is [Applause] this is sandstorm sam can you not tell from the graphics i mean the original insurgency is a source mod it looks really bad compared to this move out are they close okay uh nikolai thank you for the 50. over the boneless here nice meeting you cannot believe you were playing the same time as me i love you thank you nikolai you got me a few times with that revolver man i think i got you back a few though ggs there's false ending there because why not someone got my back i think sir this area is clear someone just got sniped there's a little angle here we could use they're alpha i keep hearing things i get up to alpha this way i'm not sure hollow site is best for this map they took alpha let's see oh look a lot my team are dead wasn't going to be camping up here isn't he how do i get upstairs yeah i'm not too keen on speaking macau because they'll like they'll know it's me straight away i mean i know my name is jack frags in the game but i don't usually use that it's just because it's tied to my epic games account everyone ready most people think it's a fake when someone's called jack frags in a game you can't really compare this game to cod i know a lot of people might see this and go it's too slow it's too campy but it's not that type of game it's not an arcade here it's a tactical shooter you have to be a bit more methodical and patient i suppose it's like one bullet most guns will kill you in one bullet [Music] oh my god i'm playing against pros that was the best pre-nade i've ever seen [Music] needs more game modes six at the moment [Music] i'd like to defend on this map that was the perfect grenade one two three four five i've never seen someone leave a match that fast hey i'm not ashamed to do it i'm going to green dude let's go what's up jim hey just a dude on the ground is it free no it isn't i think it's 20 bucks sure sure sure it's bender okay let's move on futurama i have to defend i am defending okay good there's some pool they come from there this isn't a very good spot but i don't really want to move i'll just die yeah i shouldn't have gone to that game doesn't need jet packs are you kidding i mean they could do it as an april fool's joke maybe yeah i mean i've played this map a lot when i saw why do i say books if i'm based in the uk because most people that watch me are from the us 45 percent of my audience is from the us but i think it's also 20 pound and 20 euros important question should i order a pizza or no yes you should okay copy oh look they're actually on the mini map there what the hell's that about is it like a uav or something oh no they're all my teammates what the hell why do my teammates have little red dots on them and there's 14 on the enemy team someone in this building hello um yeah get like um pepperoni can't go wrong deep dish pepperoni gg austis rescue in cs 1.6 was great yeah it was man i played like cs italy and casino was it cs casino so much when i was a kid [Applause] here's my body what's going on there thought i was gonna get team killed then if i'm honest with you i scared the crack on me oh my god jeez that scared me so much oh my god that was the full horror game jump scare no i don't like that oh my goodness [Music] if keep getting all these achievements popping up as well how many cars i got two more cars left i can't be here hello they took it oh my god that molotov burns for so long i'm stuck i can't shoot let me shoot [Applause] it's interesting the way they do that as well people spawn camping or if like they capture the point like that you can't shoot them in that area until you move farther enough back into the map what's up jt underwood shout out for my son nolan what's up nolan how you doing man hope you have a good night hope you're enjoying the stream bro that scared me it's the g3 semi auto or is it full auto in this come on roger [Applause] how many of you guys are playing alden i'm throwing a grenade stupid oh stupid stupid he's in that building there [Applause] i know i've got half a mag left but i'm gonna reload g3 is select fire we go hey man where the hell [Music] [Music] i've got rpgs out now i'm not happy with me being here so i'm gonna move right below me hey hey hey smile got me down you can cut grenades by holding right click as you hold it i mean i've had no issues at all on my pc but i understand that i've got like an insane pc so okay i don't think it's really fair to say that it's fine because i've heard that a lot of people have had performance issues on albany but honestly for me i haven't had a single stutter [Applause] that was last bullet kill there i think that achievement means yeah it's been flawless for me but again my experience isn't necessarily the same as what you all have ruined  oh is that jack frags am i planning on doing a playthrough of the new destiny 2 campaign user shotty they're devastating can i use it on the classes that i've unlocked i think i have one maybe there maybe [Applause] can we do it i don't know can we will we well it's no good is it i did not deserve to survive that long jeez oh my god the rpg nikolai use the revolver i beg you you'll be ivan aren't you again shotgun's a breacher okay what level am i um nine um there we go breacher it's the mp7 mh-70 is there any point putting attachments on the shotguns laser sight what does that do just a red dot might give me away reload speed that could be good suppressor i don't think there's much point to be honest in that heavy armor gas mask c4 i didn't even know c4 was in the game oh did i not equip it i think maybe i was overweight the combined loading grip and flechette rounds okay laser sight could be good as well but like i said it'll rounds laser sight i need to take something off don't i i know i did have the c4 two points there we go let's go let's get over there all right you don't do anything stupid now green the green dude let's go all right we're defending from inside the palace now i didn't put the laser sight on [Applause] is there actually a left root here i couldn't find one a slide there is a left root how do i use this i'm going to blow it those sounds are horrible bombardment stop that be great they're just not going this way hey stupid all right you tell me if they come this way and i will detonate the c4 are we clear i think did you understand don't no can you leave it don't mess with my c4 dude does that mean it's not on now [Applause] i swear to god if that's not armed now i'm gonna go crazy molotov as soon as i see someone i'm clicking it him oh my god wow okay well that works and you can get so many kills with that i got him as well this is so difficult for them to attack that's my first c4 kill in this game [Music] the range there no no no how did you get up there dude hello jack bye how do they know it's me they can't see my name can they oh that c4 wasn't the team kill the guy was an enemy shotgun it's good when i was attacking this i didn't realize you could go all the way left and then the underground bit there c4 damage transfers through some walls and ceilings the range is big okay you just ruined me i think he must know what um class i am or he's watching the stream or something he knows that i had a shotgun around there they're on to me it might be time to leave we're losing delta 24 bomb this game so far that's not bad this dude's got a sick mk 11 or something look at that that's nice [Applause] [Music] no more reinforcements eh it doesn't even go anywhere it's just the bar area who the hell who killed those guys oh we're a different part of the map now i didn't realize i might have to change off a shotgun now looks long range is the range that big that's a friendly oh okay i was like what's that noise i turned around this is a body stuck glitching in the wall with a gun that's horrible play marksman i don't think i've got it unlocked yet because i'm not on my normal account see i said earlier what the demolitions have uh i like the c4 though you know it's cool oh it's two for the laser sight damn what should i get rid of pistol slug rounds plus a decent optic most people said useless though grenade launcher rocket launcher for demo okay i'll try the slow grounds then oh look at that two tone oh two time green the only two left alive though they've got one more wave left as well take off the body armor okay that's a blip block can i sleep it's already the morning here if you want yeah [Music] five head shots i'll take it [Music] is it tossed any good loading grip laser red dark chrome add upgrade frag i feel like like with one though like you might as well take it right get out of secondary m9 with the suppressor yeah that's cool cool i've got the slugs on now so we'll test the range it's 6 am here golang wow what time is it here it's 11 p.m 10 past 11. as well as fastest movement speed maybe you do run faster with smaller things ob i don't know the prenates like that pro gamer that ruined me [Applause] you can bait me if you want bro there you go there are so many things in this game that look like people's heads but then oh no it was a head okay [Music] that wasn't a kill how was that not a kill literally blasted him is that because i've got the slug maybe if i had the flechette then that would have been a kill this game is addictive yeah his name you can move really fast with a shotgun i like that can i do that again [Music] oh i need one i think i should switch to the shirt can i just kill a teammate i hope not i'm sorry if i did just do an airstrike how'd you turn the laser off follow me i need to flank and kill these guys oh there was another one behind h for laser yeah that's it you guys are awesome thank you oh no it's a cue has to do one at a time on that engine for some reason i thought we're gonna take it then yeah i just wanted to know in case i had to turn it off that's all i go clear upstairs whoa oh the angle that's horrible that's the only thing isn't it with shotguns in this game you really have to push in close but it's difficult because people hold angles all the time and make it work we'll do it i want to go that way again put me in coach oh my god i nearly made it i'm trying to get up the stairs i'm trying to do it couple videos on those to jarrod i've not played it in a while though this is uh free to play as well it's quite fun i don't know if they've updated security stalemate quite violent and you're right where are they did he run out of hours i think he did oh no oh god reload reload jesus rpg ah that was intense [Applause] see if i can get any use of push is a good game mode though i'm level 10. i want to get to 12s or new snipes yeah i think the enemy seems like that well sure crossing i'm defending i like this map it's cool map all waves we've only got two waves oh my god i know they've got two waves hey i'm drawing a over grenade yeah a shotgun isn't good for this map should have changed but i didn't you stop running stop running there's a guy right here this work [Music] am i alive i'm snaking the grass that's bad oh you need to push you can't just camp you have to push and get the objective [Applause] what's about how you doing man no this game isn't free this game is 20. 20 bucks um should i change he can [Music] i won't really yeah please what the hell they don't have any waves left i feel like this map is just very imbalanced because they've got an attack over this huge area i prefer to attack anyway so hopefully it'll flip got an enemy there yeah it was just putting my head off good shot m24 is it on ps5 i think so bradley yeah i think it is yeah this sounds loud on purpose like that's just how the game is let's go it's really chunky i mean look at the recall it's insane you're back in is it i will go man hey charles from canada what's up man how you this map is impossible to attack without a ton of smokes yeah you can imagine um right we're going to drop another code in the chat here guys this is for the epic game store insurgency sandstorm gold edition first come first serve i've unlocked so many cosmetics oh look at this i'm like i've got another 90 to go so i can get the sniper yep [Music] no nothing he's given up i do a plain album ring yeah i am abolish [Music] would i play a remaster of metal upon a warfighter they don't they'd have to like update the gameplay i think you haven't felt the recoil in this game until you've shoulder fired the m249 with an acog maybe i should give it a go [Music] that's a hybrid isn't it how do you switch the scope get your gear got it this map sucks okay panda we'll see what's up what's with what a magical moment yes it was i'm on the cobra right now i don't think this is a good guys oh that was hilarious if i had a pistol oh my god i wish i had a pistol then there was so many i'd run out of ammo oh my god that was so funny i'll avoid the edge of this map because snipers okay [Music] i would like to respond yeah i ran out of ammo i don't know if that maybe that wasn't clear that's why i said i wish i had a pistol [Applause] i've got one if i really thought about it i grenade what the hell did you see that oh i see i thought it was someone had thrown it and we were just gonna blow it yeah if i'd really thought about that play i could have got my grenade out and hitting the smoke and just throwing it ah nearly i'm playing fast i am playing fast on this map i'm enjoying this probably burning through all the respawns but it it's fine what it is or maybe i could have got my knife out do i have a knife yeah i do i should have just gone this starts slashing okay it's interesting how the characters cough in the smoke oh scary equip that mac pistol don't go too fast yeah he did don't want to be too fast too furious dude you'll end up dead i don't like single fire giga i just prefer to like try and control the recoil okay we don't have any friendlies up here so i am actually gonna oh no there's one there i need to slow it down a bit here i think so underground way there i mean surely this is sniper getting over here that's my squad laid his uniform sick i think i'm going around to their spawn here i'll be careful why were you looking there why were you looking that way dude was that just an accident get ready get down on the ground now get down on the ground now okay [Music] the gas must have any negative effects [Applause] chemical rounds how do i get upstairs here here [Applause] this is where i want to be if you control the high ground we might be able to just stop them on the point how to get in there though i don't know if he's up here really i expected some resistance up here good there's two down so all the stragglers yeah i think we're good oh okay no that's not a gun whoa oh i completely cocked that up idiot mask only cuts a bit of high frequency sound that's the only downside then there's a guy in this building and one there good job i check that out did you hear me where'd you go upstairs oh what there was someone prone there right by the box oh my god i couldn't see them at all i bet on the stream that guy was playing his day but i just couldn't i just got blind that was a good little streak there i enjoyed that intimidate the enemy with left control that just slides can you see oh you can laugh you can laugh at them so they can hear that right use your smoke use it be the goblin the deuce [Music] that went in i think time to push could have easily got a team kill there ah one bullet just missed didn't see him good camo yeah that's another great thing about this game right like the camo actually works he had the perfect color that blended in with that area that he was in i mean i'm not mad it's just cool check weapons cool part of the game there's not many games you can say where camo actually works all these dead bodies oh my god we're taking it so i should push i think he's just pissing in the wind there through that smoke grenade there's no way you killed me headshot works great i don't think so alex like nearly at level 12 as well [Applause] stop dying we're long on the reinforcements one wave versus their 11. we're not gonna win this [Music] i mean battlefield 5 had some really interesting camouflage because the maps were so dreary and grey and so were the characters so before they added the lighting do you remember they added a rim light to some of the character models how did you not see him acess what the you're dead everyone's dead [Music] just missed that guy at the corner of my surely he's going to peek this window yeah should i just hold it watch out oh this game is brutal man there was two one push to cross i thought there was only one there but it was two in there yeah i know you can cook grenades i just i didn't think i needed to oh god they're so inaccurate aren't they you get one of those monitors where you can put a dot in the middle [Applause] boys hey josh what's up man am i still not level 12 come on there's a little bit tiny little bit is back not working [Music] all right let's go what's that alpha gaming how you doing they come all the way down here i don't think i can push into there can i huh already

supposed to be pretty good in this california especially for the co-op stuff i think we've got one more code to give away as well drama oh dad is this a sniper map i've got no idea people on drugs what sniper shall i use i'm gonna have to completely change my play style though because if you run around with the sniper in this game you just get wrecked what's the batch love youtuber hillside i'll try um i'll try domination where the stakes aren't as high test out sniping hillside or tideway okay domination what's it like being famous in the gaming world i don't see it like that clank i

you a grenade oh my god look at that cheapo suppressor suppressed sniper barrel okay oh it's an acog i'm not sure about the acog there you go [Music] this is a cool looking map what is there a guy above me qts iron sight i want just a nice looking sniper scope like a cross you know what i mean like a cross thread kind of thing okay it these people invisible that were up here oh my god what c19 that's better that's kind of more like it although it's a bit noisy [Music] six three try it out a lot of you guys are saying six three red ring scope there we go okay that's not bad you can change the zoom on it as well actually like sometimes that's cool this is a terrible sniper map by the way oh that works i'll go over there eyebrow magazine oh that's so satisfying though dropping people like that damn you move quick with this revolver hi monty [Applause] remove the barrel why is it not needed what's wrong with the barrel yeah i really picked the wrong map didn't i not that i had a choice it's a favela isn't it mosin has bare stats cool i mean i'm just trying to snipe bizarre like i've not used them before the amazing boy those in the gun same site keyscope ads speed it's quite a far zoom though isn't it there's no one to shoot so much cover [Applause] this would be a really good map for an smg let's hear someone uh [Applause] i don't know who killed that dude it just exploded [Applause] [Music] good job are you really taking a i don't think so i'm seeing on there dead that guy's got a victor come with the rare fire might be a line of sight here you can see oh i just missed the shot there onset come in damn melon popper yeah indeed the toy revolver it's cool man i'm gonna win on there yeah try a different map i think not the best sniper map alpha ak plus drum mag equals bro you can kind of quick scope with that grip that i've got though all right we're gonna drop the last code in the chat here this is for insurgency sandstorm on the epic game store hope you guys are enjoying the stream if you are leave a like thank you hillside you guys said right let's go hillside baba it's literally called bab everyone's wearing different maps your fruit killing skills are remarkable you're done right crystal crossing is epic for sniping not here what if the bab remove the barrel and you can spam the revolver okay and maybe i should try push for sniping because i feel like you've got attacking defense so it might be better situations there for sniping there's a lot of good loadouts to be honest said sb wingmen it's just about playing adopting the way that you play also use create code jack frags in the epic game store yes also that marksman oh someone's already playing marksman payne grease gun honey badger get rid of some of this flash grenade yeah it's a shame someone's already playing marksman's full is but not is bad not on consoles explosive rounds here fire the guns hit him hard what's up barbecue noodles how are you you can spawn kill i'm not sure about that why i mean i understand why there's a cap on snipers but it's a shame okay garage i would like to see the marksman also i need a sight on that gun i think that's so expensive get rid of the flash kind of reminds me of the old was it pick pick 10 system do you remember from blackout sorry not blackout black ops have i tried being the commander no how do you actually select the commander all ah my staffer no problem man let's go let's get over there  spread it out i'm not high enough yet that makes sense okay go there message received hell you could see that guy through the wall issue with the lod there trust me to want to knock down the only door this one was about to span through literally half a second later you could just do without light armor i'll trust you keefa i'll get a secondary for one yeah tariq interesting up ahead that was really close come on melee artillery jeez hey tom yeah i just tank rpgs all day it's not a big deal no big deal i want to be able to like smash through the windows i can call of duty who's shouting at me i think we're going to come this way yes middle click is melee do you do like a butt with the gun pain this guy is who i want to be i want to be this guy is that one hit kill over here [Applause] is that the commander running around with some binoculars explosive artillery this target station this is observer we need you to fire where are the enemies [Music] right [Applause] hello you keep watching that way yeah [Music] it was mid-game time that i joined this i couldn't get it that's the nastiest head i've ever seen mp7 kind of nice yeah it is is that going to go through the glass are you going to kill yourself little from column a little from column b ruined you run no hood yeah i mean armageddon it'd be cool game to play no hood very immersive i imagine i don't think they're gonna push are they i feel like they want it bad enough this guy's still alive here [Applause] it's fine hang on that's a sniper isn't it it's got no ammo ruined cool take away my dreams you want to follow sweep why don't you oh my god those rpgs just going across the map they look awesome still on that head glitch is he nope can i push into this bit oh i can for real where are the enemies they're all on that right side [Music] i kind of miss destruction you know i think games like bf4 and five have spoiled me with the destruction so when you see a rocket hit a building like that you expect it to leave a hole in it don't you i do at least [Applause] i'm sorry how did you i thought surely that's close enough for the hip fire obviously not some spread on it my bad i should have aimed is this pc no it's on console as well brian they're actually pushing to the point i'm still playing bf4 yeah jonathan i play it as well dude what is this he's got an iron sight on top of his sniper let's do it let's go i'm really interested to see what happens with warzone 2. i was trying to find the voice button yeah hip fire i've learned my lesson there for sure [Music] violence hey t-rex what's up any more recommendations lucy boy uh have you seen reacher let's go reach is pretty good on amazon i've been meaning to watch a show called severance as well on apple tv my friends say that's really good can i get across here without dying i'm just being team killed dude there's someone on the point but i can't see chris's smoke i think they could be right in front of me he gone [Music] bend me down i think yeah richard was an interesting one because i remember they did a film with tom cruise like 10 years ago and a lot of people who'd read the books were annoyed because reach is supposed to be like this big sis six foot five dude and tom cruise obviously he's a lot shorter than that i think he's like five seven maybe but i mean i watched that film it was okay but now they've got this massive dude this absolute unit to play reacher and uh i think the people who like the book are a lot happier and also apparently the tv show follows the book a lot better than the movie did but i haven't read the book so i wouldn't know leroy i don't have any waves there it is knife only gameplay for the last game and then i've got to go because it's half fast did i get it no pain i wasn't quick enough i was looking at my phone looking at the time yeah it's half past midnight so [Music] okay uh this is the vellum up again isn't it pain g scope ads speed greased bolt cycle the weapon bear claw that's cool suppressor and then maybe copy suppressor on the pistol a little green dot sight quick draw holster that could be quite an interesting sniper though oh no this isn't the favela map thank you for 20 months cheers for the bf1 video yesterday just started playing again recently yes where am i from falcon i'm from uh the uk i'm from england mate i think i was surrounded by like five people there it just shows that like graphics aren't the most important thing you can make a gameplay that's full of features and fun [Music] this is deja vu right here so i go up here with the pistol guys hardcore uh why could you not go through that area why is that not allowed there see there's a little see where it is yeah there's a little blocked off area there that you're not allowed to i wonder why that's the weak spot though there i've done that easily twice i think i held him off there which is good with my little pistol my little makarov reminds me of daisy that does they're gonna be here still aren't they bit of a system of a down there i love the pistol gameplay though just feel like john wick you people oh a lot of maps had to be reshaped using tons of out of bounds and spawn killing spots let's see interesting what gun is that was that the grease gun hey emily you see it they need more guns there's loads of guns in this game man i did put a suppressor on this uh i'm going to reload for grenades one dead oh there's a basement on the way down pain that voice come out of the sky or something yeah the the audio sometimes like when you die the narration sounds really echoey there is a deagle yeah you can get a deal it costs like six points though so it's not for me come on we've got to go we can do it you only get two mags in this pistol i suppose i can take well drop down and die again someone is just sniping everyone where are they i need to be the counter sniper find them in there did you get him i just threw a molly in there that's awesome ow didn't see anyone oh who's shooting at me i don't see a thing there's no muzzle flash or anything [Music] i can't see who's shooting at me at all there i literally can't see it jack sprags you may be thinking of like jack's films bro we can capture this  jack price i mean not when i'm sniping because i'm you know crazy you just moved across to the right they can be in that top window though how we're gonna get in there someone's just eating grenades from their spawn as well see that help me guys he's on top of the bridge on top of the bridge i'm so sorry there's one under the bridge you're gonna peek again careful oh my god the smoke has just ruined everything we did get the point which is good artillery where am i going i don't know oh my god big jump scare big big jump scare they called me a phone yeah they don't think that's good i like it that way jesus should have just switched to an smg but i said that i wanted to snipe for this last game so that's what we're doing what's with the blue paint strange bro have a commander [Music] the no are just a maze aren't there he's making a lot of noise there look at this ak one mag let's make it where the is i'll change loadout because sniper's obviously not working change class preacher shotgun yeah whatever let's do it see how it goes i've not played squad in a while okay check your equipment come on what this pump actually is those guys just got wasted got my old body there [Music] that feels really cheap sniping took out three shotgun work well there breach and clear kind of thing as well i thought it was going to be a building but it's just a square with a fountain seems really difficult come on buddy you can do it good shot it's an m16 isn't it a4 maybe let's go god damn it it's difficult guys what are they saying that's pain if i go out here i'm dead capturing it i think we nearly got it last chance that's the ultimate spawn camp right there just ruined us houston we need a commander yeah put smokes in maybe is this sniper still here somehow god it's really annoying like playing like i do when i defend playing against that is really frustrating [Applause] [Music] all right it comes down to this guys can we get the window there's gonna be some rats here watch out oh it's crazy in these streets oh god is that a sniper it's on the window did he put a smoke this is literally last chance saloon right here [Music] nope we won the game hey all right guys i gotta go it's nearly 1am thank you for watching
