hi everyone hope you're doing well today we are playing some more call of duty warzone and checking out one of my new favorite smgs the ots 9. so this came out a couple weeks back but i haven't really done any gameplay videos on it at all because i was just so obsessed with the cold war mp5 and the modern warfare mp5 but i watched a great video by true gamedata who broke all the stats down on this gun and compared it to the cold war mp5 and the mach 10 and the ots actually has more damage per mag than a mac 10 does and it will beat the cold war mp5 in most situations also the recoil on it is really nice and manageable so i wanted to give it a go again i had to unlock it because it's a bit of a pain but got there in the end maxed it out and used it today for a couple matches with the qbz which is also a new assault rifle that's pushing its way into the meta and i might do a proper video on that in the future but this is the ots build that i was using feel free to copy and i was trying to play as aggressively as i can because this does a ton of damage up close that's the whole point of this gun you only get 40 rounds in the mag maximum so for quads maybe it wouldn't be a great choice but i think for solos joes and trios trios i'm playing today worked really well so with that said we're going to just jump into the games today i've got two matches here for you and i've only done a few edits really on both of them because a lot of people have been requesting longer gameplay for warzone and as you can see the length of this video it's a lot longer and there's some great discussion here with fireborn and broken machine just a couple of really chilled games we had fun some great combat scenarios and we were challenged a couple times as well so i think you guys will like this without said if you do like it hit that like button below thank you and as always cheers to all these absolute legends for using my code in the cod store jackfrags in caps so here we go then you're about to see how devastating this smg can be subscribe if you're not already let's get it on the roof come down [Applause] yeah why not in the building are they top four uh well they were i think they might actually be below [Applause] round four i'm confused uh what have they just gone away before they're on roof i've got nothing to have it nope [Applause] could have been in the sky

full team down the other oh they're off they want none of this [Applause] let's go let's go get them on the roof [Applause] there's one's down here one's running back one busted oh he's lucky reloading i decided to forget how to aim right there at the end of that yeah he's going up the left the cheeky devil no he's not is he oh down [Applause] i swear i just heard someone isn't there someone like yellow there's one on top of broken right now oh no i had some weird like there there's two of them you want to go over this chris or yeah they're they're just waiting to go up the line with their friend i'm down he's just here on the left i think jump in with me oh god there we go i'm here i was i was coming around on the outside [Applause] uh you got your kill broken let's go i'm on it i'm on it no no still in there no i mean uh the guy that you downed we just finished i've heard that the higher kill death ratio the better lobbies you get right no that's not true right this that was everyone here chris wasn't it i think on the radar we don't have enough money for that [Applause] broken's not a cheap not a cheap lady we know me more than him more than i am not cheap lady he's an expensive day i've [Applause] brokenness a little bit more 200 yeah all these buildings have already been ran through so [Applause] there that's it nope yeah that's it is it three oh yeah i'm an adult i can count i think i'm an adult um you want to go that one maybe or which one i don't mind works through here one under there under the tower is you know that's got us some escape points oh what's the worst that could happen [Applause] [Applause] literally found no more money it's insane already short i am ready super ready so there's red doors inside airport so you can head over there and you can see some uh i just know this is where they spawn right now yeah this one in this little room right uh there can be one yeah [Applause] that's one there could be another one in the diving board right there where the plane dock is [Applause] one down nice i'm flanking he's running inside i'm a potato here we go you're not potato excellent uh sachi here armor's over here oh some money on the bike is it close no yep they they just got wrecked they're trying to get their load out lost it all damn it that's so annoying it is there's no way to what if we go under the building ah that's lamb it's right there [Applause] or do dads [Applause] oh there's a door above us yeah in that little room we had marked let's go would do anything like battlefield portal that'd be really cool all the cod games yeah yeah i feel like that's the next gen experience of battlefield you know what's uh card gonna do it's really they're gonna make battlefield that's gonna be yeah i'm definitely serious because let's get the uh load out yeah i think khan has to go bigger destruction and more vehicles that actually have a bit of depth to them because that kind of gameplay is what warzone has given the cod players for us it's just normal because we've had all this stuff for years with battlefields they've been served in an accessible format in the form of cods and now they're like well i don't really want to play normal multiplayer anyway there's another red door oh let's do it why not do this yeah go on uh we've got our ghostbud out here but that is before that oh okay yeah that's a good idea i left the center again there if an answer i'll pass on that it's terrible i've never gotta go with it ever yeah i just believe oh yeah yeah i don't even want guys but yeah one or two uh i have to upload so that's terrible so you telling me let's do it if i leave that on the buy there i'll get a kill yeah you might all right let's put it in a like a dark corner a dark corner yeah yeah most people are just gonna drop here they're not gonna look are they put it here then try it does it timeout after about a minute is it or so it's pretty pans it's not like the one in there was it modern warfare 2 that was insane oh my god turn the corner just get blasted instantly oh there's another one let's go alphas how many doors can we hit in one day y'all can have the advanced i've got a precision in pocket i'll take it i don't want the mask i'm not dying tonight again i'm broken no i'm not doing it i've lost so many games to the gas mask animation literally the other day literally [Applause] stresses me out [Applause] where'd you want to go [Applause] i have no idea sure maybe pick up a king spice this round up a little bit someone just fire a shot then oh yeah there's gunfire over here to my right it's actually right at this building oh down let's go let me pop this there you go look at that got one coming in as well just got respawned they're on the back wall dude i just want to put my i'm going to put that on the uneven surface that's annoying that'd be a very good spot for it as well i just armored a guy on the back there's a guy in the top window [Applause] up down too and there we go hey it's simple [Applause] you don't want it you can have it it's for you oh thank you very much okay right where's the last one then there upstairs there's so many dead things

don't know how he's got an angle on me there he barely peeked his head out of that corner i'm coming okay [Applause] there's a little gap right there that you just poked his fart head out far enough on that's dusty nice angle what's dirtier is the fact that he knew you were coming that was probably his teammate that you butchered over there oh oh jeez he's in the little door down down down i just got shot from the left in here yeah they're still in the left building as well i've downed him again [Applause] uh no no where is he i think i'm getting chased he's here i think what onto the roof
