now to really dodge the bugs we've got it we've got to do a space walk so this is to get to the top of the space station it's just to get out of the space station without having to call ourselves the elevator because it will kill us yes the lifts are you serious oh we can buy some nice clothes here star-lord is it yeah that's wrong as well it's now locked down here we go this is an airlock but we're going into space because we can't go upstairs oh whoa whoa whoa what the i didn't expect space there ah jack i don't know where i'm going in here by the way do you know uh i've literally never been here time ow we're just floating around do we just go up we need to go up yeah so that's that's a good idea but how do we know if that's up with space isn't it no go go all the way down they're saying go down okay i'm going down i think this is cool we need those mag boots there you know so we can like glue on to the bottom yeah that'd be cool if they had them i think about here this is where we need to go jack that's still not pressurized though is it well no it's just a buggy gaping hole into space in space okay whoa all right now we just need to figure out a way back into the shops up there so there's gotta be an elevator it doesn't work it's not work for like ever like people like you know oh right now can you figure out way back well which way is up hang on hex well don't just fly out into space go above the rock yeah yeah i can see an entrance okay come in paddle two here look ow of course it hurts you when you do that so don't die vast coldness of space yeah well it's it's a bit hurting when you land that's fine nine percent health gone look that's that's where we're trying to get in well we can go through here look all right oh there's the punisher frank one [ __ ] two [ __ ] billion time oh god here it is here we are the drake she's back i'll open the ramp hopefully not get crushed by it i got strapping so this is the mission we're going to do then oh oh it's drugs this is drug running jack we um in the game just to be clear you are clear to launch where do we have to travel to i don't know look not very far away 100k look it says over here 100k will be there in what 10 seconds yeah i'm just spoiling the drive right let's go find the drugs there might be people here well there will be i mean i think there will be people here i don't like that it seems as if you could just crash into the planet now the stash is over there okay i don't think there's a walk to it so we're gonna have to find a manual way to get down to it is it on this side of the planet no i'm gonna use the marker and go around oh my god there look 250 kilometers now there's no so we can do a trick trying it closer to it we can we're going to line up this marker and i'm going to dump out the content drive like midway really fast though i mean dangerous you know we shot it is it fine yeah it's but like it's slightly closer all right we'll get out if the stash is down here look right there should be some there could be drug there could be drug lads around here drug lads all right i've landed get out the seat [Music] whoa there boy okay we're ready to engage hostels really i mean is it a war i don't know might be i'm gonna open the ramp because we can never get back in that way why is it even like it doesn't seem very well designed does it no the landing gear is here look at this look at this i got what is it railgun railgun oh my god that is sick you fire it yeah go on oh my god i was charging whoa that's cool i reckon there's gonna be blokes in that other ship over there i like these red flares i'm just scurrying up the side look i've got this dead set oh yeah bodies all are hostile in here just remember that okay i can hear something oh you know i'll kill everyone engage hostels down here tom take him out they're warping around kill them i think we got two then one of them was just running into a wall yeah that's normal i don't even know what it looks like are you looking for boxes is it this let's say it's over there doesn't it but i mean i don't think it is there's some food in that i think this looks a bit dubious drugs how do you find drugs i don't know like i think there's gonna be like boxes to carry do we have a dog no idea i genuinely don't know what we're doing i mean it just says i'll check the contract you just keep an eye out oh i've got it it does look like drugs to be fair so that's one there's an enemy kill him killed him i think there was only one up here anyway jack i think so i'll come down now i can hear people shooting tom you hear that our chip's under attack why who who's shooting it what do you mean it's being shot something something bad thomas oh dear dad tom who was doing it i have no idea there's just a ship and now we're stranded jack we're going to need someone to come guess there's just a ship hovering outside and he's just destroyed us is that a player then no i think it's the cops why would the cops just destroy our ship surely they'd come and arrest us or something right we need someone to come pick us up here oh yeah i see it why i'm gonna fire him jack you'd want to fire at him yeah go on then did that hit it no he didn't seem that fast about that did he do again he's moving a little bit no he doesn't care about that tom okay well we're really gonna need uh someone to help us now okay rolly's coming to get us yeah but what if when rolly gets here he gets destroyed no he'll just he can just easily dispatch that um ai i didn't realize that we were gonna have basically i didn't realize one of us should have stayed in the ship and it's one drugs oh that does look like drugs you know what it doesn't it just looks like nine bottles of iron brew or something really delicious there must there's probably more drugs down there but should we try and deal with this ship look here we got it how if i go down here tom there's no way that's gonna even damage it oh maybe it did that was a bigger particle effect on they were pissing him off it's not moving though could it just eradicate us in an instant that was awesome revenge blowing up the drake there's got to be more around here there's a dead guy here tom doesn't sound normal does it it's uh i don't like it i don't want to go in there i feel like it's like something's going to kill me like it's the roadrunner from the cartoon the roadrunner is that a ship tom something's happening there's a dog fight what where it's a dogfight in the sky what's that what the hell's going on i think the big one's gonna win oh no he's throwing bat tom this is epic what's going on like who are these people is this rolly do you think don't know roley's done a tactical minute oh no oh god if that was rolly he just exploded this guy coming to us oh he's really the small one whoa what the hell's going on wait one i count three ships in the sky i don't like this jack what what we walked into here i don't know i don't want to be here anymore i didn't start shooting at the surface surely they wouldn't see us i can still hear the roadrunner in there now i've got this drugs look search that orange spit there the crash bit okay just ignore what's going on up there it's fine i mean i don't feel like we can ignore it tom look at the railgun out should i just start joining i think it'd be a hell of a shot well i don't know who yeah oh god which one do you go for i don't know very strange i don't know oh god one that splash one just two small ones now um i don't think there's any drugs here okay that's fine if you don't see any have they stopped i don't know i feel like someone's coming for us no they're still fighting is i don't know if there's any more drugs can you say there was three yeah there's meant to be three but oh someone's just destroyed incoming call why have i got incoming call who's ringing it i don't know do i accept it oh yeah pick it up there it is hello hello i mean i don't hear anything tom how do i see i'm so slow with these drugs it's crazy i don't know how do i see who i'm on a call with i just accepted it i don't i don't know i'm just being prank called or something i don't know yeah rolly's coming don't worry he's rolly sandwich triangle no who's that then his name's rolly the someone outside sandwich triangle is 7 000 meters away rapidly ascending on that

random bullet like kills us through the wall i think i think that's what he's gonna go for but we haven't even found the third drugs i know but rolly's about to kill this guy and then we can find the third drugs is this guy just flying around in the ship this is just outside can you see him you can see him come up here does it only know that there's two well yeah but he'll just smash them they

yeah yeah yeah put that down there oh he's got the gravity going look he knows what he's doing johnny john is a veteran of star citizen obviously look at this guy we'll just deliver our drugs then we'll take us to the nearest space station so that we can we can be get a new ship because we've lost our ship now let's have a look around then that's where you can you can store like a one-man fighter to deploy off the back of this ship oh i see it's big enough that you could put a ship yeah well it like attaches and you can get in the cockpit this is cool it should be another turret all right oh my god it spins around there's a screen yes [Music] um i can see the things [Music] quantum drive is now on warp drive oh baby here we go so this is going to put us upside down yeah yeah there's like two giant guns on the back there who's got you're in the turrets it looks like a railgun uh i think they scarfed when they realized we summoned several people to come and like escort us we have lost my ship though which is a bit sad ready to drop some drugs off there's rolly giving us a flyby look at that oh tom that's hot that's a bit hot isn't it that's all right isn't it i mean look how close we are to that building i'm not used to such a giant vehicle it's quite close disembark sorry it takes me about 10 minutes to leave the sea let's get her the drugs made it the drugs have made it wow uh all right boom is he going to put the elevator down oh careful they're jostling they're jostling they're juggling that's all now comes the real game what's the real game well if you try and deliver them and it just instantly kills you oh yeah i remember you'll do it because you've got light armor on we'll get you to do the deadly game i presume that there's an entrance here is there an entrance oh there's a ramp on that's why you want one of the grav guns a lot quicker that way isn't it oh i didn't know that okay mouse scroll apparently lets you run faster yeah didn't know that yeah good you kidding yeah i was uh role-playing we'll go with that oh yeah you can run tom look at this this whole time i know this is the deadly okay wait no this is very deadly wait no
