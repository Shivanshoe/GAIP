hey everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some call of duty warzone juggernaut royale it's back i'm happy and today i'm playing with study pomographic and mr pro westy i'm really looking forward to this it's gonna be good first game of the day i'm excited i've got to get my eye in get the juggernaut and we'll have a good time thank you for coming along and i hope you guys enjoy this still parachuting no you're still parachuting again because my game isn't even up i can see a minute like off but there's nothing on my passport now i just ruined myself yeah it's all my time down photoshop premiere and lightroom which i realize we're all still running um it's a problem and then the game just disappeared off my fast bar so it's relaunching so we have to go back to menu [Music] me if you had a um if you had a threadripper you'd be all right you would they just sit there humming away you'd have no problem at all well i've got an i9 7900x but it's just it's you know it's designed for the multitasking it's just not that great for gaming i've not used an amd cpu since like the original threadripper i've never used one i do back in the day the amd 64x2s they were like incredible they were so much better than what intel had to offer back then in terms of like the performance and the value yeah i think as soon as intel came out with the the core 2 technology they just took over even though amd were the first to market with a dual core cpu yeah like intel just took over with core 2. all right i'm back in i'll invite you get back in tomo let's go it's mental now with the amd side of stuff because intel are really struggling like massively struggling with their um is it seven nanometer process i think that's that's where they're struggling um i've no idea i haven't really kept up for it for a while yeah there's something invite westy i should have hang on a minute i'll invite you something you gotta go jacks yeah probably because i logged in with dna oh yes silly buffoon but um yeah i mean it just in like price to performance at the moment if you if you're gonna build a gaming pc right now then you go amd absolutely yeah is it ryzen 5 or something ryzen 7 it's you want one of their ryzen 9 processors but it's the they're on third gen ryzen now um and that that's the 3900x is pretty much like the content creator gaming uh processor at the moment unless you go thread ripper which is just obscene right yeah i've still got the 900k i've had that for nearly two years or something like that it's not really good oh yeah there's nothing like there's nothing wrong with buying like an intel processor it's just that amd are massively catching up and they're cheaper so you know if if you're if you're a bit budget conscious then you'd go amd i should have gone with a 9900k honestly this build would be so much better for it this uh the cpu just has so many issues with modern games [Music] someone just asked to see the ram class that i'm using there it is this thing just melts ram seven is disgusting it's brilliant uh niels thank you for the two surfers thank you for the five so glad that i'm back streaming warzone that's very kind you man thanks hope you all enjoy the stream or the videos today i'm a big fan of juggernaut royale so uh we should have a good time it should be good msh thank you for the donation glad to hear news of more streaming wicked and david jameson thank you for becoming a member that's very kind to you hello carmella spicy melons what's up what's up andrew bonds right okay restart we got this it's just like i just can't figure out where to put modern warfare i guess so it's just like on all the cores it must be brilliant by rendering and doing like you know creative face yeah but obviously premiere had that looking used premiere but the gpu encoding is insane now yeah i heard about the update for it you see one of the uh one of the modern warfare devs tweeted about half an hour ago saying that the patch is just it's just massive for next week or whenever it's coming really yeah it's 500 gig it's a massive patch but once you've installed it and everything's been compressed the game files will be smaller than what they were if that makes sense yeah they did that last time basically they need to keep updating the game and all the infrastructure behind it to be able to make it better so they're probably like replacing a bunch of core crap that they built before yeah no doubt and now they're fixing it all up i don't know now then right now we game now we do this chunky boys on tour i actually can't even see starts face on that character model now what have i done you've ruined it for yourself what have i done okay so they're all south we've got one train promenade and farmland train or do you want to go mid-promenade i think we'll be there filling in the sandwich if we drop mid probably i don't know it's the only way it's the only way it's the only way go there go go for that search

ammo around four players thank you you guys need this yes well we got to go back the way we came uh oh he's coming on the road should we go for our second loadout yeah off to the right uh mathias thank you for the sec 200 what graphics card did i have before 2080i i had a 2080. i pretty much always get whatever the best thing is apart from i don't buy like the titans because i think you don't really need to spend that much on a card and they don't give you that much performance increase over the ti or the 80 whatever it is at the time dude i mean your x50 is changing color is it yeah it changes from black and gold to purple well it should be purple so at the moment hang on a minute it's got a gold barrel on it look yeah i always see that but the body of it changes from purple to black and it's kind of cool wesley sold his soul to activision they made him a custom skin uh sounds like me you get some pearlescent paint on you on your sniper rifle if you sell out only a reactive camera every kill he gets it changes color right so there's a guy at the top of the other building the king come on come to the edge thomas someone said in my chat that you sound like darth vader when he was 18. that's one of the best ones i've heard that is a good one that's a good one right do we want to go up and get that king should we just go and go and get those just end this round is it repel or but he's on the roof so he if we all go up at once he's just got his oh and he's got a contraband if we get up there now surely his team has to be spawning on him we'll get there before his teammates do he just picked up the contraband he's gonna jump right yeah he's gonna jump he's going up west he's going up oh you're mad ready send the elephant you will okay can't hear any footsteps it was anakin also yoda killed the young looks like oh that famous line of dialogue i think he jumped yeah yeah you jumped no never no yeah he's hacking look wesley i'm not gonna press oh [Laughter] right hospitals playing with my biggest hater yeah imagine you do that but he still thinks you're a hacker there's a guy right there guys martin any job dolls that'll be a sick what do you reckon yes corner me dropped off the roof on the hospital he's coming down here i bet you [Applause] i'm waiting for a teammate to go resin but no one's waiting for a teammate lying for a minute come on eventually we won't talk to each other in conversation it will just be in my olly memes yes looking hmm oh yeah guy here i'm very dead this one down crossing the road i think he's acting he's
