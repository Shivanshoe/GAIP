someone just died is that right what no no okay that was teammates fire i don't see anyone right is the guy here prone see that 145 marker got him hey it's quite snappy there's a tank or something man pain there's a tank tom oh not enemy though yeah give it a laugh i didn't right there tank two ramirez he's on so that's and are you sure he's here oh god well he's moving no okay uh unless it's a necro tank how do i what's my squad leader command oh uh tank uh c9 it's like right there what did you say thanks c9 mark's on the map oh i pressed the wrong button i'm sorry i pressed the wrong button he just shoveled that man oh god oh god the tanks i'm running across in front of the tank oh god jack why i didn't mean to he's stay down i went to do my voice and it pressed b and just smashed him in the head with a spade my voice is me are you dead no he's not dead you're okay enemy enemy tank marks really close to captain jenkins like just to your right can i stand up now he's just behind that yeah to your right you can see him oh yeah i see him he's not looking at us anymore tom there's a teammate standing on him it's me strudel standing on top of him i do remember that from world war ii out careful it's like literally there behind the behind the earth thing wherever it is what's it called move forward you're gonna sign him what's the name of the tank that sound payoff the payoff just leave it's like let's just hope that that guy gets that thing there's a tiger like right next to him and he's just yeah we're in we're in flavor country now the tiger needs a bit of coercion sometimes can you taste the flavors are we in flavor town oh yeah we are but now i'm going to use my there's some chicken let's have a look here see if we can spot anyone out straight right there's teammates in that forest over there now so maybe we're all right let's continue with our plan though yeah okay i'm gonna put a new outpost down in this little trench oh there yeah there's a guy there's a guy spotted your left jack here you guys you've been getting an angle you guys won by the truck and one just out in the open one dad where's the second guy don't see him son there was one by the truck i don't know if he stuck down or something yeah i can hear him firing what's that noise that's enemy vehicle yeah i don't see the second one oh that's an enemy vehicle right there what is that a little recon tank oh my god it's horrible even to this little forest zone oh god he's leading yourself over that i'm on the strong point i'm gonna have a look down the road for men world war ii men in your area and they're all single and ready to mingle single world war two are you dead no i just got injured what the hell was that i think this is a grenade there's people with a prone with shotguns in here i can hear them is that now right mine's steely wait what are you doing picking grenades out there left right and center can you pick up enemies guns yet there's a grenade right there time in front of us watch out well there's probably people just prone on the points watch out um um um my eyes have been rattled to pieces i think there's like what's that oh that's the enemy tank yeah uh oh that tank might be in trouble i think it's done pulled down look at that all right let's use the cover of that to get in oh it's gone now the smoke just dissipated instantly i thought it was going to stay a bit longer than that there's another plane coming out there we can get to the edge here we might be able to like stay here have a look there's a guy there grabbing his way through enemies yeah i'm gonna move up a bit he's right in front of us oh tom there's a lot of people there yeah i'm moving to your cover one down got to be an outpost there or something you see more here there's one missed they're around people a lot further down further back i guess we've got to get into the meme really we're on their flank here time goblin into these lights this logs a quick reload in before we start what's he doing there okay i'm moving back it's okay where's somewhere see well over that side somewhere i don't know i'm from grenade sounding close that neighbor's bad is that him he's nading in yeah he got him was that the same guy yeah yeah he was the guy who's shooting me their outposts are gonna be around here somewhere i don't see any movement people behind us as well one down oh god two down this direction all right let's push up this way because it's probably they've probably got an outpost to swear then you're the goblin no you got it gobbling it gobbling it always goblin to the goblin dude hopefully there's no one on our left i don't see any outposts oh in front of me just behind it maybe it's a rock sorry oh my god you're left what was it is this the whole garrison of men i didn't see it okay we know where this garrison is down there so that's good we found the garrison oh god there's people in front of me that's what i'm saying three lines there trying to get across to the edge of the map up yeah he's cheering me come on stand still stand still he's got machine gun yeah dim got him you got him nice wait i'm going to spot again there's a guy on the did you get the guy on the rock yeah more to the right of that tom yeah there's further i'm i'm pushing up i can get towards this garrison okay i'm gonna move to where you were yeah moving he's spawning i'm just i'm moving up to the tree line moving again they're all like focused forward i think so it's quite good i see it i can see the garrison there okay he comes oh i can't see at the moment you'll have good range than where i am at this rock yeah here once running towards us nice see the garrison there let's try and move up to it you're gonna have to hold use on that to get rid of it yeah if you can just get to that rock i was out and cover you should be all right hold on about five seconds away down there almost there oh tom lowe's just won i've got a couple of them on do you know attack i'm gonna push in get out there and try because it's unlike the garrisons on 45 second spawn waves i mean if you can get there before they well they battle it i'm on it yeah i think i think there's a yeah i think there's a lot of team there now i'm heading just towards n30 now as well okay i'm getting rid of it nice i write somewhere i don't know where oh that's an enemy jeez what were you doing he was behind a rock man he could have easily turned around at any point and killed me now okay my outfit has actually got someone near it now are they firing up there's people on the actual point they're dealing with i think they're going to sniff out my outpost jack no god it's gone on there's a plane coming yes you just gotta cover all right drive forward i'm gonna use you as cover there's a guy sniping me from the left i'm just running across the field there now this is team play how we're cooking with team play oh god blue just got toasted oh we're nearly capturing it a new outpost down here just in case i see medics running across oh my god you can do it tiger you can do it get him get that recon tank no you're turning your ass to him you're turning your ass to him the tank is hammering that tiger right now i'm watching it all unfold oh yeah but it's suddenly a re-convey he's right do you lefty right a bit now he's moving look down the road and to the right he's moving closer he's coming towards you he's coming towards you get him yes the one shot was it yeah it's like versus recon well i think we need to keep going east a bit right and maybe i can see you now get to this trench am i clear to run over there i mean i don't know jack i mean i'm me no i've been shot from the fro in front of me where i put that move marker in front of you oh yes yeah come on you got him it's a sniper no way he needs to peek again i'll try and i'll try and reveal him with my body i can't see him time in my angle i shall snake forward i need to move up a bit only amount of time before he dials me in you see where i am yeah i see he was just in front of me lying on this barn maybe i saw his head but i missed goblin don't be shot i can't see him tom in front of me behind the barn he's probably probably have got an angle on him i'm gonna keep moving if you can literally get to like just look at the back of that bar and i think you'll see him nearly made it don't see him yet i'm distracted with my body i'm crouching up to the building no come on right there i don't know he must have moved into further my size fine i can spawn nearby i don't know where he is he's very really close to he must be in this trench system going behind him i think i got him i mean there's loads of guys over here getting an angle on him leave the sheets behind you i'm done i'll start spotting a second i'm gonna go for an outpost in a less dangerous position and god dave the sheep's here hey dave's dead let me show him there's a tank seeing him i can hear a vehicle tom yeah it i'm gonna get into your little knock here jack your little christmas oh just killed a medic while they were reviving someone that's bad isn't it i mean that's leaving convention ruins it's more there's a cow here seen by the two guys by that like oil for your fuel tanker the gas tank there is i think you've been shot yeah and there's a guy at the back of the building on the corner i running forward towards zero tanker now keep picking them off tom this is a great position yeah there's like three guys one on the oil tanker now he's dead damn it was that high or low that was that was low you guys got a bunch of strikers see that am i taking them out no you didn't game the guy here just stood still at the wall not moving i know he's stuck now he's not done oh that's the time tom or something moving good soup campbell's soup delicious nutritious perfect with a bit of war in the morning i guess that's what most people ate in the 1940s and 50s because of rations and it just a load of tin soup bread and soup water sauce they called it yeah war sauce i like that oh no we're about to win it's fine it's everything's fine jack in the end it turns out 25 seconds yeah they can't catch them we've got we've done it we won the war we held west bend but look through the spice hole anyway we've got to get at least one kill through this guy's hole come on 15 seconds is this it is this the spice wall yeah there is there's a guy there i saw him even prone or something wait maybe we look somewhere else over to the right a bit more three two i bought it we got one yep got him did i
