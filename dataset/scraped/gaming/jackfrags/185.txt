the bolt is an insanely powerful vehicle in battlefield 2042 right now it's fast armored and can equip a devastating 30 millimeter cannon that chews through infantry so we thought how can we make this even better well what about dropping it on a veto aircraft flying it around and raining down some pain from the sky we weren't even sure if this was going to work and if it did work our objective was to get at least one kill that's all we wanted so let's take a look at what happened it does get pretty crazy if you have fun watching the video leave a like sit back relax and enjoy okay that should stay i'm well i'm in it but now one problem is i can't get off the ground that's it hey hang on it goes backwards oh it's moving it's wow it didn't work it's too tough it needs to be on the front of the condor okay let's try again it has to be on the front like it can't be on the back it weighs me down put your towel down like a pigeon like a pigeon okay okay go go go i need the tail down now there we go there we go okay try again it just kept pushing you forward that jack all right here we go ulti get it right in the middle all right it's coming down don't move that's pretty square in the center as well i think it's going to crash and destroy me isn't it i'll get i'll rep something ready fine oh he's serious missile coming incoming missile guys we need someone's like no but get in hold on wait how in the boxing you can't get in we need another vehicle to jump up or something come on jack get on it okay as well get on you'll have to ride the wing with the rock a missile that's it back a bit more a bit more a bit more it's not very sensitive at the moment that's good the bong can repair you from up there hang on you you drive it hard you gotta go very slowly tom um it's not normal careful not to tilt i mean i'm just gonna try and get one kill i'm gonna die because i'm gonna be out of bounds i'm trying to go forward i'm going forward not terminated we need a ramp or if if someone can spawn under the balcony and you can just put it on the front see like that that's good tom the thing is i might slip off you need to well just pop don't don't go left and right whatsoever just power forward the way to me to me needs to be on the front almost basically almost naturally on the wings oh someone's trying to rock it at you dude no repair just keep repairing i can't go up anymore yeah and then you get wedged so you can't go up anymore okay we'll get in let's just see okay well when he tips forward you won't be able to that's it gets it to me to me it's just gonna slide off though okay yeah sit here right in the front go right a little bit i don't want to move in case it slides that's not me dude yeah but i can't that's the thing if it was on the front get to me oh no left go left a bit okay that's good that's good that's good that's good now if you can you pivot it naturally so it's like that's it using the oh you're going to go square on well that way yeah it's genuinely balanced i can't if i move anymore i worry i'll it's gonna slide off all right where's that guy shooting us yeah it's weird it's it's weird it's weird [Music] it's kind of balanced out a bit genuinely balanced we're going to be guys very very slowly by the time we get there like 50 people will be looking at us well we've got i'm not going to put this the speedy mode on kill that little bird oh it's tilting it's tilting no heal it's falling it's falling cut it down no no no all right come on i've got another one of these look oh my gosh what's hitting us i don't know is it that's it the power to the front are you done it is straight away i need to spin okay but not too much maybe the spin spin the dog spin the dog yeah we haven't tried it with it at the front facing forward yeah yeah okay gonna turn you slowly come on where's the infantry there's loads at sea look loads of sea i'm gonna have to very slowly hover my way over there okay what can it say get down there oh do you see him get him boys out i'm being stuck no no you have to respond yes a kill yeah it needs to be flat ground on a rock otherwise it doesn't it just doesn't okay there's one over here i was trying to get your gun though well what for like there's no reason that's kind of better that's perfect tom all right hold on say that why is this guy shooting ads yeah i don't know well there's the front oh no it's slid yeah i have to try oh no no no no no yeah i can call one time that looks pretty central hold on you're shifting ever slowly right i'm not trying to i know it's just the natural okay that's fine in there okay okay just on the front spine like that that's fine yeah all right okay i'm in the gonna say all right hands three's deployed let's go oh this looks good tom i mean this is i need to i needed to settle though you know it will settle just gotta believe as we need you i mean i'm in the driver's seat of this oh well i'm useless in the driver's seat though i was testing if the zoomie would work the zoomie does not work what the tank no no no no no all right don't worry there's a boat coming it's fine hold on look at that that's perfect placement now get one yeah you sort of lift off into the sky we actually go let's find out into your condor it doesn't look fine on mine my pov is really good thumb it's great it doesn't look fine on mine you're floating away from the vehicle on mine ever just look gently just drifting we're drifting well it has to be gentle you can't you it's men running i don't know if there's any corrections to be done as a driver though whether it's to make it worse you just got to go with it you know yeah but should i try and reverse i don't think so not right now no corrections necessary we'll get there eventually don't worry is there an enemy bolt down there with a superior bolt though we're going to get in to sea with this but it we're just going to take a while to get there yes it's working it's working oh please go down a bit support package ready to drop your bolt uh maybe reverse the tiny bit hit the bolt it wait a bit more no i've got you i've got well again the the the pace what was that oh he's on top of you he's on you i do bung i really hope they recorded that can you go right tom oh no out i mean we're being attacked by something behind [Music] him it's a c4 man again opaque is gonna be back any second i'll get sniped up wait wait yeah that's good that's good you're getting some attack chopper over there see it now now you go forward let me start with firing the missiles okay that's fine oh parachuting in above us i'm i can't no jack it's no no it's too fat ended just kicked him out there's something locked straight away oh good good yeah there's a plane attacking me it's that same guy yeah people have seen what's going on and then they won't leave you be now look can you drive onto the top of the wings from the from the left here there's a tornado coming as well i'm overheated on the repairs that's good that's good yeah get off it a sec that's good we need to get back on i'm dead snipes out okay well if someone needs to shoot at that dxi one guy on the top it's taking off in this guy just not he's dead go go go go go get on i've got a wiggle i've got a wiggle quickly go go i'm gonna get sniped go go go go go go go get one all right now we're gonna go for those guys oh god what on the tower yep right at the top i can barely move this is perfect um get him now let him snipe me it's no baby guys that'll teach you oh god no the tornado though we're tilting forwards it's all fine yes [Music] it's like an ac-130 whenever you jump out on the wings now hold on hold on it's wagging about like yeah it's fine this is the best of the tornadoes coming oh god i see it now i'm on the way i'm on the way i'm sorry i'm trying to tell you oh god oh god i can't believe this is working there's a tank down there tom oh no oh no that's an easy shot for that tank a quick fair and balanced rocket part on the way on some infantry hold on it just killed you actually didn't realize you'd called it in it's slipping oh no no it's rolling you need to get in get in and go back and left yeah yeah back again let's have a look what's happening here let's see if the artwork vehicle is now that's good you can just you jam it in between the back winds it's lovely that i mean you're floating in the air like what no no exactly it looks completely from the pilot's perspective for some reason it looks all right in third person the gunner's seat is is a joy are you falling off no no no no it just looks completely wet oh yeah there's a high in there you're okay there's a hind in there don't just tilt left just start going towards c i'm going that's it that's fine and even though it looks like it's wang from the pilot scope it's actually all right like okay can we straighten it up please it's fine it's fine because i'm just gonna i'm just gonna jump out so i can stand on the wing how are you gonna work there's a hiding down and see you guys needs dealing with okay now it looks normal i mean not normal i think the experiments are over [Music] you
