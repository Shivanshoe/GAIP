after the success of battlefield 3 the sequel promised so much and while it was a slow burner it absolutely delivered we all know the struggles that battlefield 4 faced early on though it's well documented and most of us were there through the pain of the first few months with netcode problems crashes all sorts of issues i don't want this video to focus on the negatives of battlefield 4 however and i want to focus on what made that game great because when all the chips fell into place where they were supposed to be the game was undoubtedly fantastic sales figures backed that up too copies sold at upwards of 13 million by any game standards that's a huge figure and the game actually released in 2013 which honestly feels like a lifetime ago now seven years and three battlefield games have come and gone since then but the memories of the game remained and it still has a healthy player base even today on pc and console i think the first thing we have to talk about is destruction or more specifically revolution when the game was first announced and the marketing campaign kicked off this was the key phrase being thrown around there was only in battlefield and then levolution i remember watching the reveal gameplay on siege of shanghai for the first time in 2013. i was sat in the orpheum theatre in los angeles waiting for the ubisoft press conference to start and staring down at my phone being blown away when that tower began to crumble and fall down completely the idea that in a live multiplayer match you could have this huge building just disappear in the middle of a session which was triggered by the players and changes the whole dynamic of that level was really impressive to me and i'm sure it was to other people too it really gave you that wow moment of course not every map had something as wow and some of them did come across a bit gimmicky but they all had something that changed up the gameplay flood zone for example became well flooded mixing up the entire flow of the level and introducing boats on road transmission the dish gets annihilated and paracel storms sees a destroyer which was stuck in the sea go charging towards land crashing and eventually changing how one of the flags on the map operates overall there were some really cool moments that when you first experienced them for like nothing you'd ever seen before in a game it set the bar high when it came to the weapons it was really an evolution of battlefield 3. with both games being modern shooters there was a lot of crossover in weapons as you would expect there were some new ones too though the ace 23 was a very popular assault rifle i'm sure that you came across it multiple times i really believe there was something intrinsically fun about the light machine guns for the support class in bf4 picking up your favorite and customizing it with the 200 round mag meant that you could go on some absolutely epic back rages the m249 was my personal favorite and with 32 players on the other team you are guaranteed to take at least a few of them out before you put down the attachment system in bf4 was a little bit more refined and customizable too compared to bf3 for example on rifles you could choose between an ergo grip angled grip or stubby grip for your under barrel and then a flash hider muzzle break compensator heavy barrel or even a suppressor as your barrel attachment and each attachment gave you positives and negatives depending on your desired play style and there was a weird system in bf4 where there were multiple attachments that did the same thing but they were called different things and looked slightly different it was purely an aesthetic change for example the potato grip was identical in stats to the stubby grip but looked different same for the ergo and vertical i'm not sure why they did that it was just a nuance of the game perhaps an attempt to have far more visually customizable weapons and maybe we'll see a more in-depth version of that in the future if we get another modern game they toned the suppression down too from bf3 it wasn't as bad and the gunplay became really refined and satisfying when you play bf4 one of the things that you definitely notice perhaps even more so over battlefield 3 is the vehicle-centric gameplay vehicles are incredibly strong in this game especially apcs on maps like siege of shanghai or zavod tanks and apcs can really dominate with a clever driver and so you have to work as a team to take them out there's an infantry player and i think the infantry gameplay is fantastic in bf4 the one thing that's the most challenging is often an lav or an abc they're just so quick and nimble in this game and if they're really paying attention can dodge rpgs quite easily the one thing to remember though with bf4 of course is that if you're in need of vehicle repairs you've got to either rely on a teammate or get out yourself unlike what happened with bf1 and bf5 the battle pickup system that definitely introduced some awesome moments into the gameplay whether it was getting lucky and finding the one shot kill 50 cal sniper on the ground and posting up on a hill somewhere picking people off on an objective that are 200 meters away or grabbing the spawn of the grenade launcher when you just needed it these guns were overpowered and purposefully so and i just appreciated having them in the mix and giving you another option every once in a while when perhaps your typical weapons or your class wasn't doing the job of course as i mentioned earlier though it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows bf4 struggled early on with some pretty major issues with the game involving its core performance and stability i think releasing on five different platforms at once was probably one of the biggest contributing factors but to solve this problem a few months down the line the cte was born the community test environment not a new idea in gaming but the goal of this was to improve the game and ensure that it was working exactly as it should be once that initial goal was realized though having a separate client a separate branch of the game where changes and fixes could be tested by the larger community player base first and then fixed and refined until they were ready for the release build and when the game was stable the cte turned into something else entirely it was now a platform that dice could use to not only test new gameplay features without impacting the core experience but also provide new content avenues the cte was initially needed though because the game was in such a poor state and we can't forget that but as it turned out the cte was actually the best thing that could have happened to bf4 in the long term it enabled things like the community map project to become a reality and this was spearheaded by dice la where the community had a say on all of the design choices on a map from the early theming the block out flag positions you name it play testing of this was available on all stages too and it definitely offered something very different for the battlefield franchise operation outbreak as the map would end up being called was also a great map to play one thing that we haven't talked about yet there was a massive improvement over previous games especially bf3 was the net code and that's an overarching term that's thrown around a lot during the early days of bf4 it was a big sticking point though for a lot of players but thanks to the cte and dice la it was not only brought to where they wanted it to be but it was actually improved significantly beyond what we as players could have imagined the net code the hit registration eventually was on point in bf4 and as far as i'm aware it's still one of the best in multiplayer gaming there was a point where dice la tested high tick rate servers running on the cte something that dice had previously said was not possible so instead of running at the base 30 tick rate they were trialling 60 and even 120 servers that were common in games like counter-strike this means that the server updated more frequently providing a more accurate account of what's going on for all the players at the time they weren't even sure if it would go beyond a cte test but hertz servers became the norm on battlefield 4 and when bf1 and bf5 launched 60hz was the default specification and the hit range on both of those games going forward was great and we've got the cte and the hard work and time that people put into it to thank for that i simply couldn't look back on bf4 and not talk about easter eggs as polarizing as they are to some people they are some of my fondest memories of the game and there's no doubt that they go a long way in actually marketing the game and getting people to talk about it but the way that the community came together in bf4 to help solve common goals and puzzles is something that will never get old to me bf4 had some of the best easter eggs of any battlefield game and recently you've seen other gaming franchises attempt to replicate some of that magic the phantom program and the build up to the megalodon though is probably the one that gave you that oh my god that actually just happened moment when a giant prehistoric shark jumps out of the water and eat you it was just a really special time for everyone involved and of course as i mentioned the mystery the intrigue of the phantom program consisting of four phases with a dog tag available for each you had to enter specific codes to gain access to underground bunkers where eventually the phantom bow was waiting it was a little bit more in-depth than that but that was the gist of it an insane easter egg that lasted a long time and was released in multiple stages there was just some cracking easter eggs and puzzles in this game and it gave the players who cared about that kind of stuff almost a game within a game a new way to play at wrapping things up bf4 it didn't start as a perfect game but as time went on i think bf4 really showed how good it was and today i still think it's one of the best large-scale modern multiplayer shooters out there and a large part of that has to be put down to the cte dice la di sweden even some members of visceral who worked on hardline were committed to ensuring the game turned out to be as close to their vision as possible and if the next battlefield game turns out to be a modern setting then we can only hope that it builds on the foundations of bf3 and bf4 and with that said that is all for today guys do let
