hi everyone and welcome back to more back for blood so i think today we play for a couple hours we should actually finish the campaign and i'm really looking forward to seeing what's at the end of the tunnel for us big thank you to nvidia as well for sponsoring the stream and video today if you notice we are playing today at 4k and streaming at 4k and we're using an rtx 3090 and we'll be enabling dlss and this is supported on rtx gpus and in back for blood nvidia say that it can boost performance by 46 and it uses ai to just increase your frame rate whilst giving you nice sharp images so that means you're just getting a bit extra performance and we're going to do like a live example of it now just to show you guys so if you look in the top right hand corner of your screen you'll see the frames per second i'm just going to go to options and graphics uh yeah we are playing at 4k so at the moment we've got anti-aliasing turned on which is a traditional form of sampling but we're going to use dlss instead and there are different options you can choose we'll keep it on balance for now and we should see the frame rate jump up so we gained about maybe 28 to 30 fps there just in this home section area if you want to learn more about dlss there's a link down in the description below but with that said we're going to continue the fight and i believe that we got to chapter three so that's the last one that we did the grave danger with all the snitches running around the church graveyard and create a new run act 3 let's go with that create run it should put us in a server again i'm playing with johnny lee and paul welsh we had a good time the other day this might actually be worse it should be good thank you everyone coming along for the live stream if you're watching this as a video welcome on board christian thanks for the five appreciate that what's up robert kevin joseph chris ma bumblebee you like the new logo well it's gold to celebrate 10 years so this month will be 10 years on youtube for me and i thought that it would be cool to do a bit of a rebrand for the 10-year anniversary so there's a new logo there's a watermark there's a couple of graphics if you go

armored lance behind us behind his finest they breed in the water who says that why but it says here on the wall be a messy place to do it i mean like it's not an easy place to do it in the water people think it's a good idea but it's not it's not or maybe it is for zombies maybe they do differently here i thought they bite people i thought that was how they brewed it they don't beat like bite each other yeah but they bite like humans and that's where all zombies come from hello can you go easy little shot again sorry again i think we have to go in here which is totally i don't know well we

visual recoil in this game hey thomas retro no problem are you see like are your mouth feeling better today or is it still pretty bad hey giovanni does the game have pvp it does but it's it's not great in my opinion i think it could have been a lot more in depth i really like the pve though 20 accuracy oh that that one's really good the beep boop winter thank you for the two it's very kind here atgif it's under casual norwegian what happened to the logo it's temporarily changed for the 10th anniversary of the channel i've been on youtube for 10 years now so i thought be cool to kind of

trained beavers to smuggle in dynamics it's quite wild you should look it up it's very good i'll take a look later previous tests have been shall we say somewhat unpredictable germans do that with dogs as well unpredictable there's no dogs they just have to use beavers do what you have to do to ensure smuggle beavers wow i'm out can i steal that smithy's lost contact with a group of scouts in

was trying to get out the maze but then the circle came in and i said oh you can't that's i can't believe that we need uh molotovs i think yeah if he stuck behind that first gear it's easy if we all set ourselves on fire maybe no no oh i picked a card again uh i didn't want that card all right or whatever all right i bought a molotov yes get molly's from what i've seen she's got quite a sense of humor that was pretty brutal i have two molotov there we go excuse me sorry that probably smarts right okay so we've got to go through the greenhouse birds here watch out watch out the amount of me getting shot but you guys it's unreal i don't know what you're talking about oh at least the boss is here earlier oh he's spawning okay that's fine that's actually better for these birds just fall

dead now so it doesn't matter good job johnny really hates the birds what are you waiting for christmas we're problem is whenever there's a big pile of cash near the birds the cash is more illuminated than the birds in the dark so you just have to get the cash cash birds matt thank you for the 12 months thanks matt thanks matt thanks matt best year ever even better than my first year of marriage he said don't let your wife hear that matt your husband if you have a nade you can kill the birds yeah we figured that out just now loki i think was did you guys use a nade or a molotov what did you do barrel barrel barrel near the birds love it why would yeah does it just kill them all i suppose i can't believe for this whole time i thought i was selecting one of these three cards yeah we can't believe that either but it's true well what does it like why does it let you hover over one of them to light them up that would suggest that you're selecting one of them it's finally it's okay we all make the same mistake i'm pretty sure i thought that as well when i started playing it johnny just doesn't care at the moment birds i'm going through those goggles don't look comfortable johnny yeah they're a lifesaver i mean he's got his eyes closed adam if you really look the eyes are closed yeah judging me jack stop eyes hearing me [Music] right you can now have three three things because i bought one three pipe bombs oh sweet that's really useful i can only have two oh i can have three i bought it okay you'll have a card somewhere oh it's a healthy boy in here i mean johnny i've got the biggest scope in the world on an mp5 not a big one just like a little reflex or something this one's too much i can't wait to swap it uh yeah it's a bit annoying when you've got like a close range you've got with a longer scope on it and it's like ah no i don't want to i don't want to see what's on that way away does that just close when we leave i mean we might need it then barrels yeah he's

friends 100 edition of bf2042 i've also bought my friends other games too want to know if it's worth it you seem like a really good friend to have ice picker walrus as i said earlier like if you want to try this game get it on game pass first check it out see if you like it i think if you want a challenge that even the normal difficulty is quite challenging and you'll be replaying and strategizing a bit more so you could get a fair few hours out of this game the pvp i'm not a big fan of i don't really like it that much i think it could have been a lot a lot better much more in depth how do you get two primary guns you get a you get a card i've got a card hey zeus what's up hold me i've got your buddy don't worry it's a popular song by jack little dave and ira shuster the song was published

it was wicked wait what was up there nothing nothing no you get on the roof and you could like go around to the hall and then you could like sit on the little river and look through them and there's at the top when people are in there doing stuff like exams did you ever get caught when you were up on the roof yeah probably yeah i got caught up on the roof by the art room once [Music] did you abide and come down instantly or we always used to be like oh sorry mr football got stuck up here oh you just made an excuse did you store footballs up there as an alibi no there used to be a lot of footballs up there though you could you make a lot of money you could always like to be fair you could go on the roof and not just make because like when the bank came to school when hsbc came to

absolutely but definitely dead now i feel like all we did was just drive the bus off a cliff there for no reason we shouldn't have done that that was irresponsible i mean let the handbrake off and run out the back sure hmm we saw that level i enjoyed that just you know this is school it's three stars zombie game school are we gonna get to go to prison that's i think that's the last time there might be a prison what hasn't there been what stereotypes for a zombie game farmers a farmer's market hospital we've been to farm to several farms farm police station we've done a brilliant hospital we have we have done a bridge we did the bridge at the first level with the ship oh we can go across the bridge no we didn't come back airport that's a good one oh look hospital oh bam right on cue is this an army base is this a medical base uh an army medical barracks remembers an army base yeah we live in them as well shopping mall that was left for dead two wasn't yeah all adam cards are getting out of hand now look at that when you're fighting outside that car that's in the mall i love that level i'm going to give team 10 health about 10 um aircraft carrier deck yeah we haven't had that hey mike jack likes living on the edge no healing right quinton act four today yeah we're doing everything today we're gonna complete the game actually like that character looks like an actress which one the one that you're playing as adam which one who do you think she looks like i played um was it batwoman in the first series of batman right she's in she's in uh john wick two i want to say or john wick three purple m4 hello [Music] you can pick up a new attachment which forces the old one off but that's it is anybody taking a longer kick thing yes okay i'll take uh i'm taking two pipe bombs someone get molotov maybe i've got four fight bombs stun guns really important ready to meet your maker what does the stun do if you're trapped by a spitter or something you just press it instead of relying on a teammate okay it's only the spider that i have a problem with the rest i can just press it escape i think you guys are open john [Applause] if you can't if they're near you shoot the exploding head ones in their chest rather than the head and then they don't explode i mean i hope we're not wearing masks guys i mean this looks quite infectious would you agree well we must be immune to some degree otherwise we'd already be coptic right yeah i think you're right you really explained that early like we should have advisers got vaccinated as soon as possible and we washed our hands and that's why and that's why okay we can turn into zombies some really cool level design in this game like the art is incredible i feel like it's got better the longer we've played yeah i agree with you first levels was quite generic maybe come i've got on pipe bombs by the way if anybody needs me to throw one we might we might be immune but we can still be killed by being turned thrown apart you know or eaten taken underground by the huge that's not here you have to shoot that in head well at least there isn't a line oh no this is e.t i'm going to be upset it's a bit easy isn't it elliott fun ah oh good i i mean you walked over that he kind of watched it yeah i did i thought someone i thought like one of you would have had a smoke oh we don't carry some extra brush banana that's johnny's favorite strat guys 80 okay so apparently one of the npcs makes a comment to the general about being immune at sometimes i think you hate me i don't hate you for there but by the grace of god go i what the hell just a moment i'm gonna put myself back together here i think it's a friendly fire line oh fun fair fun fair now that one we've just done medical barracks and funfair in the same level i mean i don't know if we're going there though but like there's a ferris wheel once you've completed the batch then i suggest jump peak how do you reckon that big lads arm gets that big oh no watches a lot too don't worry about me this is one of the containers there this looks like it there's a box here just a minigun mini gun here talk it yeah you know go on no uh i do yeah i think we'll need that there's things on the wall the zombies punched through the door oh just add the alarm doesn't go off what about here oh no oh no oh no chemicals in here is that the way forward adam i don't know where the way forward i've been spamming around too much i mean i've got i've got some chemicals on me at the moment i don't know if there's more though i can't go through this orange dog you've been through here johnny no i stopped here to kill things there's another door here actually i go in this chemicals okay that's a dead end i've got we've got chemicals but we've got chemicals yeah we went through there no more big lads out here surely magnifying glasses showed it it's over there oh and once again the game is taking pity on us yeah we're being a little smooth i got it right did that open up something else then do we go back this was a dead end to the bus it's still a dead end i've got a thing this time over there we gotta go that way uh i don't know back this way maybe have you got that look have you got that little plus sign on your map or something yeah yeah that's the um the laboratory do you say laboratory or laboratory laboratory it's gotta be through this orange tent though was it this way where are you going i don't know because that's we've backtracked a bit here but i don't see a way forward maybe something else opened up get some light here i think what's in here no ignore that this big building here oh this door here that's got a big symbol on it this works oh did you just open that okay good job johnny is the finder and the healer oh this looks sick reminds your world was that [Music] the green bit i'm a bit premature there mate sorry i'll unlock that door here go away oh we're gonna have to go down there man he's gonna be a boss isn't that here

here's your human nature at its finest is that good here are we ready for the opening of the gate uh hang on jack's miles away no i'm right that's right it's full world was there i mean we could shoot them through the gate oh it would make a noise so this is a prison and a fun fair and a hospital all at once all at once insane what though big lad watch out watch out for the moon you pushing forward throwing a pipe bomb [Applause] i'm pressing another button this is absolutely insane i love this oh you need to god anyone else got a pipe bomb yeah i've got one next you behind this guy you good good yeah right there this is the least safe room that we've been in the entire time because it's actually made of plastic wow it's made of thin plastic we're in a tent [Music] that was great that was cool level i'm definitely writing that you know what i'd want to rate that five we're gonna go all the way up get that five if i could later on i'm gonna write the level designers a nice letter dear level designers my name is jack frags and in my spare time i like to make videos on why am i writing like a section i have a channel that has like people following it and i have a twitter account and can i have a free copy of your game please and i will make a video for you and i will send you the link also i really like this level thank you check and do it in crayon who do i address it to mr back for blood i miss the back footbed here mr black does anyone know where he lives robbie williams back for blood okay magic grenade magic remains what phillips is right offensive the fuse oh it's the blue stuff that the guy was firing from the artillery cannon charming wow i can carry four of them now let's say we have some or we can mutation well i think we have to use them sparingly then right head out and find some test subjects how to get free games i mean i think it worked did you say it worked i'm gonna buy that but i can in all seriousness if you sent a letter like that and it was in crayon you would probably get a free copy does it have to be in crown you have to also do each letter in a different color no i can't i don't know if i can be bothered with this free copy of back for blood and what were we to do please tell me i still are we supposed to be doing these grenades did we just throw it this is just oh my god oh they'll run towards it and explode dumbasses that's cool t5 grenades oh we know they work right do we have to drop down now i guess oh oh no there's a big lad it's an ogre well don't worry we've got the op grenades [Music] i mean he's instantly dead it works yeah great work easiest we've ever fought in our lives ever ever in the history ever is this oh i feel like the game is really building this up to something even bigger there's going to be a boss fight there's going to be massive boss right absolute monstrous boss fight two ogres three ogres it's gonna be like it's gonna be a tall boy but made out of ogres it's like a transformer that'd be great that's a great idea it'd be like power rangers like all of the bunnies will instantly be oversized and they'll all like merge destroy the nest i'm gonna go eat some grenades into the nest yeah do it jack what's going on here whenever you're ready yeah that works oh my god they all just explode are you guys throwing the you're gonna throw the grenades i don't want to go to the doctor for that oh my god why am i my lump either oh my god [Music] i don't believe this i threw the t5 grenade at him it bounced off him and then hit back hit me back oh my god there's another one like he literally bounced off him it's all boys [Music] oh no johnny's being dragged away just just find just there's lots of nodules around everywhere i guess we just have to get in there what is going on we should have stayed up on the high ground [Music] [Music] i mean i'm ruined adam can you cover me a second i can heal can i not use one for the food plate already no that's me down right here you're i mean it's just specially infected everywhere i think we just need to be throwing all the grenades you know i um i'm on my own if you get me okay i'm coming oh i'd have found a nodule i have to shoot the nodules and then shoot the nest right i don't know if i'm going to make it johnny i don't know [ __ ] the nest is behind you grenade [Music] bring them to me keep running back forth over me there we go there we go oh no oh no thanks to the heel there okay i'm clean all right i'm trying to sprint to you yeah i don't think i can hold on dude i mean this guy's just rubbing it in now oh my god that was so close we've got any hills no good heavens no jack you've got defense no good heaven i'll see you on twitter i hate this oh not again no oh it's endless you're coming in guys [Music] i'm the last one though i wonder if we can just run over there have you got any hills nope no i haven't come here there's no heels it's over [Music] it's over i think we need to um stick together a bit more right jack if you could stop messing around yeah we can actually okay does that mean no continuous remaining so i mean we've got to start the whole game again i think we i think we lost i think it's down that's the first time we've died isn't it no earlier didn't we we died earlier no it reaches no we didn't if we gotta start the whole game again now yeah let me start from the very beginning i don't want to start the whole game again nightmare mode thanks for watching this game everyone we should have a checkpoint there we got a lot to do and very little time you kick you all out the lobby you did yeah i'm in the i'm in the barn hold on i'll send you invites that's right trying to equip a primary weapon i've got the primary one i didn't think i need to equip that double primary card this last level uh yeah i think so there's just one more after this yeah i've only got um a knife for my melee uh canola because i'm using two weapons maybe if i had an accent it would have been better campaign do i have to create a new run yes t5 it's not saved it from the um okay not like this it's not saved there we'll see you in the next one i'm going wait wait wait unless i'm doing something wrong here i can start act three yeah but from where though oh the start no one wants to see that t5 uh no a friend need you can start from there i can't start from there is it because that login server was ruined maybe what about you guys can you guys start from like i can start from a friend in need lee [Music] what do you do campaign yeah and then do what picky difficulty yeah and then where can i start from the crew act one oh you sure i mean the other padlocks on i think it's just not it's not saved the progress for some reason maybe it's done in chunks because it's got the start of that second chunk of chapter three yeah because we didn't make it to the end no it doesn't matter if you look what it says it says like for example the body dump it says complete road to hell to unlock the starting point we did road to hell i guess then it's because the profile service keeps going down and it's not saving progress which is what the warning message says when it pops up so we could start from a friend in need that's where johnny has listened to the no a friend in need is the one before the school do you want to do it or do you mind let's do it jack all right well it's up to johnny then johnny has to start the campaign right which one oh i can do it hang on ready yeah i think that's just the time it's quite like it is annoying it's okay it happens explosive sandwich it's all good explosive so much that's a good name what are you gonna get to see now is the speed run version uh actually i can't start running this is it i can't create one for some reason is it because i'm the host how do i become host i don't know i'll join you become a host can i promote you what if i i'll just kick you all and then johnny sounds great we'll join johnny's game it still

wall lee yeah who's our family okay this is good adam come here oh god wait wait ammo cool well we have to go around the side into the gymnasium unusual for the ksc to leave behind equipment things must have gotten bad are we all here have you got if we don't have a toolkit though do it i do okay we're gonna need that money run ah you can see that before last second how are you yeah set it up

watch out i got the battery so we toss the fireball and whatever it is it's big you need to get out of there can we get out yeah yeah probably no you just slide down yeah it did that to me and it let me just poop out earlier we've got to focus here guys because the ogre can come out onto the roof yep i'm ruined [Music] [Music] oh my god hey [Music] are you kidding me why is there a snitch can we run can we make a run they're hungry no or do we have to kill it i can't remember this i'm doing it i'm running hi i don't know where to though where'd you get oh no it's up here you got so many zombies behind you right now what's up yoga he's gonna hit me down over here we turn to a bus turn to a bus come to the bus i have a bus there come a bus become a bus i became the bus done jesus oh my god that one wasn't fun in the dark no it's way better in the day that was worse that was not that hard when we played it earlier it felt like there was way more zombies oh we did it chat [Music] this is back to where we were wasn't it no no this is the oh my this is the prison fairground medical center yeah and then it's after that isn't it then after that although i felt like this one we could probably get through it pretty quick yeah we just had to know to find the canisters and then we lost the door didn't we you just want pipe gun pipe pipe pipelines for days pipe guns no bombs for those pipe guns i want a gun that fires pipe bombs yeah pretty sure they have that duke nukem ferocious boss ridden defeat the ball now this can be a big horrible boss on this one wicked and ferocious as well in the dark again 25 percent accessory damage that feels useful wow that like it it is the dark end yay accuracy i like this rpk i feel like it's good it was depressing in the new call of duty you can be the dog right i have to buy a rifle because the uh the vector's not the one i mean i've got the most insane sniper shotgun you've ever seen does it just bang things from a distance no but it it looks like it pretends to on the left tall boy sorry so these spiky lads explode now and leave you on the floor that's like the worst role yeah that's awful that and we have that on that final level oh did we maybe that's why i was taking so much damage then look at i mean you run through that and you just get wasted you all rightly yeah yeah i don't see anyone's name on it what school anthem paul this is horrible this card coming out of the backpack i mean the last bit when you're in that corridor with these that's going to be awful stitch somewhere is that what the spot is a snitch it's here i guess we just go past it the spikey would definitely on last time not the other on the floor yeah we can leave him just go fast oh my god it's not funny is it no it's not that's what i'm saying the last bit in the corridor ruined yeah we're in a lot of trouble actually yeah we have to like push through the goop i've only got one pokemon though push through the goop maybe you should go up oh my god the energy behind you lee god damn it quick you're gonna take damage there you need to reload what causes you to explode is it a head shot or a body shot just anything i think you should be able to find the chemicals nearby once you've completed the batch we'll fly in breaker breakers okay we've picked up that car where's the breaker there he is molly anyone nice he's got armor in his weak spot i'm literally out of smg why is he made of metal because he's ferocious [Music] sometimes i think you hate me i don't hate you okay we're there but that wasn't that bad thank you for the ammo johnny quite mechanically sound this game i like the uh i like the shooting mechanics well that's off here oh this got bad last time didn't it oh no glad something will stick me this is one more year yeah we have to check for the specimens did somebody check this building no i'll go armature boys again there's not one in here as far as i can tell you reckon this is where the game screws you and it just it knows when you only got one door i think i think the game screwed jack quite a while ago [Laughter] oh my god see anyone's name on it hey commando what's up need to keep a pace french onion john marston john marston in the jack guys i didn't realize cowboy the real john marshall yeah well no i've put mental scope on this gun i didn't mean to do that all right ready for the pain big round me still all the things healthier you might as well use it am i pleased to see you yeah this is gonna be awful we're just gonna have to stagger our pushes i think but like they don't stop do they i think that might be the problem i don't know i don't have any pipe bombs either do you guys i've got no idea you've got two they're gonna come and clutch here take this thank you you're gonna need more ammo okay good to go wicked human nature at its finest okay everyone ready ready yeah i think we use the pipe bombs at the gates rush to the gates just as much as we can here we go oh man keep moving keep moving what'd you need johnny on the ground yeah we basically just got to shoot the stick together spam the howl out of those special grenades yeah we have to shoot the three little things on each of the nest modules we got to prioritize that we'll go clockwise around the map yeah i'll get to like that good plan have i thought about playing war thunder okay i've played it in the past it's not my kind of game though anymore i understand why people like yeah it's free to play and everything um but yeah it's not for me that's why cadbury won't sell you five fingers of fudge that's why it's always a pack of four you guys crack me up each of the nests i think that's a good strap as long as we stick together let's go all right two grenades one grenade oh yeah we don't have the perk anymore yeah you can get can you get two now yeah nice i carry four well what matters is that you succeeded admirably now what say we have some fun and put your hard work to the test these ones don't explode i just dropped them accidentally i mean do that idiot there's loads out here though we need yeah we have to stick together and what were we to do please tell me i still don't i suggest we focus on the job that's all we got to do we've got to stick together and do that simple all right clockwise we go hold up wait wait wait for me and johnny ready okay adam take point this way first grenades yeah grenade out grenade's there where did he come from okay look for the blobs i've taken so much damage already two blobs all right go get the left one okay hit the main okay i'm gonna have to heal johnny watch out i'm going to open this get some more grenades around this way big blob there someone open that on the left watch out this is where a big guy spawned before yeah it might be different though this time you're still together here open any crates that you go past it saves uh grenades grenades let's do a hit me right now keep moving what is happening to me why am my breath ogre i need to reload grenadine yoga grenade yogurt guys okay shoot it shoot it shoot the yoga i won't bother with it i don't know if we should yeah yeah good point maybe we'll come back for it if we if this is an even bigger boss at the end here it's gone keep going left clockwise guys clockwise after we destroyed that thing in the middle come on got it think about it yeah shoot the big lad just threw two things away you don't want to do that oh [ __ ] there's a lot of them there don't just keep keep coming badly keep coming back you're okay grenades see the thing boy you might want to heal i'm connie that was what we had to do the first time yeah we didn't we weren't playing together though were we such a man yeah we were like oh open [Laughter] space should just keep this helicopter yeah stay there because i can be more efficient how about role-playing as a beaver why not let us do that why do you need to see that in the cutscene let's do that why is that guy outside sound fisher [Applause] [Applause] surprise look [Music] what the [ __ ] is that universe is putting us in our place mr walker thank you husky all right let's not go to the ground let's stay in the helicopter and shoot it from the sky we've got the blue stuff drop it in the mouth we've got one shot let's make it count we only got one shot one opportunity do not miss your chance to blow do it put it in the mouth in the mouth [Music] [Music] zombie godzilla [Music] i don't remember the numbers of multiple buildings of people to go [Music] yeah i reckon that's what we're gonna do we're gonna take it down from the inside we've got a this is the last level i think this will be easier than what we just did you reckon yeah it's kind of like a problem that's of jack frags just a big yellow log sorry i don't know this will be harder to prove a point that zombie is me getting out of bed in the morning before coffee says you left the game like well it said johnny left again for me that's interesting please in my game so johnny yeah you've left the game jack is the problem no we're all here oh it takes you back here you made the right choice let's do it and continue you want to refresh your loadout now is your chance it should it should say act 4 there's only one level in act four it says like three can you click does it not work does it not work for jelly is it that save the checkpoint for jelly you can if i go to create a run it's um act 4 should i assume it's fine it's just it's a song oh yeah no no no no that's not it didn't save it guys you can do act 4 can you okay thank god for that i was getting worried there interestingly i couldn't continue but i had to set up a new one johnny you hear me hearts like that dude it would be the most unsatisfying walkthrough ever you get right to the end and then slip everyone would unsubscribe how to complete the game play it twice wait wait let's play it twice it's fine don't worry chat it's fine
