hi everyone hope you're doing well today we're taking a look at an update from dice on the future of battlefield 5 so every now and again they do a community broadcast and they've just put one out there today and inside it they've addressed some really interesting and important topics of discussion for the game arguably the most important one being a kind of semi revert of the time to kill let's look into this down so there's a bit of an introduction saying thanks for enjoying the Pacific Maps and talking a little bit about community games and then it goes on to say for many of you here the biggest change of the chapter came in the form of our recent weapon balancing and then it goes on to talk about a upcoming patch 6.2 and it says that in that patch they will be publishing a series of further changes designed to address the learnings based on your feedback and game data for details will be shared after we've launched update 6.0 that's the next fact but in short you're going to find that in close quarters much of the same recall and rate of fire that your previously accustomed to will return we will continue to operate a damage model that ensures that weapons that are designed to be lethal in close quarters will still do less damage beyond 30 meters than experienced in patch 5.5 point-o was the Pacific one if you weren't aware however we're making adjustments to the damage curves to ensure that the damage drop-off doesn't feel as instant or severe weapons that should be more effective at ranges such as the semi-auto rifles and pistols carbines will have their damage drop-offs extended ensuring that they regain a purpose closer to their design and perform significantly better at range similar changes are also being made across machine guns and assault rifles and we'll keep you updated as we finalize the design and move them into a shippable state so this is what I mean by a semi revert of the time to kill so while this won't be a full revert they're not just going to go back to 5.0 values they will be extending the ranges of a lot of these weapons and I think that's a good thing because I'm kind of sick of having potato assault rifles and semi-auto and for example I don't think the game has been as fun for me since that time to kill update dropped it just made so many guns feel weak and arel and I'm really glad that they're looking at this again and maybe this will be a positive step for the game so damage drop offs will extend which means that you will be more lethal at range so the initial wording is a bit unclear there's not much detail there but there were a few comments from part Welsh the community manager on reddit where he replied to people's questions and this gives us a bit more insight into what's actually going to happen here there's a guy here called sf seventh and he said okay so if I understand correctly the damage and recall values will return to what they were in 5.0 but with the gentle damage drop-off beyond 30 meters is that correct and part Welsh replied for the most part that's a good summary if you factor in that there are places which need to be rebalanced anyway which would create places where that's not necessarily true so it's not 100% accurate but you're still thinking about it in the right terms and this one here from smk gaming where he quoted that part in the post where they say that much of the close quarters will have the same recall rate of fire that you're accustomed to and then so is this Update 5.0 previously or 5.2 five point two point two previously if 5.0 I see this as a positive and part Welsh said 5.0 is the baseline we're working from for the next set of revisions to be clear it won't be a full revert of all the numbers there's inevitably some weapon balance that needs to happen hello type 2a but we do intend to improve the damage weapons are doing at range and we want to smooth out those curves so whilst you're going to see performance much closer and more familiar to 5.0 it's not a full revert to that behavior so at least 5.0 is the baseline for what they're doing here this will be much closer to the original numbers than what we got at the moment which I think in the community most people don't really enjoy so for me I think this is a good thing for the game it won't be a full reverse of how it was of course no one outside the studio has actually played or tested this as far as I know so we don't know how close it will be to the 5.0 damage values but maybe we're going back in the right direction now I hope so now there is more to the community broadcast about what's of coming in update 6.0 and there is something in here that worries me a bit update 6.0 focuses on providing you with all new content to set the scene for our next chapter so we're going to get a new map new weapons and new gadgets the new map is I'd guess the jungle map that's been teased so far but this is the bit that I'm not sure about in chapter 6 we will continue to move weapons and gadgets out of weekly rewards and into Chapter rank rewards as we've seen a great response to that throughout the war in the Pacific we've seen new weapon ownership double thanks to this approach in Chapter five and so we're keen to see how we will improve that across our next chapter we've also tweaked the Earned rate of chapter X PA end-of-round to better reward players who place higher on the scoreboard to ensure that your performance across the board is better rewarded there will otherwise be a handful of focused vehicle balancing changes performed in update 6.0 as well as a small selection of fixes and changes to maps that we were able to identify and develop solutions for at the end of the year a 6.2 update is targeting a more expansive set of fixes and adjustments so bear with us as we work through the issues that you've highlighted to us so far in 2020 we're on it and we'll keep you updated over the battlefield Trello as soon as we're ready to kick off chapter 6 so the bit that bothers me a bit here is the inclusion of more weapons and gadgets in the chapter rank rather than as weekly rewards and they say that when they put those weapons in the chapter rank xp new weapon ownership doubled now what that means is if you remember when the Pacific launched in the chapter rank XP that's the one that's got like 40 levels and might take to a while but there were actually three guns in there there was the jungle carbine the revolver and the Japanese pistol you could unlock these pretty early on in the chapter they weren't not difficult to get hold of and grind but remember that if you want to skip those levels you can actually use boeing's which is real money to get to those milestones so if for the next chapter all of the new guns and gadgets are in chapter XP rather than weekly tides of war rewards in theory if you wanted to on day one you could just spend a load of money on points and unlock all of the new guns and gadgets straight away some people might be fine with that because they don't have time to grind the weapons themselves and maybe they can afford to just buy them all but I think that most people playing battlefield 5 wouldn't put any money into this and therefore they'd have to grind for these new wet and gadgets and I know I'm playing devil's advocate here but the problem with this for me is let's say one of the new guns is equivalent to how good the type 2 a is and that just happens to be right at the end of the chapter XP so for people grinding it depending on how long it takes if you don't want to pay money then you might not have that weapon for a few weeks where is the people that can afford to can just buy that straight away that isn't fair and if it is a very good weapon or broken in some way and it's not going to be fixed for a few weeks or whatever this starts to cause a problem of course I've made an assumption there but I think it's a reasonable thing to be concerned about and how people feel about this depends on how far along in the chapter rank XP all of these guns are if you could unlock them all between like 48 hours of play I think that's acceptable but if the majority of them are weighted towards the end of the chapter XP there might take you like 20 to 30 hours to get there that's when the pay2win branding will get stamped on you and that's not a good place to be for me personally I wouldn't put weapons and gadgets in a system that you could pay real money for and instead I'd want to put more focus on the weekly tides of war rewards maybe do two a week or something and make them more obvious for the players and let them know that these new things are in the game and unlockable and here's how you work towards them I don't think this is a good move and I'd rather die stressed kept chapter xp stuff - cosmetic stuff only I know in the past we had stuff like premium where yes you had to pay to get access to assignments that would unlock the new guns for you but I feel like the gaming industry has moved on from that point now and it's better for all of the players across the board being able to experience everything together note also that die said new weapon ownership doubled they didn't say new weapon use doubled they just said ownership so of course if people are just playing the game a chapter XP is going to rank up over time and they're just naturally going to unlock the guns whereas with the weekly tides of war you've got to do specific things so even though new gun ownership doubled there were those people actually using gear this is a problem with visibility and showing people that they have these new things to use and how to get them my take on it what do you guys think let me know down in the comments below with that said after this update it was a bit vague not much detail in there to be honest still no update on team balance auntie Qi and vehicle customization but I am glad that they're looking at those damaged values again because the game definitely hasn't been as fun for me as I said since that 5.2 patch the main issue I think though that dice have here is the they're flip-flopping and it doesn't look like there's a clear vision or control over their own game I think dice need to start owning their decisions from the start and sticking as close to their original designs as they can because all this kind of thing does is so distrust within the community and it also can have a big negative impact on how people feel about the next Battlefield game after what they've been through with bf5 will they be so forgiving next time I'm not sure with that said let me know your thoughts down in the comments below thank you for watching guys if you enjoyed this video leave a like if you
