strung me up there didn't they flesh hooks is there anything that i can steal in here oh yeah the crimson glass i remember hey they've gone oh that's gonna need a lockpick isn't it yeah that looks

statue i'll be angry if it is fluid can i just smash everything yeah i can yeah i'll teach you i was a little shiny here where have they taken rose oh okay those things have come about the ground now

mean i played this on ps5 oh this is on pc got it maxed out ray tracing's on and everything oh that environment detail though is so good let's smash some more stuff up property damage oh okay so that's back there excellent can we head upstairs the wine room that's open can fluid there's something here isn't there it kind of looks like you have to put a bottle of wine in there doesn't it noises outside i don't like that oh is that above me maybe they're walking above me oh no no no no no all right hello i feel like i'm being watched i can put the eye in there i'm just going to smash this first okay so i have to examine this doing the inventory maroon i examine take that out of there and then we can put it back where it belongs like get in there more secret passageways more evil ladies i haven't cut open a man in a while whoa let me string you up no slice you've already done that and just watch you literally just did that dad which would you prefer uh neither i can't hold back any longer you bloody leave me alone lady all right this way stay away from me we're back in the cellar again it was my first day working at the castle today i was most shocked to see the other stuff of all women yeah no men that work here the men are just the prisoners apart from that cowboy dude and does the duke count to someone who works here or is he just a traveler that sells stuff no no i can see the lady lady i would like that bottle of wine please i need that locked it behind her i guess we go down into the depths i kind of like that you don't have to switch to your knife you can just quick press it this room as well look at this this must have taken so long to put together trust in the light so we've got to light both of those just give them a nudge get this one there it is a simple puzzle but interesting nonetheless there's a horrible torture device chair there i'm glad that i've got a flashlight though is that a pig it looks like a pig oh my god candidates rejects so they're testing something here aren't they using all sorts of medicines is that a brain in a jar it's all smushed up in there syringes i guess we go this way there's some bodies hanging nope i don't like it weird drawings robust appetite unstable i mean i've got a robust appetite that's what mcdonald's is for okay that got me again that got me the first time when i played the demo unbelievable and here's the monsters i can hear them lads yeah i know you're here somewhere [Applause] uh there was another one how do they take so many shots i'm just gonna run past although you do get money for killing them a crystal skull yes please okay dead good i need to try this new pistol a powerful customized handgun equip shortcut let's have a look oh man check that out it's got a suppressor on it and everything oh nope so many bullets i think that was actually pipe bomb i think that was less bullets than the previous ones though and i guess that you could upgrade it too right make it really chunky now there's more oh there's there's loads oh he nearly got me excuse me coming through coming through nope i don't really want to waste my ammo on these guys you stay down there that's where you live that's fine i need a key for i that believe cassandra you're against all this mess nope cassandra didn't do anything all right that doesn't that's not effective at all which tools do you prefer i don't prefer any tools so no we just gotta run we gotta run we gotta run i need blood no blood for you lady wet no no no no no no no bullets cannot harm thing stop that i won't forgive you you bastard oh right time to get the shotgun out feel no pain this can't be just die not like this we gotta the crystal torso so they don't like the cold the glass shot out and she started hating life so that's their weakness i don't know that was awesome though is that one of the sisters dead then i mean mommy's not gonna be happy with that there won't be any milking tonight let me tell you delicious there it is beautiful we've got some supplies in here too maybe i should heal weird animals there a little box what did we get a recall compensator equip parts inventory to weapons put that on there we just upgraded our pistol there can i crash some shotgun yeah i need the meds though don't know really and gunpowder that well that was kind of our first boss fight i think that was awesome this is back in the the wine room nearly it's a gorgeous table beautiful spread and there's big mama's chair right there compared to the little ones oh man this game's too too much fun it was yeah straight ahead put it in there passage and a little box or the courtyard key that's huge big chunking courtyard key the big guy's in here oh we meet again duke why are you here well there's coin to be made and have you found your daughter no if she is truly here the lady of the castle would have kept little rose in her private chambers would she not tell me to ask the very same why don't you take a look maybe you'll get lucky and speaking of looking care to make a purchase i've got some stuff to sell you mate shall i choose something for you three crystal fragments two crystal skulls a crystal torso the crimson glass the statue you're loving that look that's 20 grand right there 20 grand as always a trustworthy fair exchange yes it is i could actually upgrade the firepower of the shotgun yeah i think that's a good idea so i think if we go through the dining room that may lead us shall i give you the tour nope give me the top no don't give me the tour [Laughter] oh she's probably stay away mother said sail but i think you're delayed no no no no no no one's delicious uh is it here atmosphere open it open it okay right i don't think she can come out here because it's cold and what is this place i've got to get to her chambers though the door over here that needs a key looks like a hidden room or something doesn't it that's a giant door definitely locked this one maybe oh there she is you think she's going upstairs to her chambers and we'll follow her keep it sneaky oh man look at this place i kind of wish this was a real building you know be really fun to just look around it wouldn't be fun to have to deal with the giant lady and the vampires and everything but i'd like to visit one day what have you done to my daughter oh is that a map hey beautiful that looks a bit suspicious give me one second i don't know if we should go in there just yet it's like gunpowder there right i don't know what this is is this her chambers something what the hell that's gotta be blood beautiful statues what to say women are blind to male advances but the poor shall take their chances to give their lord their bounty zone so that soon the wine may flow women are blind to male advances can we turn it oh yeah we can turn it and we're gonna leave it there and what was the other bit the poor shall take their chances to give their lord their bounty shown so if we turn this one right and then this goes there that's it i love a riddle oh it's all drained oh no how does she fit down here i wonder how tall she actually is like what eight feet looks like it what the oh it's one of those goats again don't shoot it jack what the hell something bad's gonna happen hey it's just me bathing in blood no big deal oh how'd you go oh okay they've got me that was like eight shots there's gonna be more of them isn't there 100 there's going to be there's another one oh god i do think it's worth killing them though because you get that money you can buy so much weapon upgrades all that stuff i could have barricaded it then my heart rate is increasing rapidly is there something there oh yeah i knew it was there and it still got me it still scared the hell out hello me oh beautiful i only got three shots though so craft some first aid craft some of that some more of that yeah i feel a bit better now quick reload hidden behind there is there oh no no no i didn't realize you were there all right full back full back there's three i'm gonna see if i can run past no that's the wrong way i might have to get the shotgun out or the other pistol drop something big there shotgun just ruins them absolutely ruins them just got the doctor ordered there we go i suppose you could just bait him in and try and run past right excuse me he nearly got me nice uh get out of here ding dong rapid ascension there thank you i did not like that not one bit that's a bit dubious isn't it hello lady she's got a key there how could you not see me right there [Music] mother miranda i regret to inform you that ethan winters has escaped that fool heisenberg because he is in my castle and has already proven too much for my daughters to handle when i find him no mother miranda yes of course i understand the importance of the ceremony i won't let you down oh love to hell with the ceremony that man will pay for what he's done oh she's mad i did kill one of the doors i want that key did she leave it there yeah she did we were all called by mother miranda to decide the fate of the child's father what just thinking of that family meeting makes me shudder to think i'm treated like a sister to those miscreants especially heisenberg he's a cowboy that riff-raff wouldn't know proper manners if they slapped him in the face i would have sliced him into ribbons if my dad stopped me what was the other bit why did she treat me the same as them she gave me this castle obedient doors everlasting life did she not am i not her favorite i need a drink she's really mad oh [ __ ] oh my god all this for a child who isn't even here you ungrateful selfish wretch you come into my house you lay your filthy manhands on my daughters and now you even try to steal my property rest while you cast because i will hunt you and i will break you go ahead do your worst that's a long way down that's a very very long way down all right so she's hunting me down then like the dog that i am i am not looking forward to this but i kind of am there's no way she wouldn't be able to get down here that quick though would she we'll be all right no this looks like a boss thing maybe i'm wrong i don't know i don't know i don't like it this game is messing with my assumptions and expectations under the gate here what it's like [Music] you will learn what it means to instead no i don't want to learn anything you put those clothes down you put them down lady put them down please oh my god my hands there i just take it back seven hand okay go go go go go nope we're gonna have to

no good man screw this castle okay so ethan's obviously not completely human then right because that's impossible so i'm thinking maybe something that happened in resident evil 7 like the mold infected him oh hello because that can grow limbs back can't it or maybe i'm an experiment or something right i'm going to go put this mask on one of the statues see what it does which one did i get the mask of sorrow or rage or something this one mask of sorrow that won't fit second time lucky right so i've got to get three more masks to get through there which is obviously somewhere important right where to next you disgusting outsider no no no not disgusting what is that just the fingernails what even is that excuse me coming through oh man ah i think that now i've got that key maybe i can open there was a door here yeah that one that one that one can i use that uh use the key yep and go through go through right i've not been here before i don't know what this is the annex is she

lipstick is missing hmm there's definitely something growling behind there i wouldn't like to find out what though i think i've got to go over here i can hear her put those big high heels on effective at stepping on people a flower swords ball okay right maybe i can use that in the maze thing anything else in here it's just a picture oh one more shot would have done it yeah you're dead cool so can

though isn't it oh i don't want to get it in the hole i can't really see i think we've got to get it in that gold thing there can i like bring it down here now and then across and then down we get it yeah we did it get the ball rolling the crimson skull and what the bloody hell did we do with that i was confetti awesome why are you making weird noises dude what's that about i didn't go down here

thankfully that was there i'd have been ruined if it wasn't i'm sick of bugs you think that was the developers as well going ah yeah this room was really annoying we had to q and a about 500 times there were so many bugs i should heal oh that's new just checking sometimes you can find crafting parts in those what's this is it like a heater or something a mask of joy excellent that's mask number two i don't know what's coming next though i feel like at some point i'm gonna have to fight the lady the big glass cassandra come here now enough games of course mother i won't last until dinner oh she's right there cassandra please oh i'm ryan for the kill mother said snail but i can keep them oh thank you oh no she's here i guess i should hold back no i'm trapped now i'm trapped what do i do

cool cool cool cool cool it won't open as is can i put the mask there the mask of pleasure well i need that for downstairs don't i obviously i can't go that way i've got to take it with me can't get through there he's getting crazy and crazier i don't like it when it gives me ammo because it means pain is coming i was worried my sisters had gotten to you first no move that oh that was close oh there's a crack there's a crack of light i could break it with a powerful attack that's perfect oh i think i just wasted that ready [Music] oh yeah i could use the uh the pipe bomb pipe bomb there it

torso add it to the collection okie dokie dog all right just breathe just breathe i mean i'm nearly out of everything here i can't craft any ammo what do i have i've got two pistol shots and a knife the mounted animal skull what was the point of that is it hiding something that might be one of the masks then i can't drop out there can i now so i can put the fake one in there well that was really lucky that it was in there wasn't it it's a substitute then it's like resident evil 7 when you swap the shotgun over or like indiana jones and the crystal skull hey lady i didn't expect it to be right there she's going downstairs can you go away now there's nothing to see you're here that's so freaky close it she's gone okay he's gone oh right okay right we can do this now i feel like i should buy some shotgun ammo it's a thousand each thank you for your purchase no problem mate the fact that i can craft sniper ammo as well leads me to believe that we're gonna get a sniper soon so i think that's a good pick up okay so we can put the mask in now this one i think is the joy and that one there is the pleasure the one with four in and now we just need this one three which one's that then the angel of anger where am i gonna find that hey nope it's fine it's fine it's fine i don't know where i'm going to get this mask of anger please i've unlocked that is there anything in here that i missed i'm not sure i don't know where i'd get it from did i go through here no i didn't go through here did i oh that is a beautiful painting there let the five bells of this chamber ring out it's life-sized as well imagine being that tall there's a bell there do i have to shoot these yes obviously it's on fire there's one there's one there look it swings up here come back bell there's two one up here oh it's outside three it's not really in the chamber though is it there's four and there's one more she's right outside five that's the easiest one so this is probably where i get the last mask oh i see where it is i get it i get it i'm going up here she's really really annoyed at me at this point incredibly incredibly annoyed we're in a tower there's another goat maybe i should be shooting them some kind of collectible are you dead you look dead oh damn it i knew it i really don't want to waste my ammo on you a treasure map this treasure in the dungeon i heard there was something called the dagger of death's flowers somewhere in the castle it's an antique from the middle ages that's coated in a concoction of poisons from across the continent it's said to have been crafted to kill demons and monsters well i'm gonna need that aren't i oh the sniper rifle yes love it one shot kill well that's what that guy was for i just picked up the crafting recipe for sniper shots as well didn't i and i can craft some beautiful can't craft any first aid though got barely any ammo i'm ruined some gargoyles is it you should have stayed in ghostbusters i don't know what you're doing here nope they can fly now yeah dead luckily that didn't really take much ammo to kill did it can i make anything else now just a first aid kit i'm just gonna run from you stay away oh

life and in death glory to mother miranda hey remember me i almost died up at that castle tell me what is going on around here how can a man be almost dead that's a question for the wise you know what i mean and i still haven't found rose where did mother miranda take her [Laughter] you're too late or maybe almost too late the child will be sacrificed life for life what kind of sick medieval [ __ ] is this she's just a baby the crests of the four bloodlines may open the path you seek will you please stop talking in riddles i just want to find my daughter it's only original if you don't know the answer oh i love that [Laughter] wait a second that looks familiar hey hey wait never going to give us any straight-up clues this year so we've got house moreau house heisenberg house buena viento which we've just destroyed i was a key in this wasn't there the winged key i mean there's all sorts of weird stuff in here man what does it all mean i'm sure it's all got secondary tertiary meanings use the wing key here well the environment's changed a bit now we're at the castle it's another one of these levers though if i use this am i gonna get my other hand chopped off [Music] i really hope they explain that the four houses yeah that's the umbrella logo what's that doing here this pattern looks really familiar so i've got to find something to interact with that it's going to open up isn't it i guess we have to come back here all right into the wilds we go oh castle's so awesome should we go over here there's always something hiding away sniper ammo you gotta check these things

mate i know you want it oh my god he's quick what the i don't think i've seen him do that before that we go i gotta look at those birds more cutscene there you are i had a feeling you would pop up here it was all worthless is that so i assume you've picked up something of value not sure if it's a value but why you have your daughter right in your own hands what are you saying whoa take a closer look no that's her head that flask seems to contain her head that is so messed up no way no roses don't say another word this this is impossible this just can't be your daughter's essence is still intact her powers are truly unique oh who could even do this she can be saved you know saved from this are you insane there's a house with a red chimney on the western side of the village go and seek out the man who lives there then we can continue our conversation quit holding out and get to the damn point you don't have to trust my words but do you have any better options your choice the customer is always right after all he'll pay you if i find out this is a lie [ __ ] joker okay right that that has to be mark hamill after that reference obviously mark hamill played the joker in the batman animated series it has to be it has to be feel free to peruse i thought it sounded like it but that's just confirmed it for me so i'm gonna have to sell some stuff 25k for that what that's a lot of money oh ladies beautiful even in death that was that waistline yes mommy milkers yes yes right anyways this key just gets me everywhere i love it the house with a red chimney i mean it's right

miranda february 1st offered walter mother miranda no messages take the answer to the cave someone could touch the child what this is the chosen child her original form no no no no the hell the wing key is just a single piece three more parts are needed to make it whole so you can't actually take that or you can examine it though combined with the winky four wind key excellent damn it better see the duke again all right gotta get back to the big lad now duke i got the thing what are you gonna tell me how was it did you learn anything i found these feathers now tell me how to fix this like you said you would settle down first you must use that key and collect all of your little roses flasks where are the rest of them there are four in total you have the one and the other lords have the rest lords mother miranda is the cold calculating ruler of this village four lords serve under her the first you've already met the lady demetrius the second lives deep in a valley of mist the doll maker donna beneviento none of her playmates have ever come back from that dank old state the third is moreau a being of twisted flesh that lives in the reservoir past the windmills it is said that he is not the only monster that lives in those waters the fourth and most dangerous is heisenberg he works in his factory on the village outskirts and the project let's just say parts of the human imagination are better left alone if you truly wish to save your daughter you must first gather the four flasks i'll do you a personal favor i've marked the lord's locations on your map thank you some treasures still lurk in this village i'm sure each one will prove of great use to you why are you doing all this why it's all part of our first class customer service please do come again soon he's a legend well at least he's told me what i need to do and where i need to go which one do we go for first though that is the question so i think we're gonna go to the weird doll people first because they are just weird and this game seems to do weird stuff really well so this could be freaky and i'm into that so we'll find out and the skeleton on the floor does not bode well it's not a great start look at these dolls everywhere no no no no no why are they hanging dolls from the trees i feel like this is going to get really spoopy it's true horror now oh no not the rope bridge okay please don't break i've fallen enough times in this game already i'm not gonna sprint it'll be fine it's fine it's fine [Music] what is that mia ethan come with me there's something i have to tell you mia what's going on it's a ghost i'm playing with my mind messing with my head locked rose feels different ethan you have to fix her what the hell is this everyone leaves me even rose this can't be real is there something in the woods like uh hallucinogenic that is possibly the creepiest thing i've ever seen bena biento hang on 1987 to 1996. she was just a small child am i losing it ethan you've already lost it my friend many many hours ago give up your memories family photo that one was obvious i knew it'd come in handy what's going on it's creepy no why have i agreed to do this no please please please base no [Music] come with me ethan that wasn't there before this is oh my god it's a haunted mansion disney i have a feeling this will be a lot scarier than the disney ride i can tell you that for a fact house beneviento this was their building that's where they lived is the front door open apparently so it's wool [Music] this is a dark dark place i'm not gonna like this if you're still watching neither will you that looks like a shadow of a person but i think it's just the stair thing here there she is creepy creepy doll girl nice little cat you got there look at that doll anyone in the cupboard nope nothing there it's like that weird doll from the conjuring what's this is that the toxic flower that's in the woods that looks important starting to get a bit more decrepid in here locked that whole area was just to get to the elevator i think what's that contraption one two three four five number three is missing why is it missing that's weird [Music] [Applause] [Music] what wait where's my gun i don't have any equipment it's all gone what the hell's this examine right shoulder that's very strange oh a key i mean there could be something else hidden in here that's mia isn't it is this a dollop yeah yeah it is examine the mouth what's inside it oh there's something there it's that little film thing check out the eye roll it around it's a wedding ring whose ring is that though blood covered ring check out the leg hidden compartments everywhere apparently ah another key a winding key check out the forearm what is that that's very confusing so the way that i came in is locked and there's a code but i can't find anything that gives me the code i can use the ring on this and wash it so does that have a code on it or something let's have a look yeah zero five two nine one one right so we've made it out of the room but we've lost all our guns and that's a bit ominous i wonder if i can wind that up nothing there surely i can wind that up that's another puzzle so i think what it is is the scratches so this one for example fits there and then which one would come next that one maybe we do that that's it we got it it's a beautiful little song isn't it yes tweezers okay so now we can go back to the doll use the tweezers and get the film out and then go back to the room through there because there was a film missing open her up use the tweezers just
