are we australian no we're brits australian nah my guys not an australian man thank you i mean we could be if you want i'm gonna hone up this road here pop down a little squad spawner and then we're gonna get in there like uh swimwear uh jack if you'd like to uh push into the left-hand side here i've no problem mate i can do that i don't think i could see any menus around here so i'm going to put down a nice little squat spawner in this corner a nice little squatty little squat spawner get your squad on i've got a nice little squad spawn down now we're actually going to push the uh church from uh i think that's blocked off there i don't know about that completely blocked off there we're not going to go that way it's going to check it out yeah sorry sorry there's actually a door there uh it's fine let's see an open gate there check yeah so it's open as you can go i didn't see that one mate i think we need to wait for the whole whole squad to be with us here you know i think if we run in like this uh we're gonna get gun down the hill i've done five don't see a problem i'll try and put down three smokes mate because we've got some ammo here pull that out and then just check it like that yeah nice smoke that is i like that we need more i think you got another smoke there two more smokes fiji i'm wicked all right i'm ready to rush matt well we've got some smokes down it's uh that guy's been absolutely shot pulverized now looking at the situation here it does appear like we needed more smoke there on the right maybe i think i think i think it's not safe whatsoever i think we need to go north don't want to go there i think we need to go further north for the attack for the south that doesn't make sense i do apologize to any australians watching i know that our accents are abysmal but we're having fun right that's all that counts but welcome to a new hell let loose video today we're playing on the us side and we are attacking san marie de mont classic hell let loose map this is there's some great moments in here i'm absolutely loving the grand do you think it's kind of good compared to most of the other weapons in the game but a lot of them are a one-shot kill anyway but with the grand the rate of fire and the accuracy so good that it enables you to get some really dirty flanks and hopefully you'll see that in this game with that said i hope you guys like this if you do hit that like button below and subscribe for more let's get into the action over there over there say the words send a prayer over there and the yanks are coming it's contested there's people here on this tiny little barn oh they're that headline there they're very close yeah well just hang there all right i already have two let's go the luna bell i hate this they're just shooting at me all the time ruined i'm sure i heard someone did ping a lot of smoke there's a tank a tank you say they're right next to us they're trying to fly oh there's like a half truck there isn't there i think that's commonly referred to as a tank tank oh yeah that is the thing i'm stuck then adam can you put a smoke down here okay has to be exactly there oh okay i think i'm pretty much hit there thank you oh i can move and now we can see if we can get across this field here trump's our bombing for five pound away that is full 1917 there okay i'm just going to hoon across the field look at me adam i'm young and free well look to your right you can't just walk right through jack paul van der brothers i could do what i want his mg over there yeah i want to try and get him they never expect you to just run straight across the field okay he's dead i'd face that jack would kill him i didn't even bother amy we put a new spawn beacon up here oh god now yeah i know several enemies on the other side this uh hedge here had him yeah i'm going to try and flank but i'm down behind them i wish you could just force your way through the heads like homer simpson i'm going to hold the sims in this then got him got an outpost as well oh i'm in the mix here there was supposed to be an mg somewhere here i'm not sure if he was on the left or the right there he is push got the engine out okay nice size got another outpost lovely work jack you'll get a medal for this bloody well hope so can hear another mg42 somewhere there's another outpost oh there's so many there's another one here yep oh yes did that guy not hit me we can clear this okay stop stop another guy [Music] another one okay stop shooting yeah they're trying to flank to our left we do not want that let's clear that they're just surrounding this area like rats man they've got so many outposts i think there's more here there's two [Music] oh this ground is amazing what the hell just just the bush it's okay goodbye oh god what he's dead over there come on firing yes one more jack okay enemies on me there's enemies here guys come on homie you can do it yes there it is did they see me ah yes they did damn it oh that was fun what did we get then 15 kill streak i've got a five pounder next to our spawn as well case we want that oh i chill well that's a beautiful looking gun there he's right he's a big one he's a big lead this is the final push to the corner now we can do it am i about to be bombed is that bombs or supplies [Music] i feel like they're bombing that tank or something push forward man that's my move marker let's go go i hate it when the bullets come and you don't know where they're coming from well i think you take that in real life yeah i'm sure it wouldn't be a pleasant experience get your head down demiro can't die he's got like another 58 movies to make with martin scorsese to the corner i don't know how we're gonna get there it's an open field i think it's fine isn't it just the corner not a friendly tank oh god jack you're on the wrong side of the fence there yeah yes i am you were the closest man so that counts we're going all the way around behind here to the corner pretty sure there's a tank in front of me adam well i'm dead i'm afraid is there any way you can tell the team that there's a tank here um it's right next to me but i'm alive okay he's here that's the mg over there and he's dead he's like nice silver well played it's a strong point for corner literally just the field uh it would appear so yeah good we are going to lose fields we should we should start pushing north and get behind them because there's a lot of them damn it oh there's so many of us on corner though it's worth cleaning out isn't it jack kill that thing that's next to you you could disable it what thing right in front of you that's a spawner isn't it it's a guy only garrison yeah i can get rid of it that's an enemy spawn point okay it's gone okay good did we lose it no they actually managed to defend it so far wow okay well we're on strong point this corner yeah where are they going to come from someone's whipping an mg-42 there yeah you just need to chill there yeah okay i'm gonna go up to try and defend fields fluffy panda blues fields corners for nothing anyway we've nearly got it what's the tank that's the tank yes taken down what is that tank doing yeah you got it yeah yeah well played till this game full crashed yeah minded as well that was really fun but it runs well and you know when when you've actually got teamwork and stuff this game is really fun
