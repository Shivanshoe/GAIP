oh baby oh wow look at you jack you're getting paintballing how do i put my torch on like you did g [Music] or what about turn it off and press n it's some fisher yeah so what's the story of this game i say no right so there's a horrible facility and it's full of monsters or something that have gotten gone out like not just normal monsters though like there's a monster what is a vending machine um that can turn things into other things can you imagine that like pray yeah there's just basically uh the creatures we're going in bad there's bad juju foot okay we've got to deal with it it's an elite team i'm pretty sure there's been several other scp games before right yeah it's all like like weird like creepy pasta type stuff you know like slenderman oh yeah it's that kind of vibe get a gun off the wall they're all the same now we can use the extensive weapon best of my section yeah yeah let's go no way in this type of game i'm putting a hollow on i got a torch on you know i'm getting a vibe from this game jack i think you'll know what do you think it's reminding you of right now sort of like the graphics as well and the very gray blocky environments and horror for you that's it i feel like you know what it feels like it feels like you know half-life blue shift yes it feels like fear blue shift like we're playing as the you know the guy the fear soldiers the tactical team that goes in so we're bound to die then look at this there's a man down there yeah he's dead actually looked pretty cool look at this the glass yeah wait there's another one tom oh you got it it's fine why is it got like hardcore mechanics look at this occasional classy wormholes known to manifest wooden and flooring so we're just going to fall through the floor are we you got to watch out for them i can see that you've already lost 40 percent of your health there tom yeah i know those health bars remind me of bat for blood or something there's a floating magazine here tom you see that dancing in the air right breaching clear watch it go go go oh the crouching animation is special oh yes yes yes i love that special oh yeah now we're talking look at this thing what was it like night vision as well like that tactical nice little head turn there yeah real tactical whoa what what's going on there oh side objectives oh and pick up the day from the cr pick up dave from the crate what find dave's wife find dave's children did you get that objective yeah that's very strange so that's the side mission then that we've got yeah this is dave i guess look isn't it you can lean tom yeah oh would you like that it's rainbow 16. yeah that does look like rainbow six boom serious business oh here we go this is the lift down to facility oh no this is where the game starts for real down the ramp various enemies and not tom what what the horde um oh this is very odd i have to reload wait oh no they they do want to kill us oh ah look at my health dude that was the full single file i feel like we shouldn't you're kidding i've got a 12 second respawn there's a guy coming he's pushing you dropped him oh my god his neck went long for a second then wait for the respawn he's got that old battlefield bug what is there one down there yeah god got him good yeah well did you find a heel no i haven't not yet are you back oh yeah of course you've respawned on full health but what if dave's wife and children well oh holy [ __ ] there's a guy behind there the man just came from behind here horrible ammo oh nice still doesn't give me a gun though does it oh health right there's a code here jack what about the computers tom we need the code if only we could see where the code was two two one zero let's get in there [Music] let's go i heard a monster tom no no you know what it's time for you [Music] so many tactically looked at tom you take over but he got pistol help you cannot get ammo from that box i've got i don't get it here but i can't get a gun okay they're all dead it's fine all right guns up oh i dropped him see now why can't i take this chaps gun it'd be good if you could lose it would you like a refreshing can of doctor doctor edited out the brand name i call that i mean that's the same font that's the logo look bepis peppis and conch death that's a nice stream there's zombies here well you'll have to deal with the ball i've got nothing he's got a fight on oh that's not right i've got to reload the party had zombies are coming jack this is an easter egg or something it doesn't seem right that they've got party hats on well maybe they were having a party when the the thing broke up get closer look at them oh look at the cheeks on them they got some cakes wow i'm awake coffee oh tom tom no no no shut shut shut that shut that door can we kill it no don't don't no more opening that door just trust me can't we just shoot it in the head what was it well i'll open it you stand there and have a look ready okay [Music] no i don't like it it's weird i don't like it are they just effigies fine what are you doing sexy mampos i think they're just dolls it's never just dolls let's see jack trusts information for recruits do not show the code report all suspicious activity do not listen to the voices do not negotiate with the voices god tom they're trying to break through that door there i'm happy about this glock motif indiscriminately mow them down with the glock well i mean they're synchronized they're synchronized ready i'll open it should you is that a good idea [Music] jesus christ reloading [Music] i'm kind of into it safety first oh we can't get through there look all personnel are subject to body temperature checks wait this is a code tongue we need the code uh what's going on here jack there's a pickle in here it's very odd isn't it it's very odd you look in the offices here i didn't go in there well whoa whoa whoa whoa going down good tactical now there's plenty of places the code could be hit on enemies oh it's head popped that was horrible popped it like a melon wait i can't get through here oh it's a access code eight one five three you found it instantly go and push it in you'd be good sound uh temperature check okay well this is just a dead end right yeah what's on the cd factory porn what that's what it says factory porn i don't know what that means tom maybe someone who's really into like different factories greg wallace maybe i think people do this in real life jack well go hunting for monsters in weird installations well there's like facilities we don't know about like proper horrible facilities have to be sweeped by black ops because things have gone wrong yeah no i think there's but no i'd like it to be but it isn't we don't know though do we oh wow this looks oh hello there's a lot of enemies you guys it's the shooting enemies i'm more worried about yeah these aren't bad reloading like they're just running a single file here it's good it needs some work does need to work generator room this here flipping the circuits oh attempt to start the backup generators refuel the natural gas depot c3h8 what we've got to restore power we've got to get there we've got to get the fuel what about we get fuel from storage i guess upstairs i'm going under here tom you're with me enemies fired can hope that you got overwhelmed is that storage delivery bay might be some storage there some gas yeah look it's a giant fuel tanker wait wait it's going to be enemies here all right one of three done oh good i'm gonna have to go further down into the abyss stomp all right you ready there you go number three go back to the fuse box there we go wait for the flow to die down 10 seconds then what what do we do then then the pain begins i think i'm watching the flow it's incidentally just italy instantly and then we're gonna i presume we gotta jump off yeah and go into where it was playing there's some stairs here that go all the way down yeah up here probably well this is scary look at that look at these vats of water i think good comes from vats of water i hate places like this in real life that are just this big how often do you go here well i just remember like school trips going to weird like power stations and stuff and you would go into a room this big and then they'd turn the lights off what the hell what kind of education have you had mp5 hello i'm taking that tom well it just reminds me of rainbow six uh um um the middle the middle oh my god jack ah good time there's a lot of them there have to be yes well we're like where are they coming tom in here oh jack get out of the stairs get up the stairs get down go down this way is not good oh one more reloaded hey you're telling me look at his body stacked up oh my god i was aiming at the balls i was having the real
