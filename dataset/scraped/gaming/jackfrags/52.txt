now i don't know what's going on with this gun in warzone the xm4 but after the latest patch it's beamier and more deadly than ever before and it's straight up just seems like the absolute best medium to long-range assault rifle even on rebirth island i would argue they nerfed it then buffed it and then nerfed it again and now the latest patch claims that headshot damage multiplier has increased to 1.54 up from 1.5 so cheeky buff there if you can hit the headshots but the maximum damage also got decreased to 29 down from 30. doesn't seem that way though in practice doesn't really seem to have nerfed it much so here's the build if you want to copy it that's what i'm using i'm not sure how it fares on controller but i imagine that it's quite good with aim assist kicking in when you start strafing and shooting but on pc it's very easy to control the recall on this thing hitting those headshots is a doddle and today i'm going to show you some highlights with the xm4 followed by a frantic game with the buffed stg which is also pretty dominant right now and we had one of the most crazy chaotic endings that i've ever seen in a war zone match we were up against it and we outstayed our welcome by about 10 years no spoilers put it that way i do apologize for my voice i'm a bit sick at the moment but these games were recorded a few days ago so you do have my normal voice in there
