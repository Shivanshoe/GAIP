have i been better by this server no i didn't okay good oh my god there's only 28 tickets left i've been trying to play bf4 for the last half an hour and i'm using the server browser and all the servers are like 64. 61 out of 64. 60 out of 64. and you connect and then there's no players on it it's so frustrating and i wanted to play propaganda and the round is literally just about to end so hopefully it's propaganda again because this is the map that i want to play we'll wait and see we won guys good job america 635 tickets to zero great success wow guys hang on why am i 22nd on the leaderboard i got 3 000 points for doing nothing i literally did nothing and i've got more points than these people who did things like got kills and stuff that can't be right something's gone wrong there hasn't it surely rogue transmission i wanted to use a shotgun yeah now i'm going to try and find a propaganda so guys there's literally one server running propaganda right now and there's nobody on it you're actually kidding me look i've got where is it where regents i've got europe and north america ticked because i can play north america if it's an east coast server because i get like 90 to 100 ping and that's fine but i wanted to play propaganda it looks like we're gonna have to play something else should have stayed on rogue transmission jack you idiot what's a good map for a shotgun why does everyone love goldman railway there's so many 24 7 golmud railway servers on this game i don't get it it's not that good maybe if you're a vehicle player who just loves tanks and attack helicopters and jets yeah but for everything else it's not a great map okay maybe there's a propaganda server now maybe ah it's still just that one fine i guess we'll do operation locker god damn rock and roll locker no explosives how many tickets are if it's 10 000 tickets i'm disconnected i'm not doing it it's a fake play account oh my god nope nope nope i was so enraged i couldn't even press the ok button then is it a propaganda server now pain please so it's all i wanted to do for this video now it's just server browser simulator maybe you guys like this only pistols and bow and knife so it's not only pistols then is it it's it's pistols a bow and knife it's not only pistols parentheses and bow and knife you can't say that this one's team deathmatch just locker 24 7. 90 hertz they actually had 90 hertz servers for this game actually no they did they tested 120 at one point as well didn't they so this is gonna be pretty responsive then perfect for the shotgun guys it was a fake play account again why are you the way you are why has this not been fixed i don't get it is it that difficult to just find a real server with real players in please club kent b telegram i don't know what this means let's join it let's see if there's really 55 people on oh my god it's kind of real i think i mean it's not as many as 55 is there let's be honest 22 plus 21. now i did basic maths at school that isn't 55. i can tell you that anyway what a great spawn what a fantastic literally a guy prone with an mg4 okay can i actually play the game now please i've got the m10 shotgun and i've

shotgunning just like that there you go unlock the red dot perfect that's what i always wanted look at this as well this was always a bit sus a lot of people think there's some kind of unsolved easter egg with this door because it's a unique asset i think it's got a skull on it you can't open it or anything but i think it's just a door it's just a bit of set design you know that's where they take the prisoners to be killed yes quick res yes love that can't raise that guy sorry okay i don't have the range there we got a shotgun headshot there somehow are you coming after me you just slid down the stairs i did i missed so many shots dude oh no oh my god look at that there's so many out there are they coming through they're trying to come through guys they're trying to oh my god there's so

that again hey hey hey no not that time we need to go underneath don't we can we not like go under the tower thing here because it collapses doesn't it you're an enemy and now you're a dead denim a dead enemy i'm in a strange mood it's just one of those saturdays you know good luck my dude good luck hey they made it okay this guy didn't oh good luck my dude they're just throwing grenades on the bodies oh no the other side no one expects mortal kombat do they look these are medics you just had to look left once you literally just had to look left there's the mortal guy still shooting the waters you do you man you know you just keep doing you back on these bloody stairs again go away look there's so many out there look at the mini map i need like a rocket launcher or some c4 or

watch oh you spawned on me dude i'm just trying i just want to turn my voice comes off so i can hear the game okay boom big rest oh big rest dead dead who's next i can't see anything guys why did i agree i know this a lot of you guys are asking for me to play more bf4 but i don't know why i decided that lockers was was what i wanted you know i never asked for this i wanted to play propaganda i'll hide here they're gonna come running past i'm gonna shotgun them i've predicted it yep there we go there's more yes come on anyone else anyone else want some we're back on the point i'm just trying to keep them alive you know keep them breathing keep them swinging i don't think i've got the range for that i don't think i've got the range yes anyone else let's go over here yes you're dead are we gonna capture this point i hope so there's a claim all that how do i i can't remember how you get past claymores in this game do you just go prone i'm going for it i'm going for it you know it might not be a good revive but it's a revive [Music] and you can't be flanking like that it doesn't work sorry shotguns got a bit of range as well doesn't it that's charge charge charge press mass one multiple times that's how we win this will be a proper residence look at this boom got him what is that use s12 it's absolutely chalked but don't worry it's explosive and it's a shotgun it's an explosive shotgun how did i actually get two kills there even though this is absolute meat grinder i'm enjoying it man you know the gameplay the gunplay still really good on this game that's cheeky hiding in that corner it just says admin it's not really a message is it to be honest just admin does it let you know there's an admin what does it mean i don't know admin guys just so you know admin for an enemy i was killed by look at my cheeks what a great name i'm sure they're referring to the cheeks on their face as well and not the other cheeks you get these nice moments on this map where there's peace for ages and then it just gets absolutely hot i'm crazy okay more there what there was one more it was look at my cheeks again damn it okay it's really high enough now just c point what the hell there's two kills there apparently we're back here again this is where everyone runs past me or i push them and hopefully don't die and just try and kill people through the smoke i guess oh my god what is going on someone was there because i just got a hit marker with that grenade look at this look at this it's just absolute madness none of it makes sense it's just insanity and then someone tries to break through every once in a while and get ruined by a shotgun and i get some res points don't get flanked by these guys oh yeah and then i reload we're gonna get flanked are we that's what's gonna happen yeah and then we shoot and get a bit of damage and then everyone jumps back and then we reload and then we go again hey hey hey hey hey hey check your breath hey hey more points in the bag we need to go when he said the flank hey you're dead hey you're alive wait let's go baby c4 do not if you have c4 little c4 around that corner be great wouldn't it why is no one doing that okay i'm gonna be that guy and see if i can flank underneath because this seems a lot more chill than what's up there right now because it appears there's like 58 people up there doesn't it okay well that was the worst flank ever because my team killed everyone it's a grenade stuffed wall that's unusual it's a grenade are you gonna push you're gonna go for a rest you want to go for a walk you want to go to the park you want the bacon the mabel kind maple kind what am i talking about i've gone absolutely crazy way too many panda pops today i think the e numbers are off the chart i saw you i saw you oh hello what i run past him i'm an idiot lmg would have worked a treat there wouldn't it can i please get in please let me in grenade what did that grenade just disappear what happened to it there's more look at the minimap right now look at that [Music] there you go have some meds there you go watch out for the grenades there's only 5 000 of them i what are we gonna get flanked i wonder how many grenades are thrown per round of operation locker what do you think it is tactics tactics they're trying to flank aren't they i see i see what they're doing no not today angle grip got it that's the commando foregrip in warzone isn't it is that that's a you kev i think that was a you cav i bet that more guy's still there you know wait wait wait look at that in the chat jack frags allowed here why would i not be allowed here what did i do whoa what the what did you calf was that you cav i think it was right if i throw a grenade about there wow what away with that one yeah headshot yep that's legit blizzard save me nope didn't save me they've elaborated on it why not why yes it's an interesting question i'll keep going i'm gonna keep going we'll go under hello hello hello they're having a conversation what did i just interrupt i'm sorry i think that was like some old friends having a meet and greet or something and i just ruined it oh that could have been so good how did i mess that up there were loads there yeah we got a few kills out of it whatever you know i think operation locker shows that there is beauty and chaos sometimes you know it's not all just i mean it is it's all just absolute chaos isn't it look at this look at this 24 7 chaos all day all the time every year there's a claymore we're going to swiftly avoid that you i hate you so much you need to be careful lads i've got the slug what the wanted grenade see that was all wiggly uh fresh uh guys this guy is just shooting the ground what are you firing at that's just the door that doesn't go anywhere my dude okay and where's yeah and down we go this will be a comprehensive victory for the team here 300 tickets i think we're going to end with over 300 left which isn't bad at all really what did we start on like 1200 1600 there's a claymore right there i know it's friendly okay hey i got you don't worry number one medic number one medic i will fix i don't know if i can i'll try it's a hot one it's a hot one six tickets left we'll go right or left i mean i looked the right way i just you know we didn't aim as well as we could have done come on gg there it is gg well i didn't get to play on propaganda but you know what we had a good laugh with that guys thank you for watching hope you enjoyed the vid you know therefore is truly sublime i'd say it's a timeless masterpiece even though it was really bad when it launched anyways like the video or the demogorgon from stranger things will create a poll from the upside down in your basement and eat your face later this evening bye
