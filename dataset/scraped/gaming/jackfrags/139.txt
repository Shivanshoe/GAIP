[Music] hi guys and welcome back to god of war on pc today we're going to be continuing the story where we left off this is a really cool section of the game fighting dark elves and attempting to take the light of alfheim so we can continue up the mountain a big thank you to nvidia and pc specialist for sponsoring today's content we're playing in 4k 60fps here with dlss mode set to quality every other setting in the game is turned up to absolute maximum here and it just looks incredible dlss uses ai to boost your game's performance in some cases up to 45 at 4k resolution we also have reflex turned on improving the responsiveness of the game and reducing latency up to 22 percent making timing those blocks and attacks a little bit easier the system i'm playing on is a brand new build i'm using built by pc specialist they're one of the uk's biggest system builders i know you guys have asked and i will be doing a full setup video soon and this features an i9 12 900k 12 gen processor an rtx 3090 graphics card and 32gb of ddr5 memory i put this together using their system configurator on the website which is linked down in the description below i've also teamed up with them for a promo code if you enter jfrags during the checkout you'll get 30 pound off your order with that said if you enjoy the stream or video leave a like and let's get back into the action okay we are good to go thank you for coming along today guys i think there's some kind of puzzle i'm here to figure it out so in this room there are prisoners and if i turn this that may open the door what focus up hello did you enjoy that boy hope that was worth it maybe a bit too much so there's two little things that we have to destroy here i can't get to that one so i think what i'm gonna try is i throw the axe there and then keep it there come back here line myself up and then recall it and it should get both at the same time maybe i just had the wrong angle there so we'll put it here like that and then recall it maybe there there we go little trick to it wasn't there i've already got that chest apparently and over here there's a big elevator and there's another chest and i'm gonna try and get this one because i had a little look around before there's one up there and then if i do this we can see one there and if i remember correctly last time i played this we drop down turn around there it is smash that one [Music] and then we're gonna go back up come with me andreas roll it down all the way freeze it did i just miss that such a noob no you can climb up smash it and then i think i've got to put it up a level like that and then i can get it no wait i think i had that right didn't i just have to recall my axe when i'm there there like that jump up and this platform will go up i think there we go five head [Music] common wrist armor man okay so that's a lot more damage there isn't it a lot of runic damage anyway a bit more defense too you know what i don't care about the look i'm gonna equip those oh there's no socket though is there i really like the socket so leave it like that for now two or three apples very good and then we've got to go down to get to the next bit what's up karth hello bizwa mike solis what's up guys welcome to the stream appreciate you guys coming along so we're gonna be live for a couple hours tonight it does look awesome in 4k hey marcus there's quite a few puzzles in this bit you were wrong back there oh i know mother's voice better than anyone who was hurt she is gone boy speak no more of this fine are you stuck in there mate hmm oh there's a chest there is there a way to stop this yeah right there hey sal from texas welcome to the stream [Music] fragmented heart of alpha rare enhancement reduces all damage from dark elves well i definitely want to put that somewhere don't i what was it for that's it isn't it so i'm just fighting dark elves down here so i feel like i've gotta have that more of these weird things you gotta line them up if you do one at a time doesn't count race time i can't decide if they sound like minions or do they sound like ewoks oh my goodness how do you guys think ewoks or minions what do they sound more like yeah i've got to get across there though this way maybe yep hold on boy he can take him out himself no he's some kind of king of the owls the dark elves tuscan raiders okay that's a new skill i've got as well [Music] oh closed captioning not available them though mincemeat evan thank you for the turn ewoks for sure it's like java without helium interesting they sound like jawas yeah or dvd maybe maybe that's it there's a chest there how do i get that then i don't see one of those pink globules anywhere no way across here too bad the witch's bow string doesn't work anymore boy it is the power you will look so there is one down there [Music] through that door it must be connected somewhere else but where pray tell maybe i can see it from over there oh come back to that one maybe [Music] hey you sure the witch is okay i'd hate to think she died helping us she knew what she was doing okay yes she did you got a chest in there ugh more of it weird stuff if we cut enough away the bridge above us should reappear right expect resistance there's always resistance you can't get over how pretty this game looks it is a good one isn't it i mean it already looked really good just on the base ps4 right and it came out in 2018 but this is the best version of it by far it is on ps5 as well surely there's not just one ow fortunately those ones are quite weak i love this oh my god i'm sorry i remember this guy okay you have to throw that in there and then he drops those yellow things and then you get these and then you have to throw them inside him [Music] ready [Music] he dropped some yeah he did oh no i think he blew me up then come on open up down here just in case a few more back here we can get such a cool looking enemy isn't it oh my god oh he's strong got some health over here horrible come on stop beaming stop beaming it's fine open her up he's tough [Music] now you have to watch out because i think when he actually stomps like that he destroys the yellow i thought these animations run so nice [Music] oh that was close he's tough for sure he is gummy well there it is i think jack is the only one i follow that streams in 4k i mean i've got the hardware i've got the connection youtube allows you to do it so like yeah i'm gonna do it you know like if i can get the max quality possible [Music] i'd much rather do that tempest a rapidly spinning melee attack that one looks quite good try it out the look of ages can i get some health from these parts yes there's something up there okay that thank you very much open her up kratos let's go what's my internet one gig up one gig down i have a dedicated loose line i did we must it a way up [Music] unknown planet thank you for the zoo is there anything i missed there i need to try those new attacks as well huh guess the light makes more than bridges maybe this will spit us out on top second time playing cory i played this on ps4 pro jeremy yeah it's really good man i mean just being able to play in 60 fps in 4k so i played it on the quality i think on the ps4 pro so it was only 30 fps i mean it looked incredible still even on the ps4 but this is just another step up you know it just feels way more responsive as well you know i will never get used to walking on solid light yeah it's a bit weird i wouldn't trust it the door there's no seam what we have a problem i like your channel but i don't appreciate your titles for videos they're very repetitive it's just the way that youtube works you have to you have to play the algorithm i even have a door then hello come we will find another way i mean the titles aren't really for my regular subscribers they're for like searching for new people like if i had it my way my titles would just be oh playing god of war again or something like that but if you do that like youtube doesn't hey like that we found something interesting oh really i love something interesting it just doesn't serve the videos and the live streams if you don't have a decent interesting tile oh nothing whoa oh he's got a side quest doesn't he an ancient yes was it difficult yes is that all you're gonna give me yes he literally just said yes twice then didn't they let's get to it can't do anything for the act check i i still got that resurrection stone as well well don't buy anything on my account this works okay hey how did cindy get ahead of us he and the blue one do seem to travel quickly i can teleport magic we're inside what the hell of course oh it's so pretty [Music] oh focus up boy there you go i hate those things i've got the frost sacks as well so i charge it up like that see it will explode freezes them oh well i didn't mean to do that i just wasted some of my rage there hated dark elves on this it's such a cool area of the game though they are kind of annoying to fight against but i just think this looks incredible doesn't it come on i don't know boy maybe an awk i like that a bit lower [Applause] i'm not aiming too low there or too high i'll figure it out there's one at the bottom as well maybe a different spot for that later on there could be an angle from here [Music] oh that's it right there i was trying to be too clever [Music] what did we get some steel you can sell that okay [Music] everything's so goopy down here [Music] that does the job doesn't it oh [Applause] there's one behind me [Music] check on that [Applause] rip this dog out with alphabet [Music] is that necessary i think we're good one of the best looking areas but worst enemies they're just annoying it's a bit more of a challenge you know oh that's impressive what the hell is it [Music] the new shrek unleashed game looks good i've not heard of that one i thought they stopped making shrek video games oh it sounds like arnold schwarzenegger that does what they need the light they've covered it up with it how would they do that dark elves gonna kill him oh i'm down [Music] look another light on is there ray tracing on the pc port no there isn't oh no but there is dss in reflex why are they killing him he didn't do anything do not assume you are seeing the end of a war boy you do not know what led to this moment but he didn't even defend himself that was his choice we make ourselves i'm not ready [Music] man he does a good job of like thanking the aggro doesn't it [Music] they really got me in the corner there didn't they get away from me i'm ready [Music] goodbye oh my god just chucked his head clean off [Music] the light is near look for a way inside let's have a quick look around here that's a vast area how long did they take making this game was it three years does anyone know four years i know it was delayed a couple times you love the finishing moves for the dark elves it really lets your frustration out i think that's why they made the attacks on the dark elves so brutal when you finish them because they are just really annoying so when you finally get that kill it's just like oh feels good i think i'm gonna switch out my i'm gonna put that one back on because i think i preferred that one sorry kid get him a trace that wasn't so bad boy you will speak when spoken to i should not have done that [Music] can you like when there's sun like that the nightmares can you actually like throw them at enemies here we go what's this oh my god [Music] good job kid five years and 200 million is that really what they spent on this game you're restoring all the pathways boy i am trying my best [Music] huh you're going up you can throw the nightmares okay it shouts louder treya saw sundance sundance definitely for sure oh no there's so many of them [Music] break into the hive can we go through okay i've gotta figure out how to line these up you need three at a time usually so if we do that one there easy no angle there [Music] i wish mom were here maybe it's just these two first nope [Music] is there one that i'm missing here there's there it is and then these three and that's gonna get us in the hive i remember this bit being quite tricky so i'm just gonna see if i can get a couple more skills here [Music] shield combat that's cool increase the firing rate [Music] yeah it has to be three of the same vein i don't think we're supposed to be in here quiet we're not supposed to be here at all boy did you hear that stay alert and by my side they're crawling on the walls hey when we make it to the light how do you think we get it into the by frost the witch said to step into it she did when she was ripped away from this realm oh i missed that you are more concerned with her safety than our goal hmm nice get it that was close the boy is an adequate murderer you don't gotta tell me you can unlock the infinity gauntlet variant of it what in this game is that an easter egg stay back understand god there when it falls be ready we will need to move quickly okay you ready boy it is an easter egg okay i'm not saying that here they come stay behind here protect our flank you just have to keep pushing oh my god that's awesome keep shooting boys there are many targets you will not miss a neural path negate superior numbers stay focused keep pushing keep pushing sorry what are you supposed to be able to i thought it would just give me the key input straight away that you're gonna destroy like [Music] how is that not broken his back that looks like champagne are you injured i'm fine i think i would die if i did that in real life you know wow it's beautiful the light it's making the whole temple reappear it's the source of all of it what's cool about this is that little section wait atreus is learning the whole time throughout the whole game i hear i hear her i told you i heard her do you think she's in there ah akanda thank you for the 20 minutes i really hurt i feel like my angels on don't we have to go in here stay here stay only use it as a last resort you're giving me your axe far too heavy hold my axe it's almost as big as him still ouch i reckon that would hurt really bad it's gonna be hot in there isn't it we just entered the matrix what is this take the blue pill [Music] fey [Music] you have to come back it's not harassed you left me here alone atreus along with him he always leaves he's never here he doesn't want me he never will [Music] nobody come [Music] i don't know him and he doesn't know me doesn't seem to want to i'm strong i'm smart i'm not what he thinks i am i know better he doesn't talk to me doesn't teach me it should have been him do you hear me him not you [Music] except [Music] i don't mean that you know i love him i just wish he was better i know he can so if he tries i'll try but if he doesn't please come back i know you're out there somewhere [Music] cut state [Music] oh this bridge is right at the end of the game [Music] what have you done why did you do that i saved you you are treading there i waited and i waited but you wouldn't come out so i pulled you out boy i was gone only damn the trace has been busy moments no you've been gone a long long time i didn't know what to do you left me here again why don't you care that's impossible you got the line now we should go before they come back i hope you got what you needed nice grumps he's in the mood yes look there's our exit but there's no light to make a bridge we're trapped and the witch's bowstring is useless we can imbue it with power the power of the light all the doubt what's the people talking about gears of war in the chat gears here's all one two three we're really good uh the other one's okay i think five's better than four i didn't play the spin off one i don't remember what it was called on my mark loose your arrow into the stone it worked we can now make our way back come that stairway's blocked we can fix the stairway boy just laying there maybe it'll help us get out of this stupid place you're gonna stop being grunts a lot so that might give me an angle there i think judgement that's it is that supposed to move oh there's a step up there as well [Music] they sound like the clickers don't they i see what you meant read the needle there address oh man those explosive things are so annoying i don't understand how that's killed in there because he can fly so couldn't he just fly back up i like the crystal if you find me an angle let us make our way back up i just want to fly the condor eddie hero you mean in 2042 [Music] condors op you know the thing is i'm not joking the condor in 2042 is actually op but it requires teamwork you need you need it to be full basically if it's not full it's pretty useless but if you have people repairing and on the guns the guns can destroy jets helicopters everything really [Music] but yeah it's not a problem because no one really uses teamwork in 2040 it's not really there [Music] i'm sure i've got like three versions of that now right i've got skills i can do as well a quick stomp damn what about atreus more stun damage [Music] now and then this one as well now is it just envelope oh it's just runic and vitality i see so they're just different types i think i've got to put this back a heady hero thank you for becoming a member that's very kindly nacho i wish i didn't watch the play through when the game came out would have loved to play it now nacho to be honest even if you've seen it i mean i've played through it once already it's a very satisfying game to play and obviously i will play it differently to you people that you watch will play it differently to you as well you know i'm not necessarily gonna discover or explore every knock and cranny of the game i'm not really interested in like 100 in it but you might be so you'll play it completely different for the people that you've watched i'm sure there's an animation where he he throws he gets the spear that they have and he throws it and it like takes them out midair i've not seen that one yet andreas thank you for the 50 big glove from south africa i love your videos thank you man cheers teddy what's up ethan it looks sick mate yeah yeah the graphics are nuts only i imagine like watching this on a big 4k oled tv would be sick i'm going the wrong way here that's why i came isn't it this way oh that's where i climbed up yeah this way yeah i can hear the jawas this is [Music] dammit yes that one's brilliant i'm playing with a ps5 controller philly um yeah i tried with mouse and keyboard it's just it's a controller game isn't it you're watching this on a 65 sony a9 tj oled awesome dude age paul valerie i'm watching this on a 4k tv and it makes me want to take a shower because this level is gross what because of all the sound effects or what oh look at that that's sick strike up the old guard i'm not really leveled up any of these runic attacks boy we can use this where are you taking that i'll take it where i like boy boy what does it say boy it's just law then [Music] okay new guy at work frank's been watching you since 2011 you're the best brother that's when i started you guys thank you i just might are you going to carry that everywhere oh look the blue door that's not a door and a sand bowl but how do you expect me to reach it it's a simple puzzle boy all we must do is put this in here shoot her out with that boy and i will climb up here boy i don't know why but i will oh dead guy rip is it to get an angle here yes [Music] i didn't even see that chest what's up there isn't it chris cheers for the five can you do some 2042 like the way you did battlefield 4 i love the stories about war heroes um i don't think it makes sense for 2042 chris because you can reach the ball now that game isn't based on a real war so there's no real stories for it right do they have a name for the kid yet yeah he's called the traitor's test what's in the ball boy are you ready what does this mean see remember the shape yeah i know what's that one man go ahead greatest man or tallest tree begins as any more than me yeah and see stupid i don't know any of these like that kid is smarter than everyone i've ever met in my life ever have i heard of the steam death portable pc yeah i ordered one seven i pre-ordered it when they first announced it but they've been delayed [Music] light elves are so pretty they don't seem to care that we're here goes to the sashimi yeah it's really good mqe you've been sub since september 2011. i'm pretty sure that's what like that's when i started or october's when i started so that's what he wants i hate that guy we'll be back i've played a little bit of ghost as a shimmer a few hours it's really fun it's still back at the other side of the lake where we go we really gotta go back down here again do you see any other way no man this is the way boy you think they could make a god of war tvs here isn't it actually be good or would it always just be bad i'm really interested to see how the last of us serious turns out i don't know if they're going to follow the story of the game though or they're just going to make their own stuff up because it's got joel and ellie in it have they said is it only one season as well or is it multiple seasons all right now i can barely see there's light big oh you cheeky monkey [Music] hey suck on this but i actually went around the corner okay adapt sick they're doing a show on the division as well matt really got a war movie could be cool hunt showdown's making a tv series yeah that's true hey garrett stumbled onto the channel enough to see any tips and tricks on battlefield 4 any word on 2042 going free to play garrett they haven't said anything about the future 2042 for weeks we don't know what's going on i think next week we'll probably get an update because they should all be back at work now so we'll see the witcher season 2 was way better than season one like way better season one was okay but the cgi was pretty bad and it was a bit difficult to follow because yeah you only found out that you were watching different timelines after the fourth episode so you're just watching it like what the hell's going on and then the fourth episode comes and you're like okay i get it now but i was really confused for the last four episodes but season two is linear so it doesn't have that problem can i not cut that down oh it's just above thank you reuben yeah halo's coming out with the series oh i don't know how that's gonna be though you know because it's not obviously the guy that does the voice he's quite old and i don't think they've got him for the series that there's an actor playing master chief instead and what's his voice gonna be like like in my head master chief only has one voice so i don't know if they can make it work and are they going to take his helmet off like the last one if need be it might be it could be really bad that series i want it to be good could be really bad hey ethan and pop this down there that heavy guy kind of looked like the one from hunt showdown uh yeah the guy that you have to stab three times hey johnny what's up man thank you are you watching on your nice tv johnny mass effect tv series there's rooms of it there's rooms that's going to be made at amazon we can use the same sample that brought us down the first time i want to get out i don't think they've made an official announcement though i did those chests tonight give master chief the darth vader what does that mean oh he's the boss [Music] me yes i was lucky oh yeah if you get hit by that remember this you go into like the shadow realm it's horrible there we go and then it counts down just have to kind of run away [Music] nope come on [Music] get my beard okay run away [Applause] so i can actually see [Music] charge it up and finish him [Music] mistake [Music] wrath of the wolf oh yeah so atreus can summon walls now which is just cool he's got a rune and you hold square to do that all right let me guess you're going to be smug and say you told me we shouldn't get involved that is enough can we go now jp thank you for becoming a member so this was closed before wasn't it yeah i'm not looking forward to the valkyries i tried it once on my previous playthrough and it did not go well let's put it that way i've got the chest in there as well do you remember the answer yeah yeah yeah well i've seen ragnarok yeah andreas definitely boy read this boy what's up only time you want to talk to me is when you meet do you want to tell me something i said the only time you care to talk to me is when you need me to translate for you if mom was if your mother was still alive we would not be here at all atreus forget it what's up justin right my controller is rumbling like crazy right now how are you not turning boy are you magic well you are magic but i didn't know you could define the laws of physics you know you killed all the valkyries shameful sir good for you man must have been difficult not like you would even care if she was mind your tongue boy until our journey is over one of us must remain focused do not mistake my silence for lack of grief [Music] mourn how you wish leave me to my home best dad ever i'm sorry i didn't realize no why would you you do not know my ways i know it has not been easy [Music] bit of understanding that it's all right i felt only moments pass if that is of some comfort to you that's good to know really so should we go back to midgard face the black breath what do you think there's more to see in this round is that actually an elf or is that just a statue of an elf it's a bit confusing isn't it it's sad the elves can't work things out now if i'm such a beautiful place but war makes it ugly you see with the eyes of a child in war a soldier sees beauty only in the blood of his enemy the rest of him is lost sometimes never to return you know about war don't you wars are fought for two things survival or advantage battles may be won by the better soldier wars are won by those who are willing to sacrifice everything to ensure victory you boys look like you're gearing up for quite the journey what's up div hey jess kratos ugly he's just got big dad energy man look at him look at those muscles let's get started then lost items is that just stuff i didn't pick up then my destiny if you're not in a hurry there's an abandoned temple in midgard that a fellow dwarf converted to his personal storeroom packed it with all sorts of treasures he collected during his travels throughout the realms jake yeah i'm using ps5 controls did he go to what did he collect fafnir was a shall we say aggressive collector of magical artifacts the more he acquired the more he desired there was no realm too dangerous no relic too hazardous he wants venture deep into niflheim for a white stone huh i bet that was quite the whetstone does this story have a point yes it does i just happen to have an entry stone to fafnir storeroom you might find something useful in there neat thanks andrew you're very welcome oh and uh if you find that whetstone well it sure would be nice of you to bring it to me you got a deal oh i could you i'd advise caution if you're heading to the storeroom last i was there all manner of nastiness had taken up residence won't your friend be upset if we steal all the stuff oh no no not at all he's dead he's dead sorry no i don't need to be sorry these things happen don't be sad from realm to realm collecting prices it's just how it works out sometimes that's quite a nice upgrade looks amazing now cheers not many blues still don't be a stranger don't be a stranger i don't really like upgrading the range combat although that looks cool hunter killer whirling storm hold l forward and press r1 to perform a quick axe attack [Music] [Music] i think those are the ones that i just i don't know what luck does there we go increases perk activation chance increases xp and hack silver gains so it just gives you higher chance of proc in a perk and more xp that's kind of boring to me anyway i'm sure there's a way that you could gain this system and just become god mode you guys watch the spiffing brit on youtube by the way he does that kind of thing where he will take a game and just exploit it just single player usually i don't think he does multiplayer but father i have a confession he finds ways to minimize everything sometimes with bugs as well very entertaining his animal warned me about something hiding in the trees that's why she didn't want to cross she told you well i could just feel what she was feeling what she was afraid of it happens again you tell me understand i promise he's got a video on skyrim which he did recently which was quite entertaining where you just become god and it's because of a bug that's not been patched in skyrim for 10 years where there's a specific barrel in a tavern i think it was and if you go there and you drop all your armor in there and then you go and do a certain quest that like adds stats to your armor you get that item then you go back to the tavern and then you keep just putting armor on and you just add armor upon armor upon armor so you just have ridiculous stats so it's really easy to beat the game i mean i've paraphrased that and i've definitely got a few things wrong there but go and watch that if you haven't spiffing brit on youtube it's very good no that's cool oh he's gone gregory you just have to have a powerful pc as a stream of pc and a good internet connection i'm streaming 40 000 bitrate so you need a fast internet connection with good consistent upload speed if you want to stream like this i think it is worth it though because people say that they watch in 4k [Music] i don't know what percentage watching 4k but good enough for me if a few people do it's crazy to think that all the wrongs exist in the same space one on top of the other yeah you can do 120 fps in this game if you want i've just capped it to 60 so we don't get screen tearing and that's because of my capture card there's no hdmi 2.1 capture cards yet when there is i can play in 120 without screen terry nothing sorry if that's a bit too technical it's playful okay twitch can only do 8 000 bitrate gregory grigore sorry and uh 1080p you can stream higher but the bitrate's not high enough to look good and we met your brother wait not battle it's my favorite character in the game did you let that seed saw put hand to your blade you do know he lost his talent right just jump and left him one day tried taking me down with him did he botch up on her girl quite the opposite big improvement yeah we just did the house have you you're leaving a blind pig farts up a truffle now honey hey vladimir i'm good thank you but you know what really counts consistency and i got that coming out all of you literally just hit it once and upgraded it [Music] mark of the dwarves it's better that's all you need to know isn't it good now when you're done gawking i got a favorite ass he's got a side quest there's this alchemist on var been working out in the vellunder mines you haven't heard from him in maybe i don't know a hundred winters or so probably dead but uh maybe you can find him he's dwarfing like me where's the fancy green ring owes me a favor you look if it is on our path oh i see how it is not a something for nothing type are you fine if you find don vary i'll make him whip you up something special this entry stone here oughta get you inside those mines alex k is this the new battlefield 2042 update looks kind of cool yeah yeah this is the new specialist for something i'm stewing up for you if in your smarts you'll find him he's called bob and he's a god of war doesn't use guns just an axe really op to be honest at the moment do you remember the way back to the black breath of course we need to walk across the bridge to the vanaheim tower are we going to the black breath or exploring look at this place we wrote past that statue of thor earlier when we left the witches game and what direction is that it's mid morning the sun is over there so that's south southwest good look at the big boy up there is he dead he's so cool there's thor he comes with one of those robot dogs but in the shape of a child a ranger i'm getting 60fps at 4k c runs top right frame rates up there i've copped it to 60 though let's try these walls sick i think that was a charged axe there oh oh my god so sick i've been down there already haven't i can you just the fob no you can't traffic goose oh look the witch's magic is still covering those scorn poles saves us some time i like that because that that's good game dev right there you've already done this bit where you've had to freeze the witch's magic and it makes sense in the law that she would help you on the way out so you don't have to bother with going through all that again huh it must be a crystal somewhere what was that oh it's down there how did i not see that oh it's because i landed in front of it there's so many sneaky things in this game like that where you have to turn around boy i'd like you to translate this i don't even know if you can i think you can arnie thanks for the two why is 12 pro max only allowed 60 max that is the max resolution and frame rate arnie that's the highest you can watch it this is good to know trippy where are you okay what's the best pc build available right now pretty much the one that i'm using teddy bear 12 900k 3090 go look at some benchmarks 390 ti is coming out soon though but i don't know if it's going to be a massive performance upgrade over the 30 90 i don't think so i guess maybe 10 percent max because it's the same architecture clock speeds aren't going to be that much higher either so oh this aesthetic man have you made it out of fafnir's storeroom yet what speaks to you random stats i may have a random perk okay um come back when you need something i guess bye he's very odd isn't he he looks like a character out of the witcher season 2 as well same armor watching from a private yacht good for you brandon [Music] the hell was that it was like damage on the ground or something there strange you live on an island yeah i do live in london the united kingdom is an island that's correct i've got the elevator i'm watching from a room with a floor mclogg that's something ddr5 docker if you skip to the start of the stream do you think i could carry here now i put up a picture of the full setup all the details um you can get faster ddr5 ram now but when i got the system 5 200 was all that was available i might upgrade it in the future if ddr5 goes up to like 7000 or something i might buy that does it i don't even know if ddr5 can do those speeds but i might get some memory with some better timings what do you think of the face in the mountain you would know better than i thanks look at what's your step this is why i use the thumbnails see if i can recreate the thumbnail kind of [Music] i do have a tick tock account sir but i don't post content on there now little kids with the questions today jack when i live stream a lot of the questions are the same i don't mind answering yeah we see if the witch was right it's the way down isn't it 6000 is what you seem working and no cool name thank you for the 45 noob that's a cool sticker i'm not seeing that one it's working she was right girl let us finish this hey chicken tommy is watching on a casio calculator watch i didn't realize that they could play videos tommy that's cool what resolution you got there 160 8x8 uh john thank you for the 20. um community events we do them on discord jan if you're on there i don't know i don't recognize your profile picture but we do play together on discord sometimes [Music] [Music] chinese food or pizza chinese food then we climb i have to jump although i love pizza as well i think if i had to pick between the two i'd always pick chinese though [Applause] pizza flavors are quite similar chinese food there's lots of different varieties before they disappear disappeared yeah i guess they just up and left one day no one knows why perhaps they returned to their home tiodam maybe i wonder if the face in the mountain was a tribute to some important giant let me be more specific so with a pizza a lot of the flavor comes from the sauce and the only options really a tomato and barbecue some variety in the toppings and the cheese and the vegetables you put on but typically speaking you always get one or two tastes don't you whereas chinese food it's just so much variety we more black breath [Music] i bet black breath smells really bad [Music] the giants did come here [Music] the giants boy a spicy pizza yeah of course man some jalapenos on there spicy beans with a deer head i wonder who he is oh look at this slide what does it say no yolk beast nor fearful thrall nor rooted tree that's no my call [Music] i'm gonna use the crystals nothing gotta do the other half that doesn't mean anything something's missing there's a second light crystal around here i wonder if the direction you're looking could be the answer boy stay there they've never been wrecked so hard latin thank you for the 10. it's a cute fox pizza is a variety of food i think though i'll eat anything me anything put it in front of me i'll eat it apart from sprouts and cauliflower can't do it i'm not a big fan of oysters either i'm not really a big fan of fishy food i like tuna fish cod salmon that's about it prawns can be okay as well if they're fresh and shrimps petraeus here yes father i know i missed something about food about making you guys hungry aren't i [Music] this place must have been important to the giants it's like they're testing us okay that looks right hey boy i can almost make it out what's the sprouts jada you don't know what sprouts are oh my god they're just like little green vegetable spheres that taste disgusting in my opinion i've never had a good sprout they make me gag there's something about the taste i don't know rose is it the answer freedom sure brian yeah don't trust the word i say sure i'm ordering a pizza right now what are you getting savannah that is so cool look at that oh i thought maybe there'd be a bridge these particle effects that to die for man so good [Music] there's a crystal in that torch holder should i light it that's a good idea i can't heat those down jason thanks for the five loving the commentary do you plan on playing tiny tina's wonderland when it comes out i'll check it out jason i don't want to promise i'll check it out guess we have to go down and go up that's a life lesson boy sometimes you have to cut a piece of yourself off to grow and move on these passages seem too small for giants why do you laugh oh you're serious i am always serious mom always said you never took an interest in history giants are just a race like i wasn't hold your phone it doesn't mean they're big whatever okay in that case giant also means bit there's only one we are deep in the mines here [Music] [Applause] [Music] i want you that's it one more one more no i wanted i wanted to throw you oh oh my god okay she actually stopped i hate you so much i was about to charge up one of these bad boys but she attacked me first what's this what's that dude snack brags that's a good idea no one would watch yeah we locked the 60 king manor how the bloody hell would i get across there maybe that way um [Music] mother you're almost dead you're almost dead it's funny it is over it is over boy can you imagine anyone ever saying to someone another you're almost dead oh that's cool hey larry can jack get a bit more likes i mean if you're enjoying the stream yeah hit that like button the fact that you guys are like commenting and chatting like that's you know that's all that matters to me i could see it boy absolutely bullied him the trailers can't believe it though he's like what am i hyped for cod 5 or just waiting oh god of war you mean ragnarok yeah yeah for sure man it's gonna be great isn't it be honest i don't see how that game's gonna fail hang on did i just luckily do that no okay behind me [Applause] is that it what's chat now an acolyte layer and tomographic as uh tommo and acolyte posted new vids [Music] yes did you guys enjoy the talk of yesterday [Music] i had a lot of fun playing soccer with those two already did that didn't i do i plan on doing light 2 videos yes jeremy oh it's on the wall there isn't it bnr okay so is that the last one nope that's the wrong way more talk off um was there even a bee there hmm so is that just the order you have to do it come back to that one i think we shall go deeper into the mine i could use that crystal thinking about it this is a lot of bodies tell me what this is horrible it's like indiana jones they look like men not giants correct for you seeking treasure see the traps see how the audio has changed be grateful these stay dead oh the statue we made it across what does it say sir subscribe to jackfrags what what why is that there what the hell i do not know here boy i've seen this language that's weird what is it boy enemies down let me down i can't do anything with that can i is it the dragon power i think you get the dragon power there don't you i can't wait for alden ring though i'm just gonna be sick that's next month isn't it first time doing that where to now the peak is still our goal we find a way up [Music] the highest peak in the realms i think mom knew this with the giants no the request has been more complicated than she could have foreseen it's a house it's a name i think brazley like the video what what what's that where there's a candle all tangled up with string in some sort of animal some kind of lantern no way that is of no use to us the bifrost lights our way how they got all these like youtube things in here it's crazy it's all related to me as well what's going on is it blades of chaos i can't remember which one you get whoa what is all this where are we mine and if this claw reaches the summit our goal is near all right how do we use it the scale of this crazy [Music] but what rolls on that's not going anywhere can you read it yes sir that's funny oh so one hand wrote yo nar only and another road and also doors should we add to it no there's got to be a way to make that claw work paul thank you for the 900 happy new years man would you be playing more taco yeah yeah definitely you know i think the giants not only mind the mountain but actually isn't there a giant in the trailer for ragnarok pretty sure there is right i'm destroying years of antique furniture good evening captain fuzz how you doing got some health there there's a machine with ears and rope by that torch what do you think that's for let's go check it out that's already full that's tear i think i see how this works the claws on one side and if we get this unstuck oh no i think the rope stuck under that rock that was careless yes sir sorry sir are there any easter eggs in 2042 discovered yet there's one i know of one actually two but maybe we can find our way after that after you know getting rid of those things there's one which is a shadow of the philosophy stroke oh my god what there's also a mirror's edge one as well know how like in every battlefield game you can find fakes running shoes on top of roofs they have that in 2042 there's not many to be honest i don't think it's like a priority though at the moment right like they just need to work on the game first before doing easter eggs i think more people would care about the game you know features rather than just easter eggs but i'm sure they'll add some cool ones i don't know if we're gonna get phantom program again but i'd love that mess you created up there boy maybe there's a way out there through that passage then we will see i was wondering who woke up every dragger in the mountain was me shoulda figured wow okay plus 22 defense that looks sick so uh put a gem in that sticking around for grains of wisdom look at that it's like a true spartan now can i get a trace to shoot that how big is this place it is a mountain big well i'll do a gameplay video with level cap on 2042 more traps maybe maybe in the future but you won't fit take it okay see where it goes boy this is horrible okay of course follow me [Music] oh and you're red and you're red come on it's a bit of a surprise attack though it's kind of heavy i can move it thank you michael i think i've got some skills that i can use here things that i can upgrade this one after landing the precision axe throw press triangle during the flash to recall the axe and cause the next row to do frost damage okay [Music] i had loads of xps [Music] didn't realize i had that much nord's tempest try that one this game using rtx no ray tracing tyler but it does have dlss and reflux worthy is my name thanks for the five can't see a difference between pc and ps5 i think the main distance difference is the resolution what the hell is that because i don't think ps5 is native 4k all the time whereas you can just stick this at native you've also got i think there's an extra reflections and ambient lighting setting as well which i've got turned on i think up there is it oh something but yeah the ps5 version looks great you could get high frame rate on this as well you can get up to 120 yeah let's go are these skills to pay the bills though jack i don't know title i hope so that's it you can do ultrawide as well on this for pc if that's your thing you know if you've got an ultrawide monitor i don't know how many people have ultrawides though i don't know anyone that does but i'm sure there's lots of people out there that do have that well it's blocking me there you go boys huh [Music] adequate adequate i'll just kick that down for later it's a shortcut trace relax always one [Music] controller controller if it is not useful can i not do anything with this it looks important [Music] normal difficulty snoop was that all for a guest hey jason okay no ruin though i'll get through there yeah cool later man let's go halo infinite battlefield look great at 32.9 broken leave it what could they be for there's something special about that i can feel it it's working yeah ultrawide is really immersive especially for racing games i wouldn't play an fps on it though because i like to focus on the center i feel like i would miss things you know now we can drag this through i have to push it playing on a 4k monitor all cynicis 28 inch watching on my samsung refrigerator now that is actually possible because i've seen this in a shop there is a samsung refrigerator that has an android tablet built into it and you can watch youtube videos on it you can play games on it it will order food for you so yeah i believe that you could actually watch this on a samsung refrigerator yes so what do i do now i've got that through here pull it okay i think we can get to that rock now still need to free the rope think you can use the cart to get us up there i think it's up ahead relax do i listen to podcasts not really promo runic summon oh that's for trace oh damn look at that i'll try that out cut the rope [Music] that's nothing nothing but kratos it has a camera inside yeah it checks what's in the fridge and then it will order it automatically for you if you wanted to it's the biggest gimmick ever i would never buy anything like that and i don't really understand the real need for something like that it just i don't know like it just seems a bit bit gimmicky go that way hello well i didn't do any damage he's trusted me [Music] [Music] oh i don't like that okay right in the crotch right in the crotch [Music] he appears to be fine with that oh you actually just smashed the enemies ready ow i'm going to give him little punches little tiny punches oh oh my gosh yeah when you're older i love that use it on the way back to strip them up back to the wheel yes boy kratos should stop doing steroids they make him kind of edgy i don't think he does steroids he's just a big lad you know he's a god so he's got he's got god jeans [Music] the river of knives that looks sick [Music] frozen flame so i can upgrade my axe karna with that i is burning a frozen flame i need to see the dwarf don't i can you please how do i get out of here now we've done everything we need for the thing haven't we godroids back here i think this should work now we can get on the floor [Music] i should come down here oh there it goes again no is there a freezie on it where's the freezie [Music] what am i missing here guys i thought that that would just stick in place do i have to put the thing there we could just ride up with the car somehow yeah i have to get this don't i and then put it underneath where the claw is and then get on top of that and then that's gonna take us up oh i see what we're doing we're going to ride it boy together it fits that's perfect that's it i should hold it [Music] come on boy no we don't push it we jump here we go do you think this goes all the way to the top we will see you soon enough something feels strange up there is it a dragon boy heading into danger i think it's a dragon do not concern yourself with what might be focus on what all of us and be vigilant yes sir don't worry about things that you can't control like the future or you can't some extent but you know you know closer wait that one's not broken there's a note a giants pray they're asking their ancestors to watch over them to guide them home boy wait i think i know how it works the lantern isn't it [Music] [Music] what did you write i asked them to watch your mother [Music] adorable do you think they'll watch your worst on the way to the top i think crayons said it better yeah definitely a long way up definitely whoa stay back let's fire them a tunnel boy got it i thought i could roll under it stop rolling this game these tunnels around the giants traps good thing too are you okay you can just avoid everything oh come on that is not helping see you on the other side yeah you go have it easy because you're small [Applause] just want to get saved [Applause] another mining may not be as long a way up as we thought chaos [Music] some of the way [Music] all right moving again hey when we get to the summit yeah how far do you think we'll be able to see forever the lake the world serpent our house i don't think we can see the house boy get there until then eyes open i'm fine just lost my balance for a moment you know for someone so strong you sure worry a lot there is a bit of physics on this isn't that and how i keep us alive i guess you can write it he's trying to do the shielding there just knocking on [Music] that's what i'm gonna do now from now on oh god oh so funny [Music] i'm so childlike i'm an idiot not saying that children are ready i don't want to be stuck boy i'd like to move now boy i think part of the lift is stuck in that wall can you get it free yes i can boy use your feet boy put your back into it boy i want more yeats come on let's go do we have to go i do not know i think we'll get attacked again definitely yes boy yes i'll be ready you're wondering about what deodorant craze i swear is queries what does he wear um sure [Music] what does he wear is of course that's unblockable on me uh sorry uh where did you come from you weren't invited kill you cannot carry that find the beaches always works best [Music] i don't think i could eat him stuck again i'm gonna be stuck again [Music] i don't think you can eat him guys i tried to eat him i don't think it's possible i need to parry then try and eat the big boy honestly i don't think i can do it give him a hot heating scene we nearly made it after we scattered our mother's ashes what then what comes next nothing comes next kratos wears links maybe yeah that's it just reminds me of for now painful school you will have much to do you were right earlier on the boat after cutting down the last tree you said it felt like something had changed and it has and our home is no longer safe but it will be again and we must continue your trading we wouldn't make it safe boy okay also i realized one day that lynx doesn't actually stop you sweating it just smells nice you want to get antiperspirant if you want to stop swearing we're almost at the summit nothing's gonna stop us apart from the giant dragon hello [Music] i think maybe the axe will work can you block that oh how would you dodge that do you just have to be at the other side of the platform this dude is so sick be ready it did escalate quickly it looks incredible the design of that dragon so good that was intense whoa what was that it was a red thing you can block it that looks like a root of the egg yourself really okay crystallized zap there's power inside [Applause] incredible i can't believe we fought a dragon i was aiming for his eyes but i can't you have to do the dodge roll okay do you think this is their home did they move in after the giants left or are they why the giants left i think they have why the giants like those thing here more questions oh yes i see i can hear it there's a dragon a hero [__] what's going on sounds like someone's screaming wait boy it's injury can you kill something that big if we can catch it off balance i can distract him [Music] [Music] find an angle wait for my mark thank you it's like a playful kitten yates [Applause] ah no didn't do any damage i don't think that's a good place to be inside a dragon's mouth is it really you can just laser beam us what are we doing in here [Music] oh imagine someone getting in your mouth and just hitting your tongue with an axe [Music] i think i have to throw this in his gob come on give me a go like that don't you [Music] open open wide open wide [Music] give me more oh he's moved any dragon dentists around the size of the thing you want some oh that's not good oh my god okay i think i've got to block that stomp them [Music] there we go look at the timing [Music] ow can you not just leave it alone no oh block that one oh my god what the hell's that okay that leaves something nice i can't use the trace here either [Music] he's got a wound on that side [Music] he gave me a cheeky one on the way out there didn't it no no no stay back i don't have any candy i don't have any ow that was close oh that works really well when he's doing the attack [Music] you'll get another one he's gonna hate that no what i missed i didn't miss [Music] [Music] a baby dragon it doesn't look like a baby is it really a baby dragon look at the size of it okay so i need to get one of these and then when he does that attack [Music] i don't even know if that's a good idea like to pop spawn rage probably not yeah he seems to hate the axe attack more it moves like a baby dog i guess you could say that yeah oh no he's noticed atheists boy are you okay you can use the call be ready to lower the crane on my mark i do not care be ready [Music] lots of love [Music] so that these things come back [Music] okay i think he's going to start doing electric attacks now because he's annoyed at me there we go now i can get this and throw it at him look at that son i like them apples that's it isn't it okay can we do it now now boy [Music] oh that looks good wow we actually did it and you we killed a dragon but but but nobody's killed a dragon for hundreds of years and unless i'm mistaken you did all that for me not for you syndra you are mistaken simply on our path nothing more you deny it all you want but you saved me and that deserves compensation what are these braided mistletoe arrows straighter than heimdall and perfectly weighted um thanks oh okay hold on uh oh not that um have you seen my brother again yeah he said you lost your talent hey very funny snoop oh and that i'm selfish no i'm sure that i value a weapons look no over its purpose that i'm pretentious no and i'm tight fussy i know what he thinks but he can't hurt me burn that i do not have time for this no no no no no wait wait wait wait wait i have a better idea what i just need a tooth from that dragon is that a good idea i mean what we're gonna do with this what's where you grab that oh never mind it's got lava coming out oh so so unclean oh the smell perfect that should do what we do with this yeah i am not touching that just hold it out can we use those against boulder i don't know run that along the string of your son's bow electric arrows just humor me betrayus your bow two passes should do it ah gently now kratos doesn't do gently shock arrows that's cool [Music] whoa oh sure now you're impressed test him um oh i can see i figured it out on your own then just
