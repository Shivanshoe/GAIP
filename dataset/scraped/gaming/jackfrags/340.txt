hey guys and welcome to some bf5 live gameplay commentary today we are playing on mercury kicking things off with a headshot i haven't played this map for ages i don't know just doesn't seem to come up that often in the rotations but we oh no it's an enemy bomber isn't it i saw it in the server list it's been a while really good for sniping on this map oh i've got the craggy orgasm today as well cause remember i posted that last video with the car 98. damn it i can't hit this guy ow so i posted the video with the car 98 and everyone screamed at me in the chat and was like jack just use the craggy organs instead it's just better so that's what we're doing today i'm in a bit of a funny mood as well i've been um look i don't know i really like theme parks right i mean a lot of people like theme parks right it's not a not a weird thing to like is it i like to visit disney a lot when i travel to the us there's a couple theme parks in the uk as well whatever and um sometimes i like to watch the povs of the rides you can go on in the parks and i found one earlier today hang on that guy's down by the rock isn't he damn it i found that kill was stolen from me spotted an enemy medic no no what do they do back there it's a a guy who's recorded himself with his uh his wife and his daughters on thunder road or big thunder mountain in disneyland in los angeles i'm laughing just thinking about it so he's on the ride we're having a great time that's the sound that you make when you go on roller coasters by the way guys if you've never experienced that in your life over there and all of a sudden they're going at one of the inclines one of the hills and the ride starts to slow down and he pans up and looks at the the vehicle in front of him because he's kind of at the back and the guy gets out he gets out mid ride on the incline right and just runs down the stairs and then they're like okay what's going on we've just stopped here why did that guy get out and uh apparently he dropped his phone on the ride like whether he was recording on his phone or something or just slipped out of his pocket his phone dropped out so he he gets off the ride and he goes to get his phone and of course like the operators stopped the ride and then he just runs back up the stairs this dude keeps on recording he just runs back up the stairs with his phone in his hand and just goes sorry it's like it's like he expected it to be you know like a taxi ride or something and the ride would just continue when he when he got back on i just think it's so hilarious just literally runs past him sorry with his crack phone in his hand and gets back in the ride expecting it to just start again and of course no no no no disney they don't just start the ride after something like that happens they basically evacuate the whole train so everyone has to get off the train walk down the stairs cast members come up and chap around them in this the behind the scenes areas of the ride which is kind of cool to see just like the thought of someone doing that man just crack me up so much if you just go to google and type man gets off rides to find phone or something like that it'll come up you'll find it dead easy it's big thunder mountain in disneyland so funny anyway so i'm not concentrating on the game at all we got seven kills what is happening here so i put a random ap mine down there and there it's a little duo of ap mines i need to see if i can help on this b point oh there's people everywhere spaghettios look at that minute ago there's a medic right here wasn't it oh medic he's dead i could get that gun was it stan love this gun of course you don't switch class when you pick up someone else's gun in this game i think i hear people somewhere down here that guy's dead as you can be friendlies oh come on someone keeps stealing my kills what the hell why no i did not see you at all that's full nice vision nice the character models just blend into the scenery we have how have we captured everything on this entire map definitely people over here because i can hear them shooting i swear people keep stealing my kills it's kind of like i'm playing on console isn't it but i'm i'm not i'm playing on pc this is weird there might be a lot of new players on today or something is this just how it goes on mercury every time maybe the map's just in balance oh man explosions everywhere it's friendly though it's okay friendly explosions well i was hoping for a more even game and we'll switch map and see what we get oh it's ours then this is a cool map i haven't played this in a while so we'll stick with it can i get on the tank i would like to become the tank please that's it you get in there you keep pushing me tank oh my god it's a what is happening how long can we serve the tank no don't want to go inside the tank super speed yeah my legs just don't work no i've got inside it that's not what we want why is there blood on my screen just keep sliding me let's go let's go you got to stay in the center you stay roughly in the center you're okay oh no no no dude come on he doesn't want to get bombed luckily they missed i should have just wrote it in the first place shouldn't it oh ineffective bombing there what are you playing that lad let's have a look in the tower there's no one up there tank do the thing from saving private ryan that's it shoot the tower go on yes yes that's how you do it that's how you get him to do it you literally just pretend you're a tank and then shoot there and then the tank does what you want it to it's simple i think i'm going to play medic on this map and just hoon around the village for a bit maybe we're kind of related to disney just started watching the marvel movies again you can get them all on blue right now and i think they're all on disney plus as well but watching them all in oh god there's another one there isn't there hold on a second hold on watching them all in chronological order rather than the order that they were released so you start with captain america because that one is set in the um in the forties two oh my god that tiger thing that looks awesome lovely bit of frostbite destruction there you put that pier down no and then after captain america you watch captain marvel because i would say in the 90s and then you go on to like iron man iron man 2 what's after that incredible hulk i think because even though that's got a different actor playing the hulk it's still set in the mcu and then after that it's thor and then the avengers and that's that's where we're up to at the moment the first movie where they all come together and it's so cool watching it in that order because yeah there's a couple of plot holes here and then a couple things that they say just don't really line up but generally speaking the continuity and the world building they've done with that franchise is 10 out of 10. and i know like it's a bit pop culture you know entertainment for the masses but the movies are super entertaining man some of those films are great i just can't wait to see like winter soldier and civil war again guardians of the galaxy because a lot of those movies i've literally just seen them once like i'm not like a super marvel fan or anything i think the one that i've seen the most is infinity war i reckon i've seen that twice once at the cinema once at home but the rest of them like i've just seen them once oh my god you just got toasted lads so i'm watching them again i'm like i completely forgot about this i didn't realize this thing happened or whatever it might be and there's some awesome moments in those movies what the hell was that did my grenade just explode mid-air someone actually shoot my grenade there i'm sure lots of people might have done the same thing too because of lockdown right there's so much free time you've seen everything on netflix you've watched everything there is to watch on amazon man this gun this gun is so awesome but you don't really you don't even need to aim look just hit fire everything these guys need resting oh god i've got to reload it that's i don't know if i you can you're good we got a little front line disappeared here oh man so what i mean just rinses people got a dead guy here who killed you you got a rest good man i'm out of smoke grenades though that's not good we're losing d said today ah cheeky i'm so sad they didn't patch this map so you could drive around in the tractors i know you can do it on a couple of the other maps and obviously you firestone but i think this originally was where they were supposed to be right imagine just driving through this field in a tractor imagine that explosion in a tractor it would just be so much better wouldn't it someone just fire a sniper shot here i can hear you mate come on you're not a velociraptor maybe you are they made jurassic park didn't elon musk say that he could actually make justice park now if you wanted to oh they've got the technology might as well what else is there to do go to mars i guess but nothing there is there i'd rather build jurassic park on earth instead i think that's a better way to spend your money so elon if you're watching jurassic park come on or if that's not a reality spend a couple million on building like a full-scale resident evil mansion escape room where you pay actors to like hunt you down and pretend to be zombies in the night and you've got to go through the mansion and solve puzzles and maybe they give you i don't know like a bb gun or something or a paintball gun come on elon just take that idea make a nice presentation go to capcom see what they say i'm sure they'll be on board with the idea i just want like one percent that's all almost missed that guy i'm that guy there's a dude here clipped him in the head there straight away he got the advantage that's someone's legs isn't it yeah just shot him through the wall because his legs were sticking out there's someone here as well i can hear him mate come on it's good i've been spotted by a flower oh this gun's good this goes real good i'm the sneaky bee gear in the bushes you'll never find me protecting the e point i love how i spent like ninety percent of the game at this e point so far that's kind of cool i mean i do have the gun for it right the swami this one there go away plane no i want you here no one likes you stay on the runway oh no look how smoky it's gone it's kind of gone red i like that a lot wow such recall control hey don't worry bro yeah yeah the swirly at that distance is absolutely crazy dead still at least one on the point oh you shouldn't find a shot mate gave the game away good good good oh hello just lining up for me boys quick reload what the did someone just throw a bathtub at me that was the slowest moving bomb i've ever seen and it killed us all what the hell was that i've never even seen that before in this game there's always people chilling in the church someone down here wasn't there oh i wanted that second kill what is that oh is there a bloke just in that yeah there is it i feel like i'm playing war zone here you could mount on the wall just get really good accuracy hey don't worry don't worry no no no i'm coming i'm coming it's okay everything's gonna be okay don't worry your kd ratio remains intact where'd you go where'd you go where'd you go are you in here just about got him we still got e which is good it's been a fun match it's nice to just run around with an smg in bf5 usually i'm just sniping when you saw like at the start of the video right we did do a bit of sniping on this map too when we picked up that rifle let's see yeah cutting through the wall beautiful 12 tickets left it's in the bag at 420 tickets guys can't write this 419 i guess it was just coincidence there it is we've got a victory gg gg well played boring game with cheaters mad cuss bad yes reckless cheating card reckless oh
