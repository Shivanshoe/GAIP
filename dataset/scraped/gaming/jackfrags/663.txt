everyone hope you're doing well and welcome to some call of duty war zone today I'm joined by the magnificent study and the fantabulous acolytes we're gonna be playing some trios and the loner that I'm going for is the meta loadout here which I've Apple enabled meta nailed labeled I've labeled it matter I've not enabled it enabled isn't even a word but whatever this is what we're working with it's the ground the mp5 you guys know how it is I thought you know what today seeing as I'm playing with study and acolyte two of the most excellent gamers in the world ever I thought that I would see the trihard thing so we've got the growl that's my loadout you guys all know this by now come on well I did drop the TOC laser I went for the Crone and sniper early on the grip instead and the mp5 Opie mp5 which is this bad boy here check him out or I've even got a crab with a knife on it that's how good it is that's it man that's the one anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this live stream if you're watching it as a video afterwards thank you for tuning in it's on mutant let's get into a game and see if we can make some magic happen here we go all right boys we ready let's go you ready so ready Q us up alright both end all sent today acolytes got the dog Oh dogs got the mask with two eyes that I've always had and has never changed ever really boring have you ever bought any skins thud uh yeah well but to make a thumbnail maybe never see what used a different skill is that how you justify it to your accountant so what why did you spend this ten pound here well I needed to make a thumbnail so it's a thumbnail this one alright you buy any skins Connor yeah yeah I'm a sucker I enjoy skins only like I only buy them if I can see them like if I feel like the money is worth spending mm-hmm it's like because we don't play third person right so oh wait you played their person yeah I've got this hack it's lets me see round corners damn I gotta give me that we are we are the hacker yesterday no way you see one in a ages yeah we do we had to do a two in a row what it was really weird so the first one was like using a PKM and it didn't seem too instant but then he was dropping his gun after firing and just every time you pick his gun up he would have blammo again it was so weird PKM BPM and an RPG both obsidian Skinner's are that's very strange and then the literal next game when we when we came in on paratroop I got Lady beamed by another actor it's super weird maybe you got photos shadow lobbies that's not mean how do you think you've got putting a hacker lobby well no because it happens in stints like the last time I have hackers with a three in one day and then again just nothing for two weeks right it's this it's just so weird how it works you reckon they'll put out a new band wave when season four girls live or whatever I am so but then again I don't see any other hackers ever it's so weird yeah just in these little stints like every so often maybe they get their cheats updated for like one day and then Infinity Ward patch the game then they don't work any mean that's the way doing it I thought that was brilliant though like putting them in the shadow lobbies because then they they never get banned so they never make another account right I don't know right they'll know that they're in the show their lobbies will they though hmm because it's only potential cheaters I suppose if they get obviously killed by cheeser over and over again yeah and then they look at the killcam that we like okay it was a cheater where we going this is like an aggressive spawn but we can go blue somewhere safer yeah all rights to it it'll be hot it'll be hot hot I don't know there's no contracts there might not be my skybox hasn't rendered in I've had that way of the water doing rendering as loft yeah it's just where I'm like a floating island almost the world is flat watch out oh shoot oh he's pissed he's pissed that he's won by buying you one buy mine he's gonna beat you up I'm going in oh he's got me make your paste on make it pay I'm in the game I see Mason he's just holding that out there wait for him is dumb I should have just beat him down to a pulp you know rather than trying to share listen nothing up there was a your skin was he wearing your skin you got through life goes rena helmet this guy here in that oh yeah I'm a I'm a late them I mean okay okay underneath me right now you ran back this is a company Wednesday he's doing no no no you Brandt any running welcome alright I got me a gun what Pinkett you go spell it's a full team know whatever pain do you have hundreds on that could be worse it West Coast is definitely worse yeah West Coast is horrible unbelievable yes yes I feel like West Coast is even bad for me though really which is really strange okay I feel like I am less less pagani you yep yeah Donovan acolytes joined us today the legend absolute legend reckon those boys will come back here no no there's not enough stuff here for them to come there was no mission or anything they went for so yeah you know what I think I might just I know and now we make her I got the super jump off that roof how did you do that super jump it just sometimes throw that exact roof nowhere else on the map so sometimes it just throws you forward like 100 feet when you do when you do a vault over the edge let me see my parachute well you know he's just trying to hide his cheats here jack yeah that's what's going on here I just openly cheat that's okay the lead sheep any moment you can just press the burner sometimes get secured well that's kind of like did you ever try that apex one pretty could fly back off in the air it wasn't a cheater it's just like a glitch well how did that work Connor did you not play that balloon have that one balloon yeah I was a star balloons I think and then while you were flying I forget exactly how you didn't look straight up whilst you were flying and you would just forever float upwards all right and you would just bounce around you know see that one Jack surely you made a video oh it was the emot-- wheel wasn't it you had like use the emote wheel and then throw your mouse upwards or something in your character would just teleport you're top of the map so I think I'd memed it for a bit I can't remember exactly I don't remember the event well I just remember you just dragged your mouse all the way to the sky whilst you were on the balloon and then you would just go upwards it sounds like yeah I think I think it was the emot-- wheel that just bugged it there was like just that one patch I'm sorry Girl Scout it's not gonna really whatever Nevel not bad are we going up okay yeah that was really funny you play much apex anymore Connor wanna do you play much apex anymore I don't know like I'm I don't know for me it's always I play a certain game for a few months generally and unless they're constantly putting out patches and new content stuff then I get I get pretty bored quickly yeah I think that's for most content creators those streamers right yeah let's see it unless you battlefield streamer and yeah you're sadist you enjoy pain forcibly playing the game you still cheat is following your own battlefield stop was it okay um I mean occasionally not really much I'm about four five I mean maybe because I'm just never know when I'm on so they can't

got it can we go now just can you go now children thankful the plates back to the plates plates Hey I mean somehow I'm still four plates after all right beautiful gonna get you a they have you guys ever tried running around with melee no it is so good Richard hits two hits with anything yes oh not the bunt of your gun cuz apparently that takes like three or four hits or something okay I'm just like melee and just chop chop done no but I got pretty close doing it so you just run restock with like stun grenades and they just run to people okay oh no I don't the same is thunder I don't know but if you do have a throwing knife it counts as a melee right like if you gotta mail with them oh yeah okay okay yeah there was people building another mark Greene it was people fighting there it would be this one even on blue yeah they were being shot at from 240 I mean I'm really in the open air I don't know where I want to go okay did you kill him on the roof because there was somebody dead

full team is dead over here cuz I saw like three or four dead bodies on yellow okay so if someone is full health and full armor you can kill them with two hits I'm almost positive that you can I forget if not it's three but that's pretty quick two hits just fine fine yeah and how fast the meal is and it punches you like you get that aim punch have you tried to win a game using just melee only yeah we did it and I think trios like you Stone Mountain and someone else yeah karemera I know is Stone Mountain I for sure so you didn't kill Tommy buddy when they go okay uh I honestly can't

pushing left left this one Wow pushing up to you a presenter thank you I was I was I was slow but it was bad it was bad but it worked son of herself after like you panic you stunned their leaders panicked so you kind of gets this I think you will not show tom Ronis what's up from Greece how you doing eleven what's up Lucas Brandon thank you for the to appreciate that a slow fat wombat thank you for the ten just want to say thanks for all your content and the informative videos and all the games in between keep up the great work and also can you do bf3 or bf4 live shoes this month the problem with bf3 and bf4 livestream slow fat is the people cheat a lot in those games on PC and there's a group of stream snipers who whenever a youtuber or twitch streamer goes live a will just turn on their hacks join the servers that the stream is on and ruin it like I tried to stride to do battlefield one a few weeks ago and was just following me around like every single game so I just had to stop this you can't what can you do it ruins the game for everyone else like I don't mind not playing but if I'm ruining it for everyone else that's on that server just because I'm live-streaming it's not great is it so yeah bf3 and bf4 a bit difficult to stream I mean if I had my own private server yeah I could definitely do it then or if I was on a server that had an admin yeah that would work I don't really know any battlefield 3 or 4 admins so yeah they'll definitely be more bf3 and bf4 videos but in terms of live streams it's difficult because people cheat so much on those games unfortunate but it is what it is but thank you for the tenth one that I appreciate that I hope that answer was sufficient for you Soph thank you for becoming a new member Joshua thank you for the 300 really like your game style greetings from Mexico Oh Joshua always wanted to go to Mexico you know I think when everything is back to normal in the world might organize some travel there love to go so much thank you for the 25 really love the war zone content the same your twitch channel has been selected for twitch drops on escape from tarkov didn't know you played I don't play much to be honest I don't play much but all I am kind of gonna try it again I need to get good at it I'm really bad at it anyways right we're gonna focus up on the game again not my player so quick thank you guys know what I said yeah no worries I was I wasn't it was probably the most what's the word long before I've never were aiming like something before then when the meta was the 75 you talk about modern warfare multicam yep yeah what you wanted to use it no no no I was innocent III didn't want to play anymore because I didn't want to eat I didn't want to play against it you know it was so draining it was extremely draining I've got like green jack Thanks I mean they those sound like big snipers we were together low dose that's all right I'm Graham another contract of this how'd you know the people that like follow you on servers when you play is like bf3 and bf4 mmm you find that they they don't do it if you don't tweet about it or is it just whenever your life like are they always there well I mean if he'd the more you talk about it the more they do it that's what that's what I realized I mean if you just basically basically if you just set yourself up to say every time you could live with a game like that you just saved yourself if this happens I've got a back-up plan so that you literally just don't get frustrated with it like you know bf4 never you cannot get away with streaming beer for just anyone do people really do that - just just it and it's really it's like a it's like a platoon whole I guess you could say of people who are literally like because the battlefield security is so bad albeit bf4 is at least it's like everything's open IP addresses server IP everything like that you know just like yeah we don't want streamers playing this game though they just really need to go the other way yeah yes bad eh I didn't know that like I play I play battlefields for like a week or two when it first comes out but then the new ones have a new infrastructure to the servers are all owned by dice so that they're not third PI servers in bf4 and even bf3 like it's all third buy service so they're really easily infiltrated you know can they like get your IP at one point as well from the a absolutely still can right yeah yeah oh man EPA that's crazy I don't know about that yeah why is that Jeep is making a weird noise isn't it was that just me you guys want to go for a contract or something yeah you almost got enough for a loan now they're all gone what that's like right here he will fight you like that right that right that right there people find rather run low down yeah yeah I don't want to fight them with this Grahame for their in where are they it was like that one's going in it we do need to be careful behind us and after all right do you want to use the car to get into the zone oh I don't really want to cross this other night yeah I guess yeah yeah just looking across and then don't bother I mean that we would have seen people trying to sleep over by now the Justice building for art is lion-o knows really hunted the sky Oh No just cover this guy up yeah we need cash really don't worry anyone need plates they got five drop a couple fleas start if you can I'm okay thank you again yeah I tried to stream bath with one a few weeks back start then it was just like I had about like 45 minutes and then the same guy every single server just hacking rage hacking you know they just delete everyone yeah and there's and there's there's nothing in place to even stop that like you can't just like you know there's no one to contact so it's just kind of like oh well it's all stop sorry was a guy in green oh that guy was instant Oh wonder if the guy in the truck is the guy who is unthink what'd you reckon oh you're threat one down just then yeah he just jumps out the truck oh yeah yes I see I see obviously windows open on this moon feeling I feel like there's someone around I don't know there's a bunch of plates in here if you need I need a satchel yeah so do I so no by station you're shoot shoot no joke guys I guess we're go for that scavenger try to you all yeah really do you feel like I run so much faster than mail out I think no isn't it it's a weird thing like Malay is a hundred and three percent for the pistols 106 percent I'm pretty sure you do run faster you want to try a check yeah sure I could have and then just do a double sprint yeah it makes it look like you're running faster just because the screen is shaking speed yeah is increase the fov or is it just like good let's have a raisin illusion I've got like it I've done it before it's the same I've got high mobility mp5 right it's just you want to do it you want to go right right ready okay yep one yeah about the same yeah it's the same time because I tested it previously we were doing like the slide running to cancel it's egauge sprint back do you think it just doesn't look like you're winning class yeah it's just a visual thing I think oh did your screen shakes more cuz you're moving your arms right do you have more stamina though so like your if you have a melee weapon does your tactical sprint regen faster anyway I don't think so no maybe and what about the slide counselor did actually increase your speed no so what that does it just kind of like resets your double sprint mm-hmm so you can do the sprinting faster again more frequently I mean I find that it really messes up my how do I set my timing like I'm if I'm if I'm trying to if I'm focusing so hard and try and do the slide cancel I'll end up like sliding into someone and then just fumbling everything I do when I'm dodging you know like when I'm dodging far away you can just go diagonal instant diagonal yes so I mean yeah just double taps the slide right to cancel it double stack so double tap change stance make sure that make sure your slides is just same stance and then you just and debate the jump express you to see you go Crouch crouch jump Crouch crouch jump because you're basically canceling the animation of you going from crouching to standing by jumping oh it looks so weird oh okay I've never done it that way that's new I honestly I don't know if it does make a difference I use if I tried to do it where it stacks prints as well so I don't even have to double tap for words forget it oh let that messed up my invest on my stuff is this

what else may I with those rumors that they're gonna show a new Resident Evil as well mmm you know I think it's gonna be really impressed if I hope so like Sony usually pretty good at just showing gameplay but last III or III where they showed God award remember that that was just like solid hour of awesome gameplay 2016 I think yep I think it'll be good I think it'll be good cuz they didn't they postponed it yeah we're supposed to be last week yeah I mean hopefully hopefully yeah I'm looking forward to it I might have to level up my console skills again with the controller you fight that's coming some years no I haven't played in years what's uh let me guess hello oh yes of course yes myself some hayla I played everything I call it someone I when I was growing up mm-hmm and then I got my first PC and now I just slowly started swapping over and then I just couldn't go back yeah well I was a good game I enjoyed that one we did get some new members in there as well guys thank you at Brian P thank you for the 25 hello from New York C and for the entertainment wall on total lockdown here no problem Andres Fritz thank you for becoming a new member Darko thank you for the ten days thank you to the fire in a fan since bf4 love your channel thank you so much man that's very kind you I appreciate that Elijah how you doing hello bird sub J n Daniel I'm looking forward to battlefield VR I'm not sure they're gonna do a VR battlefield game you know I can't see that happening I don't think VR is it's not like that mainstream at the moment I'm sure they sold a load of headsets but I think until it's like Wireless completely wireless and it's just a set of glasses on your face I'm not sure it's gonna have mass appeal until it's at that moment but VR is cool I mean I've had a lot of great VR experiences I wonder if PlayStation are gonna show a PSP r2 or something like that I'd be interesting I believe throw this to everyone -

P now you still run around in there he probably going to the roof yeah he's on that roof jumping on is he jumps in the back yeah yeah well this is a nightmare he's running away I hear someone with a suppressor yes that was him yeah there's I heard voices unless he just got sniped I just heard uh-oh I think it's safer to just get some money in what do you guys in charting do you think he's just good or he's got an aimbot the guy that killed me before I went in the gulag what do you reckon I'd be interesting if we get to suspect a that guy again in the match later on I'm not sure to be honest cuz I wa I didn't have any armor and he had an mp5 so he could just have a really high sense and just turned around and beam me yeah i didn't didn't get much chance to react to it my personal opinion is that at the moment i'm uncertain but maybe we'll get killed by him again maybe we'll get to spec to him we'll say David Burleson thank you for the five love your content hopes emote our coven he'll let loose with Tommy and Adam keep up the great work David thank you so much man that's very kind here yeah I definitely want to try and get better at tarkov cuz [ __ ] off can be quite fun when it

afterwards so we can just all watch and see and we can decide in the comments if you're watching this as a video let me know in the comments below what do you reckon tarik said it looked sketchy to me way too fast Luke James how do you think the bunker ties into everything I think it's teased in the next game you know there's rumors that it's gonna be a black ops game and the bunkers feel a bit cold war Sammy so we will see that's the only thing job was maybe search for some yeah be careful the word can I get that or is it no no no drop on out here if anybody missed it I'll drop on you sucker okay who's gonna try and find some more plates before we go fight so we're gonna net good car I can give you my own people I've again Jack go on I sure have a growl I can drop you that yeah thanks for a growl yeah Roy yeah we do like one like and that would be great thank you coming hey beautiful this is the a cue light special then is it I mean I picked it up of somebody else okay I'm

us wanna go so I don't have ghosts on this no no no no wait let's play right there dude in the open is it way using those three plates for one mmm someone baited that did you get it if you go look at that look at this own though we might as well just start heading towards the edge alright yeah we could very well do that or do you want to do some more contracts it's it's whether we edit that I don't know I just I just don't feel ready for some engagements you know not really we just get a few more plates we could we could full send yeah yeah they killed that guy got on me was a bit sauce you know was it it was yeah my streamer was well type of suspicious well it could be it's just like a beam dim broke his armor he jumped instantly flicked to me 180 didn't miss a shot it wasn't why he did something like that to me as I am sorry sorry start it wasn't like no when you're turning and shooting you're gonna miss a few shots it was just ton instantly you know dead we'll see I'm not sure I guess yeah we might run into him again oh people fightin I'll give him the benefit as a diamond five yeah he did have his custom mp5 as well and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt at the moment but we'll say if we run into him again yeah we get for that bouncy maybe yeah I do the stairs been trained roof I think we have to cross over to the left here to get up there I think that stairs just say oh and getting up in there you're ie people find nearest though that was a water drop at the by station was it yep okay let's say for now I intercepts different forceps yeah just the weight crash protect your back area if you guys won't I have it I have a drone to guess of c4 I have idea of see only one though maybe I did hear off the steps I don't know we can keep running again I was a little far behind you guys so you might have heard me echoing through okay Oh shots I think there might be people yeah there might be people on blue and push it yeah I guess that's it yeah they're bright there's right there they're right there so I can beam in and down him down him okay I'm gonna stir okay nothing was see anyone else it they might be right that's gonna fill the guy down right first dead oh yeah over here there's a sniper northeast yeah yeah I think he's fighting that theme though yeah well he's just keeping him is now oh look at that that's not Easter nice timing you stopping me from the left side of one of those aircon units I feel like I want to bang him with this collar you know I mean I know I had it for a second I need to stop peeking so is that speaking again back dim honey three brothers Jack get him give me one more yeah sure this is where I get knocked Connor I know that you're fine someone's gonna do the same thing that we just did to this poor guy oh he did it alright the gas is coming I suppose he has to move he has to move yeah he has to move either he goes back down which Carlo he's gonna do yeah and then someone just rest behind this as well blue yeah Oh being from down below North how did they did I have an angle on you then I was standing on the wall all right yeah we'd have much to replace our plates do it someone just rezzed over on yellow yeah there's a satchel here guys oh yeah there is a gas mask and just wait on there that's too shaky we need everything they have respawn over here it's closing that door we came out yeah the slowest moving gas ever this is let's see any movement in the train yard like there's nothing better than a I've just seen some of that blue marker blue in that building yeah yeah that was probably me he was in in that door whether taking shots there from 300 down low I think do you want to get over here I'm only gonna push across yeah there's some plates down there zone yeah we're all on the radar now as well yeah more plates anyone need plays I got three auto seven I'm good this is the Recon Dre hold on yeah I'm not too c4 on it okay so I guess yeah yeah yeah I can I get two okay no they're right below me and right below me I'll let you know in 32 on it okay in about oh that's not my drone on huh in about three two one go go go blast shield no dude it was literally on him yeah Hey sorting for c4 you gotta be kidding me others I do on it oh okay yeah I was just Connors they in that small building yeah yeah they're in there they're on there look at Mike they might have moved one another back sniping in the back don't pushing them yeah they've gotta go now left and watching left I'm watching that one we always have to go as well we might want to felt like we bullying these guys huh that guy killed them off yeah Oh most definitely pulling go come on you went to left left we gotta go guys Gus Gus Gus gotta go Jack do you have any extra hay our team wipe you want some lace there's a shop here if you really want to be quite sure if you want to be great you can go to the shop don't know if accountant I mean I guess I'm just gonna buy some plates that's a good idea hi boys sweat mode activated yeah indeed just crossing this gap here it's bit down to ruse do you guys feel worthless sometimes not a sniper it's a guy right was he saying yes the same no he hasn't see me but we can all just beam him when we get there this Wesley in here is our in this building that he's there and all that so okay was a guy on my thing like a left is he pushing yeah nope he's hit he's not dead he's not dead he's here but he's not dying on the ground killed my son I didn't get to kill on the guy in the woods could've self raised or beam res I have to get this what is that I was a keycard don't want it I got a precision you keep talk key cards feel kind of useless no doubt that yeah mm-hmm waste of time dude you still here somewhere hmm I've got one few more stunts I'm doing which is I said I'm got a load of a RI MODOK could Rob go there checking right yeah I can give you some oh it was right here yeah that's the guy that was the star we can get go slow laughs now it's quite risky to I feel I feel it is gonna be like at least one yeah that's really risky you wouldn't just rush to and the building yeah do you for loves dad ed places all central keep car maybe wasn't there a guy right here on the left was a guy beyond this wall did anybody know he's still alive I know right beware of fire as well got a res - Reza's so for us yeah I mean fire it seems clear all right it's not obviously it's not gonna be in the zone though you want to get on a roof he'll just literally say roof of the three guys ago this one will be partially in mmm yeah this is DejaVu man and there's no one here again where are they all okay the it's in but it's not the roof isn't like nothing that's safe is in if you're not I mean like there's no cover it's in so we can move to the next one maybe 11 guys like this we could do this one cuz there is to res design yellow but if we can get that roof yonder mr. will be we can't be staying on this roof with savouring yeah I think okay yeah 100% understand quite about dead silence we do we want to push this so do we one just get someone just ran through somebody's round right to left from blue to the tool building with the roof yes do you guys won in there yeah he was watching it there's one guy upstairs I think he's alone up there can we get up there without being no no you can do this if you go on the bottom floor he's making balcony now there was another green ankle I'm in here okay reload watch me I think they're just a month I think there's only one I only seen one you really think it's not anyone can i yeah default skin right he's right yeah I see he's good he's here he's gonna stick into the war on a bye son yeah meet Dan did you down one no no no no didn't get it I don't like this fun we have to be from out to eat now wait the balcony me yeah no I mean in here near here you place your little slide he plates how many of you got so how many you got I've got five all right thank you did you drop one more please just in case yeah yeah thanks do we keep moving oh dude this is gonna get crazy or maybe we wait until waiting so that's ending in the gas they've just have just heard the move I just moved on brenes me you know you know we letting and then running through there another one right through this window there's a guy over the road as well somewhere there's a guy down there's another one as well there's not the skin lights or before there's another skin - I left somewhere no eyes on nowhere around here you must have ran maybe died there um I'd like to go back it in in the building he's in their garage building a little Hut okay okay three three oh they're sleeping or we are get me into where any of guns here Donna thank you yeah I can do some plates pika pika pika from blue Peterson blue right you know exactly where we are graph the moving fire one layer he's gonna yeah he can't be compy push push reloading okay pushing cover the buildings where we were life behind us yeah I'm down self-rising now if you got me in left on that second the left track one further back one step back president over damn I didn't expect the guy in the far right I mean they absolutely I don't just with that position that I couldn't do anything because the gas Mike's kept going on I wish you could manually do that though so frustrating a lot of people have said that yeah well these the guys that you see what you want to do with the console oh no I don't think so different guys yeah different skins yeah different skin and go boy to us first and second so now we have to convert and then that's it and the prophecies fulfilled it was it just one left then no no no so the the I downed one Jack in the gas and then he just sell for us so it was to be one at the end all right thank you Jason yeah yeah I'll plate Oh all three of these games been really good actually mm-hmm I felt like a match I was a crazy around wasn't it go uh Mario what do you think about the skin camera of the weapon telling something about the player any thoughts I just pick whatever I think looks cool to be honest Danny thank you for the fired love your content what do you think of rise of Skywalker Oh counts noodle thank you before sorry thank you for the tea beans from Germany okay so rise the Skywalker I am a I'm a big star Wars fan I have my whole life ever since I was a very small kid I used to dress up as Luke Skywalker when I was like four years old right that's the context for you I'm a massive Star Wars nerd I watched all the rebels I've seen all Clone Wars I read some of the comics play a lot of Star Wars games rise a Skywalker for me right it's it's an OK Star Wars movie I like a lot of the visuals in it I like a lot of the action I think the first time I watched it I predicted almost everything that happened it was very predictable and without spoiling anything I felt like every time that movie made an interesting choice and an interesting decision about characters it instantly undid it and it didn't mean anything so what was the point of doing it in the first place that's it's okay the second time I watched it I liked it more because I felt like more of it made sense the second time around but it was just okay like it's not it's not one of my favorite Star Wars movies put it that way I've seen it three times now I don't think God watch it again unless I was doing the marathon put it like that but I think they should have stuck to their decisions that they made in the movie and they would have had way more impact all right way to you boys if you want to if you want another hottie you there again oh it wasn't hot the first time but that one there come a member generally anywhere where there's like a search contractor at the start is where it'll be hard so whatever you guys why I like the one near superstore light an edge all right you want to go for the marks one yeah you wanna come on I see a couple of people maybe none and I will get so your nameplate wasn't there for a second so I'm ready to fight come on do stuff let's go okay no one no no real shots from super well it's up to you guys now do you guys want to just try to do the contract as quick as possible yes loadout written yeah and then we just start rushing kill contracts the force awakens is actually my favorite Star Wars movie from the new trilogy I can watch the force awakens so like again and again and again and I never get bored of it it's got so many cool moments in it I love that it like introduced characters in the way that it did it's quite interesting and the the fight at the end between pilo and rey and finn it's a brilliant I think I love it the choreography on it and the moment where like Ray and kylo have like their lightsabers next to each other and you can just see their faces up close like the red and the blue glow I got I love that shot he has a brilliant shot and the bit with the Falcon when they escape from jakku love that moment so nostalgic but my favorite ever Star Wars movie is the Empire Strikes Back here drop me some money yeah take my money I can't believe we already have a straight someone else just got the load out as well to our Northwest wait sorry say again does anyone need you like in the armor or anything full okay imagine having your load oh it's like less than two minutes in the game it's so good okay I think think there's gonna be a lot of people run here cuz this the scavenger contract is still here as well yeah Oh threat medium don't even realize it be huntin Oh guess we just rented that pop own way from the bush I only just popped up oops oh they must be here with us somewhere um any eyes on ya negative this guy here yeah yeah that's thing that's probably them there's an our ammo refill they're both red

them as well okay so that just came I see we don't know how far away in the forest probably you there's our view on this roof again Oh with this lot of sense it's so difficult to get these tests give you like am i dropped on there I have to whip my mouse around like crazy did someone shoot down to the right yeah right something like an m4 okay I got here even beam bin ready sounds down down nice might have teammate someone hey fella kaity Jesus you one shot I hit him once again this team it there's the teammate this guy down here on the wall or on the tree he's a good player finish the guy underneath us that's okay those guys directly beneath us yeah well Mike's in blue see that blue but someone else not from their big roof they're fighting now you were fighting over it taking potshots oz3 move closer to the main train don't like I don't like being up there yeah yeah down that guy that was janeski boom and then what's the other time Oh guys we didn't get the bounty watch out for where pull any opportunity I hope so yeah this squad could become notes that they could all be on the roof now mmhmm yeah they were just down here listenin so you still trying to snipe me no one on the through so far down one again yeah rag doll the reason that I'm streaming in 1440p is because if you are so difficult not to use this if you only stream in 1080p on YouTube you get the old codec and the quality is terrible if you up scale to 1440p you get the vp9 codec which looks so much bad than the AVC codec which is the old one that's the real curve in devoting bully the bully yeah how are they do my son is your eyes on you yeah a little bit oh okay that was not stood mid ahead shows nuts finish again that was that was pretty insane do you want to stay away from that guy yes we go round the right of the building is dead I can't no we have time I don't know but we do we do we got time Oh full theme pool team full team ran front of me you see it born yeah dropping trophy yeah I've got a high angle it a push I don't think they were I think we're just gonna let that we let the vein pretend our number one ones directly in front of one on the broke stud keep in the back you guys keep it up down two down I haven't heard a res on them yet but I did a haired one tree mush once holding me down running their gas in the gas one finishing I guess I must I've got I've got no plates now we'll go past the shop here really hope that guy is just a really good sniper yeah sights a cue light and then go another hill on him and as I jumped down midair yea medgar was free he hit me was climbing a staircase like just different elevation every I've been eating money play what do you guys want plates right yeah this place okay if they survived then that squad did bigger res they know I killed finished one and then there was two up okay can you please Jackie I could do agree well I've got I've got three I can get one thank you they're gonna be about right close down and green just drop down watch out for this psycho though yeah maybe you stay low maybe stay low cuz I'm thinking just being up top is just asking for it yeah was it mark Schmidt how you a Marine reservist yeah that's them I think that's that group they just raised I'm Switzerland boy and shop on the rooftop dude this crowd it's just got no recoil yeah it's 60 rounder just I think they'll changing you know in the patch already how do they have to it didn't change them for uh that's not noisy you like still on the roof the guy on the roof yeah and we've got a or uh no they could drop this you can drop your little here thank you good long it's too full mags I think beautiful picked up some long where do we want to be I want to see if I can get um go stuff that loadout don't know you might as well try it's in a pretty similar but they're still peeking that roof the day they do they have to jump they have to jump now they have to done that already the first one Jack's just going in I can see the sweat dripping off of them sorry man yo I didn't forget about you 16:06 games do I just take a sniper I feel like where we are maybe it's I don't use it man like I just I feel like I'm not even playing the game thing is if you don't use the met weapons you're such a big disadvantage right now tell her really mm-hmm like I don't want to use the ground but if you want to be competitive you kind of have to it's not even competitive if you just want to stay in the match yeah would you like to have fun yeah okay okay um I'm broke I'm a break use the ground why 50 over 60 some reason just cuz I prefer the little [ __ ] mobility yeah smash absolutely smash I need plates if you gonna spare broke the gap on the rack what about the guy hill uphill rocky like he was downed the one guy Oh downed okay it's not guys still about six players thought if you want some yeah yeah yeah yeah mystery he'll do now do Tiger double the hilltop the hill mark and I've got no ammo what about our left what about left as well surely they're gonna be taller safe - Sam oh here's one thing you one team left once you met once he met this is it till I left broke something stunning done hit and downs the other guy's low at okay job man I sweat for the last thing well done I was just dominant absolutely AJ's very well played yeah how do we do ten ten seven I'm not gonna lie I do feel a little useless with the scart you guys just lazy having people across the map those easily empathy for most of that and then and then I gave up see I think for the recoil and like the damage that gun is it's well balanced yeah it's how the grip you're out and the m4 which are just the exact same weapon basically they just have more damage on top of that GG you guys I'm gonna call it there for now that was really good fun I like this hurry man it's a good group I think we should play some more - yeah for sure alright guys catch Alea have a good one man light up right boys and girls that was really fun we played four matches we won three and we came second and the one that we did we dance the more I calculate I really enjoyed it just to show you my loadout again you know that is the meta loadout things may change when the patch goes live when season four goes live but you know like it really feels like the growl is just too strong if you're not using the growl you can have a bad you have a
