Oh sushi grenade yes oh right and topless I've got a perfect solution oh you eat tanked all that didn't talk about Mon did eh oh we we just ruined their whole day hi everyone hope you're doing well today I wanted to see how effective the grenade launchers in cod war zone could be because I thought to myself I've never actually used one before but instead of putting it on a sensible primary I went for a golden egg a instead because I'm weird like that but at least it's a bit different from the usual growl and for loadout so I also wanted to mention a few things soo first up hello to all the new subscribers thank you so much for choosing to watch my videos here we picked up 80,000 new subs in the last 30 days which is an insane number to me and I'm very grateful for your support here check this out - I was playing warzone a couple days ago and I put an armor plating as I was going up a ladder and this weird animation started playing of a bandage you can see the soldiers kind of wrapping a bandage around the ramen and it made me wonder perhaps in the past this game didn't have health regeneration in it and you had to apply a bandage to fix that and maybe they thought you know it just isn't as fun if you don't have also health regen so they got rid of this but maybe this old animation this old code is still in the game or it could be that this is something that's coming in the future we'll have to see pretty cool though finally lots of people say that they miss my live streams on YouTube and the notifications aren't sent out so I wanted to let you know that this week if you want to tune in I'll be live on Wednesday the 3rd at 8 p.m. BST that's a midday Pacific time for the new season of warzone and also on Friday at the same time - and if you do want to get those notifications just check to see if you're subscribed and have activated the infamous spell with that said here's some hot action using the grenade launcher with jacksepticeye I hope you guys like this if you do leave a like and enjoy you think monolithic suppressors are real are they real think Jack I have the power of the Internet in my hands how how what do you mean how it's just kind of surgeon and oh yes there they are real you the inside of them is completely different Jack i'ma send you a picture okay now don't freak out how will you send me a picture I'm about to blow your mind Wow at the inside of it looks like apparently that's science then something to do with the sound and the the gas moving around yeah see for everyone at home who's not listening right now when this gun shoots and go bang that's actually gas exploding from the gun did you get the purple tracer pack for the ground that's what I keep seeing I didn't they put it in the store a couple days ago everyone's balls it cuz it's it's got purple traces for the growl of the mp7 which I like to the most popular guns and again oh yeah I should put that I mean I've got one here which is a gold ak-47 with a bayonet on the end I've not seen anyone use that but it's probably trash gold a K I mean should I just do its go grenade launcher on the bomb as well good for the crack why not why I've made a monstrosity of a gun I'm okay with it oh I thought that was you how's the guy here that was really confusing Oh that's not a problem okay I don't know what people are doing in this round anyways as always say oh this is Toby koala this is bananas Jase the grenades are so bad check out my gold okay though its beauty sake come on duck rubber come this way so I can launch my grenades idea how they going for the by I wonder they just drive around in circles okay mad lads they've got to come this way though cuz the gas is pushing yeah he might be at the boy are you ready for this there we go here we go yes that was amazing I didn't even see the care anymore I just saw explosion from behind the rock the flame is just licking up into there whoa where am I getting shot from behind I think that's the first-ever grenade launcher kill Oh God oh those are whistling by my head put some damage on him I do have an airstrike I could pop it down could be cheeky he's already in the zone though isn't he yeah they're here a spike in it he's got a move damn horse for you this is fun you get gold eh hey powers I'll thank God that can't kill him remember a battlefield one you could do that you just get off your own teammates anybody TV station nay you said nay we are but men rock I'm not going to attempt the next bit because they involved singing and I'm impressed that you went for it I'll do it for you don't want to drive these things around what is it little kids toy for a junk come on lil easter egg or something look at that that would be pretty tight how hilarious would that be if you see like a fully geared up tactical SWAT guy 3 3 guys 1 2 yeah I was so good the horse out here a horse like the Deadpool moped from fortnight yes I don't see a single person oh I did all right over the ridge oh nice I'm too low for this behind that over there Oh Sunday no game up get the guy who went right and he is a friend with him though have you still got cluster strike no let's move sure we gotta go it's

put some may start Oh behind me do I meet your right yeah I'm gonna go down I think he raised his friend next to me ah I'm een that's our first game so yeah it's not a bad game that's true I don't know if I would recommend using the grenade launcher in wars over it's fun but it's kind of difficult to use and also the AEK is a bit trash it just doesn't work very well in water but fast maybe I'll try and put together a decent build in the future we'll sit anyways I hope you guys enjoyed that a few later [Music]
