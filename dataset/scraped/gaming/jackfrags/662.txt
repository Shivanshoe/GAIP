hi everyone and welcome to the final episode of across the battlefield 4 battlefield 5 this is the only map that remains Provence we covered encampment last week and there isn't anything left this is it this will be the final Mac I suppose will be a 5 unless there's any surprises along the way and I've decided to go with the welcome today I've leveled it off I've got it to level 4 and I respect it out for hipfire so hopefully we can put that to good use here today and get some decent hipfire kills I mean that's not a bad start really I understand to know that ba5 won't be getting any more Maps after this that's it I mean I'll definitely cover the game still of course if anything crops up there are any Easter eggs that kind of thing I can't really push that but this I suppose will be the last completely unedited live gameplay let's say I might be taught in the back yeah you know what I'm getting out there don't like that I'm gonna go around this way will they be expecting me well that was a person now that was someone's head I'm going to be crazy what we all is this guy clued up yes he is I just tried to rush me could be someone appear still yeah there we go yeah this Weldon is an absolute monster in here fire it really is I mean the ray of fire isn't super quick but just like how active really is like look at this look at the distance there it's not bad can people spawn now I suppose they can well being shot from the church someone just blew the hell oh don't you dare that guy just jumped off and killed himself cool Oh it's the ladder still there sometimes if people destroy another ladder still there should we go up and see see if there's anyone up here hello oh there's a couple of minds how strange you know what I'm gonna make a big bang I'm gonna put my only online there let's see if it blows those a say goodbye church tower well it's still standing never mind who was shooting at me then was it you finished.i Damon sooner than I think I'm not sure if there's enemies underneath me in the church perhaps rolly-polly I didn't Rollie pollie I think he's dead man he's dead he's dead Johnny it's always Johnny isn't it there's always a Johnny in every game of Battlefield ever this is Johnny he's Johnny a popular name I mean I've got a very good friend called Johnny uh maybe there's just more Johnny's than we think maybe that's all it is I feel like if I push up to this black here it's gonna be a nice Hellfire on our hands or perhaps my teammates have killed everyone it seems so I hear a vehicle a little Sherman I mean because of these anti-vehicle mines that I've got these new mines I could potentially put a bit of damage out I heard that guy just a split second too late didn't realize they were there let's see if this cipher guys on the ball he is thank you so much cipher pretty sure that where is the dude that killed me there's one see they actually stick to it whoa that blew me so far back that tank shot do you think the fact that I was in a little alleyway kind of compacted all the air and just forced me out I had this weird thing the other day where I was down like this and a tractor exploded next to me and it heated me into the air like a hundred feet and then I just slowly floated back down is very very strange but let's have a look let's go Dee we haven't been there yet have we it's a big windmill this dude is I can't aim down all I can do is suppress jump out clear this building no one am i right could be someone upstairs ya know I could have sworn there was gonna be someone there well there's a tractor chug on the tractor could get on the tractor that's always good fun Thanks having a great time I don't know what all these jeeps are doing here should we make a big explosion for the hell of it yeah let's have a go three two one Bank that was a bit too soon anyway where's that tractor gone is this one of the ones that you can drive maybe no it's just a random blue tractor that totally looks like one you can drive why can't you drive that dice please I know this three on the map already maybe they're all it's born 26 damaged got some snipers up in the windows here can we get close to them a couple smokes down and I say I don't know one running into here all I know was there's a couple of snipers I think there was one in there around here somewhere yeah there's people on the point but where I don't know I'd guess in their back here maybe it's gonna be someone in the corner Pro and they're gonna kill me I just know it what's our tank guy over there oh this is still the cowboy cowboy it's actually really big yeah anyone else got these weird mounds that you can use as cover it's kind of cool what tank is that not sure it's one thing that I never really did much of in this game you know using the vehicles don't suppose I could like a rapid that is I think that's the that's the new one isn't it what's it called we've got the humor 38t or something so I just wanted to put some oak down before a resident artillery I'm so dead anyways I don't feel like I'm being very effective here this SMG and we've lost D although we are no we I thought we were capping it back then we are not cap and get back that's unfortunate its head over there I don't wish you could drive that I'm sure this won't like getting firestorm it looks like that anyway I've got this little bad boy as well the well rod I was thinking of making like a well rod montage just of all the one dig so you can get rid of it it's so satisfying so good alright so this one up to the left maybe hmm this could be a nice Hellfire here I try and clear out the windmill see how many people are in here everyone's dead [Laughter] that's not that's no fun why'd you have to kill everyone guys come on whoa okay I couldn't do a Rollie pollie there too much damage there's no one everyone's dead okay I mean look at this imagine you could drive this and just pull that thing around you could put troops on the back of it have them with bazookas or dynamite just having a great time it is a nice hook him up though this I have to admit all these fields of lavender that they've got that's pretty I don't know if there's any oil you certain Jeep over there I'm there I don't know if there's any Easter eggs on this map so to speak well I've not seen any poor guy let's take this seed point I got one bouncing around like crazy there won't me someone up there oh oh it's nice man it's a nice gun I don't know if there's anyone behind us here being a bit wary I saw someone then jump down Oh damnit I should have been there shouldn't I I was on for a nice blank then but I blew it absolutely blew it guys I think I was being a bit impatient maybe let's have a look so we've got a seize quite a cool point to fight over though I like I like that point I might go back there yeah yeah don't worry everything's gonna be Kay I hear people I'm sure I heard enemy footsteps and as me not aiming again I'm thinking the hip fires may be not as good at that range come on dude let's go get the rest Mauro come on come on come on trying to tempt him in with that little yellow pink beautiful guy's face was all messed up though what the hell was that about thank you what are you doing there no one else there I'm never gonna be an su-15 there in that kind of distance can I tap more I win again can I tempt them come on come on smoke down Sebo get that smoke down yeah there we go there we go well played again out there now chickie reload let's put some smokes down push up here get the bridge no one underneath this is where they were before yikes yikes Seb oh hold on I'll come don't worry screaming out with sunny tato come on come but we can do it dice we can do it I believe in you walk into slow motion you I swear they've increased the eating distance on those like what I was playing as support the other day like the distance that you can throw those things I he's ridiculous dude with shotgun here somewhere is he dead I think in in this building you've got a you've got to stop running into a p- guys and you can prone if you pro you don't take any damage just so you know my pequeños nearby if you put a smoke down Pokeno please okay no Pokeno the dude in there's go well good come on I want revenge I want to get in there let me spawn dice you in combat you're in combat dice please it's just let me spawn all right will they manage to decaf see a bit it's people here somewhere cool yep that's sir that's a Sherman I saw it shooting before I was like it's not friendly not really getting many revised ammo in this spot I might change squad joined this one instead might be better deploy overview let's have a look I want to get that Sea Point back that's what I care about yeah that's not that's a no-go no maybe if I had an SLR or an assault rifle or something not with this hey tanks still there it's gonna be a problem if I could get above it and get those mines down I'm gonna go for it just a numbers game right now someone phone in ng still you die already please die my garden fire that was awesome Captain Rex to your friends got you bud we hold on to C then we push up and get a watch that angle there so many windows that I can get shot from flight safe mm-hmm do you feel like there's someone around even though there's no one on the point it's not like gasps watch out someone here that's fire that's a lot of fire I'm just gonna yogi a couple of grenades down there a little oh hello you have the little flavor everything is on fire I do I don't know man I don't know I'm gonna fit whatever I can't let a man down yeah looks like minecraft oh he was really low just had to kill him at once all right mate push that a nice little squad here didn't they look at this holding us off hmm it's a pack who put this here is that always there what if there's an enemy in their docking shell didn't look like it by random show anyway you never know what is he doing there got the killer sis let's get to be I feel like this squad I mean now is a bit better they're more active get on the back here right that's enough that you need health that was awesome that was a great little fling can here a show show still need to use that need to get a decent game play with that thing I'm gonna push be aggressive make sure that we cap that point why'd you go around here headshot Oh dice that first one should have been a headshot surely you guys should watch that back now on the video and tell me was that a headshot was that not a headshot because I feel like that was a headshot oh the one on the way because Americans here somewhere something like shooting here isn't it oh my god okay above me that was a guy I'll get ya hopefully I don't get showing the back no no no no no sorry had to cancel it impact grenade why are they in the game why our impact Rene's in any game there's so annoying there's no counter to them I feel like a grenade should just be used as what is that as a means to just the big lads oh it's the big lad someone spawned the big lad a grenade should be used as a means to move someone out of a position and if they don't move it kills them you know give them a couple seconds maybe but impact grenades like they just don't they don't have a counter to them so I just put this in the towel there's a tractor I could drive let's watch this beautiful v1 hit its target where's it going Rani by the looks of it boom up anything that bf I've had to offer the VIII ones one of the most awesome things surely they just cool I just wish this thing was a bit faster to be honest kind of regret picking it but if the squad leaders formed it in they obviously wanted someone to use it than their so I just launched a battle over there and see if it gets a hit [Music] I don't think I even have a machine-gun do I all right mate it's a Miss giving away my position as well I'm so dead what a waste what a waste as long as I can get that one kill you know that's all the mass I'm happy with that at least we used it right at least we used it right what are we doing here then we're losing see just heard an American then it was above me I do like the 3d headphones feature of this game - I think it's really good that's another good thing about this game like the audio has always been really good for me really consistent very easy to identify footsteps where people are multi poly let's push whoa that dude just got rekt taking the church I'll try and save the church you go watch your back buddy please can't jump out this window about drill that's pulling back there mate go kill go go go enjoy it up nope I should have got back and cover soon right there but that's gonna be it that will be the end of the round guys that's a really good game in fact I'm
