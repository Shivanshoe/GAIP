welcome to star citizen this game began development in 2011 and it's still ongoing a couple of my mates tommy and adam have been playing it recently and i asked if i could join in as a complete novice what happened in the next few hours surprised me in ways that i could have never imagined the graphics are astonishing the sense of scale incredible and i personally had some gameplay experiences that i've never had before on the flip side this game can be incredibly frustrating to play at times with bugs and unintuitive systems especially for new players like myself but there are flickers of brilliance in here from time to time and after my play session had ended i was sat longing for more and what you're about to see are the opening moments for my experience in star citizen i think there's a ton of potential here if it is ever finished nobody knows but i hope you guys enjoy this if you do leave a like and comment below let's get into it i've got no idea what i'm doing well you get the first thing is getting to the taste of spaceport central line that's where i'm at now lebston station yeah and then does it say it's going to the spaceport i don't see any trains why is there a naked dead man at any time they're inside each other the baseboard line is the blue one yes that's the central line what this is a game have you managed to find your way to the space sport i just got on a train time i have to be honest with you there's some big golden statues oh no you've gone to the you've gone to the center you've gone to the business district if it's going to get back on the train oh god i'm just gonna leave hold on get on the other train yeah you go across and get the other one okay i'm gonna get on the other train i've arrived at the spaceport so these are just npcs walking around oh yeah yeah customs area you are leaving your green zone do i have to be interviewed no okay i've gone through security there's a man running around that's me jack because remag found you that's you will yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna drop you some gear can i look like you yeah i'm gonna make you look like me oh sweet just pick it up as i drop it okay how do i equip it well just i think you can just press hold down there and equip it it's a menu whoa oh i'm gonna give you what you want a sniper rifle or something give me an assault rifle will that's some grenades not grenades we don't need to have someone with anybody yeah grenades grenades dodgy they sometimes just stick to your hand after yeah and then they just blow up there's just no need for that why is this man walking into the wall it whiskers just fully scuff jack that's right he's gonna take you in his weird alien spaceship and bring us me sweet nice environment so it looks great what is this your ship yeah what the hell it's very alien isn't it alien boy gold alien boy massive will i don't know it's not actually it's not massive it's tiny no and you can easily accidentally take control of it so watch out yeah i'm not gonna press anything oh my god is this supposed to look like aliens oh that was awesome will why why did i just fall over and now glue to the floor you can't be standing around on the ship whilst it's flying just sitting just just lie there it's fine because if you get in the other seat it um you can sit on the bed i can't get up well i'll stop and then you can sit on the bed sit lie down no don't lie down because you might log off don't lie down you might slow down i'm sat down now are we there well no we're in quantum what's quantum oh my god if you want to get in the sea it's the quantum bus you want me to get in the seat well probably not actually that's probably about it here isn't it i'm getting in i don't care what you say whoa i'm not going to press anything will oh my god this actually looks incredible what the hell that's so cool all right we're well i'm in control i know you're you're in the seat mate do you want me to leave no i can't wait around probably because i don't there's a lot of asteroids in it i don't feel like getting ready for this well i could shoot as well no i don't know i'm gonna get out this seat well you know that makes sense well did you just fall over and die no i didn't die but i'm just rolling around on the floor there we go very unusual can i get up now will oh cool coming into land look at this i'm gonna go open the ramp damn look at this hangar all the asteroids no it's closing no i want to see next time hey we're going to do a mission then tom you will take it from here remake you can go about your business you look like deadshot tom said as well why don't you give jack a gun is there a gun shop on this place yeah there was yeah yeah well let's go to the gun shop then i don't know where it is though i never end oh my power rangers look at this they interact with this scutters things up yeah press f and then click and then what should i buy then what do i need i presume i should buy some med pens as well yeah maybe do i need anything else that like any type of pen i can max that out there 158 i can't buy this smg it just says insufficient funds impossible oh no oh no you didn't just buy a thousand med pens did you maybe how much does that cost everything why why did you do that why did you buy a thousand dollars i just clicked max and it said a thousand why i thought the thousand at the bottom was how much it would cost not the quantity he just bought a thousand med pens how have you managed that that's insane why don't you just get to ten nah as many as i can buy please i thought the quantity was the cost all right we're gonna go on the drake here we go it's your ship yes don't stand under the ramp that would kill me then yes yeah well what do you think a giant massive metal uh this is a lot more spacious than wills i've heard using the stairs can kill you jack so i think the ramps got a good chance you can do the co-pilot seat jack behind me oh this one here i'm in the seat okay i've turned it on i didn't mean to do that i'll be turned on the screens don't worry about that you can you can turn the screens on i'm just don't drop i'll drive there yeah okay i've got some mission to do uh i'm gonna share it with you guys hang on what's the mission you know it doesn't pay lots but you know it's it's a good start it's safe okay so this work so if i share that left bracket to accept yes boom go to the pickup site yeah we're in so you're manually flying this thumb yeah i'm not there's no autopilot as i know really well i haven't found one pickup site is 840 kilometers away on an asteroid oh i presume that these rocks would damage the ship if we flew into them gotta be careful all right we've got to go down to this pickup site down here it's 180 kilometers and there's no warp point to it so it's going to be a bit of a mistake is this just going to transition from space to to ground yeah no that's sick oh you can see the the ring around the planet as well yeah f4 and then if you hold zed and you can you can orbit around the ship it's a nice looking ship [Music] all right we go can you read the mission again son the constellation is some valuable cargo blew up and the nova riders are paying to have this shipment of aluminium taken to brio's breaker yards so we've just got to find it and deliver it i guess this is so awesome it's just gone from space to planet well several games that do that these days the ones with atmosphere are bad because you get to go through the clouds and you see that the weather system and everything still impressive oh yeah the tech is pretty impressive uh the car goes down there is this a hostile area tom i don't know there might be men here okay [Music] i've absolutely no idea we've landed all right then disembark smg is ready let's go look okay it doesn't look like there's any hostels here mcrn on the ground it looks okay well we're freaking out there's no there's no hostels just relax that's just having a little play either it might be pirates here though it might be but let's just you know is this cargo there is cargo around i can see it you can pick it up and put something in the ship if you want grab yeah that's the objective yeah go put that in the side it's vibrating don't come too close to me what do you mean put it down it's come too close to me it's vibrating if you put it down bong i can [ __ ] i can put it in the ship from here look watch oh it's like a gravity gun or something oh my god mission could play that's it yeah but there's no there's other stuff this is the loop there's a dead bloke here wait the drop off of the aluminium it's 92 490 kilometers away that's nothing we'll be fine with that we've got we've got the quantum drive for that jack so is this whole planet explorable yeah but i wouldn't say there's anything there's gonna be nothing on it well the sensor scale is just incredible i want to test this out is that okay i don't like the rocket law you can fire it somewhere else to start the ship maybe what the fire that ship no i'm in there hang on oh you better get out fire that's extremely dangerous i don't know why you brought that it fires three and we're killing i like it if someone comes to attack us we're ready all right jack you wanna go fly on the ship yeah go on then go and go in the main seat then okay i mean now what are the controls uh oh let me get in the co-pilot's seat and i'll this is cool the most important thing is to keep your mouth central so when you take off otherwise you'll okay mouse is central well yeah nice all right so just space to lift up yeah there you go press end to put the landing gear away it's fine and pitch up a bit obviously there's no atmosphere on this moon so there's not don't worry about it i'll scroll to get to increase acceleration or like the it's a mouse scroll to increase like the thrust the thrust like maximum so if you see okay are you pressing space as well no no stop pressing space look pitch up you just pitched up with that what's the top speed um i have a boost as well yeah so that's so yeah shift is boost but you don't need to use that i won't worry too much about that okay yeah so we're going to lose space but now i press press b you know enables the quantum drive oh yeah spooling quantum drive systems online so aim at the drop off aluminium thing i don't know if it's like yeah i'm i mean it says hundred percent it'll charge on the left it's a constant drive oh my god okay we made it but we've got to deliver it on the planet right if it's locked onto brio's breaking i'd hold b and we'll do like an insertion like quantum there we go this little bit for some reason always upside down why it's relative isn't it to the planets and space now we appear to be moving away from the ah you'll be alright right now you got to come in for a landing jack upside down though i mean well hold q hold q to spin us right then just bring us into the uh area is it below it's now the drop-off point yeah yeah look down oh you're not gonna fall or anything he's perfectly safe oh that's freaky don't know that you need to um hold control to go down you're on okay my first landing here we go it's to the right why are we spinning we're down i don't know why we're spinning something oh my god you got you made it down let's go let me let me whoa whoa how far away are we 300 meters i've been killed what happened i was too close to your seat jack i crushed you oh no tom look whoa that's so dumb it's fine what's going on so what happens to you now tom i've just gone to the green glade station again so i'm pretty far away like 30 million away oh my god i'll have to complete the mission without you then if i get the aluminium and will can give you a lift over here maybe what the scrap yard this is a gatling gun use that everyone to give it a shot oh my god what the hell like that why is that even there can we get one of them before the ship i will drop off the aluminium wait don't worry don't just click drop off yet wait this is extremely i'm not joking okay now you have to take off all of your armor no no you're touching you're too close to each other right now stand back i'm not joking you will die crouch you crouch edge towards it you hold f and it'll say place in the thing and you have to place it you can't manually place it yourself if the place is where it says but if you don't deal with crouching you'll just die i don't want to die that's way too close so i'm scared jack look go come back come back come back look up at the thing yeah hold on hold f hold f now no too close hold f he says done so you've done that before you just die if you stand too close you will die every single time i've tried to do one of those things i have died by standing too close so i'm just trying to avoid another incident that's all i'm gonna try this turret here [Laughter] i'm just pointing at you i didn't even fire it i'll stop i'll stop back on the ship let me test out my gun certainly jack you just shot me how i was here firing you were miles away from me adam adam you were literally on the right hand side of my screen yeah there's a lot of desync in this game actually i wouldn't advise just firing your gun like for no reason i just wanted to see what it was like time well aim it like miles away then he was almost perpendicular to me tom and it hit him alright don't we need to check tom's body and make sure it's still here so he can get his stuff back he needs to make sure the body is on the ship and get my guns back i think it's outside nothing is here tom the body's gone it's underneath the ship what i'll investigate there i've got him just drag that up the uh the ram oh whoa whoa whoa okay okay okay okay drag body okay i've got it okay now drag that very gingerly towards the ramp yeah gently gently jack i mean you've got to move it some small foot that's it that's it that's good this is good this is very medical i don't know my gun went by the way i can see one gun oh it's on my back okay is it right behind me yeah yeah keep going this is good [Laughter] to me to me okay very slowly so just gently do it it's fine it won't let me drag it up the ramp can we use that gun to like levitate it in yeah on my hip there is my um my multi-tool that's the gravity going on that's the gravity that's it you can mouse scroll to movie oh god is it press f2 guys and show us where tell us where you are we're the um you're on the left that's that's me wrong you said double click don't scroll double click cr ul one crusader we're on it's called crusader yeah yeah you're on daymond yeah that's the main that's the main planet and then you've got three moons around it hello i'm back yay oh my god that is so laggy here's my is my body is it what's this is there actually someone out there well yeah yeah yeah really it might just be like a street stream oh he said he's saying don't kill him i don't know who's i mean i just want to test if my machine gun works what did i do you killed a man in cold blood my murderer now he said thank you guys don't do it him hang on what's he got that's a great that's pretty sick to be fair look at that jack what i just wanted to test you know i'm gonna go take this man [ __ ] for a spin see what it's made of nice interior yeah take it off oh sorry what the hell oh god i don't want to be here i don't want to be here either what's the target button again no don't t stop it a couple of missiles maybe listen i'm going down i'm just gonna get those lights on it so you can see it nicely here's a cool ship oh my god tom what the hell that looks so awesome okay so because i murdered that man and he didn't forgive me i've got a bounty on my head which means that other players can come and try and kill me and the only way to get rid of that bounty is to go and take this card which is called a tiger claw to a government station and hack in wipe my slate clean and then i can do missions again okay we made it to the station but there's a player that's just turned up and started attacking us do you want me to attack it yes i can't tell me i can't i can't move that was a missile wasn't it is the missile coming yeah just spam h oh my god it's the expansion oh i think they missed i mean my missiles are going towards him there he keeps flaring that right oh hey coming for a pass oh okay i tagged him a bit then he's well he's going to stealth quantum maybe he's retrieved so we've won we've we've we've fended off okay he just walked out quantum down yeah he's shielded down he's taking damage so he's [ __ ] him one of his engines was damaged we won our first baseball well we won but we didn't well we didn't you know we didn't lose we certainly didn't win oh there's supposed to be turrets here okay so this might be as soon as you need [Applause] we're going to just very gently and gingerly hide the ship here yeah on the underbelly of the beast yeah on the underbelly can you stick it to it i reckon you can i reckon you can come up to this big bulky bit here and this will be fine here this will be fine all right it's still moving a little bit oh there we go oh don't go yeah what are you doing how do you do that rematch you're defending our ship then while go and saw our crime stop okay here we go i went to the cold vast darkness of space yeah this is a spacesuit you're all in space oh my god this is awesome so we've got to go there to that platform god so quiet and weird [Music] we made it now into the base there's a man in here already is that he's there right off you go mate off you go he's hiding he's scared where is he i promise i promise i won't shoot you but let me go let them go let me go let's go yeah hey bong's going to go first but apparently it can take a little while no what what have you done i threw it have you done two at the same time no you can't do it at the same time we have to wait and do them individually doc bong's doing his loading requested records uh aggravated assault and homicide dismiss um yeah just for disma uh mentally conscious basically you're pretending to be the judge for yourself there goes a simple mental incompetence then i think that's absolutely accurate yeah okay hold f look at the little slot on the bottom left and you insert no there's no option to insert there at all low pass key detected again can i stick it in check it's not working put it in the slot i don't get insert it does it's not there let me let me have a go just in case something's going on maybe it's bugged or something or it's like a cool down one person at a time each station is single use then please come on don't say that it can't be this is the only one where you can do it i think no there's there's three uh ground stations we can go to all right try again no it's just not working is it okay so that one isn't working whether it's like a cool down or a bug or something we've all tried we can't get it to work but some enemy ships npcs have just turned up because of our bounty stat and they're gonna try and kill us so we're gonna have to fight our way out of here what the hell see what's going on every jack but he's space wars somebody's star wars isn't it which one's let's go it's the star wars we're just going going okay we're going down to the drake oh careful i'm aiming at you in your direction oh god oh my god don't hit me it's not me it's not me the turrets are firing you well what's going on here can i get in the turret yeah you should get in there get in the turret there's a bloody prospector fighting your body's still there tom yeah i'm going in yeah where are the enemies i'm absolutely beaming him tommy's flying towards us oh my god yes that was awesome what about this one here can i zoom in hold f and scroll i'm sick um this guy's quite big he's really tanky a caterpillar yeah you won't kill that usually he furry there's a cargo holding ship speed to leave oh no get out of there now quantum drive go go go all right well we managed to escape and we're headed to another planet where there's another one of those stations so we can try and wipe the boundary start but apparently there might be some enemies there okay who does that [ __ ] there look is that you out the front wheel oh no no no no no no that's the player don't shoot he might be leaving though he looks like he's leaving he's getting in his ship look he's getting you can see the cockpit opening that's a cool ship he's already been in here though which is a bit worrying but is this is this guy gonna then just shoot it he's gonna shoot you if you're not careful jack really why would he shoot me you're a bounty logan wolf is his name he's gone all right how do we get in this is open tom i'm going in okay well there's no airlock either i bet it's not gonna work because that guy's just done it yeah probably there's a dead body here tom lots of dead bodies he's killed everyone hasn't he's been in here he's killed everyone what the hell look at them tom what happened here everyone's dead i don't like it this gun's there yeah this guy has exactly done exactly what we just said he's just cleared his crime stack oh here it is it's here look he just did it logan wolf no you killed him oh is his name on there still oh i'm gonna try what hold on no no insert it's not working so with the second disappointment i couldn't wipe my bounty stack clean and also the ramp on tommy shaped the dre wasn't working and we couldn't get in so our friend adam turned up and decided to see if he could help us by putting his ship in a position where we could climb up it and jumping through the sides okay this is good down one lane much further closer and down that's right that's fine though that's fine there stay there don't move they're scaling your ship how do we scale it on the wing of the wing yeah oh well it's not really going to work is it um ow that's the wrong shape oh my god what the hell why did you do that um i thought i could flip you in hang on i'll reposition you need to just put the wing closer to it rather than the nose noses [Music] and that's narcissism [Music] you
