hi everyone and welcome to part four of my god of war walkthrough if all goes to plan this will be the final episode of the walkthrough i've really enjoyed it so far i think it's been absolutely stellar the production quality the graphics the story the acting just everything about it's been brilliant so without further ado we're about to head back to the top of the mountain and hopefully with our new tools we can get ourselves over to johtenheim that said if you enjoy this leave a like let's get into it oh we're back at the face is that green thing really stayed there the entire time i can get this chest now would you look at that upgrade complete hardened spot helm steel just what the doctor ordered come on boy let's go so this is the area that had the black smoke before i think now i can have atreus destroy that oh that caused a i suppose that's odin's doing too rockford careful let's jump across what's inside box number one number two it's box number two and there's a zip line that goes all the way down all gods were evil but we're not peter wasn't ray and neither the acer gods that's who's evil and you know what odin's right we are a threat cause we know what they are and we know we can be well not all of them not yet magni did his worst and he's dead they're no better than us and they're gonna be sorry they picked this fight the boy is generalizing why'd you go over there for atreus just admiring the view is it okay this looks quite ominous wouldn't you agree no tim thor blame me me for what you did to magnet my [Music] looks like he did more than that move it world pick up where he left off i'll kill you he's already done no he's confident not worth killing he should pay for what he said about mothers i said no but we're gods we can do whatever we want that's what i said to your mother right before i gave it to her what are you doing this is a much better knife than mothers nah the kids lost it you killed against my wishes you lost control haven't you been teaching me to kill i've been teaching you to survive we are gods boy and that makes us a target from now until the end of days you are marked so i teach you to kill yes but in defense of yourself never has an indulgence nobody cared about him anyways what's the difference there are consequences to killing a god why how do you know how do you know watch your tone boy whatever um the boy's out of control now he knows he's a god i remember this you stop saying whatever please that's these boys i call them i don't like that dude keep your wits about you boy if modi found us balder cannot be far good i have a few words for him too no you do not you will leave him to me so you can kill him because that's what we do to our enemies right because he'd do the same to us i will do only what is necessary and i'll help no he's way too cocky this will be a problem i foresee at some point in the story this this is going to end badly not yet oh good job [Applause] made short work of that didn't it we can't go through that i have to use a switch oh we're back here yeah this room my favorite find a new path [Music] again all right one two three you gotta do it one two three four five i'm gonna switch some axe [Music] oh are you talking to me i thought you didn't like my tongue no he's just annoying now boy has this become suddenly really annoying i don't like that why [Music] why are you like this boy have i not taught you manners cool that's all that was in this room i think the music has gone a bit greek now as well i don't know if you guys noticed that [Music] i guess we can just whip it there we go it's funny isn't it because you see all these places as you go through them for the first time and you can't figure out way through but then you get the new abilities you come back it reminds me of old school game design like zelda ocarina of time i can't learn if you won't teach me you do not heed my lessons i've done everything you want and all i wanted was the truth where did you get your fire why did you hide them you said there are consequences to killing the god you use the blades to kill one who else did you kill before magnum loads of people do you hear me i heard you and these are not subjects for discussion do not push me boy fine i mean kratos has killed a lot of people i know everything i need to know now i have nothing else to alarm congratulations whoa glitched out hopefully there isn't dragon 2.0 up here i don't want that i want dragon 2.0 thank you what are you doing over there boy he was disobeying my orders is that a new thing are you just going to disobey me now boy is that what this is [Music] corner okay this used it's just too easy for atreus now gg easy he's the kid at the end of the counter strike match even though it was a a close game he just drops the gg easy anyway that's that's a treasure must be warned the tunnels i'm seeing in the walls up here show signs of recent dragon activity we already killed that dragon ah did you then oh how'd that go it went fine actually almost died no big deal caved its head in with a giant pair of pliers [Laughter] something like that [Applause] that's locked are you locked are you like this something for later perhaps bye felicia atreus i just kicked him off a cliff you do anything and get back on fortnite boy the scroll it better not be a dragon fight again i just don't i don't want it not about dragon fights this way this will be easy for god uh well thanks for that mate right we have to throw it inside him like that what i'm sorry dice dice the game's broken right that's just not working oh thank you maybe we just have to beat this one up in the conventional sense of the word oh that is horrible okay i need to learn that he's a nice guy so it doesn't really make sense switch the axe that's it i remember now to get those things yeah okay i've forgotten how to fight these guys you throw the axe and then he spits out little yellow things and throw those out in the guy not yet yeah he's hard as nails this one open up that's it charge him up i should do it nearly gonna help open up say good night what did we get frost sigil of focus increases resistance to frost attacks okay there's something big orange there as well ancient i can use that for upgrading right [Music] you better stop boy collectibles is that all that was in there come on boy here we go whatever you have to keep saying whatever how many times do you record that please have a bit of respect legendary chess armor i already bought some new chest armor so i don't i'm not really interested in that at the moment although i will check out that other rune that i got cool down when damage is sick i like the idea of that that looks good no no no oh there we go we can upgrade one of them magic that's gonna bounce the arrows around a bit more you're never busy come on chaos plane where do you get chaos flame from i'm not sure um so chest armor i can upgrade that it's almost like having a thick skin yes indeed i think that just gave me a room there didn't it so i've now got yeah i've got three rune sockets here that's cool you can just stack these runes it's awesome one more here cool down reduction is good [ __ ] it okay i also bought atreus new armor as well so he looks good hi hi what as many combos as you please let's get a bit of space here damn it that god really hurts i want more rage attacks i like this a lot falcom into nothing that's it that's the combo that i wanted to show you that's cool it's very powerful that okay cool i could have used those explosive canisters a bit more there if i thought about it dude just straight up attack me the realm of fog oh him i might do uncharted lost legacy in the future we'll see i think the next game i'll play will either be the last of us part two or spider-man the silence is getting unnerving don't worry about it we're focusing hey we're back here you get a reward from the portal i'll go back down i don't think i've actually uh done one of those yet i thought it was just gonna spawn more enemies what did we get dust of realms used to enhance unique properties of various talismans okay i really like the talisman that i've got equipped though the health i've upgraded it a couple times too let's get up there we can break through this we did it reddit nearly there now finally boy the room oh it's a different one carve along that this is slightly different i think you just have to hit the corners wow yo none we made it beautiful isn't it why i remember once brother looker oh nice really oh this time i thought i needed you ugh [Music] surely that's the only way to get rid of him i'll cut his head off or something i don't know no you broke the gate that was only way to you know stupid [ __ ] [Music] get out of here boy yes by all means junior run away let daddy do all the heavy lifting for you let's go calm down boy you are not ready for this and here i thought my family was [ __ ] up your father is right boy you are far from ready now would you be so kind hold this for me thank you dude's got a dragon no don't you know when to give up i would like to take this dragon thank you [Music] this is cool atreus is just out cold [Music] bye dude how [Music] oh [Music] who's activated the bridge hey i ask you a question and when the bridge opens the full world of ascot will come crashing down on you it's over is it so be it no listen to me let me out let go of it now i will kill him you know i will what did you do boy i'm here stay still that was so epic i'm kind of speechless speak a word i am your father and you boy are not yourself you are too quick to temper you are rash insubordinate and out of control this will not stand you will honor your mother and abandon this path you have chosen it is not too late this discussion is far from over we are here because of you boy never look at that yeah we're back in hellheim aren't we that's where we were earlier yesterday right ruined how do you get out of here we could climb up there there was a chest down here that i saw come back to that later perhaps wow it's cold this is hell not just hell worst place in hell you could have put us i see a ship get us there it only takes us halfway to tears temple but at least it gets us far from here for a thousand mortal lifetimes the bridge keeper kept the living out of this place but now that you've ripped his heart out here we are funny how it all comes around one combo and they're done boy that wasn't me he didn't say that what what was the point of that we've got to get to that [ __ ] oh oh [Music] but he said it would only take us halfway and this is where we saw zeus isn't it but we're gods you can do whatever we turn away boy that's [Music] do not dwell on those thoughts not here [Music] we must keep moving you did do it boy yeah it was you find down there good what was that not just the old and sick come to helheim so do the criminals i almost not draw a distinction between us and those whom these visions are meant to torture how do we stop it escape hell as soon as possible i'm not gonna let it bother me like you said ramire it was just an illusion that wasn't me you have become of late look i know i got us into this now let me focus [Applause] hey big guy i think that kind of interrupted this attack missed that one that's the one that's the horrible attack jungle he looks like the night king doesn't it i don't want to fight two of those at once that would be an absolute nightmare for me palestine yes okay we can use that to upgrade the blades cool we have to go down perhaps to get that wait i think i see baldr up ahead he's right there hey [Music] that's the witch that's freya i can't taste it i can't smell i can't even feel the temperatures this room feasting drinking women praise his mom again death has no power over you now you would rather die yes take it away she cursed him trust me [Music] come on and he tries to kill her so she must know that he's been after us but she's been helping us [Music] [Music] never freya is his mother why did you keep this from his head would you believe it slipped my mind what you would not you mean i'm at a loss ah sure you have no reason to keep such a thing a secret there's the boat we will speak more of this soon well he's going to be stuck in here as well right amanda thank you for becoming a member that's very kindly i appreciate that what's up gaming with roland how you doing come come here [Applause] take care of this playboy that's a good combo as well nope zeus is that thor i don't know i don't like it i don't recognize it let's go this way uh not entirely sure this is seaworthy it looks fine she will do we have to get rid of all this crap give me space to work i'm just supposed to make an entire ship seaworthy on my own right okay you have done enough i like how my my tactic for most things is smash everything oh that's awesome love that great just bear in mind this boat can only take us part of the way tears temple is near the top of a tremendous waterfall which sadly we are downstream huh that means even if we get there intact we'd still need to sail up a waterfall somehow selling up a waterfall okay if there ever was and it can fly near yeah because it was designed to fly what now indeed child i've got to get rid of the iceberg then somehow i don't know what the plan is i'm pulling the sails down but how they gonna catch the wind yeah i knew we're it the heat from the fires we're actually floating very clever kratos very clever and we're stuck not for long stay with a boat not for long boy that's a giant anchor [Music] all burn damage inflicted by 25 stacks that's pretty nice wait for me there where how am i gonna get back on all right these don't like the fisticuffs [Music] i can actually command atreyus there as well i have to use maybe i didn't realize that i could actually use that we need to talk brother you do realize it's over don't you but even if we make it back to midgard you and balder destroyed the only gate to yottenheim we are out of options and that boy up there he's in nine kinds of pain his head's turned so far around petraeus is not your concern well he might become everyone's concern if you don't do something you don't have to be the smartest man in the world to see that he's out of control i guess i'll have to climb up what's this an elevator okay that's cool petraeus i can help together now push we did it we're free we are going to get out of here face me father it is time to end this here's my son is this it is time no it's that voice again do you know who that is i do not know skies of helheim hmm hold on careful of the icebergs oh you didn't get off there we go you have to keep lighting the fires here get off my fire no it's one of those things i will free up [Applause] [Music] oh right now can i release it how do i get it off gotta kill all the enemies first goodbye grapple hook the old viking grapple he does fire stoked how long before we reach the temple yeah as long as we maintain this speed and those fires don't go out we should be there in no time lad boy they're putting out the fire trixie aren't they and i'm not looking they go for it can you please kill that guy first thank you animations are brilliant aren't they really good i'm gonna run over there light that back up i'm sure we're about to crash good job [Music] very similar in their design the way they look huh keep shooting a dress no not another one kidding that's two of them now micromanagement stuff being a dad not that i know i'm not actually at that the sounds they made [Music] wow that that's a giant bird has that just been there the whole time i didn't even realize it was there looking at me that's the one that we saw when we fought that massive ogre that we took the heart out look at it look at that thing that's probably the coolest thing i've ever seen in a video game so good [Music] a lot of resources there he's using it to warm up that's adorable kid you're not so bad after all but if you say whatever again there will be serious repercussions i made it jesus the ship is falling apart come here keeps the doctor away no absolute chaos i love it it's so good can you come over here no he blocks it oh another one two more again [Music] uh [Music] that's useful oh that's quite enough for that one are we gonna get them off do we have to break it it's kind of weird how you just have to kill the last enemies and then you can interact with it i thought i'd be able to run over there whilst there was a bit of a gap in the combat but that's the end of that don't need the bow no big deal it is time my son look around at what you have done there he is dead zeus there's old me even looks like old me what this is god of war 3 i think [Music] come on we gotta go that was first person no way that was so smooth the camera hasn't cut once this entire game it's so impressive only when you go into the menus but that's not really the [Music] camera we made it down goes the ship that was your plan you're both tracked the secret chamber we're leaving this realm now as long as we didn't write our way back where odin just has a place in helheim i mean that must have been expensive right three bed apartments at least four million what is this place this is odin's i'd recognize his atrocious taste anywhere i quite like his taste at that it's the missing panel about here i remember that yeah one must have stolen it but why he always has his reasons might i have a look well this is most unexpected why what does it mean we're having the foggiest isn't that unexpected look clearly that's tear traveling somehow perhaps magically but what's that to do with the giants that they should avoid a shrine to it i'm afraid that is none too clear what are those rooms in the corners not runes symbols from different lands they mean or i how do you this one i know too well oh his eyes they are jewels like yours no doubt signifying the gift of sight the giants granted us give me a closer look [Music] interesting [Music] very interesting what is that secret plans concealed by tears so none could access for him and those few others the giants trusted and right under odin's nose i did promise i'd get you to your name what do you mean head you said we were out of options don't you see brother odin never gave up hope and neither should we he knew there was a clue in here but we are the ones who found it these plans are for a key to some chamber tears kept hidden i don't know where it's leading or what we'll find but it's a path how do we make this key i suggest we ask a dwarf i know a couple a wake and bake thank you for becoming a man on the temple door it's a bunch of rooms together peace hope other things too tia's own design he made this door himself i feel like we're gonna have some puzzles here or some kind of boy assault course i don't know when you saw i didn't see anything you did don't lie not see me with someone an old man what old man can we go yes very well why did he just pretend not to see it all right let's get back to midgard and see about making that key where's that dwarf cruise that dwarf what's ruined i mean isn't this all broken now we've already seen that and nefarious thank you for becoming a member now why did you not tell us baldur is the son of freya he is it's shocking every time i hear it and yet obviously i know it when i think about bolder and freer the mayor yes lad freya he loves that brother boulder is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or magical wait what is happening he is bewitched not to speak of what he knows i am i am oh that's it precisely i wonder how long that's been stored since he had my head up on mercy but back when i figured out boulder's weakness come here yes lad you just said you figured out balder's weakness did you boulder is blessed with invulnerability to all threats physical or matter enough this means there is a way if he troubles us again we will find it can you make it is it a weapon armor or likewise an instrument of war of which i'm a master chapin no then forget it even if i wanted to make such an insignificant google i'm liable to change my tools working on something so delicate and ladylike then shingle it how to weld the item with scaps like keep the layers thin alternate the overlay okay smart guy and where do you propose to find a lump of quality scalp slag last time i saw one i could still get ridgid down south [Music] i had to get my hands dirty [Laughter] well don't just stand there let's do this what you you're fine with working on something that's not a weapon oh hell why not what i can grow too oh what watch the spine keep your wrists loose don't you keep your wrist loose yeah i need more heat here coming up you're gonna temper that steel longer i don't need to i triple quenched it with drago see how inventive and sanitary you clever little beaver never too late to learn a new trick is it no it's not yeah here it is nope don't forget this no quit your grinning it's downright unsettling it's just nice to see you together but now the ruin on your brand looks different yeah impressive reforging something what broke i knew it you two love each other i'll cut it out princess you're gonna get me all week i like the new one better don't you we have work to do no i couldn't shake his hand couldn't do it so we got an upgrade the blades of chaos no you wouldn't your goddamn right brock oh we got gold stuff now oh wait check that out that's nice cannot afford any uh gold stuff sorry is big problem the cyclone of chaos that looks like a good one that resurrection stone's cool because it lets you come back with more rage built hey up helps right whatever else right sell all this stuff 122k oh what is that i actually got gold i didn't even realize i picked that up what you need what you need boy always a pleasure now [ __ ] right along wow dudes you don't have to be so rude just want to see what that gold rune was what was it for i think it was for my armor that's a really good attack there it is look at that increases resistance to frost attacks by fifty percent that's pretty okay switch stances by pausing momentarily after the blazer chaos attack yeah i've got that on my axe i need to use that more [Music] burn damage you can charge up the blades even more [Music] cool grade the boy the shock arrow is brilliant very good [Music] i've just got enough xp to max a trace out here there he is cool beans right onward let's go now we just need to figure out what door this key opens it has to be somewhere around the temple anthony says the stunt switch for the blades of chaos are really overpowered i'll keep that in mind so it's you hold r1 you press r1 you wait and then they set on fire that's yeah that is pretty open can't wait to test that on some enemies though tears roon this is it a jigsaw puzzle piece get it in here we go we're inside but what is this place your guess is as good as my little brother hit it boy yeah he's got a rapid rate of fire now the tree we're underneath the road travel room oh why is the floor on the ceiling hmm those realm doors seem to mirror the ones above it's the wrong way around it's so shiny there's something up there up there fear use the same magic to protect the black rune the clue we seek may be inside huh right next to the united door interesting but can we reach him not from here oh what's behind there i have no idea boy this opened up it's so bright that's a big chain or something well one in our sanctum within another those tapestries looks like a more giant whatever it's here did for them must have been big excuse me whoa who are they a hall of tear i've absolutely no idea but i'm sure they'll come to life at some point this is the room for your night that's right and look we're on the other side of the door the upside down door strange thing okay extraordinary that chain of the whole room is built on some kind of axle there's chains on both sides without those we can flip the temple oh no what now flip the temple this entire building this giant structure we're gonna flip it things are happening i [Music] [Music] hmm ominous go on read before the first after the last nothing between no shadow cast are you quite sure flipping the temple is the only way to reach them whatever it is you said there would be a path the temple can be flipped therefore we've put the temple the logic is on this hill that looks so cool not sure what happens when we recklessly append a room that's rooted to eight other realms i'm curious of course but it's a leap to imagine it gets us to your night i don't mind the lead well who knows perhaps you and tear are the same kind of mad so we have to break the two chains and flip the temple oh good again with the death traps that's it okay room number one done what do we get purple legendary wrist armor i'm not interested in that take that out does that work did that do anything i had a thought brother why don't you let aloud carry me for a while and let you miss this no you're enjoying this aren't you wrong type of arrow there's another one there i think let's get that yikes i think what we have to do here is get one ride up to the top hopefully that won't crush me then just roll down yeah you just gotta run for it there's the first chain cool number one done right okay i'm gonna try this uh stance thing he would let me do that [Music] i've just realized as well there is a fire thing here that i didn't even see that's spitting out fire every now and again [Music] oh watch out died hey that one was close got some health back there's more oh hi these guys are just gonna get crushed surely i can just push them hold on i just want to check because there was a big chest over here loads of stuff maybe i can't open that yet i need a trailer right okay so chain number one is done quite a formidable duo tres help hey it's a fragment of a language boring you should look for more like this leave them in peace obviously not referring to us oh that's still there i could have used that i don't know how far you could carry that oh i don't have time [Music] uh in the back go that's a lot of stun damage straight away whatever i did then oh how oh he made a bit of cover for himself that's it what's this at the big bad again okay come the other chain waits i like that battle music i think that's me [Music] is that the way we came i think we came that way didn't we let me just check on the map what didn't we tell you i just run this one why is that locked an army of statues i don't think they're the kind that come to life if that's what you're worried about dear often said that in the world of pc envisioned the only soldiers in need would be statues this is hard but the bugger did take himself rather seriously didn't he but i did this looks pleasant variety is so important cool we can get that with the chains can't we take that put it in here that's real like changing its orientation i think is that a big enough gap again are you gonna get 10 seconds to do that because i'm terrible with controllers oh my god give it to me i missed there again so you've got to take that one out when it's at the top now we'll stay up there i can't believe we're so close i for one never touch it right another piece of the language cycle good thank you oh there's the other chain and now we're gonna try and flip it i'm gonna fight first hello uh careful the beams of doom resurrection stone nearly dead good the rage just too far away is that it oh god yeah cool right so how do we flip it hello and you got crushed how many more rooms are there i can't see what's happening i literally can't see yes here's the walls yes sir time to flip the temple yes sir okay just agree to stop saying flip the temple it's starting to sound normal don't know how just use that herculean strength i guess i mean i don't simply don't know brothers i know what i promised but in case this doesn't work just remember tyr had good cause to create these obstacles he's kept jotunheim we're playing on normal mode hold it hardly at peace no but it's got hope we're all working together now we have unity that's what the rune on the door to this place was telling us we're on tears path okie doke right if you just let me do my thing guys and don't stop me that'd be great don't come to libraries he knows [Music] it there you go it's that simple the day that brute force is the answer i'll be quite happy to be on you see that mimir nobody can do all this alone all these obstacles they're just chances to prove are the ones who can beat them we may argue me and father you and freya brock and cindy but when we all work together we do make a good team and that's tears test that's why we're gonna make it to you do you hear that brother equilibrium what's that mean it means you speak wisely atreus and that is good to hear okay so he's he's not being as much of a brat anymore put it that way nice i think he was loading boy your knife well looks like a big crystal some sort of travel stone let me see great out dumb lazarus that's the unity stone you know it i wasn't sure it existed if tyr possessed this that explains how he could visit all the realms and other lands to boot held this in the panel alone's library yes yes that's it i understand now it shows tyr walking the realm between realms you know how you must never stray from the path well tear always followed his own path if you catch my meaning the realm between realms we gotta explore it you're saying dear shrine show them stepping off the branch of the world trade and you're thinking to reach the secrets oh dear that is what you're thinking isn't look who's it up and about didn't i tell you he'd be fine create the bow what did we get let me be shorty now we'll shoot something in the face for your do anything else for you i will instruct the boy i'm sure that's a load off your mind oh that was nice for the cooldowns some of this armor looks so cool andrew junior evan jr i used my resurrection stone didn't i let's get another one right lots of luck cheers brock so this place in the past has only ever been a root a to b and it's just you just run along it and then that's it but we're supposed to explore this now are we the realm between realms if you're thinking about howling us all into the void i hope you're quite sure wasn't it your idea find your own path right bollocks this is where two step beyond and the unity stone protected him ready ready well if this is it lads it's been an honor our faith head nice knowing your memory that's a bit of a leap of faith isn't it you don't know where it's going to end up you don't know what's gonna happen gotta trust oh how can i be so nauseous without a stomach come on that was great look the tower i knew there was something down here amazing it's all in your head man there's something that exists in all realms cast it out of any realm to the space between clever old tear is jodenham on the other side can't be that it's not like you go through vanaheim to reach the midgard peak but how do we use it i'd suggest we look inside but stay alert tears little challenges are never as simple as they appear i have noticed well this is sparse there's nothing here it moved out oh no it took the stone tower it's absorbing the stone's energy something's happening is it moving it's moving it knows what to do the stone served its purpose with fulfilling to your spell what happens now no idea brother but after that fall i'm sure we'll pass the worst of it oh they've got some nice lights how many of these are gonna have to kill here then i feel like there's gonna be a lot [Applause] go with me blade that was fun not confident there's no way oh looks like hey get off the edge you can't knock him off the edge it's really annoying oh no not the dark owls again stuff it's a bit of a test isn't it there's going to be lots of different kinds of enemies i think me using my healing room actually there it is i try cool i do not know oh no we're back in hell oh dear here they come great huh i'm gonna get this card dead as soon as possible it's a big left say creston moves going on here ddt ddt good surely that's enough of that i want more give me more all the different rounds this won't be good [Music] hey okay getting serious now oh you have to fight every single round on the way there why that's not a good idea isn't it unless it is a test of a challenge i did not even see that coming yeah i thought i was doing well then oh maybe i should concentrate on this guys jesus that is a horrible attack it just crushes behind me he smashes this guy's nearly dead i don't think there's any more ads so it's really good i think i can do it now just gotta be a bit more tactical about it sweet dreams that's the last one you stop i think it's over hi but where are we make it stop the wrath of artemis check that out [Music] that's cool we made it to the z whatever that means oh we're back amid god we're back in mid garden there's the bridge we did it now back where it belongs now tears travel room can take us to youtube how did you do this odin suspected the giants secretly possessed some remnant of primordial youth in our creative essence the stuff all realms are made of the human the world is to trust an outsider with an even tear tells you just how desperate they were i always thought that that giant snake was going to be a boss in this game because he was in all the promotional artwork screenshots in the trailers it turns out he's just just a friendly dude who just had a fight with thor and now he lives here that's that you fellow sure love to make a racket don't you cool guy just afraid of anything you know what i'm gonna buy those get another resurrection stone it's definitely saved my ass a couple times having that was that all there is wait a second boss stacking burn damage i like the idea of that i can't greatly sort you out not enough resource what the [ __ ] ever why are you so rude why are you the way you are i don't know what we'll find when we get to yotenheim but we must cover our tracks odin's ravens will tell him of the tower's restoration and we mustn't let our efforts be to his benefit very well [Music] all right here we go john heim this is it here we go hold on wait a minute this isn't going to work why not what there's no travel crystal here must have used his own eyes to reflect the energy it was his final fail safety precisely to keep me from traveling i have to get another eye for it thought that would work what did odin do with your other eye you'd have kept it any of a hundred places i'm afraid we've come so far there has to be a way look a bit of a long shot but for years i've seen syndra sometimes brock looking around in that mountain when odin came for his visits maybe they know something rockets injury we have to get him an eye why there's always something else isn't there it's never simple hey guys question for you anyone know where we can find them oh yeah yeah that's yeah i'm sorry as a matter of fact odin asked me to haul this he wanted me to build a home he showed it to me you see and i oh the coin sorry will you excuse me well that was useless you know it was about that same time that odin came around looking for me to build a statue with some sort of hidden compartment now that not being a weapon in the acer being a bunch of park speckled cockers i too saw fit to decline but i know we got it built just the same oh what was the statue i had sent one of thor out there flashing his sack to the lake the statue that the serpent ate sorry about that feeling much better how are we supposed to look inside the snake inside we'd better go see what the world serpent has to say about that can you just give it sure i'm going to land i don't know what lies ahead but now to make sure your gear is ready for the worst anything you need to do i'd do it now just some sage advice siege advice unfortunately i can't afford any gold armor like that hasn't changed that's it either hey nobody's twisting your arm boys we're going in dry can i upgrade these anymore that's fully upgraded upgrade that one i think i'm good on the i'm just gonna max damage on the runes not quite enough for that okay all right let's go another word with the snakey lad see what he has to say or she i don't know i don't know the sex all right you ready for your big performance let's go everyone just relax do he thinks it might still be in his stomach um and he's open to letting you go into his mouth to look inside ew really i'm down for it by the bye he's not wild about it either just wait in there oh my god i mean i would think there won't be any enemies in there really doing this letting the serpent swallow us you do not have to come well i'm not gonna miss this what about the stomach acid and i just i don't know if this is a good idea we're just gonna sail in there i guess i guess we are you sure this is a good idea no hey but it absolutely really should expect stinks sort of response at this point you're gonna need some light here it's fine belly of the beast funny i used to dream about getting eaten i'm not afraid it just reminded me of a way i used to feel when i was a child let's find that statue okay now understandably it's a video game set in norse mythology but snakes in real life are there insides really this simple ah smells not as bad as i thought it'd be is it just muscle fermenting rather pleasant actually you're so weird there the hammer i don't see how there could be enemies in here though but that's okay the hammer is massive what it's quite chill in here actually i quite like it over there why is it hang on why is the serpent just got contraptions inside of it did he swallow this as well i mean i don't want to get back in the boat maybe we have to spin that a bit further oh my god look at this i've just realized it's all its insides we can't climb that i guess he has just one other stuff yeah didn't say where we can reach it i don't know where we could reach it from trying to figure it out because we can get around that way you can't get down there maybe i have to put it somewhere and then oh okay so there's something here yeah i think i had it in the right place i just didn't realize that thing was there the way forward was hidden let's go it's a shift isn't it i've just realized so yeah you're right he was just is he swallowing ships that's what he does any idea where odin hid your eye no it's not like i can still see through it i mean isn't it going to be tiny and we're inside the serpent's belly i mean there's not come on it's like a needle in a haystack isn't it there it is yep that's an eye maybe you should stick that in my head for safekeeping one two only now gently that's cool you don't miss depth until it's gone good job now we can decipher those new blind loops and the travel run is here too you want to go sweet a handy zip line i love that can i ask the serpent to just spit us out now or do we have to sail back no i would need miami wouldn't i to get on that get on the blower give him a call how's it feeling well i wouldn't say i'm feeling whole again but it's a right improvement the bifrost is intact then we have all we need finally we're going to unite there's no stopping us now bladdy have you ever had the town tempting feet jinx it did look like a ferreira russia yeah you're right it's a good point we just stuck a ferrero rocher in that man's head what's going on did he burp well that was mildly terrifying maybe our presence is upsetting jorman gander's belly no something is wrong what's happening nothing good glad that's over surely there would be more movement is he being attacked what is that we must hurry couldn't agree more brother hold tight and watch your balance the board shifting boy boy i'm good i'm getting kind of used to this not that is it what happened to him something we did no something else a dead giant why would the serpent leave us here look it's an eagle oh yeah we can still trust her right until we know for certain keep a distance the world serpent what's happened here we hoped you would know you are far from home i'm looking for my son the two of you you helped me see things more clearly you do not know where he is then no but the woods and fields speak his name i know he walks here in midgard when you see him last long ago before you were even born why are you standing so far from me what's wrong we know who you are nothing's happened there [Music] i had a feeling hurting the big snake would bring the two of you out in the open do you have any idea any idea at all what you have cost me my boy mother i'm here don't run away oh i'm not going anywhere mother i know that you're still angry i know that how you feel hasn't changed but i i want you how i feel how i feel i've spent the last 100 years dreaming of this moment i rehearsed everything i ever wanted to say to you every word to make you understand exactly what you stole from me but now i realize i don't need you to understand anything i don't need you at all back off kratos this has nothing to do this path you walk vengeance you will find no peace i know you i'll deal with you later but family first this again here we go that's annoying [Music] he has a big health bar [Music] why me do you do both at the same time he's too quick you might want to turn away boy this won't be pretty i won't let you hurt him no boy fine stop no betray us you're bleeding breathe boy breathe not my blood what is that that's his weakness it can fail i can feel this i can feel everything he's vulnerable now [Music] she resurrected the giant what's going on is freya trying to kill us no do you hear the wind we are moving that arrow bugger punch the mistletoe in the quiver strap yes mistletoe harmed him freya said it was wicked he's more than hard the spell is broken he can be killed i'm certain of it it's all coming back now now he remembers mistletoe he just wanted a kiss [Music] she controlling that thing stay out of it i can reason with him no woman you cannot he needs to kill you you can't stop me no one can where is he i don't care if he kills me i will protect him i will not let him die i'm touching this will all be over soon where is he oh my god going to feel so rewarding now ah i feel i feel crazy stop burning my boy he's still a god [Music] this is frustrating i'm coming for you okay we've got a switch [Music] that is horrible and he can flashback as well [Music] dammit [Music] i'm trying to parry that one up get a lot of damage off him if you do it oh just have to evade that one ruined can i use the red stuff there i wonder boy address i'm oh my god never felt so alive why would you yes [Music] incredible [Music] did not want that to happen [Applause] here we go oh god [Music] get me every song with that just die already please he just unplugged the stake from his head what [Music] the giant is so slow stay away from my son you don't have to do this [Music] hey stop them good shot [Applause] ladies there has been enough pain [Music] smash swing him off just eat him off get him beautiful crack the neck again yo the kid has got skills [Music] before you die i want to thank you both of you you've done what even the all father himself could not i've never felt more alive ironic isn't it [Music] as well all right [Music] [Music] keeps changing no need to help [Music] just let the boys find out [Music] yes [Music] dodge rage so we can finish him off [Music] die why won't you just die and adam cross this happened well done boy just cut his head off dude stop please [Music] he's being father not a threat you will not come for us again you will not touch her i don't need your protection [Music] god damn that was really satisfying the actual goosebumps so good no matter what what i do or say you won't i was just trying to protect you i was i've made mistakes i know but you're free now you have what you want try to find forgiveness we can build something new no we can't because i will never forgive you still need to pay for the lifetime that you stole from me i have paid i have paid but if that alone will make you whole we've seen me dead we'll make things right no i like her don't do it i won't stop you [Music] he's done for [Music] him [Music] what i love you [Music] than this [Music] is no no no no no my boy my dear sweet boy [Music] freya he chose this i will bring down every agony every violation imaginable upon you i will parade your cold body from every corner of every realm and feed your soul to the vilest filth in hell that is my promise he saved your life he robbed me of everything everything you were just an animal passing on your cruelty and rage you will never change and you do not know me i know enough does he [Music] boy listen close i'm from a land called sparta i made a deal with the god that cost me my soul i killed many who were deserving and many who were not i killed my father that was your father in health is this what it is to be a god is this how it always ends sun's killing their mothers their fathers no we will be the gods we choose to be not those who have been who i was is not who you be we must be better well guess we are the bad guys now in her eyes yes but she could never make that choice we should finish this journey while i still have strength whoa i don't understand i know saving her was the right thing she seemed all evil at the end not evil you killed her son lad her son the death of a child is not something a parent gets over easily but he was gonna kill her she would have died to see him live only a parrot can understand so you'd let me kill you if it meant you would live yes look there was no easy choice for anybody brother but i think we can all agree you did the right thing the world's a better place with fear in it just give her time lads she'll come around back to tears temple then one last time hi yottenheim awaits yo that was so intense man that was brilliant must have convinced him that following you to your mind he started crying lies i'm sure why did mistletoe break the spell daniel magic is powerful but its rules are slippery and elusive i'm sure it makes sense if you're a witch but it's also bloody tragic balder was the greatest gift odin granted freya the one thing she treasured from their marriage he only hoped to spare him pain and spare herself loss but such impulses can lead good parents to make terribly stupid decisions the cycle ends here that's so cool i can't believe odin and freya were ever married love and hate are more closely intertwined than you might imagine for instance odin hates the giants and they him but khor's own mother was the giantess bjorgen one of odin's great loves so thor's have gotten half giant where once pjurgoon was gone lonely ages passed and as war with the vanir raged i could see what he really wanted and after no small amount of convincing freya agreed but while there he really turned on the charm he seemed happy he seemed interested in making her happy but i can just tell you this story later right finally we can go to johtenheim the dwarfs here what's up boys i need that alchemist for something i'm stewing up for you if in your smarts you'll find it i won't forget here we go i can't believe we're gonna see the giants well if things worked according to the plan go ahead and lock in your time and we'll be on our way probably probably get it also plug the controller in boy the head get ready oh right yeah we need his head got him let's hope this doesn't cause you to explode or anything oh i haven't considered that maybe we should talk about this a bit more nah i'm sure you'll be fine ready that's unpleasant now boy use the beam we must be close well what are we waiting for think it's far we will see a word please before we continue listen the last thing you two need up there's a decomposing heat ruin in the moment but i'll wait for you here this is between you and the boy true but if someone wants to fight my lady sips soft perfect slushers you done did it sorry we had to see this oh no no no no no no fine damn it fine watch the head till we return i can do this no no i can't oh okay ready come home i'm gonna do nearly there boy look we're on the giants fingers i can see the highest peak ahead right over there we did it we did [Music] what are you doing [Music] i have nothing more to hide [Music] can we go now we're so close boy [Music] carrier [Music] i like this place hmm boy it's nothing i just thought i'd hear voices by now the voices have stopped just cool the lion king is ready anybody here what is this place they must have all come through here when they left midgard what was left of them odin and thor ruining everything for everybody as they always do i should feel them but i don't this place is dead what happened though my mom sent us here one question is answered and two more tickets wait father something's happening [Music] it's your axe it's mueller look she's arguing with a bunch of giants she new giants that's us the first time we met the world serpent but how [Music] and our fight was balder but that just happened wait they knew everything that was going to happen [Music] the dragon in the mountain the stone mason all these drawings [Music] this is our story no this is your story but what does it all mean that i was not the only parent with secrets you didn't know she was a giant i'm a child why didn't you tell us she sent us here knowing we would find this but why not just tell us the truth mother would have had good reasons [Music] walder was never sent to find me he was tracking her all along not knowing she was only ashes if she had a plan for us i trusted whatever it is besides she hasn't been wrong yet come on we're so close to the end now yes yes we are [Music] oh that doesn't look good look it's mother's she was here she saw every step we took before we took it like she was always with us watching over us leading us home let's finish it [Music] yeah we made it no we do it together suddenly [Music] [Applause] [Music] minutes [Music] [Music] oh [Music] the giants they really are all gone there's nothing for us here come so i get that mother was a giant which makes me part giant emperor god and for immortal right i guess there's just one thing i don't understand my name on the wall the giants called me loki what loki what's the name your mother wanted for you when you were born she must have called you that to her people but why a question for another day let us go [Music] home [Music] i guess it all makes sense now why should you want to end up here with your kind but did she know it was gonna be like this here is this what she wanted us to see did she want us to tell the people or keep it a secret i do not know so what should we do i trust you to decide that ah this whole time it was loki he actually called him son as well oh that's that's so it's ruining me i know it can't be for a god no he was a soldier a spartan a great warrior all spartans are great warriors we trained from birth our lives were disciplined duty battle and death life was grim and we greeted it grimly but atreus of sparta was unlike the rest of us he wore a smile even in the worst times he was happy he inspired us to hope that though we were machines of war yet there was humanity in us goodness when the day came for him to lay down his life in battle his sacrifice saved countless others and turned the tide in our favor i carried him home on his shield and buried him with all the honors of spartan custom his memory was a comfort in dark times wow you actually told a good story oh you missed it [Music] [Music] so all you guys are saying go home so that's what i'll do i understand if you want to go home i bet there are still some corrupt developers out there that could be set free some other help people maybe helping people was part of why mom sent us out here too i mean what would atreyu sparta do and what would loki do huh that's a weird name i'm glad we went with yours lads am i glad to see you i believe i've reached my limit for dwarven charm what happened my mirror they took an uncomfortable number of measurements and then proceeded to bicker about the weather where do you want us to take you how about the warm confines of anywhere bloody else so that's the the main story done obviously you can do some exploring unlock chests do the valkyries if you want they've all been revealed on the map as well so you can start a new game with your equipment that you currently have as well okay i don't know if you guys are being serious or not but seeing as so many of you are saying go home i'm gonna do it and just see what happens it's um is it a midgard it's in the wild woods isn't it midgard yeah it's over here wildwoods and then i think we can fast travel back home before we return to midgard i should warn you more time has passed than you went to realize the snowfall began when you slew boulder snow lots more snow and then the end of the bloody world in that approximate order another prophecy no brother prophecy doesn't expect this from a hundred more winters at least you've changed prophecy didn't count on you i'm telling you it's thimble went i can feel it in my stroke this is the big one stop [Music] how dare you make me where is the um can i not fast travel back there guys just discussing the weather bit of a cold snap lately what he means is thimble winter's upon us boys the winner to end all winners i can feel it in my screw yeah we we heard so if you're heading home try to keep moving and also to not die or if you're not heading home same advice it was loading you guys are also saying save so i'm gonna make a new save i don't know why i haven't been spoiled so please don't spoil anything whatever happens i didn't see the blue gate behind me it hadn't loaded in it's there now you scare up that alchemist what needed finding you can do it playstation you can load let's go oh man the tower ate the unity stuff didn't i wanted to fly again yes that's a terrible pity no more flying okay nearly as clever as he thinks he is and he's a collector of prophecies if it's about the future he adds it to his collection helps him style himself as all seeing and all knowing but of course the idea is control control of the future control of his feet he'd control every realm of every land in every world if he could every potential pocket of resistance he seeks to eliminate even if you've never posed a threat before he may think one day you might so you see it's not important how he knew before you did it's important that he was right he's always got some great tales to tell doesn't he mimir all right then we're nearly back home finally home feels like a lifetime ago but drafty maybe it's a right improvement over having tree bark in your tanger but this was the whole point of the game leave home get to the top of the mine spread the ashes come back home so it makes sense to come back home whatever happens time to rest i'm gonna sleep through winter okay this'll do sleep way ahead of you the ball it's outdoor oh my god [Music] that is sick guys actually say there we go god of war five god of war two reboot it's gonna be sick isn't it playstation five think how good the graphics are on this game how good this game is and then imagine that massive leap in technology ssd gpu power cpu power how good is it going to be like in terms of the gameplay the graphics the environments oh just thinking about it man that game was sick that i really really enjoyed this it's good fun damn chris hemsworth showing up at the end of nowhere [Music] good cliffhanger really good cliffhanger anyways i'll give that a 9 out of 10. i enjoyed it as much as i did uncharted kind of different style of game but i had a lot of exploring to do i might go back and do the valkyries at some point but that'll be my own time loved it really really enjoyed it if you guys liked watching this walkthrough hit that like button right now it's a great way to support me thank you and we're gonna be doing more in the future spider-man might be next the last of us part two maybe
