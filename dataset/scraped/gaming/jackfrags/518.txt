in a wild turn of events i decided to play some pubg again and let me tell you it's certainly hard to come back to this game after playing so much warzone pubg is undeniably a very skillful game with some serious recoil control on the weapons and just the overall gunplay in general and having not played it in a while it was definitely a case of throwing myself straight back into the fire so why did i give it a shot again well mostly just out of interest and because they've had a new season and a new map that's doing some interesting things so now live in the game is paramount and what's cool about this is that it's a dynamic map that caught my attention and it also has this massive volcano in the background that dominates the island what's more exciting about this map though is how that dynamic element works between matches key locations terrain and lava flows can change position meaning the map will potentially be different between each game this is helped by the overall aesthetic of the map with certain areas of the terrain dominated by red hot lava from the active volcano and be careful it does do a load of damage if you step in it trust me i tried all this means really is that certain landmark areas are going to be in completely different parts of the map and so while players may have a favorite spot that they drop at and they have a route that they tend to take every match this will require them to make them think on their feet a little bit more and this is definitely something different for pubg having one map that can evolve but in general i did enjoy the feel and look of the map the volcano in the distance really does look epic sadly i do have some issues with the map mainly due to its player count paramo is a three by three kilometer map so it's particularly small which in itself isn't so much of an issue sometimes you want fast-paced action and so i'm all for that sadly though the player count here has been limited to 64 players and you could say well that's because the map is smaller so it aids the pacing of the game but that certainly wasn't the feeling or the experience that i had here if you remember carrick in the older map that's also 64 players and i haven't played that map for quite a while now and that one's even smaller at two by two so i was playing solo squads because i don't have any mates that play pubg anymore which means that i was playing on my own against squads of up to four players there weren't any solos available when i recorded this and sometimes when i was playing pubg regularly back in the day and i didn't have any friends online i jump into solos quite often but then other games came along and piqued my interest more the problem for me with the new map though was that way too often after looting i would look up at the players left and see that there were like 20 players alive before i'd even seen anyone or got into a firefight sure the map is small but there was still occasions where i was stuck in that classic pub g loop of not seeing an enemy for 15 minutes to then find myself get shot and instantly killed and then game over i appreciate that pubg is a different type of vr from others that have released recently it's way more punishing and challenging apex warzone well they're fast-paced arcade br games but even when pubg adds in a really small map it somehow still doesn't get the pacing correct for me of course that's just my opinion and it's coming from someone who isn't playing pubg every day anymore like i once was so i appreciate that the die hard player base may not have any issues with the pacing at all but for me it is still a massive reason why i don't play this game regularly despite really enjoying the gunplay and finding it incredibly rewarding it's also worth pointing out that paramo is labeled as a seasonal map and this means that it's in a solo pool that's separate from the other maps it looks like it will only be available for this season and then perhaps it will be swapped out it's quite possible that bots have also been disabled and to my joy there are no red zones possibly one of my most disliked features of pubg you may have noticed if you're watching that because of the lore of this map you also arrive via a helicopter rather than a plane and this also counts for care packages too there are also exclusive items on this map including full body camo suits ghillie suits and a backpack if you hit the chopper with enough gunfire as it's flying over you you can get it to drop that package sooner and of course on such a small map this will absolutely give your position away and maybe attract some attention there are secret rooms to be unlocked too and you know i do love a secret room in this case they aren't all that hidden though these are temples if you want to call them that spread out across the map in various sizes with ominous locked doors stopping you from gaining access and when looting you may randomly find a door key and i'm sure that you can see where this is going take said key to one of the door locations and boom open sesame inside you can expect to find a lot of good loot including a mostly nagant or perhaps an n24 there's also a critical response kit that you can pick up too and this item allows you to revive a teammate in only a second and that is a very strong item in squads considering how long it usually takes pubg isn't short of maps these days but currently there are two player lists you can either play the new map paramo in its own queue or you can queue for a random map which will be from one of the core playlists the candy miramar eringel sanok and carrican for me though this is a double-edged sword because ideally you'd like to choose the map that you want to play much like you could in the early days when there were only two maps but now they've got five plus maps in the game i just don't think that's feasible on pc as the player count across all of these maps would inevitably increase few times of course with any new season there's a new season past two this time called highlands the pass will run for a shorter time for normal only lasting two months but it will also only have 50 levels this season also sees the introduction of solos to the ranked mode if you want to work your way up the leaderboards on your own then that option is now available there have also been updates and changes to the overall ranked rule set as well as lots of bug fixes quality of life improvements and a few weapon changes to the barrel and the slr apparently the barrel had just clearly been the best gun in the game for a while so i'd imagine that those weapon changes are welcomed overall i enjoyed the aesthetic of the new map but pubg at its core gameplay level hasn't changed all that much over the past year not that it needs to of course for the people that enjoy it but i do feel as though i've moved on and there's other br games that i enjoy playing more now for me pubg hasn't maintained the pace that it had when it started and it hasn't kept with the times of this evolving genre of games i don't particularly enjoy the mass looting anymore gathering up as many attachments for my gun as i can and the worst thing for me is playing pubg with friends in a squad and dying only to sit there for 20 minutes as my squad carries on in that round it seems so old-fashioned compared to other 2020 br games and i think that it's lost a lot of the fun element along the way having said that as i mentioned before this is a slower more tactical game and i think that's what the playerbase enjoys about it and on pc they still do have peak concurrence of around 300 000 a day according to steam the free-to-play mobile version of pubg is incredibly popular too i do wonder what a separate limited time mode would look like where perhaps if a teammate is dead then squad members could somehow revive them so they parachute back in not to replace the core mode but just to see how it plays maybe me and my friends would play some more that way ultimately i do still love the skill based gameplay of pubg i just hate all of the waiting around to get to it and cheating is also still a fairly big issue on pc whilst i don't actively play and i didn't come across any cheaters in this little play session here i do follow some pubg players and streamers on twitter and they're often complaining about blatant cheaters and it just seems that the problem has never been fixed and that's a major concern so in conclusion i don't see myself jumping back into pub g regularly again i like the pacing of war zone i think that nowadays it offers more enjoyment to me currently but i do appreciate the new content nonetheless it's cool that they're still adding new maps and i hope that they can continue to develop this game and who knows maybe one day we'll get back into playing it regularly for now though i'm happy to just dip back in every now and again with that said thank you for watching guys let me know your thoughts down in the comments below are you still playing pub g or do you know anyone that is what are your major concerns or the reasons that you do or don't play anymore if you enjoyed this video leave a like if you didn't a dislike subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next one
