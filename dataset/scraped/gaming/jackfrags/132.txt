what if i told you that the game you're watching now on the screen was created by a single developer in their free time would you believe me or not well it's true this is a game called bright memory infinite and it was made by one man it's a fast-paced first person shooter with melee elements a bit of wall running too and at times it reminds me of the old fear games and titanfall the story is pretty straightforward and it only lasts up to about two hours in total at the moment it's set in the year 2036 a strange phenomenon occurs in the skies around the world so the supernatural science research organization sends an agent shellier to investigate the graphics are stunning and it's built on unreal engine 4 and the first iteration of it was previewed in 2017 receiving financial support from epic games unreal dev grants nvidia also teamed up with the game eventually adding ray tracing dlss and reflex support making it a great showcase for those technologies and today we're going to play through the game on max settings with everything turned on the ray tracing in particular adds a ton of ambience to the game with ray traced reflections shadows call and global illumination we've got dlss mode set to quality as well dlss uses ai to boost your game's performance in some cases up to 45 percent at 4k resolution reflex improves the responsiveness of the game and reduces latency up to 22 percent the system i'm playing on today is a brand new build i'm using built by pc specialist as i promised i will have a full setup video coming soon and this features an i-912 900k 12th gen processor an rtx 3090 graphics card and 32 gig of ddr5 memory i put it together using their system configurator on the website which is linked in the description below i've also teamed up with them for a promo code if you enter jfrags during the checkout you'll get 30 pound off your order with that said a big thanks to nvidia and pc specialist for sponsoring this one if you enjoy the stream or video leave a like we're gonna play through the game now from start to finish let's do this right we are good to go thank you for coming along guys looking forward to this let's get stuck in next us all throughout the country people are celebrating the new year with fireworks displays as a huge red explosion at the beginning of the festivities a total of 100 000 spectators have made their way through the light rain to the venue where they're awaiting a dazzling show [Music] hello director chen what's the matter shelia sorry to disturb you while you're off it's an urgent mission from hq each team member has been assigned a survey mission begin your investigation as soon as you receive your assigned location okay what's the current situation just as the news says our satellites observe some abnormal weather it's possible that it could escalate into an unimaginable catastrophe understood i'll contact the closest airfield and head out immediately shelia we've confirmed the deployment of several military units to the scene be extremely careful understood i'll contact you again later [Music] breaking news an abnormal weather event has been observed in the sky approximately 20 kilometers outside of the city due to these conditions the fireworks show has been cancelled people are friends shelia according to info from the front lines general lynn's unit has arrived at the scene general the top dog at fai they say that tech wise even we here at sro can't hold a candle to his guys so if they showed up that means there must be more than the situation that it seems i've locked in the flight coordinates we'll be arriving at the designated airspace in 10 seconds follow your instructions activate the warp drive metal gear solid this isn't it one activate [Music] we've arrived in the target airspace the sky is full of thick clouds and we've got strong winds and lightning everything is fine for the moment no issues down we go the windshield i'm going to eject director chen i managed to escape the aircraft i can see a massive black hole up ahead black hole understood i'll inform the other team members for now find a safe place to descend roger it's a studio but it was just one man obviously i don't think he did like all the voice acting and the soundtrack but the game itself it's one guy i hear you're going to see some nice graphics [Music] general lynn's vanguard has been spotted near the drop site i'm sending wake you're away from backup go ronding as for that black hole we don't have enough info we're counting on your intel according to satellite intel general lynn's unit has already landed watch out where are we dropping boys [Music] kill shelia this is wake i'm headed to your coordinates now what's the situation i'm doing all right okay i'll contact you again later i just got an achievement there i don't know what for it was for something oh my god i'm going to get rock fold that'd be a good start to the stream the anomalies with the black hole it's got a very similar kind of style right oh my god time to repel shots oh nasty that rebound though hello was this really made by one person you said yeah it was it's crazy just the one do they know who i am all right we're gonna start using some of these skills soon just checking there's nothing that i can pick up how nice does this look though it's ridiculous i deflect that back to them can definitely deflect this one shoot me there we go [Music] out here playing star wars okay so i think we've got powers now we've got a slash we've got a push we've got a pull and we've got that uppercut which kind of juggles people so you can start to combo things right that's what the gameplay is all about barry thank you for the 18 months here's a big [Music] oh there we go so you get a little opportunity after that parry to just counter them and that wears down their armor that's the bar at the top is that an execution i mean that's full matrix it's a bit shadow warrior yeah definitely got those lives [Music] nice bit of slow motion as well every now and again field is unstable i can't get a lock on your signal wake should be arriving in the vicinity you're gonna have to rely on him understood we're currently heading toward the black hole so it may take some time since there's the possibility of an encounter special ammo weapon ammo can be found in all sorts of places sometimes you can also find special ammo press b to toggle firing mode and select special report immediately if anything happens some ammo here as well how many of you guys watching have played this so i mentioned that i was gonna try it in my discord and a lot of people said oh yeah i've actually played this and it's really good as i said at the start it's quite short but the gameplay is super interesting so that's like a seeking bullet or something i mean what's going on there i feel like i should keep those because i saw a load of bosses in the trailers i can pull him like that come over oh what all right back at you mate that's sick i actually love that i'm so cool you can combo it as well [Music] i love how those snipers are around at the back that's a grenade [Music] oh man oh he got last hit on me there that was horrible so it's pretty chill at the moment but this is just the starting area of the game i think i'm going to learn more skills and stuff as i go i've got to get up there [Music] let's smash these destroy certain boxes to acquire relics you can use reliquaries is that how you say that reliquaries relicarries who knows to upgrade your exo arm light blade and weapon skills well that's that blue stuff then that flies towards me uh friar thank you for becoming a member and here's the wall run [Music] can't chop that up [Music] i don't think i've got any other guns at the moment anyway geeky sniper over there go get up in negro oh my god oh you can pull them from so far away what the hell uh jump over here just check these boxes here no blue things there yeah so the ray tracing is it's real-time reflections as i said at the start but it's also ambient light and cause sticks you see how if you look at my left hand and arm the shiny metallic material that's actually taking on the light from that fire there cool changing the color of the light as well i think there is a mobile version of it too why is there a jet plane in the sky director chen an airliner engulfed in flames just passed overhead according to the satellite data that area is experiencing strong electromagnetic interference be careful the village is flooded there's a black hole high voltage lines still in the water how do i get to the opposite shore well your power unit contains a particle wiring system give me a minute while i remotely unlock it [Music] grapple [Applause] [Music] is that a bit unnecessary i feel like maybe shelia there are several enemy ships oh my god boom yeah that one's gone [Music] you dead come here goodbye cool you've always got to choose bye sniper [Music] oh my god this is sick [Music] once you've landed you should be able to see general lynn's vanguard it looks a bit like crisis yeah some similarities definitely like that weapon definitely looks like crisis doesn't it oh hello shotgun oh i've got a cheeky auto shotgun here by the looks of it director chen they're just too many hostiles no problem wait we'll back you up huh quake signal flare yeah they'll be focusing on the signal flare now is your chance roger i'll take care of this now [Music] [Applause] i've been transported back in time [Applause] what's going on here relics yeah i've got the relics i just got enough oh yeah there we go i've got enough for an upgrade i don't really understand what happened there [Music] is the black hole causing time travel [Music] [Music] i love it because when you lift them like that they get stuck they're like ancient chinese warriors as well director chen this is shelia what happened shadow warriors i ended up in this strange space and was attacked are you okay yes what happened to the hospitals they headed off toward the source of the signal flare that's a strange phenomenon i'll let the others know please do do i'm over this as well okay i've got seven whatever that is so let's check out these skills then exo unit arm light blade or weapon so these are my upgrades shock punch while sprinting press and hold f then release it quake punch track to beam should we do tractor beam i've already i've already got that okay and i need three for that i'll tell you what we'll do one of those and we'll do something on the light blade as well aerial slash whirlwind high speed rotating slash wave blade slash i like the look of that aerial slash so that's just going to upgrade that i think and then i've got i presume these are the secondary ammos here cool oh there's one there look it can be found in all sorts of places upgrade your yeah i've literally just done that so can i do another one yeah track the beam let's level that one up a bit what do i think of halo infinite i like it yeah i thought the campaign was really good uh the multiplayer i'm just waiting for new content apparently the new game mode is pretty fun though where you can revive i haven't tried it though yet [Music] um oh i nearly fell off then [Music] he's too far away for that why is everything just falling apart [Music] those sound effects oh look at that there's one over there i have to go and get that um can i do you think i can make this jump here [Music] oh that was a bit sketchy [Applause] oh we did it he's rtx on he's saying yeah it's got ray tracing dlss and reflex i'll grab him from there too far away hello darth maul out here he was a bit tasty the deuce is that grenade [Music] there's more coming this big old bell here check that out let's go just one bullet it doesn't really make sense does it because when you shoot them with this it tastes like four bullets but if you deflect it you're getting one what the grenade that was rude all right you get the special treatment for that [Music] [Applause] i'm trying this shotgun oh that sounds good a bit of bass on that i imagine if you're watching this on a decent speaker system that sounds good what the hell oh my god the secondary fire on that is nuts come on there i can't see them what even is it like a rocket shot or something spot message for bravo man just appeared let me know if you spot a girl with a ponytail roger that's me all clear here i'm the girl with the ponytail [Music] [Music] you're a bit tough [Applause] one of these here that's two i've got now right let's see what can i upgrade emp rocket punch what's the base skill that i need then for that what am i missing please unlock base skill is that isn't it shock punch i need three for that though weapon so that's a sniper rifle that's some kind of a deagle blade slash go on then exo arm shall i upgrade something on here oh no i i just spent about didn't i yeah i've got one there's nothing that is one don't think so no okay gotta get another one then oh there's one there did you know game how did you know i wanted to spend you what i thought it said i had one i'm going crazy [Music] oh yeah look at that my blade has got range on it now that's cool nasty you think this guy just smashed a load of fruit to get the sound effects he just went down the local supermarket bought some tomatoes some watermelons maybe a couple of grapes and just like put a microphone next to them and just smashed them all is that what happened this looks like a boss doesn't it or something like this open area okay maybe not a boss oh hello [Applause] oh you're firing fireballs at me now all right rock it what the hell it's just one shot that rocket shotgun's insane what is i feel like that's the most overpowered thing in the game everything okay no problems here where's the next target there's a road just outside the temple in the back head that way roger that emp light blade i'm gonna just like i feel like that's just op that thing i'll do the um the tracker shells as well for my assault rifle more more for the shotgun okay okay i'm down [Applause] [Music] when did uh shadow warrior two come out that's a couple of years ago but i think this this came out in november last year if i'm correct originally it was just called bright memory and then i think the guy got a load of funding and extended the game added all this cool technology and released it on uh pc and i think it's on xbox as well like the gun play feels really good okay this is definitely a boss who agrees with me does chad agree 100 boss right here look at this yeah i knew it the man zips around on fire [Music] beat man i'll tell you [Music] oh i really like that dodge as well what are you doing up there whoa where'd he go oh you're gonna get the shotgun mate okay maybe i can't block that i missed it it i gotta reload excuse me while i reload this is quite tricky i thought this would be uh easier [Music] yeah can't bury that nearly got him oh no he didn't deflect in here that time it did the first time [Music] the music is good yeah the music's really good i'm [Music] i think the voice acting leaves a lot to be desired mountain from behind the gamepl head there are you guys enjoying this i mean i'm having fun playing it it's uh it's good it actually feels really nice i mean on real engine games typically you know if they're well optimized they do feel quite nice but yeah the gunplay is good quite satisfying as well chopping people up maybe i shouldn't admit to that i've got two points to spend as well i want to get this i'm going to save up i'm going to find another one i get that escape the hurricane run don't look back okay 45 seconds right jump over the cliff i think he's on xbox travia can you see the mountain from up there don't give up now almost there that's a long way away what's the situation how fast bottom left i'm okay heavily there are several enemy ships heading toward the black hole we'll rethink the plan take a rest for now damn in the game kelvin in the game in the game what's up eyes of buzz how you doing yeah the game's called bright memory infinite it is in the title look around for something to protect yourself with i can't use my weapons or my abilities okay black hole black hole that's a bloody meat cleaver look at this pushing oh that looks deadly it's stealth then is it yeah he is real idiot one guy made this several hostiles nearby hide yourself in the rain and take them out remember if you get spotted it's all over did you really not see me then there was another guy wasn't it where was he [Music] oh coming for you [Music] jane wick over here what's going down sneaky bicky kick tomorrow all that and pass your choice a patrolling enemy vehicle is closing in hiding the shadows [Music] over there oh no soap you get the one on the left i'll get the one on the right what that's gonna hurt actually would you even feel that probably not there ain't nobody here you go get some rest so sleepy i'm gonna go take a nap good luck i'm gonna go take a nap look at this cherry blossom they shouldn't have stole jane wig's cap they stole the cat she's out for revenge that's a nice bale of hair you've got there goodbye i mean i'm i am adding the sound effects guys i want you to know that's not the game like her voice doesn't just suddenly change it's me doing that shelia go out through that field ahead of you warning level hello i can hear some footsteps i nearly gave the game away there it was messing around [Music] well there's three [Music] okay that one's turned around that one isn't moving did the guy voice it all no no i don't think so they've obviously got voice actors in oh am i gonna do this they're all facing me okay now [Music] now he's gonna see me so sleepy i'm so sleepy sleepy joe he's still sleepy it's fine i think it's fine i just find their friend james dead on the ground james what happened was it a hurricane i don't know enemy vehicle closing in the shadows so stupid oh this way oh i went he goes guilty of right and i went left don't let them i'm a dummy okay keep moving oh wow look at this dragon [Music] joking how'd you like them apples oh good okay we did it guys we did the stealth section without being noticed that's a unusual thing for me you know i have to be honest usually i just get spotted and then and then we ruined i still don't have my suit what's going on [Music] the cleaver gets more bloody the more kills you get oh yeah it does it actually does that's a nice little attention to detail hello is that three okay right i've got three now where is it this one shock punch while sprinting press and hold f then release it look at that look at the video that looks sick thank you i'll have that chat chetan thank you for the 100. what do i think of battle royale future in general are we losing the fun part of gaming in search for a better pvp experience live from india i don't know i think battle royale is still there it's still got an audience i think it needs some innovation though and i think that every battle royale game has a shelf life i think it gets to a point where it just declines and declines and then plateaus and there's no coming back from that but i suppose that's dependent on which extra content is released after the fact right like how regular what's the cadence of updates is there enough interesting things here evolving the gameplay adding new things to keep people engaged and coming back like that's what it's about hello are you gonna come around here [Music] go away i wish i had like a rock i could throw or something where's that that looks like a real map i think maybe there's a future in pvp ve we'll see those guys are just going to chill down there i think this is yes i knew it i was like there's going to be something hidden here isn't there look at this go this way don't look over here [Music] several hostiles confirmed on the second floor okay oh hello i think battle royales are based on like how many casual players are left as well like that's a big big big big factor because if too many casual players leave then it just becomes ultra competitive and they don't get new players then [Music] oh that was close i get behind you or should i wait hunt showdown's a great game it's just really difficult hello did you not notice me i thought i could make it through the gap without him seeing me br equals hunger games [Music] several hostiles confirmed on the second floor don't get spotted don't get spotted i'm just gonna take out this one here again i'm seriously tired me too man okay turn turn around [Music] [Music] oh my god how did i get away with that how did i get away with that [Music] yeah you just die if you get spotted hello now if this was real life the guy would be like brian sean are you okay have you just gone for a nap sleeping on the job again took too much nyquil i think [Music] ruined look at this sale of cough coffee which one would you pick that's a waffle with raspberries and cream i'll definitely pick that i could go for a coffee but it is 20 past nine in the evening so maybe not a good idea nothing behind there there's gonna be something hidden here the next pulse wave is coming brace yourself i'm trying to block that oh no [Music] oh we're back here again we've time traveled again do i get my stuff okay good but be careful okay now we're talking we're back oh he's got red eyes look at that oh that's creepy don't like that [Music] [Applause] [Music] you can actually deflect them back [Music] slushy [Music] sick i mean it's it's so satisfying it's such a simple concept search for an escape route do i have enough i've got two rocket punch yes i'm just all in for this whatever it is look at it oh my god it does like a line of damage check that out just sign me up please uh can i grapple up here the right way it's not the right way to figure out a way to go up this isn't the way yeah i need to test my new ability don't i um up here it was sprint and then hold f and then release f i think i'm gonna try it next time we get in a fight why does it want me to go over here what i can no hold on you can wall run that that's sick i didn't even know that um okay rosa yeah it was made by one guy i mean i think what the cool thing about this game is that it shows that if you oh hello new gun smart pistol it's titanfall then if you have the skills and the ability and you put time and effort in and you have a good idea even if it's just you you can make it work you can build something you know make something out of nothing like the fact that these tools are available to just one person who doesn't have a studio whatever you know they can just build it i think that's awesome you know light blade a whirlwind i need three for that so what could my pistol do incendiary grenade oh we looked at that didn't we i feel like that's going to be good look it looks like a bloody deagle rocket launcher it's a diego rocket launcher then okay nothing there all right we're gonna test this ability if we get in a fight oh a little boss is it it looks like a roman okay we'll try this here we go oh there's charging up bottom left my god what the hell i mean that's that's ridiculous i like this pistol like an electro pistol isn't it it does look cool isn't it with the wind and the rain the trees blowing [Music] look at this real-time ray trace reflections as well gorgeous i need to use that ability some more let's see 120 fps as well look in the top right solid oh wow is it not out already on the series x facebook maybe i was wrong excuse me was that a flashbang oh my god he's got a shield i know how to deal with this oh god punch oh it just won it killed him his head's gone oh hello squats i don't get any grenades though i don't think you need them to be honest i want to test this out okay [Music] what what the hell was that it kind of is like a deagle but it's a rocket launcher deagle i'm here for it [Applause] you dead did i kill you i think i did [Music] i love this environment as well there we go [Music] get in there what is that gunship [Music] even the like little version of that's really good i don't think i can oh i just have to run i think i just have to run i should be safe for now i kind of wish this locked onto targets do you remember the smart pistol from titanfall first time you got that in your hands it's searching for me now it's fine all the boxes we'll run okay i've got four points hold on i need to spend these giant blade slash so that's e g look at that okay okay so sprint and hold a is that it it just pulses out a slash kind of thing an aoe slash i love the way he's holding this as well i've left the safe spot hold on go through the restaurant find a river cross that river and the road will lead to the target [Music] looks a bit dubious going down here to be honest the sniper rifle does an insane amount of damage [Music] what's the secondary i don't have any secondary ammo yet uh when i get some i'll test it for you guys there's another big one here [Music] okay right let's test this someone over there isn't it [Music] cool alfajor yeah yeah that's what i said dude you may have missed the introduction to the stream hello but i did actually say in the intro that it reminds me of fear i fear was such a great game they did one and two which were i think by the same developers was it monolith and then um after that they did fear three and i think that was by a different death and it just wasn't it wasn't as good they tried to reboot it you know but i kind of wish that they would bring it back fear was awesome it was like a genuinely good action game but it also had a lot of horror elements in it and it's like from my memory anyway it's got one of the best jump scares in any game that i've played like it got me good and it had like cool slow motion as well but yeah this has got big fear vibes special ammo for what for this yes okay i'll test this out huh see what this is [Music] oh oh please i'm hungry oh that's a bit brutal jump into the hole uh i don't think i will i mean that's a bait isn't it come on so would you please jump into this hole here all right anyway i want to try this secondary sniper rifle oh okay is it a grenade [Music] oh my god okay it's a grenade sick [Music] do i like super people yeah super people's fun i love that effect so good you can actually shoot the head there i can't do the uppercut there because it's blocked which makes sense i don't even see that dude back there mainly lad yes uh what do i do looks like they're gone that was really mean [Music] okay this is sick i feel like i'm gonna need to save that i've got 10 sniper ammo for like bosses and stuff wasn't anything else in here was that special ammo for the sniper rifle just what the doctor ordered shelia the satellites can't confirm your coordinates where are you i'm in a read field just past the read this fungi bridge head somewhere from which you can check it out i'll get in there [Music] oh pumbaa humber i don't want to do this remember i'm sorry i'm just working out man he's living his best life there i suppose would would hogs like that actually attack you they would wouldn't they they're territorial right that's a big hog as well oh my god lighting this is going to be hog attack is this what's happening here hoggy oh no pumbaa smells like bacon oh no damn it's pretty [Music] you can't like float them in the air sorry [Music] let's go let's go pumbaa what's the boss is it what the what the giant pig oh my god that's massive it's a warthog boss came out of nowhere boom what is going on [Music] not more i don't want more of them not like this hold on i've got five points to spend blade slash whirlwind stores energy in the light blade in mid air while jumping hold and then release e i don't mind if i do weapon oh ground pound there's another boss here i'll try on him straight away [Music] oh is that a boss i don't know if it's a boss [Music] i don't think that was a boss i think it's just like a dude [Music] wow [Music] feel the dreams oh okay that guy doesn't like kevin costner no scope oh [Music] good this alden ring looks a bit modern do you think from software will ever make an elden ring star game or dark souls or bloodborne futuristic with guns could that work like that there i can't i'd like to though are there pigs on the shields did they have pigs on the shields i don't remember director chen i've checked fung view bridge two enemy aircraft passed overhead sounds like something's going on up ahead be careful [Applause] [Music] i thought i couldn't go in that water i was doing the floor is lava okay sauce isn't it warhammer 40k it's called the surge oh man what happened to that game i think i only played it once like an hour be careful oh that's

have no time i'm having wick bring you an assault vehicle get to the coordinates i've sent to secure it was the northern lights [Music] some things in this game don't make any sense but i think that's because of the black hole but also at the same time i don't care it's just fun shadow ghost [Music] that was good sam yeah well well well who's this if this is angel i'm gonna uninstall okay we're
