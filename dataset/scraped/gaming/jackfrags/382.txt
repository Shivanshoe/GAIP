i bet that there's a clip in this video that you haven't seen or heard of before in call of duty warzone and we're going to start with the counter knife check this out so we're in the dance here and what you're about to see is someone attempt a takedown on me they go for the takedown the animation starts and then i kill them so what exactly happened here well i've seen a few clips of this in the past but no one's ever really looked into this properly and i think there's a lot of misconception about whether this is actually a real feature or a bug is it intended or just the way the game happened to work so let's break this down we're going to watch it here from the other perspective first so this is me attempting a takedown on my friend hans who helped me out with this video as you can see i'll go for the takedown and then all of a sudden i just die and this one is really interesting because it is an effective way of countering a takedown but there is a few caveats to it that actually make it work so to start off i'm going to show you how to do it the first thing you need to do is have a throw knife equipped and you have to press and hold the button that gets it ready to throw now the person comes along behind you they start the takedown and when your character turns around you have to release the throne knife button and what happens is your character will actually throw the knife towards the opponent and kill them and we tested a few scenarios here now watch this one if you have the knife prepped and ready to throw and you don't release the button when the character turns around you won't get the kill the knife just stays in your hand and you will die but again if the takedown turned your character around to face the enemy and you release that button at the right moment it will kill the enemy so we've tried this with lots of different takedowns and you have to be facing the person when you throw the knife otherwise it doesn't work if you're facing away and release the knife it just goes in front of you wherever you're looking sometimes even downwards if there's a takedown where your character ends up looking down you just end up throwing the knife into the ground you won't get the kill so there is a bit of skill to this and a bit of luck yeah in a real game of war zone the likelihood of this actually happening is incredibly small because you've got to have that knife prepped and the animation that the person does on you the one they've got selected has to be one where they turn you around to face them if it isn't this doesn't work also we discovered there are some animations where you get hit with a knife before you're turned around and if you take sharp damage before you're turned around we couldn't get this to work the only animations we could get it to work were the ones where they use a blunt weapon like a baton or something so you see here he hits me with the baton there's no blood here my character turns around i release the button the throw knife goes out and gets the kill just a really bizarre thing i don't think this is intentional i think what's happening is if you've got that knife in your hand even when the camera changes to show you the fancy third person animation it's still on your character and in the first person view which you can't see you're turned around to face the enemy during the animation you release the button at the right time throw the knife and get the kill if it was intentional i think infinity ward raven in modern warfare and war zone they would have talked about this more and said hey there's this cool feature there's a chance that you can counter an execution but i think that this is an unintentional feature or just a bug but i would love to see this happen in a real game of war zone i think what you would have to do is bait your opponent to do a takedown on you get the knife ready and just hope that they've got a blunt animation where they turn you around next up now this one i have never seen before maybe there's a few clips online but we were just messing around testing stuff and we saw this happen because we thought well if you can do that with a knife takedown what else can you do check this out so i'll go to the buy station here get myself an rcxd if the enemy downs you the split second after you get the pad out to open the rcxd you can actually control the rc-xd whilst you're knocked on the ground so you see i'm down on the ground here but i can control the rc xd i can drive it around i can look at my body i can look at the enemy and i can even detonate it so in theory in a real warzone game if your timing is lucky enough and you've got an rc xd someone could down you but if you managed to get the pad out while you were going down you could drive the rcxd over to them explode it release the gas cloud and kill them which i think would be hilarious in a real match and no one would see that coming at all we did try this with a few other things i've seen a clip a few weeks ago where someone got down while they were holding a semtex and they could still throw it while they were down but we tried to replicate that behavior and we couldn't get it to work so i think that one is definitely a bug and just a really rare chance that that can happen i can't find the original video but i did see it i promise it was a real thing but as i said we tried to replicate it couldn't get it to work so it looks like the only thing you can do this with at the moment is the rcxd we tried it with cluster strikes and precision airstrikes too and we did try it with c4 as well i've seen a couple clips where if you've thrown a c4 out already and as you're going down you can actually detonate it but there's a very small window of opportunity for that but that is another thing you can do if you're lucky next one is about the wall penetration of sniper rifles and more specifically the new 20 millimeter zrg so this weapon has just been released it's a massive sniper rifle looks like the crater out of apex or the halo sniper rifle and the bullet velocity on it is insane and the other day when i was playing i managed to hit this clip let's take a look uh yeah i'm going to fly over oh i didn't see him oh downed it through the wall you can pin that i'm pushing it oh nice i just want to fill something you know yeah go get that jack there you go so as you can tell by my reaction i wasn't expecting to actually hit that shot i've done a few tests with wall penetration before with fmj and everything and my understanding was that you can't really shoot through massive brick walls like the ones that are at fire station but obviously that isn't true and at first i talked about this with my friends and we thought that because the cold war sniper rifles like the tundra like the zrg don't have the fmj perk we assume that they've got some built-in penetration already so they can be competitive in that respect to the modern warfare sniper rifles so i thought well does that mean that the zrg can do things that the modern warfare sniper rifles just can't so i did go in and test this again and as you can see it's quite easy to replicate this i mark heads he runs in and i just shoot the wall get the headshot get the kill so you can actually shoot through that part of the fire station i tested it on other parts and it didn't seem to work as well so i think the angle that you're firing at here is quite important but how does that compare to other sniper rifles well let's look at the tundra the tundra is a cold war sniper rifle and as you can see it does actually penetrate that wall so it appears that the zrg doesn't have in this circumstance any advantage over the tundra because some people have thought that maybe it's broken in some way with the head hitbox and the penetration and they're getting more headshots i think more testing needs to be done to give a conclusive answer to that but after testing the hdr here and the ax50 you can actually do the same thing with those even without fmj so these two sniper rifles here don't have fmj hdr straight through the wall gets the kill although it did do less damage there but maybe i just didn't hit hads in the head as you can see then got the kill and then with the ax 50 one bullet straight to the head it's a kill so on a wall like this it doesn't appear that the cold war sniper rifles have any extra penetration but i do think that the theory they have a built-in fmga style element could be true or at least they've been brought up to match the base stats of the modern warfare weapons without fmj and then finally we're taking a look at the behavior of enemy trucks here now we've all seen clips where people drop onto the back of a truck an enemy truck that's moving or stationary surprise people that are in it shoot the driver out shoot the people in the back whatever but my experience of trucks has been that if you get on them you tend to just die and i wanted to actually look into this and figure out what's going on here so we tested a few things first off if you get on the back of an enemy truck or a bertha as it's known by the community and it's driving along you can walk you can sprint you can crouch you can go prone that's all fine it won't kill you but if the truck is moving and you jump it will just instantly kill you this doesn't really make sense in terms of the physics of the game and the way that friendly trucks work because you think okay i'm just jumping on it why would that kill me even though it's an enemy truck but that's the way it is so if you're in a moving truck and it's an enemy vehicle don't jump basically as you can see here i shot the driver even after the driver's dead and it should instantly flick to a neutral vehicle if it's still moving and it's still got momentum you see i jump it kills me it will kill you so if you manage to do this and pull off a cool clip don't ruin it by jumping off straight away just wait until that vehicle has slowed down a bit like here and then you can jump and then you can walk off the vehicle i just think that's kind of funny that that's a thing it doesn't really make sense within the parameters of the game but there must be a reason for it there you go anyway guys i hope you enjoyed this let me know if you had seen any of these before or didn't know about them down in the comments below and if you enjoyed the video leave a like are there any crazy or weird tips and tricks strange behavior that you've observed in warzone a lot of people have been asking me on streams what operator this is that i'm using as well and this is actually called the crimson ronin pack they've just released this in the store and it's a ronin skin with a couple of missions so you can level it up and get the full bushido samurai gear really cool set actually and it comes with a ram 7 and a sword that has this kind of like red flower effect when you kill people it's pretty neat there it is and as always guys if you decide to buy anything in the cod store do consider using my support to create a code which is jack frags in all capital letters and if you do buy anything make sure to tweet me a picture and i'll feature you in a video like this one as all these fine ladies and gents have done i really appreciate your support on this if you buy anything like the season pass operators bundles weapon skins whatever consider using my code and i'll just get a bit of kickback from that it's an easy way to support me with that said once again guys if you liked the video do leave a like if you didn't like it dislike it subscribe for more and i'll see you in the next [Music] one
