with Cod war zone being out for almost three weeks now we're starting to see some really big brained 500 IQ plays on the cod war zone subreddit I saved so many this week that it was actually hard to pick the best ones and trust me there are some absolute bangers in here so let's take a look at more crazy things you can do in this game starting with relays here going up against the truck that who seemingly possessed by demons of the underworld what is going on there I don't know but I don't ever want to come up against that in this clips Cooper Stokes figured out that if you mark a helicopter with a precision air strike it will actually shoot it and take it out optimist Trump here though just happened to be in the right place at the wrong time that's interesting because it proves that the precision air strike planes are actually physical objects in the world and if they hit your helicopter then you're gonna have a bad day a couple of awesome vehicle takedowns here the first one was long shot picking a victim the old Goldberg spear there and this one from the real Boswell this is one of the most brutal finishes I've ever seen in this game so he's chilling out in the truck he knows there's an enemy in there but the gas is moving in I'm not quite sure if he had a plan at this moment but the enemy jumps onto the truck pushes him off the edge gets the down finishes in midair before he can even hit the deck that is just a nasty play right there this next play though from Ryu is just a spicy and I think this is the first time I've ever seen someone take the spotter perk in cod warzone so maybe some of you don't know this but if you take that perk you can see enemy equipment through walls it's highlighted in red and then you can hack it with the pad here and it becomes your equipment so now all of those claymores and all of those proximity mines belonged to Ryu so what do they do of course it's a bit of a bait if you fire a gun in warzone that doesn't have a suppressor on it you'll come up on the mini-map so he's trying to get the enemy team that are camping on the roof all three of them to take that bait and run into their explosives which they think are harmless to them finally there it goes Double Down destroyed the helicopter they had their runs out nice little slide takes out the third guy that is a delicious teamwipe and I'm sure that that squad are just scratching their heads right now wondering how did that just happen one one Hoonah though not as fortunate jiggly panda here with the drone I've already seen so many nice clips of people putting c4 on the drone flying it around and exploding when next to a target but it appears that jiggly pandas drone scared this guy to death and down the ladder they go I swear that that ladder has a higher kill death ratio than I do this one from crispy memes I don't have any words for their support from it's an insane clutch just watch do try an item in the last two next up we've got some really nice throws the first one from Debbie gets the Molly sends it from downtown direct hit on the chopper I didn't even know you could throw them that far that's crazy aw calling in their own air strikes from above in the helicopter spots the squad on the ground throws the c4 down perfect execution that is a lovely triple kill teamwipe next for some ridiculous RPG long shots this one's from Orchestra fanfare let's count the travel time one two three four five six hits the target this one is just as good from the todd father though flying around in the chopper with their friend waxed beaver sees the tack Rover makes the shot that is some really impressive prediction skills right there star Slayer in this clip gave us the most battlefield helicopter takedown I've seen in this game yes is this shot from be Martin better though you decide [Music] bingo and friend-making cop war zone look like it's a single-player game this is sick Nicholls up here proving that they are in fact the best driver in the war zone up the tailfin on the plane over the gap drives to the front onto the connector nice use of the handbrake there spots a target on the roof jumps up and you just know he gets that kill that whole thing was so smooth but if anyone is coming for nickels ox crown it's this guy the new bling move link has spotted an enemy on the UAV in the TV station and they've taken the 4x4 in there unfortunately there's a door no problem noob link really wants this kill and then we're in the main production room all of a sudden have you ever seen anything like this you're in the TV station you think you're safe from vehicles Lublin comes along in the 4x4 and smush you against the wall goodbye we're bringing it back to boots on the ground here and you mop in this particular clip demonstrates how deadly the crossbow can be so this is obviously a custom loadout this guy's built and they've crept up on a guy who's come to collect their teammate in a truck very very patiently though he waits takes out the guy in the back one hit kill and then hits a ridiculous crossbow shot through the window of the truck to kill the last squad member I think I may have to go make myself a crossbow loadout now because that is mud damage this is a great solo end game play from d-mac it's a very small zone they have to run back into the zone with the gas masks and they pick up a precision airstrike just in case it's a bit of a bad position for DMACC right here he spots one enemy behind some hard cover there good opportunity to use that airstrike so they do perfect placement right there unfortunately he's got an enemy on his left but he keeps the deployable cover I just never use that the only thing I thought it was good for was stopping trucks in their tracks but that is just a great use of it right there if you don't have cover make your own make use of that shield because there really came in clutch Mike minder here picked up a hitchhiker apparently some guy just decided to start winding around in the back of his truck well Mike was humming none of it what do you do with a bad hitchhiker you chuck him into the city it's as simple as that warzone players can't swim so if they're in the sea they're dead I've already seen some great comebacks after being redeployed from a respawn of the gulag but simul here arguably this one takes the cake so they parachuted in there just ghosting this 4x4 that entire squad gets out they've only got a pistol but who needs a pistol when you've got a vehicle that is just pure brilliance right there ready-made learnt that may be calling in your teammate and a loadout drop at the same time isn't a good idea this is a great snipe from James Charles though in solos the old seat switch in the helicopter gets high spots the sniper glint in the background perfectly placed shot they're absolutely beautiful headshot with the HDR I'm sure they won't be happy about that I'm just extra displaying that it isn't just the X 50 and the HDR the log useful sniper rifles they send the elevator they've spotted an enemy squad on the roof and this is solo vs. squads as well so this may be difficult in a 1v3 situation but they armor up get that last plate in there and up they go towards the top and this enemy squad are a bit distracted right now so extra beats the door patiently waits gets the first headshot pushes round gets the second obviously at this point their teammate has called and said there's someone on the roof and of course they nail that one two three head shots in a row these next few clips demonstrate why it's important to never let your guard down in cod warzone and always finish the enemy off soul here went afk for some reason in the gulag no good time the enemy runs over locates don't pitch them a few times and decides to give them a cheeky teabag confident but they've got the wind but no salt got back just in time turned around hidden with the takedown release oh here thinks they're all safe and sound to go and pick up a recon contract unfortunately there's an enemy nearby but this guy has got some excellent teammates so the enemy is distracted by them they're in a helicopter and then they come over maybe to go for a finish maybe a bit of gloating boom sorry there's a helicopter on your head amazing fleet e17 here gets in a spot of bother though they jump out the truck and change to a 4x4 but unfortunately as they're getting in they get rammed by that TAC Rover but the enemy squad here don't go for the finish and that allows fleet e to start that self revive they're distracted by something I don't know what later gets up gets out the RPG triple kill the penultimate clip for today is from Alka this is right at the start of the game they go for a helicopter pretty sound strategy you can use it to go for object as quickly or smash people had to tilt it a bit to get that one but this guy is on a mission and I think right now they're scouting for targets trying to find any enemies on rooftops we've got one here literally throws the helicopter at that dude crazy then picks up an RPG as a cheeky look over the edge what's that on the road down there Oh 4x4 May that's an easy shot for me no big deal spoons good night three enemies right at the start of the game and finally for today retro with one of the best solo clutches our end game I've seen so they're up on a roof the zone is already moving in and they spot a guy down there prone beautiful shot jumps down is that akimbo 3 5 7 s who does this who uses a Kimbo 3 5 7 there's a guy on the right drop some nice and quick got to get that reloading the gas is pushing I think he can hear someone on the right - he notices someone they're staining cover prone nice and quiet finish that reload which is then finishes the guy on the right instantly gets shot from the left in the back has to go thrown the pressure is on right now and he makes the shot of course he does what a brilliant play to wrap up the victory and that is all for today folks I hope you enjoyed this one let me know down in the comments below what your favorite clip of this week was and a big thanks to everyone who posted those clips
