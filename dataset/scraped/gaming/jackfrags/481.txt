the mac 10 is the new god gun in cod war zone ridiculous rate of fire impressive shooting from the hip and on top of that great mobility i've been playing with it on the new rebirth map and it rips people if you keep moving and firing it's so good and in these two matches you'll see why it's just non-stop action and a ton of fun playing with study and westy a couple of the guys that i killed even though i was cheating huge thanks to you guys using my creator code in the cod store jack frags and caps really appreciate that thank you and if you buy anything using my code send me a tweet with a pic with that said let's get into the game now and you'll see why the mac 10 is dominating this was my build and i haven't really leveled it up at all i just kind of threw it together and it worked great i'm sure that i can improve this though but if you liked the video leave a like subscribe for more and enjoy [Applause] [Applause] him bless him some people can't stand it could they yeah

boys mac and cheese for dinner tonight let's go well they're all right they must have all right in there [Applause] [Applause] oh my god all i did all i did was walk in that is so fun oh that's insane okay it's fun but in a while it's gonna get annoying i think it's quite prevalent on this map though because it's so close range but on the other map maybe not as bad well if you can build it with a slightly longer barrel and you could extend that damage range it could still be a bit a bit menacing maybe depends on the recoil though right there you go max 10. let's go in the game confirmed and jack's off to make a video you
