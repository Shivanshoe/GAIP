welcome back to battlefield 5. i thought we'd jump back on and see how things are going around here and also if you're watching this on the day of the upload merry christmas if you celebrate that hope you all had a fantastic day and got some incredible food spent some good times with the family and if you have knowledge of how to fix computers i hope that you didn't act as 24 7 tech support usually the way it went down for me when i was a kid but we're going to be sniping today on bl i know this wasn't everyone's favorite map in bf5 but i quite liked it for sniping infantry especially i was playing it on breakthrough here didn't really play that much breakthrough in bf5 to be honest counter sniped there fair enough it was just me and one other squad trying to defend this point so i'm gonna lose that one pretty quick i haven't played this since the end of october and i did say in the youtube comment that i uh i'm intending to make regular content on the bf games that people still play so that would be um three four one and five still got really big player bases of course 2042 i still have some ideas for videos that i just haven't had a chance to put together yet and i'm still working on those so watch out for those as well there's not really been any new content since launch of the game though apart from a couple of skins and like player cards that you could unlock obviously we had the the christmas portal mode the owls and santa which was just crazy yeah they really started to push up on me here on this point how was that not a hit but yeah no idea when the season is gonna start season one of the battle pass it's gonna be in the new year now obviously oh hello model 27 was always my favorite sidearm when they put it in reminds me of the magnum from bf3 yeah there's rumors in the community that the live service for battlefield's gonna start around march and that seems like a long long way away oh my god there's so many enemies there hey hopefully we can get some updates or new content before then it just seems like such a long time to wait you'll see what they do with it interested to see what direction they take with 2042 but for now we've got some lovely sniping for you it seems like the perfect area here doesn't it got a little head glitch they kept hiding up in these rocks here trade kill there hate that good shot though this dude actually res me had some conscientious teammates on this server off to a good start dice didn't let me jump up that one not first time anyway i'm gonna play a bit of whack them all again here got you i missed doing that that's always fun what the hell was that a body it's like upside down hanging around oh nailed that one love that hedgehog sound there was still chill out over there hiding behind the rocks hello oh that was paul should have finished that dude off then they're pushing up a little bit here i'm thinking here maybe i should fall back really starting to annoy the enemy team now but we were holding it pretty well i felt like i was seeing things there that's just a head a man with a lmg going hand i love this ross rifle it's very good yes screaming now we've got a teabagger just can't escape them they get a lot of tickets here don't they they mostly seem to be just chilling on the rocks up here not over there oh sanita need more sanitators in 2042 it might be in the 1942 though i don't know is there a sanitator in 1942 another trade kill same guy maybe there is a sanitator in portal although i've not heard it those rocks are the bane of my existence i it's like a magikarp there was someone there though just a bit trippy maybe there's a bug with the occlusion then sometimes you just see people through rocks for a second the storm started picking up here too weird explosion in the distance so cool still how the storm just completely changes the vibe of the level it was just a bright sunny day on the mountain and i was up here taking some instagram shots these guys trying to fight not today massive blizzard now still i mean it's such a realistic looking game isn't it still so impressive i feel like i want to play this without the hood on again you know do like uh another 4k real life mode or something look how good this looks what that's insane isn't it mad i think that guy just tried to do a rocket jump it's not quake 3 arena all team fortress depending on your proclivity i was trying to jump here and see that guy sniping just couldn't spot on and then this other dude rushed in got the one-two punch there how the snow is like building up on everything though so cool i wanted to use my squad points so i'll tell you straight around the corner there get rid of those snipers they only had 30 tickets here too so wasn't looking good for him and that artillery strike you know that stopped him pushing up beyond that point yeah it's like actual 3d particles isn't it people nearly nearly slipped through the net here missed some easy shots there didn't i i admire them five minutes ago you know they were the only two that actually tried to push there and just like that the storm's gone look at that nice and sunny again and whip out my world war two iphone start taking some more instagram pictures i don't know what i'm talking about five tickets let me get one more kill no i just got killed finish me off right at the end that was a good match though interesting to watch it back again nice chill that round of sniping there on bf5 hope you guys enjoyed this and captain bird's eye there looking good he's still got fish to catch in the ocean still got frozen fish fingers to make 27.5 i'll take it good game right guys thank you for watching once again merry christmas if you enjoyed the video leave a like if you didn't a dislike
