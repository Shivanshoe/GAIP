today we're taking a look at battlefield 2042 zero hour this is season one for the game this is the first new content since release which was in november of last year this is all gameplay that i played and recorded yesterday in a capture session and i only played for about an hour and 45 minutes in total so i don't have a great deal of experience with this but i did get to record all the new stuff so we're going to take a look at everything now just a bit of an overview for you if you want to get the details so we've got the new map exposure we've got a new specialist called liz who's got a remote control rocket launcher we've got two new stealth helicopters the huron and the hannibal two new weapons the ghost maker crossbow and the bsvm marksman rifle a new gadget in the smoke grenade launcher and there's also a battle pass a free tier and a premium tier with stuff to unlock there's a hundred levels in total all of the gameplay stuff can be unlocked without paying any money though so i've broken this up into sections here and what i think you'd be most interested in the first is the new marksman rifle the bsvm kind of similar to the vss you guys remember the vss ventures from bad company 2. looks very similar to that and you can actually set this up in a few different ways so i was using it as kind of a dmr style rifle here picking people off from distance with a bigger scope on it or you can make it more medium range with a different magazine and under barrel and then you can go super fast rate of fire with the short barrel and the higher rate of fire magazines and turn it into more of a close range assault rifle smg build it's actually really good this very effective i think people are gonna start using this a lot it feels like it's a decent versatile weapon for the game next up is the ghost maker r10 crossbow now when i first heard about this i was thinking um crossbows usually in pvp games not that great but this one's actually viable and quite fun to use you've got three different bolt choices i was mainly using the explosive bolt and if you tagged an infantry player with that a second later they explode so it's kind of like a one-hit kill so there's some fun moments to have with that the other two bolts i think i only use one of the other ones but it has like a really fast bolt making one hit kill headshots with it pretty easy almost goes in a straight line even at distances that you wouldn't expect so actually effective yeah you've got to hit your shots you've got a bit of a longer reload time than if you were using an assault rifle so there's the drawback had a lot of fun with this in the close range inventory areas it was a good laugh next up the two new helicopters so as far as i'm aware these are identical in terms of the unlocks and how they function but of course they physically look different you've got one on the us side one on the russian side i found these pretty decent and i think that's because it feels like a bit of thought and time went into them they've got two different modes they've got the attack mode in the stealth mode and they both offer different types of gameplay in the stealth mode you can't be locked on and you're not detected on the radar as far as i'm aware and you can also drop bombs when you're in the stealth mode in the attack mode you've got a couple of options for the weapons i had it set up here with a cannon and then my secondary was a guided missile kind of like the swar from the previous battlefield games you fire it and then you move the mouse and the helicopter to aim it where you want it to go nice and maneuverable as well these helicopters actually felt like decent attack helicopters because the attack elise in the game at the moment or the ones that came out at launch they're not really that good but i can see these becoming a big threat in the game the gunner as well gets this really cool suppressed heavy machine gun but you've got to be accurate with it and most of the time you're going to spend in the air dodging the missiles from liz which we'll take a look at now so liz is the new specialist as for the story of this character i don't really care to be honest but their passive is that they can spot or see nearby enemy vehicles that damage you get the red outline thing and their gadget is the g84 rocket launcher missile launcher so you have to right click you have to aim to fire this you get two they recharge over time though and once you shoot you have a limited amount of fuel so you can't just fly this around forever and you just control it with your mouse or your analog stick you can fly it into enemy soldiers you can fly into vehicles ground vehicles helicopters it's not quite youcav 2.0 like a lot of people thought it might be if you want to one hit kill someone with this on full health you have to get a direct hit with it and from what i experienced yesterday from my testing with it the splash damage isn't very big so you might hit near someone and just get a hit marker but if you want to kill them you'll have to follow that up with the second rocket but of course if you go after weakened players you could get double kills maybe triple kills with this thing it's quite controllable too so you can whip it around a lot and it travels fast you can't pick the recoilless rocket launcher though if you're playing gazelles so you can't run around with two rocket launchers i think that might be a bit too overpowered against vehicles so just make a note of that in terms of vehicle damage there were a couple of times when i hit a latvia recon that's the jeep style vehicle or the hovercraft and it seems like it's a two-hit kill on those on the bigger helicopters you'll be looking at maybe two to three rockets the vehicle that's going to suffer the most from this though is tanks because there's not really any protection against this there's no aps or anything like that so tanks are gonna get absolutely smashed after this goes into the game especially in the first couple weeks when a lot of people are playing as liz and using this although saying that when these things are flying towards you they are very visible there's a bright light and i tested you can actually shoot the rockets down and explode them and you get a few points for it too so conscientious players who are looking out for that you may be able to counter them whether you're on foot or in a tank or even in a helicopter as you can see here simply by shooting the rockets and exploding them before they get to you and i was in one of the new stealth helicopters here and when the rockets are flying towards you you can actually see them on the heads-up display they've got like a red thing that highlights them i don't know if it's like that for tanks but that could be useful if it is but i was having a good time here just trying to dodge all of these red missiles flying towards me that was a bit of a laugh they are noisy as well so you can hear them coming it's going to be interesting to see how they play out in the meta of the game though they may get annoying for infantry on certain maps because there's a lot of open space still on these maps but we'll have to wait and see new gadget smoke grenade launcher but here's a quick look at it you fire it and it just splits into three smoke grenades might be a really useful gadget for medics though people who like to play falco angel i personally would never pick it over some of the other gadget options though the map exposure very vertical as you can see you've got points at the top points at the bottom and then points actually built into the mountain through the tunnel system and the james bond style villains layers that's where most of the infantry fighting is gonna happen you can't get helicopters in the tunnels too also i found this at the deployment this is actually a big cargo lift or a vehicle lift so what i did was called in a tank drove it into the lift and then it shuts by itself and takes it up to the top so if you want to quickly get a ground vehicle either to the top or the bottom that's an interesting way of doing it and it'll be a damn sight easier than trying to get the tank up the rockfall avalanche which just be pain in the butt i found this melee weapon as well this stick with the skull on the top could you already get this or is this some kind of e string i don't know it's weird in terms of the battle pass itself i don't really care much for it to be honest there was a couple cool things in there like the gnome charm that's an old battlefield easter egg a couple of interesting skins too like we've got knockoff ghost here from modern warfare that's some mckay skin i think but there's also a lot of filler in there like player cards and weapon skins that just aren't that appealing to me dice did briefly mention portal 2 which i was a bit surprised about they're going to add more control over player and vehicle spawns and they're also increasing the vehicle budget for vehicles which i guess means that you could just make more interesting vehicle modes if you could add more of them and there's some kind of new vehicle superiority mode coming soon so that's the big hits of season one right there all the new flashy stuff i suppose to give you guys an idea of what's in it they're also adding in the reworked version of kaleidoscope in august new third-person animations new vehicles and voice lines for specialists performance improvements weapon balance and changes to visual recall as for the season itself they said it will last for 12 weeks so season 2 rush start date of september the 1st in terms of season 1 as a whole the whole package feels underwhelming for me personally and i think that most players will find it very light on new content dice have had to spend the last six months bug fixing the game to how it should have released and i presume that because of that they've had to pull more developers off new content to work on the base game instead and i appreciate that this content is free but the main problem for me with the first season is that as a battlefield fan the most exciting things that will keep me playing and get me invested in the game are maps and guns gadgets vehicles to play with battlefield is the sandbox and the more locations and toys in there the better so the fact that there's only one new map one new gun two if you count the crossbow one new specialist and one new vehicle class is a disappointment regular players are gonna blow through this new content very quickly hopefully this doesn't set a precedent for the future seasons going forward and i prefer if dice focused on making more new maps perhaps smaller in scale maybe two at the start of the season and then one more mid-season and then a lot more new guns and gadgets offering new gameplay opportunities and of course more new fun vehicles thrown into the mix and that's all for today
