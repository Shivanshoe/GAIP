hello guys and welcome to the battlefield 2042 gameplay reveal we're gonna watch the trailer then we're gonna break it down afterwards attention all squads the russian troops are falling back do whatever you can to secure the sector [Applause] we push them back but not far enough do not let them regroup [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh a tank though dropping in let's do a vehicle gameplay here [Music] where's that tool plus menu yes oh the c4 quad onto the helicopter zipline there very nice multiple gunner seats this just went right into the action didn't it [Music] okay the next era [Applause] all right damn okay cool right i did record that and we're going to take a look at it again guys and we're going to break this down frame by frame look at everything that we saw talk about the details so i'm just going to open up the recording here thank you for joining me everyone so that was just shown on the xbox bethesda showcase [Music] i'm gonna take a look at this what are you guys first reactions damn it was quite a short trailer i mean two minutes and 46 i thought we'd be getting a bit more gameplay than that to be honest um but we'll play it through and take a look at everything incoming fun right okay so i can actually go frame by frame as well just want to get that start bit it was on the antarctic map wasn't it that i think there we go look at that i mean that capture point i know it's kind of hard to read but i think that's 1590 meters away or something so this is one of the biggest maps in the game nice little look at the ui here as well so you can see what i was talking about with the capture point moving to the bottom here and then the points on the top and rocket launch so there's just a little montage at the start really [Music] the russian troops are falling back so we're starting on the stadium so much that we can see here so this gun here that's got like a hybrid scope on it it does appear that there's a bit of a vignette as well although usually you can disable that type of thing um that looks like a ump doesn't it what have they called it md 540 knight bird that might be is that the name of the gun i don't know so they're playing as i think they're playing as maria falcao we've got an apache here a couple of jets in the sky lots of players on the ground that's the osprey type vehicle apache there okay so this is inside the cockpit of the apache helicopter looks like there was a lock-on missile fired there too didn't it oh man look at those flares though what the hell that's kind of sick that's the alligator i think it's called okay so here we've got this is mckay so that's the assault character in the game and the assault character here has a bolt action rifle it's in this game you can actually pick whatever primary weapon you want doesn't matter what class or specialist you are okay so that's a look at the grapple hook as well it's very colorful isn't it very bright a bit of a spider-man swing if we go teammate takes down a sniper up there oh in the behind the scenes gameplay that i was shown they did have third person takedowns all right this is cool so dice told us that at any point any soldier can call in a vehicle on a tablet so i think that's what what's happened here one of these two maybe it's called in a tank and it can be delivered to you on the battlefield and notice now how the the sandstorm has picked up and the whole like vibe of the level has changed it's kind of much darker now right when we started out it's a light sky it's different you can see the sandstorm in the background here coming in i think just look how big that is what the hell i'll play how many tanks are here one two three four that one's dead or almost about to be dead five the tank as well has got multiple seats here we've got the driver the top gun of the back gunner under spotter 120 millimeter smooth ball i presume that's the type of ammunition right huge explosion in the sky tank taking out a helicopter bit of michael bay jumping there very nice this is one of the transport vehicles look at that okay right check this out guys i want you to pay attention to the tank here the wheels the track check this out i don't know if you guys can make this out but look how it deforms you see that we go frame by frame there check this out we'll go full screen for this watch here it's actually deforming over the carcass of that vehicle like that is some slick physics engine there see the wheels are getting pushed up inside the tank the gear at the back is spinning and the track is actually deforming like that that is some serious detail man that's super cool [Music] okay you can see the trees okay this is what i was talking about in my previous video look at the trees and when the storm rolls in like i said it affects the vibe of the level but it also affects the trees and the bushes they're all kind of bowing in the wind there's lots of debris in the air everywhere the tornado comes in helicopter crash there they're running into one of the buildings this is the plus system okay so this system in the game allows you to change your weapon attachments on the fly nice little moment here in the trailer we've got four different options here i presume that's why it's called the plus system as well right because it looks like a plus um but we've got a suppressor some kind of compensator two types of full grip well that might be a barrel actually like a short range cqb barrel or something um that guy says dozer although that looks like espinoza i think that's espinoza we've got different magazine types these actually change the rate of fire of your gun and the damage stats and then different scopes here and as you can see there's no animation for changing it just kind of like flicks out on the fly around the elevator into the roof another tape down there there's a rocket at the helicopter pod bike here i presume preloaded with c4 boom kind of like the reveal trailer [Applause] okay at this so i don't know what this helicopter is it kind of looks like uh an advanced version of the hind maybe but you see how there's multiple streams of gunfire coming from it right and that's because i would guess that helicopter has multiple gunner suits in it so you'll have one person in this seat one person in here you'll have a pilot and a gunner so they're talking about how the more people you've got in the vehicles the more proficient they are revive symbol here as well so this guy is playing as a character called sundance who i think is the one with the wingsuit sundance isn't the support character so perhaps everyone in the squad can revive squadmates maybe even just everyone can revive that'd be kind of cool [Applause] jumping off we're gonna pop the wingsuit flares on the attack helicopter [Music] that's so awesome i love that shot osprey being dragged into the hurricane tornado sorry crash at the end a little montage at the end here we're discarded now and then this rocket takes off apparently this rocket can fail as well but it doesn't always take off and if it crashes that'll have some adverse effects on the level i don't know what they are but i imagine lots of explosions lots of smoke that's not the that's the xbox conference again back up incoming fun okay we're gonna go to that end it again i think there's some stuff in there did i miss um yeah so that's right at the end i'll skip through next frames next frames enter the next era [Music] [Applause] how's it right my open it back up there we go good old windows video player yeah this is a right shield there i'm guessing that might be one of the specialist gadgets because that's the first time we've seen that battlefield has had riot chills before in battlefield 4 and hardline it had right shields here's the compass on the bottom of the screen as well when you aim down the site you get a compass right that's like big dammavan peak vibes right that's the map set in the antarctic again leaping off although that jet there what the hell that's so low down you can drive the transport vehicles on the ice by the looks of it got the hovercraft there that looks sick man i love that brings all that war this is discarded so in this ship here this is a massive ship called the colossus and they told us that inside that is a nuclear submarine and you have to fight over that so i imagine that's like a fully decked out interior with flanking routes and lanes and all that good stuff for infantry fighting mbt little bird up here [Applause] that's inside the stadium you know we're just looking looking at that stadium at the start where we're flying over the top bit of destruction here micro destruction of the pillars i like that very nice stim pistol so this is one of the specialists called maria and she has this pistol that she shoots into people and she can revive them from afar it's one of her gadgets that there is the meaty transport vehicle i don't remember the name of it it's kind of like an lav but it's got multiple seats in it another tank there being air dropped in okay so that there is it kind of looks like an f-35 doesn't it not yet it's hovering look see that's cool so that's the first time in the trailer they showed a jet hovering of it you could do that in old battlefield games like bf2 bf3 also had an f35 that could do that vertical takeoff and landing i assume the ospreys are going to be the same in this game as well i mean surely you shouldn't be standing that close to it right that is going to burn your face off that is going to ruin you come on you shouldn't be that how much close we can see there is there and then it ends okay so it gives us a little taste i expected to get something a bit longer than that to be honest i thought we were gonna get maybe like six to eight minutes of gameplay but they just went all in on this really didn't they like if we go from the start it's just full on action starts off with a little montage yeah then just get straight into it the russian troops are falling back multiple capture points there in the stadium i mean that is massive and think about you can go in most of those skyscrapers right but not far enough [Applause] [Music] looks like the helicopter had unlimited ammo there as well that's mckay's gadget again stabbed looks up towards the sandstorm that doesn't look exactly like an osprey though does it it's got different jets on it stone starts to roll in yeah they just went straight to the action finally gives me a uh dawnbreaker vibes this month lots of vehicles i love that that's so cool and that defamation again on the tank track [Applause] does it damage you if you get sucked into it on that drum mag for the vector little snip there as well good comedy you don't see the guy get off the quad bike only in battlefield moments no red zoops though like the hand in the reveal trailer time to kill this really quick doesn't it i mean the scale of it is just ridiculous you see that there where she put a hand up in the air the hood is kind of glitching out there as well come on let me just go back to that yeah this bit here so i wonder when you're near the tornado can you only hit fire because why else would you put your hand in the hair like in the hair in the air like that you see how the hood is glitching out as well the ui i don't know if they've done that just for the video or is that actually how it is in the game that is awesome man when it's fully it's dragging in the vehicle there pulling it back the developers told us the story where they were in a play test and they were pinned down by a sniper on a hill out in the open and the tornado in the distance he picked up a container like from a shipping crate and it just landed on the sniper and saved their life those smoke effects as well man look at those smoke effects i bought this up in my last video you guys remember like a year ago when they showed us the snippet of frostbite engine stuff at ea player last year and they had like smoke on a box when i saw this this here i'm thinking okay maybe that's maybe that's proper 3d volumetric smoke i mean look at it man it's just filling up the level this over here massive plumes and the smoke coming off it as well like see this here like that doesn't look like a texture to me that looks like proper volumetric smoke look at that that's nice that is real nice damn okay right so i think what i'm gonna do is do a proper detailed breakdown of the trailer and post that as a video but while we're here i'm going to try and read some of your guys reactions in the chat so what do you think of the gameplay they've just released i've got a 4k trailer on youtube now okay i'll have to check that out looks sick game looks absolutely nothing like cod yeah that's true very cool we love it who is delta delta's one of the specialists i think everyone has to play on low graphics we can't get new graphics cards uh supersonic source said whack nato i liked it but still effective looks amazing i'd rather play bf3 matt brown legs can't wait drums absolutely amazing pre-ordered yeah this game looks nothing like cod benny it looks really good this thing's stoked to watch you get some gameplay yeah i'd love to uh record some gameplay graphics are poor who said that paul scott do you think the graphics are [Music] purple doesn't even look futuristic well i think if it was too futuristic people would be turned off by it right battlefield i think it's best when it's a modern or near modern setting and i feel like hopefully they don't go too far into the future futuristic stuff in this game and at the moment it kind of looks like that so that's good in my opinion i mean the graphics look really nice to me i mean some of those physics effects as well i remember this is from a 1080p stream on twitch i have to check out that 4k version though with a higher bitrate but i think overall the majority of the chat it's a good reaction a few people aren't interested i think everything is perfect new engine looks insane looks quite generic it's xbox gameplay i think you can tell by the movement it's a mouse better look in the bf4 i'd hope so mv do you think they'll have animations when entering vehicles like a bf1 and bf5 i don't think so because i feel like the vibe of this game is going for sandbox and fun and getting that old battlefield feel back and a lot of people didn't like the animations for bf5 and if you think about the bit on the roof that's coming up with the quad bike the guy just gets off the quad bike really quick so i don't think it will have animations for getting in and out vehicles and you have to remember as well this is 128 players so on some other part of the map like this might be happening the same thing might be going on yeah look um so the guy's on the quad bike then he's not if i think if there was an exit animation there he would still be on the quad bike here right unless it was the quickest animation ever but i think he just kind of dives off watch it again yeah there's no way i mean there's not enough time there they just kind of [ __ ] off i think i mean that's just insane it's been in the stadium as well here isn't it no next bit yeah right shields bit hit and miss in my opinion i don't know i don't know how i feel about that i i can't stand right chills in warzone in modern warfare unless you can break them i mean in bf4 there was a right shield but you could break it so you know i hope that's the case i love this destruction here man this is cool micro destruction in the stadium loads of knocked out people here oh yeah they told us as well that when you call in these vehicles like here you see how that tank is being dropped in you can shoot them so you could completely troll someone if someone called in a vehicle you could actually shoot that i don't know if you could destroy it in time but that's just a bit funny that's insane i can't imagine what that's like so cool it's 128 players cj on pc expert xbox one sx and ps5 it's 64 players on ps4 and xbox one so old gen 64 players new gen 128 yeah some people were kind of disappointed that there's no animations for this i don't mind i mean just like thinking on i think mid you know mid fire fight or something you'd want it to be quick right but it would be cool to see some sick animations where he's like unscrewing the suppressor and screwing it back on but maybe that wouldn't work for that sandbox type of gameplay this is the grapple again so you've got infinite charges there and this is pre-alpha gameplay so it could change but i hope there's some kind of a a cool down on the grapple gun you know i don't want people to just be swinging around everywhere like this spider-man oh it doesn't it looks like it's recharging a bit there doesn't it no it's kind of difficult to say yeah there's like a line going up there you see that this ball here uses it it lands and then it changes and then it starts building the bar so i do think there's a cooldown cross-platform they've not talked about cross-platform or cosplay at all they've not mentioned it uh in my opinion i think for this type of game to be releasing in 2021 it has to have cross-play but based on the knowledge we have about how the old gen version is different it's 64 players it's smaller maps i think if there's cross play it would only be between generations so i would guess that ps4 can play with xbox one and i would guess that ps5 and series s and x can play together pc i don't know you know there's a lot of debate about whether pc players should be able to play with console especially when you can expose them to cheaters so not sure but i do think this game will have a healthy player base on pc because it's on steam uh it's probably going to be on epic games it's probably it's definitely on origin which is ea's platform and i think a lot of people are just more interested in this game than the f1 and bf5 because it's like a it looks like battlefield two and three right like it's it's battlefield sandbox and fun so i do think a lot of pc players are going to be on this um i would say if there was a good anti-cheat a decent anti-cheat yeah maybe let the pc players on with ps5 and series x but i don't think those consoles need pc players in their lobbies maybe volunteer you know like if you're the way apex do it is if you are on console and you're playing apex and you've got two friends on pc you can volunteer to play in pc lobbies right so maybe that's the way they do it but there's a lot to be said for protecting the console players from jesus because pc is always going to have hackers that helicopter just spins around and gets owned you can do a big swing with that i mean i would like cross play definitely for sure just just because it allows people to play with their friends and it isn't it's inclusive you know everyone can play together that way but i understand why some people don't like it is the spmn i don't know if they haven't revealed anything about that i mean this is this is just the reveal like we've within a week we've been showing the reveal trailer and we've been shown gameplay and they said at ea play we're going to learn about the next experience that daisalya making and all they said about that was that it was a love letter to the fans of battlefield squads the russian troops are falling back do whatever you can and then there's another mode called hazard zone which they haven't even talked about no detail apart from it it's a high stakes game mode there's a lot more to this game it's just they're not showing it yet yeah they're teasing nothing off you teasing me it's marketing isn't it you know you don't want to give everything away at once leave them something to desire and all that so i'm sure we'll find out all sorts of information about spm server browsers anti-cheat cross-play minimum specs you know all that good stuff in the future we're getting a lot lots of the airplay i think lots and lots and lots this is a very small snippet of the game they've shown i think i like the music anyway guys i'm going to leave it there for now i'm going to check out the rest of the xbox stream and see what happened hopefully they've shown some halo gameplay i'd love to see that and i might even do a video on that but i want to say a big thank you for everyone tuning in thank you to anyone that uh became a member sent a super chat thank you to anyone that chatted away in chat and just asked
