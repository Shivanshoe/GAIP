didn't even know don't want to hear about this let's sweep the tarmac for survivors and get to langley who the [ __ ] is perseus 1943 detailed information from the manhattan project was stolen from los alamos by the russian spy known as perseus 1968 vietnam war vietcong soldiers orchestrated by perseus attempted to steal an american-made nuclear bomb from a u.s firebase days ago while on a mission we acquired intel that perseus is in play again and planning on tackling west versus the cia's analysts consider him to be the single largest threat to the free world mr hudson we're all aware of perseus we're also aware he's more myth than fact i mean personally i think he's nothing more than the russian boogeyman general hague want me to introduce the man i suited to respond to that cia clandestine special officer russell adler he's one of the few people even come close to capturing [ __ ] uh mr adler why should we take this perseus threat seriously you don't have to sir yeah then a lot of innocent people are gonna die why do you say that sir every time perseus has come into play it shifted the balance of the cold war after 13 years of silence if he's active something big is gonna happen something that will affect the free world sir mr president sir mr president mr president this is jason hudson and russell i know their names who do you think approve their last mission is the threat real yes sir we believe it is can you stop perseus we can sir i've already submitted the requisition for my team sir their requests are highly irregular most likely illegal if the press gets old what the hell are you talking about you know who we are every mission we go on is illegal sergeant woods plausible deniability is the backbone of our work ah we're talking about preventing an attack on the free men and women of the world give mr adler whatever he wants gentlemen you've been given an important task protecting our very way of life from a great evil there is no higher duty there is no higher honor and while few people will know of your struggles rest assured the entire free world will benefit i know you won't fail us that was incredible detail like even on their skin this is hudson how long until we have a lead on perseus they're about to get started adler's in west berlin he should be at the safe house soon do you trust him i'm not the one you should be asking black what about his team it's a strong group he chased down sims has a lay even pulled some strings to get helen park from mi6 we'll get the mason and woods soon i'm not so sure about park she and adler have that business from before of course he wants you there and the new one well don't get me started that's the one we need to keep our eyes on oh my god everything is classified wait oh you can actually change everything if you want okay um we'll do ladiesman217 let's see if anybody gets that reference place of birth i think it was in north america right yeah that's where it was filmed i think gender well he was male 1 military background we can do cia mi6 or xkgb i'll just do cia psychological profile okay paranoid oh it gives you perks even aiming speed increased by a hundred percent asp time half okay uh bullet damage increased by 25 i don't think that's really gonna be necessary they're going to do ads speed what is this oh we can choose twice okay there it is reload speed increased by 50 let's do that one bell welcome to west berlin we've got a job to do mark adler bell let's get started there's been a surge in russian chatter in the last 48 hours cia and the dod have tapping their inside sources for anything substantial so far there are no leads on perseus mi6 has come up empty-handed as well and we'll have to start somewhere so we're going back here vietnam 1968 one of our closest encounters with perseus [ __ ] some part of me always knew that mission wasn't done with us pull up everything we've got on the attack in da nang and run it past park she'll cross-reference it with mi6 we're looking for code names encrypted transmission russian activity with nva anything that could be a lead god damn even she smokes bell this is where you come in we needed the best of the cia in song that's exactly why i requested you again head to the evidence board we'll retrace our steps through da nang anything that could give us a lead on perseus that's it it's the guy we're hunting apparently perseus use the evidence board to select your mission all right all right fracture jaw all right bell we're going back to vietnam first time perseus pinged our radar it was late january 68. we were a joint c.i.a sucked task force embedded within the third marine regiment near danae zag was there to sniff out soviet activity ward had it russian operatives were active in the region perseus had no known presence in vietnam that changed at the nag somehow perseus knew about operation fracture fracture jaw that one sure went sideways we launched out of camp hanson yeah i'll never forget that [ __ ] good we want those memories no details too small a face a name we're looking for anything that can lead us to perseus this feels like looking for a needle in a haystack in a field of haystacks maybe put that needle somewhere remember we had a job fractured jaw that one sure went sideways bell it's time to wake up it's great time ladies man belle217 i love it nothing hey fletcher how's the arm still hurt like hell but at least i can move it damn look at that that looks great incredible detail hey sims you know reading that shit's gonna make you go blind yep that's why i want it all up here belt you're with sims usually bring out the best in each other we got a new assignment fob4 ripcord is holding a vital asset that charlie wants real bad what kind of asset are we talking about the kind you don't ask about ripcord has been taking a hell of a beating so it's our job to secure the asset and get the [ __ ] out relax we got fast players providing combat air support for this mission it'll be a walk in the park headsets on all birds checking when ready badger niner one good to go imagine nine or two clear to go niger nine or three rotors up all birds go go go crank up and pull pitch all birds are in the air you all sitting comfortably oh man adler why do i get the feeling you about to give us some bad news because you're a smart guy sims the news isn't bad in fact it could be very very good the asset of ripcord is gonna have to wait a little while we're breaking off from the armada taking a detour and that's good because the source tipped us off that there may be a heavy hitter in town a soviet operative known as perseus oh [ __ ] appreciate the enthusiasm sims if our source is right we could be looking at an intel gold mine first time perseus pinged our radar surely we get to use this right rpg oh yes you and me bill let's do this this thing shoots really at a building in the quick of town let's go bill you're on point my god he was covering me i shot his hat off get inside see what we got dc go bill i'm right behind i'm not sure moving you hear that it's on you bell open the door adler we confirmed it soviets on site you sure well i'm staring at two bodies that sure as hell don't look vietnamese to me bell grab that comms log let's see who the [ __ ] they've been talking to mission accomplished we have the intel let's bug out good work hang on to that intel we're coming in to pick you up all right let's go rejoin the armada and get this [ __ ] asset we are still under heavy fire bc you're breaching the perimeter what is your status we're inbound now ripcord get that asset ready for transfer roger ripcord out oh we even get to fly it now all over the mountains here now i'm good zero watch the king bounce the duck in fire targets seems like every building is just filled with high explosives reinforcements before we're overrun anderson we're on our way setting down the base is still hot so watch yourselves roger that ripcord you adler mac v sugg yeah yeah just hurry the [ __ ] up already yes sir thank you don't thank me thanks bell he's the one who just snagged as a [ __ ] phone book full of soviet intel let's go now godspeed commander a [ __ ] nuke are you [ __ ] kidding me adler it's a failsafe that's all you need to know we that desperate already not yet rpg somehow percy is new well let loose with that goddamn scarf before we're overrun call it in grab a weapon keep them the [ __ ] off us where's that air support hey missus jesus with us there's a little danger close wasn't it you think we can call this a success sims at least the nuke didn't go off what do you mean at least more importantly we got intel on perseus i don't think we'd be here if it went off i told you we had a job to do it ain't done yet not by a long way yeah how did the memory exercise go well to hear it from adler it's working bell remembered finding that encrypted intel in vietnam and is almost finished decoding it anything useful in there some names apparently possible leads park is trying to connect the dots we don't have much time does the team know about our mishap in berlin yet no but if it's connected to one of those names from bell they'll find out soon enough you won't let that happen hudson don't say anything more than necessary that's never been a problem for me we've finished analyzing the names bella quiet at da nang one in particular stands out anton volkov he's a russian arms dealer working out of east berlin admittedly his connection to perseus comes as a surprise we've got killer capture orders on volkov so if we can't get to perseus we'll get to his men close off his resources force him out of hiding mason and woods are still wrapping up business in kiev which means volkov is ours gear up and we'll move out oh do we get to choose our loadout here we go we'll talk on the drive though oh okay nevermind i think i misunderstood he holds answers to a great many questions your preference has been noted agent park side missions okay they're optional obviously uh i'm just gonna stick to the main missions for this and i may play through the other stuff another time okay it looks like we got the next mission brick in the wall going after volkov all right volkov heads the russian mob that moved into east berlin once the wall went up at 61. this guy has connections to cartels throughout europe and the americas neutralizing him will not only hurt perseus but the global syndicate he's a big fish and here's our little fish franz krauss according to mi6 he's one of volkov's information careers he has a drop with volkov scheduled for tomorrow night we'll infiltrate east berlin via the u-bond a ghost station on the other side of the wall has the access point we need from there we'll watch krauss as he enters the city once falkoff shows his face it's killer catcher we're good to go as soon as the train slows down you and i will jump off park lazar wait till the next station bell and i'll track down crows all right train slowing down let's go to all work here we go careful east german guards still patrol these abandoned stations patrol ahead use a train to slip past movement on the platform carefully come on this is the way out always love missions like this and go in silence now nice work let's clean this up he's just sleeping crouch should be coming through the checkpoints soon let's get to the rooftop park that's our we're almost in position copy that come on this way careful of the spotlight i know how to lock a place down i'll give them that keep an eye on that checkpoint grouse will be coming through anytime look for krause with you camera damn security is even tighter than usual they detained krauss he could miss his meeting with volkov that's not crossed near the checkpoint man with the briefcase is that him that's not a guy not uh i'm not seeing him he got his trunk doesn't look like that not sure who i'm looking for no not him either surely it's not that side him good job that's our man that's kraus on me apart krause just crossed the wall what's your status roger that our intel says kraus and volkov will meet at the bar across the street meet hudson's contact inside she'll have a blue umbrella i'll stay out here and watch the street okay looking for a woman with a blue umbrella not you the table over my right shoulder hudson didn't reveal much he said you're after volkov how long will volkov be in berlin who knows demands like a ghost i would guess no more than a day um what do you know about the courier over there so don't let his whole appearance fool you the man is a killer one of my informants was picked up in a random sweep just two blocks from here the must assume there are more nearby i would ask a favor of you he will not hold up under torture for long we need him rescued all silenced they're holding him here okay so she gave us an optional task get out of there now go through the bathroom i'll hold them up you all right in there buddy stay hidden to avoid detection enemies will be alerted when the icon is flashing red okay without me i'll update you when i can don't go this way oops here everywhere is trouble um it's not tagging them i don't understand what it means by that that's all right jeez guys not having a good day i need to lay low i'll catch up with you when the heat dies down well get the parking sorry oh no don't see me don't see me okay everything's fine not fully understanding how to pick a lock oh okay you just gotta hold it there just let me go please i told you i'm not too sick i am little collector's item there some evidence nice is this the optional task this guy here i've been monitoring a nearby kgb field house i i don't know how they found me i've done everything by the book can rescue him you are careless and can't be trusted we're done with you what did that paper say you you can't trust these people see what i'm afraid of here is i rescue him and then he turns on me i'll just grab a gun thank you for saving my life i'll be waiting to hear from you all right we'll play as the good guy we'll see he hasn't shot at me i thought for sure he was gonna go reach for a gun or something i like tasks like this they're nice and uh immersive contact oh that's your low profile belt god help us all follow me stay quiet see an issue i've always had with campaign missions like this is that you always tend to walk faster than the npc so it feels a little awkward in the electronics floor right across the street from krause's place i was gonna pick her up some networks from the bramble park is just up ahead i have to give props to the audio team the audio in this has been fantastic so far i love the sound effects we're back a car pulled up near across this building a few minutes ago but i didn't have a good angle too just a moment house is on the telephone belt get eyes on crosstalk what do you think liza sounds like old call holds crosses briefcase they should place a dragon that case will lead us straight to vocal one of us can sneak into kraut's pocket avoiding kraus and his wife might be the greater challenge bell volunteers while he's doing that i'll check around the exterior for any unwanted guess part you can keep an eye on us from here a little bit just volunteered me lovely see if you can find it apartment get ready that's what i wanted to do nice work now find the briefcase oh he spotted me hello hello mama there's nowhere to hide have a look around toggle blacklight i knew it or something fishy about this what's going on here i'm missing something ah there was a second piece to the puzzle bell have you found the briefcase understood just plant the tracker and get out of there the girl from the calf oh we've been caught that makes this much less unblessed we have greater killer as well her own colleague rattata out your spineless piece of food i knew has a large bounty on your head how long have you worked for perseus unfortunately for you it seems these friends of yours have other places to be comrade i could probably make use of but you are damaged goods only a grave can kill a hunchback backup has arrived i'll help you get volkl he just walked right past him oh my god how did you get there don't kill him wait um you did the right thing one of perseus's men off the board is it oops i wanted him alive mi6 could have gotten so much more out of him can't win them all now let's get the hell out of east berlin i can't didn't mean to do that i only bunted him i didn't mean to kill him the information from volkov confirms our worst fears percy has smuggled a nuclear device through east berlin we can't be certain of it yet he has it i'm sure of it we found encrypted geo coordinates with volkov's nuclear intel an unpopulated region within the soviet republic of ukraine an aerial recon run revealed this i want to know everything that's going on inside this building we'll need the others for this one mason woods will join us from kiev belle you'll infil here with woods mason and i will be standing by for an extract sparkle handle comes we have no idea how large you're prepared their forces will be so use discretion if you have to engage it's time we took a peek behind the iron curtain i'm not picking up any extra chatter you're in the clearwood got me that part stay on comms keep mason and adler on standby let's go with woods in the woods this is gonna be a fun mission isn't it in learn what you can and get out shed park i plan to stay a while see the gulag do that afterwards no you don't want to go to the gulag i've been there too much i can promise you look at that monster reds could be hiding anything inside snap a picture ops want to see this right time to get our hands dirty i'm seeing guards choose your target this guy's mine holy hell where'd you learn to shoot like that take point and head down the slope i'll hang back okay got a picture of that move into the base find a way into the main building i'll trail and disable the perimeter quick alarm god i've missed those [ __ ] patrols approaching my position hopefully none of these guys see me i don't know if that's really gonna work stay the course and get inside this is gonna spot me i think i was supposed to move up to the truck here when that was coming by um you're welcome you lost something thanks woods park belle found us a way inside but we don't got a lot of time no arguments here these have to be my favorite type of missions these are so much fun guards down below i'll move to the lower deck and engage on your mark all right ready be ready be a thousand reds on the other side of this door cover me not a [ __ ] word bill roger that woods oh the hell is this place it's a spencer training course made to look like [ __ ] anytown usa get a picture of that bell this is the whole game saving the whole [ __ ] free world be patient woods i'm gaming over here alright we can always play this another time oh [ __ ] they're starting [ __ ] let's move they want a live fire truck let's hook these [ __ ] up gosh my sensitivity's so low for this this is really tough how'd you get up there contact on the rooftops yeah i really need to up my sensitivity this is really low i just have to use the pistol for now down push up where's the other guy there we go should be last i think that could have been a lot cleaner head to the control tower that elevator leads straight to the control tower grenade nowhere to go but up we got caught up to some kind of live fire drill place is crawling with reds we're still looking for intel bloody hell i'm putting mason adder on standby for extract she sounds mad does she sound mad she sounds a little bit mad looks like their command center come on jackpot computer central let's see what the reds are really up to they'll hop on that terminal boring what else is there operation green light restricted access what the [ __ ] is operation green light bell can you hack into that of course there's a password look around these reds ain't that smart maybe there's something on the desk restricted i thought you're supposed to be some high-tech whiz kid or something nice okay we're in we confirmed it the nuke smuggled out of berlin as a green light asset it's one of ours if that gets out no one will know not even atlas team the stakes are too high high is an understatement we're talking about an american new kid beneath berlin all right let's print it i'm grabbing a copy this doesn't make any sense perseus infiltrated a cia nuke program code name operation green light run by hudson the solanuc is american and hudson [ __ ] knew [ __ ] time to go i can't [ __ ] believe it clark come in park hudson lied to us he [ __ ] lied to us what are you talking about i'm talking about green light that's what perseus is after and hudson has his fingerprints all over it just get the hell out of that [ __ ] that apc is gonna tear oh my goodness i'm not even sure if we're supposed to fight this i think we just need to run up ahead hold onto this for me oh i think we're good oh yeah you found another sector [ __ ] says this place was built as some kind of early warning systems bastards are blocking the exit we're gonna have to punch the rules oh you pushed way too far i did not know that guy was there i think i should have kept the dragon up probably would have served me better here [ __ ] i don't know how this guy is still hitting me hey this might work let's see here ignition steering gear shift all right let's roll hold on here we go signs to do yes sir i'm on it you knew the nukes from green light didn't tell us what else are you hiding maybe i could knock the truth out of you you might want to rethink that woods everybody stand down this little piss and match isn't gonna help us catch perseus why didn't you tell us it was an american nuke he needed us to clean up his mess the bastard's been lying to us all alone it's not a lie it's an omission of fact that's what you do best isn't it hudson manipulate people tell them your own version of the truth there is no truth only who you choose to believe adler knows all about that don't you russ operation green light what is it tell us everything back in 58 the arms race was in full swing eisenhower was convinced if the reds moved on europe we couldn't respond quick enough so he authorized operation green light top secret program that placed nuclear bombs in every major european city the ultimate countermeasure to a soviet invasion 74 the bombs were upgraded to high-yield neutron bombs capable of terminating personnel without damaging infrastructure thousands dying in a flash you're talking about [ __ ] infrastructure how's that for civilized we kill the people but preserve the buildings we're trying to preserve our way of life how long have you known about the missing nuke one of the green light nukes went offline eight weeks ago we suspected it was purchased but couldn't confirm it so we saw the photos you brought back from east berlin so there's an american-made nuke in the wild and once perseus detonates it the united states becomes global enemy number one we wouldn't have this problem if you've done your job kill process of vietnam careful answer next time i might not stop woods we need to know what perseus is planning for that nuke park anything else in that printout bell and woods pulled from the base there's mention of an excavation taking place in the ural mountains yamantal our insider within the kgb confirmed an active operation i thought hudson and weaver buried that place years ago we did perseus wants to salvage the old mainframe dragonfish and steiner must have left some good [ __ ] behind steiner send me in woods you're too close to this mason we can afford zero fuck-ups [ __ ] you know there's no one better for the job it's my call i want mason and woods on this find that mainframe before perseus does i'll contact our kgb insider belakov he'll offer logistical support hell belikov may want to fly the chopper himself whatever perseus wanted yamantal i wanted more the first building is just over that ridge thanks dimitri what radio we found the mainframe woods you know what the kgb does to double agents yep if they win this season it's almost worth facing the fighting squad hey i've only one hour of fuel so after that you'll find yourself a new ride come on let's get moving mason oh this is going to be a good mission i can tell sniper in the snow that's our inside man don't let the smell of cheap vodka caviar fool you the beach was kosher though he knows where all the bodies are buried that is gonna be a fun mission heads up scout's on the ridgeline we should drop them now before we get any closer which one you want i'll take this guy good kill not bad let's keep moving you take one [ __ ] when i get the other good kill [ __ ] this looks dicey but hey if it's good enough the reds you go first i always love sniper missions i don't know about anybody else but especially in the snow it's always great what a view i hope this holds piece of cake that's the old satcom building still standing after all these years barely let's keep moving good kill see any more there's two down there so you can take this guy out what sniper take cover [ __ ] i can't get a shot diaper down nice shot your lucky woods damn look at this place what are we looking for here long way down oh yeah i don't know about that one okay up there we got a few up on the left here oh are we gonna do this i don't think there's a sneaky way of doing this i think one way or another we're drawing attention here maybe not those reds in the helipad are gonna be a problem oh my god age before beauty whatever lost my damn gun i see a tunnel down here you'll have to find another way inside copy that woods great damn it's cold in here huh crossbow bolt what is that foreign foreign number okay doesn't look like he made it now what do we got over here it's locked okay locate the key to the weapons locker it's optional but i'd like to do it if it is possible i gotta find where this key is oh yes there's no way that missed it's hitting the pole well there's supposed to be a key but i think i must have missed it already uh yeah i read you you gotta be close i hope this isn't multiplayer this thing would be so much fun to run around with okay i assume there's no key in here huh this is oh can pick lock it over here with the ropes you made i'm surprised the entire soviet union ain't up our ass you've been busy that's what they pay me for you see any dig sites if i'm reading this map right swing a few degrees to your left more north there it is right there right there's a hole in the ground you ask me they're here for more than just the mainframe steiner was working on all sorts of crazy [ __ ] that nova 6 business was just we found the mainframe there's a big crane on the west side of the base have your witch ready excuse me sorry you're breaking up making a crane oh i'm not gonna have enough arrows for all this this would be so incredible in multiplayer that's it we're getting the hang of it oh boy spike cover that turn will tear you up last shot didn't get him now he's dead right more ammo yes what i'm over the extraction site are you ready we see you dimitri hold on we're out of time we have to jump sorry let's go mason basically we gotta get down there now regular size nice thing about this is quiet so i don't even think they have any idea where i am how did you get over there take us up get us out of here getting shot up from too many different angles who's shooting at me i can't even see this guy i think it's too difficult with the bow we might have to bring out the ak come on oh my god it's kind of difficult to shoot when you're flinging us around like this we finished analyzing that mainframe that mason woods brought from yamato and perseus was looking for the names of sleeper agents dragovich used in 68. give us those names we'll get adler's team to track him down perseus erase them there's only one place you're going to find that information now the lubianca building what kgb headquarters why didn't perseus get them there himself i don't know maybe he's operating without authorization i'll let edler know but we're going to do this the right way we're not going to do it anymore just got word bilikov is back in moscow you guys know the plan bell you with me lazar be ready for xvil are you taking him into the kgb with you are you crazy wait for mason or woods to return i don't need mason or woods i need bell he's got the skill we need are you enjoying this you're risking the entire operation unnecessarily it's not unnecessary it's calculated just understand that if you watch this we can't get those names it's over i know you can do this hudson doesn't trust anyone he can't control all right oh that new enlarger came in i set it up in the dark room for you curious does the name madame shell mean anything to you uh sounds familiar there's intel criss-crossing afternoon that her body washed up along the padilla's river in cyprus it's all coming together all right our next mission is desperate measures looks like we gotta break into the kgb early's going the lubianca building kgb headquarters in moscow the sleeper agent records are stored in the archives 100 feet below ground in a nuclear defense command bunker your only way in or out is through this high security elevator we'll need proper credentials that's where our asset belkov comes into play velikov has been our source inside the kgb for nearly a decade he'll get us in he came through for us in yamatown he'll do it again this [ __ ] is crazy even by his standards you sure he's on board an immediate nuclear threat warrants every risk at this point i'm sure he wouldn't disagree sims get bellicoff on the line singapore we're almost to the tunnels did you get access to the bunker no there's a problem they suspect a mole insecurity has been elevated there's always a problem not yet i know you have this under control all right we gotta get into one thing one of our east berlin informants recently switched sides and fled for moscow we have reason to believe in the lubianca building today he knows too much about our berlin network i'm thinking in early retirement take care of it now i know why hudson thinks so highly of you we'll meet you at the basement entrance once you have the bunker key you've been summoned to the conference room upstairs secretary gorbachev is here from the central community i'm sorry we'll just have to come back tomorrow okay we need to attend a briefing have a seat general secretary brezhnev has taken an interest in the new security development there's a mole within the kgb the committee wants someone from the first chief directorate to oversee colonel kravchenko's investigation if you've not met him already this is imran zakayev thank you secretary gorbachev and thank you all for welcoming me with open arms i can think of no greater tragedy than a home violated from the inside trust and love within a family is sacred apparently not everyone shares your beautiful sentiments comrade belikov as head of security i understand you've practically exhausted yourself trying to unearth this mole how is that gone oh actually i have a strongly we might be able to set up your guys and once we are finished with this mole he will be as blind and buried as his namesake we can set up the other guy until the mole is found i want security increased around the bunker zacchaeus do you have any recommendations we should restrict bunker access we also want to cultivate closer relationships with all of you i want to know your hopes your fears your ambitions be thorough but we don't want any significant disruptions and you belike who do you think should retain bunker access during the investigation my apologies even your bunker access has been revoked we can't be too cautious can we secretary gorbachev i believe it would be best if only general charkoff retains his bunker key for now very well see to it worry yourself no longer sir i've already ordered the bunker keys collected from the men comrade belikov we are in grave danger from the capitalists our collective our very way of life is at risk the traitor will be caught and he will pay a high price for his betrayal belikov you are dismissed i think we chose some of the correct answers there i thought maybe we could set up the other guy that we uh we have to take out use kgb map to investigate multiple ways of acquiring a bunker key all right i'm being watched i need the bunker key now first i'll have to kill the cameras sir want to eliminate this guy wait there he's gonna be really confused when he wakes up cameras are shut down explore the map to find a way to acquire a bunker to get the key key for adler you'll need it to access the vault unfortunately cherkov now has the only one ah let's go eliminate this guy first all right where is that it is this way oh are you here about my assignment hi the armory guard has a weakness for cubans okay perhaps a bribe could get me inside this is them how do we take them out that will be pleased now we need to focus on the bunker key you saw nothing all right loose end taken care of persuade prisoner let's see if we can do all of it here charkov plans to interrogate a desperate politician prisoner today perhaps i can persuade him to take out charka for me all right i believe it's this way yeah we're gonna have to get through the checkpoint though wait okay maybe i could pick luck i also got to get a bunker key speak with okay speak with him to get where would that be so there's a couple things that we need to the gear do sir what can i do for you by the way i'm sorry comrade belikov but zakiyev has increased security measures you'll need authorization from the war room like anyone else i need the armory paperwork i'm sorry i can't suck i would have my head on the pike oh how important is pursuing the sleep to you ah a cuban cigar would really distract me i'm sure you could find a personal stash in one of the offices i already got one wonderful i'll let you win but this never happened good day sir thank you sir in that entry i could program this blank key card into a bunker key yes okay now head to data entry to reprogram it where is data entry it's right beside me what am i doing yeah it's uh i can go through here now um oh that is not what i meant to do shoot no one saw anything it is fine you gotta love that that's so accurate are you sure yes that is why i chose that action all right access granted nice okay now i need to head to the basement and let emma's team in it's cool looking launch okay now we gotta go down to uh this is the entrance head to prison and let adler's team in where's the prison down here we've made good progress through this didn't take too long at all down here to the right hello how can i help you sir like a smooth criminal unless team will need uniforms to get better security luring two soldiers into the tunnel should do the trick delicate here send the security detail to meet me in the fairness room immediately can i hit him with a shovel or something wasn't sure you'd come through i don't have much choice do i this key card gives you elevated access to the gun what about uniforms sounds like they're here now okay i will lead them through and destroy them you two do the rest now take cover keep it clean uniforms are no good to us bloody i was detected gives you elevators okay uniforms it sounds like they're here now okay i will lead them through this level all right you two do the rest yes of course keep it clean uniforms are no good to us bloody okay i have to leave but you should have everything you need now if stopped you are reporting with the commander sober get changed here our weapons and key card are in the bag i thought he was gonna throw him in the furnace to be honest come on this way let's run the bunker on our own foreign we're going around don't have a gun on me alright foreign is is i thought we were done for right there i thought maybe it chose the wrong action take us down foreign gear up they won't be happy to see us down here wait for my word foreign mp5 still shredding as always keem that's not an explosive barrel we're getting closer if things go south we need to secure our expo plant a gas canister good let's get to the vault we're almost to the vault oh my god open the door i've got your back i wish i could open every door like this satisfying why are the lights shaking don't have much time before they get through there's the list bell copy it to a disk oh this is gonna take a while good luck gentlemen yes he's almost done coffee is he really trying to use the shotgun from back there follow me this way as well i don't like this we're sitting ducks i need to find a here out just barely see them this might be a way out you activate the gas when we move get a mask on bella come on heavier gear i know just a place way oh yes let's get up top lazar meet us in the southwest courtyard for five minutes bellatop is hitting a ride plenty of room in the backseat once we get off the elevator just keep moving towards the courtyard get the charge ready though let's go i gotta like reload oh foreign got the list and we're heading back be ready to move what a great mission it's about time i've been waiting for your call they caused a hell of a mess in moscow was it worth it adler managed to get the list of sleeper agent names despite himself he's got balls i'll give him that bell did well seemingly but i think that team is getting too comfortable they're acting like they know who they're dealing with perhaps turns out one of those sleeper agents is tied to operation greenlight theodore hastings he's a nuclear engineer based out of salt lake city and you believe hastings is the one he'll activate exactly total surveillance is already underway it's only a matter of time before he leads us straight to perseus this is it the recent movements of theodore hastings has led us here cuba right in our backyard a vacant government facility in the cuban countryside has become a hub of activity for perseus and the likely location of the stolen nuke no doubt castro allowed it 20 bucks to anyone who can bring him down before me who castro or perseus whoever we are not gonna let him move this nuke inside the states it's time to take down perseus once and for all team wrap up any unfinished business once we strike there's no turning back woods don't get any bright ideas over there yeah you've got my surest [ __ ] guarantee hudson i have a word gotta love words huh what's up all right you available next mission end of the line you look ready you're about to hunt down perseus in cuba and and will no longer have access to the evidence board this must be like the last mission then all right i'm ready hastings left salt lake city we tracked his movements all the way to cuba we have to assume perseus moved the nuke there langley believes castro could help perseus smuggle it into the u.s in exchange for a peek at the hardware of course that isn't going to happen what's the plan the last read we have on hastings came from 30 miles south of havana we suspect perseus is using an abandoned compound there to hold the nuke they're working under the radar so expect moderate security i said we smash and grab parachute in grab nuke skyhook out and what if the nuke isn't there it's there the only reason perseus needs hastings in cuba is to prepare it for arming and detonation there you have it that's an old range rx fill while we're in route if everyone's ready let's move out adler's late now love where early adler should be checking in right about park we're in position copy that we're moving to flank damn he is punctual all find teams grab the new get the hell out boys light up this joint [ __ ] time fast and loud roger that do the honors bill now too close they're on the move someone give me some cover copy that let's what did these poor bastards do they finished their job they love a reward they've got closed circuit cameras we could use them to locate the nuclear bomb sharp as ever always got to make sure to check your corners you never know bell sweep the mines bomb defused ambush i honestly think shooting the mines is a little bit easier oh my goodness moving what do you say we finally grab that drink when this is over i mean he's not wrong it wasn't a no all right ctv mason you missed one behind the counter thanks park keep looking there hold it adler we have eyes on the nuclear device someone's killing the scientists second floor room 27b second floor center room upstairs let's go bark crude but effective can't keep your eyes off me huh park he's not giving up they'll use the default a little bit closer parker down nice little quick scope get moving oh what do we got in here please they're shooting at us please no kill the sniper before they shoot the scientists get me some cover they're really hunkered down we must be getting close take out that heavy mg let's go 27b we're heading inside is it this room and the door bell canvas the room hastings stop talking perseus was here he shot us escaped perseus would never leave his precious nuke behind he forced us to reverse engineer the detonation codes give him full access to green light what are you telling me perseus can detonate multiple nukes in europe i'm so sorry hastings stay with us how many green light devices can perseus detonate with those codes he can detonate all of them he'll wipe out half of europe and blame it all on the usa we need to find that son of a [ __ ] perseus time to go no contact chopper coming in low it's gotta be perseus head to the roof quick open the door out of the way i was just in front of you a second ago we got bigger problems in a while since i've used one of these i think that guy dropped a grenade when i shot him i think i'm ready for that drink now don't feed me but we'll have none of that horse piss you called beer get ready here they come it's a grenade where's that plane one minute these guys aren't even aiming they're just shooting oh yeah good impact we need to hook into the line now we'll do it in turns bell you harness up first we'll cover go is it this am i looking for [ __ ] reach no i didn't know that was a decision well that was a goddamn fiasco you go in with the intel you have not the intel you want you paid the [ __ ] piper down there you think this is belchvault i don't know whose fault it is i just know that perseus doesn't have a single [ __ ] nuke he's got dozens millions of people are gonna die and the united states will take to blame you need to find out where he's planning to broadcast the activation signal are we going to pull that out of our ass bell knows where it is no this goddamn science project was a failure don't count adler out yet the man has a deep bag of tricks come on a little further sims get the gurney bell i feel like i owe you bloody hell i'm going to lose a lot more than lazar if we don't execute this next move correctly we need you to hang in there for one more assignment i'm counting on you again bell sims get the dosages ready all of them adler stop wasting our valuable time he's of no use to us anymore stay alert bill you're the key to struggling persons you always have no more half-fasting we're doing an intracerebral injection injecting directly into the brain could provoke seizures or worse damn do the eye socket you sure about this memory should begin almost immediately bell listen to me i need you to remember think back to our time in vietnam one more time we need to finish what we started we had a job to do think bell perseus do you remember coming face to face with perseus in vietnam ekg is spiking [ __ ] heart rate's off the charts i need you to relax and focus bell your helicopter crashed you made your way through the jungle alone you found a bunker you remember the bunker bell we need to know what's inside that bunker do not trust adler adler is lying to you do not trust him do not listen to ever he is lying to you he is lying to you during a mission to investigate reports of a soviet bunker your chopper was hit by ground fire according to your debrief you woke up in the middle of a firefight the crash survivors were defending against a vc attack you ran forward and picked up an m16 foreign a lot of gunfire coming our way the remaining vc fled into the tree line it was then you realized you were the sole survivor you set off to locate the bunker i assume i'm going the right way the path split near a ruin so he took the right fork not the trail to the left down get down pc just moving close use our knives how did that miss thanks for the assist you heard russian voices from a cave across the river so you went to investigate you equipped your shotgun and had a boat that's when you discovered bc soldiers meeting with soviets how can they see me already they all think they're dying from robin hood i love recurve recurve bows they're so good can i go up here oh yes bill that was the door into the soviet bunker oh shoot it's not e it's f yes good the bunker now tell me about perseus ah we almost had it let's run six okay ready bell we've got a job to do according to your debrief you woke up and the rest of your crew was missing the vc were on the ground searching for survivors you readied your bow to take them out silently hey guys well i guess going silent didn't work oh this is close not meant to be doing this is that guy over there no it sounded like there was another one right here the path split near a ruin so you took the well-traveled trail on your left not toward the waterfall on the right oh you kidding me arrow went through him like three different times there you mentioned crossing the bridge nearer on the other side what okay he's a ghost that's the fork you followed the road right toward the sound of gunfire seeing a firefight you raided your m16 support we're clear that's what i like to see yes this was the bunker entrance you described in the report this could be the onset of another focal seizure oh we have to match them i think shoot that was it no don't stop [ __ ] [ __ ] hand me the fallback scenario manual here it is bell we've got a job to do according to your debrief you woke up in the middle of a firefight crash survivors were defending against a dc attack you ready the grenade launcher and charged ahead this is a bunch of adlers you just ran away that doesn't sound like you is it the path split near a ruin so you took the well-traveled trail on your left not toward the waterfall on the right i'm not seeing this guy where is he there he is reports had the [ __ ] across the bridge goddammit bell we're running out of time you went left at the fork not right a few allies were pinned down on a ridge you readied your sniper rifle to assist we need to clear that house 30 seconds out yeah we can't move up inside the house hit by napalm you would find a hidden bunker door go check it out val this doesn't look right i don't care if the door was [ __ ] stuck open it wait heart rate is spiking i'm not sure how much longer they'll last good everything's stabilizing heart rate is coming down now can unlock a bunch of games go through the door the room's getting smaller there's three clocks on that wall now stop wasting my time with this hallway four clocks turn around bill what the lab what the hell is bill doing in the lab bell forget about the damn land i need to know about the bunker i am so confused comrades the united states and its allies slowly consumed this is lol sing don't trust adler over and over can bell survive another round now you're asking me do it we're not leaving empty-handed script 17. ready we've got a job to do we've been over this already skip ahead to the next one the bunker door was right there at the ruins bell you went in bell go into the bunker now the united states and its allies slowly consume that which is dear to us our leaders continue to weaken under this threat it is the moral duty of perseus to act when they will not soon we will possess an american nuclear bomb the key to unlocking their entire green light arsenal once we control the green light arsenal we will detonate them all from the safety of solovetsky gotta admit i'm surprised i didn't think they'd recover so fast we tried everything the normal forms of interrogation won't work breaking a subject's will and erasing their mind is a difficult and painful process that's a small price to pay the cia's mind control program has had a great deal of success with implanted memories you want me to tell them about my time in vietnam lastly you'll need a command phrase to trigger the implanted memories we've known each other for years fought together bled together been through the hell of vietnam together we've got a job to do and now the training's complete you just need to give the subject a name bell he's coming too bell no more [ __ ] around what did perseus say where is he you're disoriented bill we'll explain everything later right now we need to help each other where is perseus you tell us bell that's what this whole [ __ ] thing is about belle you were one of perseus agents his associate arash cardovar turned on you at the airstrip in turkey left you for dead when the plane leaves traps on is stopping in dugout this you know here's what you don't know perseus won't be there none of these hired guns are going to leave dugout alive we'll dump our bodies in the forest then we will move the weapons to volkov in berlin from there we fly to solomonski but i have other plans for you versus things too highly of you i don't want the competition i was one of the guys in the truck we were there we found you after everything went down the c.i.a reinvented you belle we needed to give you a new identity to replace the old sims and i both wanted you to be cia i mean i am paranoid as much as we thought you might and we were able to utilize your language and cryptography skills as an added bonus the bigger challenge was your memory the cia's mk ultra program used adler's missions in vietnam as a template we needed you to have that shared experience that lifelong bond to establish trust people are sick are your hands clean bell interrogation didn't work with you but thanks to mk ultra's research we had a backup plan if you believed you were someone else we could lead you to a place where you'd give everything up enough to get us where we are today but we're not finished yet we have a job to do well we've got come on you got a job come on you got a job to do got a job to do the trigger phrase kept you in line but it didn't get us everything we needed your innermost secrets were always locked behind a door bell i realize you probably hate us right now what we've done to you i just need you to fully understand the stakes here what you do right now is not about me it's not about you it's about millions of other [ __ ] people it's about stopping someone who in the end has no true allegiance to anyone other than himself so tell me where is perseus once we control the green light where is perseus wow we can either tell the truth or lie and this will lead to two different endings i assume you know we've played through the whole mission let's go with the truth solovetsky sims get washington on the line everyone else gear up we're leaving now you made the right choice bill come on you're still one of us perseus cia's analysts consider him to be the single largest threat to the free world you've been given an important task projecting our very way of life from a great evil the united states and its allies slowly consume that which is dear to us we are hours away from perseus detonating nuclear bombs in every major european city we'll do whatever it takes some of us will cross the line to make sure the line's still there in the morning no one's gonna brand us heroes or villains they don't know us as for me i've been chasing this ghost for 13 years that ends now coming up on your right felikov really came through into soviet armor hot time you caught up with no way i'm missing this [ __ ] are going to pay for isil look at your chance zolovetsky's two clicks up all units emp and transit starfish inbound 400 knots when that baby hits we'll have 12 minutes max before the radio towers come back online our job is to knock out the aaa guns and give our warbirds a clean shot let's take perseus off the air oh yeah go stop rpg [ __ ] pardon me nice work bell head for the church mason woods clear out any aia guns on the west wing we need to launch these bombers we got one a.a cleared you know that's not good enough i can't risk an early strike we only got one shot at this you don't think i know that just be ready to launch when i tell you hudson contact we got five minutes before all the europe goes nuclear pick up the pace the power's coming back ones we're running out of time watch it heavy mg on the ridge hudson start your bombing run copy back get your team out of the radler those bombers i think i pushed up a little too much right now oh yeah oh sorry well we gotta go now they did it mr president they stopped the nukes thank god and the cia did they get perseus no sir his whereabouts are unknown and a russian response nothing yet we're seeing signs of confusion it's possible this was all a rogue operation perseus may not have been following orders from moscow well i'll be damned maybe we have something in common after all we stopped him those towers are history what's your situation down there come in have you found them yet over here give me a hand take my hand bell we did it this is a message to perseus and those that'll follow him we don't just sit back and hope for the best we'll make the best happen this is how wars are won belle do you have an update on kasim javadi yeah with both he and arash kadivar dead their terrorist network collapsed as surviving members fought for control with no clear leadership in place it appears the soviets have decided to cut ties and clean up the mess approximately 72 hours ago the militants primary encampment was burned to the ground nothing but ashes apparently the few survivors that escaped have scattered and gone into hiding what about anton volkov after his death elements inside the gdr saw an opportunity to reduce the russian mob's influence in east berlin two days ago in a large-scale midnight raid stasi swept through the homes of anyone with connections to volkov men women and children were all gone before the sun rose this will be a major setback to underground soviet activity in europe how did the cleanup in havana go we were able to recover agent azalea's body from the compound in cuba president reagan personally reached out to his family in his caskets in transit to tel aviv as you know helen park returned to london she'll continue to recover from her injuries there afterwards mi6 plans to give her a task force dedicated to finding perseus what about the rest of the team they got off soloveski before the soviets could send in forces to investigate we'll take some time to heal up that it's back to work we may have stopped perseus but his rats are still nesting all around us thanks to the help of one of our own true we failed to hunt down robert aldrich and his domestic network of spies we may have to go to more extreme measures like broad domestic surveillance which of course we're not authorized to do not yet what about europe we may have saved it from getting blown to kingdom come but it's still stacked with perseus agents there's more we could have done there if we'd had the time and bell arctic air clears the head doesn't it bell you made two extraordinary sacrifices to stop perseus one was without your knowledge the other you made that decision in your own accord i just want you to know this little thing that's happened with you and me it was always for the greater good your goddamn hero you know that kid heroes have to make sacrifices that's why when i ask you for one more i hope you understand it was never personal i knew it i knew he was gonna do that right at the end that was good that was good what a fantastic game that was a good playthrough quite enjoyed that hope you guys enjoyed that also yeah the details were great there was a lot of confusion towards the end there with the the memories and all that but that was a fun playthrough i quite enjoyed that thank you guys very much for watching i'll catch you guys in the next one
