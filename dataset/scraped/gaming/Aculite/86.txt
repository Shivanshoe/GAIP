oh how do i hold a grudge a big thank you to nvidia for sponsoring this video i don't know about you guys but i've been having a lot of fun on the new map new new map more like uh old map i guess because technically it also did was really go back in time we're now on 80s verdonsk but with this new map nvidia has paired up with activision raven software and infinity ward to bring you guys nvidia dlss if you don't know what this is it's nvidia's cutting edge ai rendering technology that will boost your frame rate while keeping your game looking nice and pretty and that's really what it is it's essentially just a free frame rate boost so if you're much like myself and you'd love to get every little bit of performance you possibly can out of your graphics card or your computer itself then this may be something for you to look into anybody with an rtx graphics card from nvidia can take advantage of this and how it's done is it utilizes something called tensor cores found only in the rtx gpus from nvidia i can tell you firsthand while playing at 1440p it boosted my frame rate by up to 20 25 fps extra in certain areas i was seeing upwards of about 190 in boneyard area now mind you i have a really good pc but this is just unheard of by simply turning on a setting to utilize more of my gpu now i'm not sure who plays warzone at 4k but if you are one of those users you can see a boost by up to 70 percent from utilizing dlss so there's really no reason not to throw it on now i'm going to keep my fps on the very top left of the video the entire time so you can see what i was getting at 1440p while having it on the quality setting and i'm going to show you exactly how easy it is to turn it on it's extremely simple just go into your options menu and then go to graphics tab scroll all the way down to the very bottom and you will see nvidia dlss there's four settings for you to choose from i thought quality was the best for me in terms of picture and performance thank you guys very much for watching hope you enjoy and i'll catch you guys in the next one there's a nice mural jack i don't want to say that i've added a nice mural to you no no you like murals jack no it
