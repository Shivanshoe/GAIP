well here it is war zone solos they released it hopefully this stays as a permanent mode I thought it was a lot of fun playing it I'm gonna show you guys a one well I guess one game video hopefully you guys enjoyed that I had a lot of fun playing solos but I also want to show you guys my loadout since I know people are gonna be asking what it is I could comments all the time what my loaders are but I always change them up so much so I don't I don't really I don't really stick to one thing anyways I'll show you guys loaded that I swapped to throughout the game everyone was telling me that the 5 5 6 aughh is pretty good so I went ahead and gave that a try leveled it up a bit and got the drum Meg and all that so this is what I'm gonna be using on it you can swap it around however you want if you guys want to copy this loadout have a go at it the Joker as a secondary because why not got to get those pesky vehicles those guys on the quads and these guys trying to get up on top of rooftops with the helis and all that stuff so that's why I use that well it's just fun to use it really is it's just fun to use and for perks I ran cold blooded ghost and amped amped for fast or weapons flop sorry swap so you can swap over to the Joker and back and forth pretty quickly and then just a semtex and a normal stun grenades anyways hope you guys are having fun in solos and hope you enjoy the video and I just thought about that's gonna be an expensive flight I'm the only person drop again my own personal plane well they're still using the voice lines for teams I'm a squad lead but I'm the only person here where should we go would be like a good fun solo spot maybe superstore let's go there eliminate I wasn't really watching I don't know how many people came down here always above is above me not gonna bother eluding them I don't think you had much and try the scar to start it's got some decent damage on it but it's only got a 20 rounder kind of sucks so I think the mp7 here is a little bit better it's just it's it's tough to to be one with it essentially oh my and writeable it's Wow okay what a strange fight that was another horse is more it's always more thank he's running yeah I think he's gone okay that's the first time I've ever used a snapshot grenade correctly creepy can with that amount of health he's crazy oh you didn't even move and this is a scary place to fight I don't know if I want to be here anymore it's dark it's eerie there's so many people just hiding around corners if they want it's kind of how solos go though I mean the game the game kind of forces you to play that way if you run around you have a higher chance of dying right it's clear [Applause] [Music] he's gonna chase me [Applause] do you mind this is a rental he's not gonna let me by is not No excuse me just need to park here for a quick moment [Applause] maybe in third party this alright now it's my turn my turn to get third party it was all green I think he's wearing though I was gonna say leprechaun outfit the I can't remember it's called now I'm dead yeah I'm dead damn I really thought that was gonna kill him c4 doesn't blow up the trucks in one hit I guess dammit shame on I really thought I had him it was that or deployed the the shield because I think those still stop trucks and vehicles I don't know for sure [Applause] it's time just left like near oh oh we got him the hipfire I think a double headshot at him okay now where do we go was it that was over there right just find the supermarket I think I was you think he's still there I don't think he's gonna still be there this might even be the Stratfor solos I mean if you do win the GU leg is kind of like I don't think he's still here why would he be he had a ton of cash she probably went to a buy station yeah I don't I think it's good see soon enough maybe I'm dead that scar was not great pretty sure either way he was gonna kill me because I didn't have enough ammo to win the fight miss too many shots what do you want do we want self res I'm thinking UAV personally we can go grab a drop one weekend then we have our lord out and just hunt people down with UAV [Applause] Ami's neck bulb for these now who were you shooting at you know surely we shouldn't have somebody at the drop now oh boy he just tried to throwing knife me if he had a hit thought I was dead oh he's right near me we can go over and grab the drop after you know what I'm gonna play a little bit more aggressive because I think that's more fun to be I think it's more fun to watch I think it's just more fun overall we win we win if not at least we get to run two people over that's a bonus right it's never get old I'm gonna keep the Joker I gave up the Joker the last game [Applause] okay actually Sindri can't be seen that building there it's a kindness building to wait no he's on the road Tina sky what's happening oh he went back for his stuff wait he's gonna get bouncing betty this is the same poor guy man [Applause] oh no this poor guy did you imagine oh my god I'm sorry I feel that's not a feeling you want to feel [Applause] I don't know what to say you're just gonna be my karma right now I'll die guys gonna be camping this is a thing yep how much so close if I didn't hit headshots there I was dead yeah 100% won that fight god that hurt who's using Sun mp7 it's like somebody's over this way I don't really want to take the roof fights avoid them as much as possible a me for the head is really saving me here you know in the fight and you know there by station I gotta go back for armor he must be in that building reaching clear hey listen if we die we die it happens is in the roof Sweeny at the top is their kiss oh my moment my moment my moment he's gonna stop flying before that wait you're alive oh I killed the other one I killed the guy in the heli with her oh my god that could have just got me killed I thought he'd be down here or something okay we need to go back to my station oh my word oh this is the truck that's very damaged so I'm not taking this I can stay there alright so the only tall building in is this one in this one movie otherwise we can take like one of these buildings we'll do our best and go for the victory now well I mean this guy's right here right might as well see what's going on I don't know this building [Music] okay we're just gonna back off there's no there's no reason to take that fight you won you won the engagement we're just up to heal up and rush a house now yeah it's not worth it it's not anything we'll deal with them later or he'll die to design something it's a buy station here there might even be a guy upstairs [Music] Oh still alive still alive running low on plates you that guy was really you had to start running over by now this is perfect perfect foot please okay there is a guy shoot I wasn't sure it like it looked like the head but I don't know I can't this is not gonna work mm its shoot not in a great spot well I'm in a good spot I just can't really call it in on them I'll just I'll wait till the Sun comes in a little bit more no oh [ __ ] he jumped into it he's a maniac luckily I was kind of scared when I opened that door [Applause] I'm still happy it's a guy in this place too he's got to go to the left right he's got to go to this window still got full plates we both gotta go where's that recon send it over enough alone not like I'm gonna need it it's a 1v1 we got it 22 hey maybe this gun isn't too bad after all we got the solo victory damn that was a quite a struggle there for a little while I feel bad for that one guy though I ran him over twice it in the same match solo match and I ran him over twice I'm sorry man I really do apologize I mean he he went back for his Luke right but he just oh the only thing he needed to do was not shoot at the vehicle just get on top of the dumpster and then they could have just he could have killed me 56k Wow you
