all right super store drops only let's do it this is where we're going all day every single drop superstore see how it is in solos i assume it's gonna be really campy it's one of those places you hear one footstep and then people just start hiding in dark corners they're just like that's it i am gonna wait here until the game is over okay what is this search grab this disgusting thing i'm wondering if they're gonna nerf it a little bit i hate to think that way because it's like it's a it's kind of what a shotgun should be right like it just destroys up close but maybe the nerf the damage range on or something he's above me there you are you have a heartbeat uh that's why oh no no no sounded like he was pinching one out or something jesus don't worry dude same thing's about to happen to me promise the nice thing about getting one of these right off the start is like no one has a no one has a cold blooded or ghost or whatever the heck you use for this counter this i don't even know what i'm going to use actually you know what i'm going to use the fin i really want to snipe but oh shoot grab the wrong overhead sorry dicey i actually grabbed you know what it's probably a good thing that i grabbed this i guess we'll just be a sweaty gamer today [Music] coming for you [ __ ] come on let's go come back what's your name d-man you come back [Music] set him up there it's a very bad idea no sweat oh boy i got the wheel get me out of here i got shotgun you kidding me who's locking onto me now jesus energy no no no no no no are you serious gas is closing in oh my goodness what are the chances ah worldly living this is the same guy he can't lock into me but he's gonna try to lock onto this guy but [Applause] coming back for me are you hey i'm down what is this video game that we're playing here good lord this is just an insane game everybody's after me after me lucky charms they got lock-on launchers they got shotguns returning to resupply he's bottom level oh i'm dead yeah the chances did he have me on heartbeat or was it it was just chance come oh he's cheating too he's cheating oh my god we could have beaten that guy too 100 if i peeked him first mp5 i think i could have beaten him [Music] or captured the objective what was this i thought he was like right in front of me there what are these sounds okay so we got a cheater in the lobby i don't remember his name which is unfortunate but maybe we can wait for our loadout contracts don't reset right like say i do a bunch of contracts then i die off entirely and then i complete another contract like i still gain the bonus from that right i think so oh yep that's uh that's how she goes is that the cheater from earlier i think it is yeah it is wow man the crazy thing is like he missed let's see let's see there's only 13 people left 12 actually i wonder if he's playing on consoles let's see if we can tell this is the thing i don't understand like there's no point in trying to hide it there's really no point in trying to hide if you're cheating if you're gonna cheat you might as well go all out because you're gonna get reported and it's gonna you're eventually gonna get banned like even people that aren't cheating and they're just good players get reported a bunch so you know if someone thinks you're suspicious they're just going to report you anyways turn them up man let's see them i want to see you beaming people out of the sky oh yeah there it is armor shot why are you using a car 98 that's what i'm curious about why not use like an ax 50 or an hdr look at him just lock through the tree so that's the thing is like there's bullet velocity and car 98 doesn't have the greatest damage at range i think he hold it in himself he's just aiming what are you afraid of oh my god oh do you see him is he up there there you go nice little miss see that's why i don't use a car 98 he's he's got to be a newbie cheater that's why that's what it is here miss oh nice little lock on yeah you didn't see that guy though did you oh my god this is so sad oh yeah that's that's the guy you're aiming at right not the guy behind the pillar there closer to the wall he'll kill these guys coming in this is just so sad i don't see this is the this is the thing i don't understand how is this fun if you're gonna cheat don't try to hide it full-on cheat there's no point go for the kills do it do what you're gonna do is there's a guy behind that mountain is already did he just lock onto somebody oh yeah you see him oh yeah accidental lock to the guy yeah that's not the guy you want to shoot but can't help it right there you go see if you died your own cluster strike man oh my goodness guys guys just cluster mcgee huh there you go nice little lock on he's just good man i gotta figure out what gaming cherry's using i think he's on console i'm almost 100 sure thank you do this come on right click left click dead there it is there it is finally come on let's see some good cheating action or is the guy have a ride shield wait he can actually win no don't do it don't do it he could have beat him 100 this guy with the right shield could have won if he just held it but i guess he didn't know he was a cheater that's so sad i would have loved to see him go out with just getting meleed by a riot shield he didn't have any utility or anything so he could have just sprinted right at him oh this is not a great gun to have hi hi okay time to be a sweaty gamer again wait a minute we have three guys over here i don't have a shotgun so it's not like i can win this fight by one popping somebody it's got you covered nice little easy double i'm dead wait wait see a paid actor what's happening here why didn't he wait does he i don't understand i i don't understand why didn't you just come run at me and finish me off did he think i was just going to give up or something i am so confused with solos right now it makes zero sense god this kilo is just so reliable right now that fin guns pretty insane as well he's not the trailer he's at the next building his second floor wait for it wait for it wait for it wait for it enemy uav overhead hello sneaky see if anybody's around us i don't really care about ghosts it's not a big deal i'll go get it if i absolutely need to i don't think there's a guy back on the roof is there a small cow cancel that no it's a dead body there we go reposition a little bit he should have shot me as soon as soon as he saw me coming up on the quad there he just waited a little too long this kilo is just it's so good right now i understand why everyone's using it oh there's a guy down there to the left he's gonna be pressed by the zone start right there jesus sneaky bugger i almost if i didn't have the trophy system on there i was dead easy easily um what just happened did he just thermite himself we got recon online this is [ __ ] good uav beginning he's got a shotgun i don't know if i want to mess with that i need reconnaissance the vehicles not drive straight anymore is this just uav is out of fuel returning to resupply i can just wait him out you're losing ground [Music] found you you did that to yourself i just yeah nope let's keep moving oh shoot okay this guy i'm a little bit more comfortable pushing chances are he's got an mp5 if i had to guess he has something like an mp5 because he's got a sniper what the frick please be nobody in this building oh shoot cheater possibly you think no because he missed the one shot it's the same guy it is the exact same guy that killed me last game it is the cheater and that c4 should not have killed me that was on the edge of the wall i'm being bullied i'm being literally cyber bullied by a cheater okay okay here we go there's no way i can beat him because i don't have a shotgun loadout but we have to we have to find where he is could uh i suppose i could out snipe him he's not peeking me so i don't know i can't like there's only so much i can do where is it i don't want to use car 98 i got to out sniping with like an hdr or something wait how did you get there so fast activision you guys got to do something about the cheaters it's getting out of hand oh well looks like he still hasn't learned though he's still using the car 98 supposed to report him again but it's not gonna do anything you
