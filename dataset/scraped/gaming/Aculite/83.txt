245 243 on it let's see oh no i'm missing the tower it definitely is definitely like 245. it'll look like it but you might oh you need to correct yourself yeah i need to correct myself push me you might be able to yeah i don't think you can correct yourself because every time i move your computer no i'm not making it dude maybe i can push him i did it ah this emoji does it oh no no wait you got it i got it yes i corrected myself i corrected myself hell yeah that's crazy yeah baby this bad boy is the sa-87 now normally i don't really post gun loadout videos i kind of just show some gameplay because most of the time i feel like i'm behind the curve everyone's already seen the loadout or they already know that this gun's good or this gun's bad or whatever but recently there's been a lot of updates from warzone and they seem to be balancing a lot of the weapons which is so fantastic to see because having one gun in the game is just really boring there's no reason to use anything else everyone's always using the exact same thing and it's become a very repetitive experience and that's why i love to see such variation now as i was mentioning before normally i am not in the know but it seems to me that this is one of the most underrated weapons in the game currently mind you it is an lmg so it does have some pretty slow ads speed as well as the reloads not amazing but it does come with 60 rounds you can throw a 60 round on there and it has fantastic recoil control and damage at range the only downside i've seen so far is your movement speed the ads time and if you don't have great accuracy you miss a couple bullets since it fires so slow there's a very good chance that you are gonna lose out on most fights so if you can hit the first shot and you can kind of predict and play a little bit safer on where people are and it tends to be a pretty good weapon so if you're going to use this make sure you don't get caught out around corners and make sure nobody's rushing you with an smg which is why i'm using the lc10 that thing shreds up close it's pretty decent at range as well thanks man he said nice nade it's like the first guy i've ever killed in plunder that actually gave a compliment unreal if you really want to know how to level up your weapons fast go to plunder go to storage town and murder everybody that you see it's essentially how i do it takes me about an hour and a half depending on the weapon but i found that's pretty much the best way to level things up also if you're interested in the lc10 build i will show that on the screen as well just have a little highlight game to show you guys hope you guys enjoy appreciate you watching i'll catch you guys in the next one they're fighting they're fighting at the police station at the hilo okay
