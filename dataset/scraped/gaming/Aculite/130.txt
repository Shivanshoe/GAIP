moisture wicking technology that's what this outfit is beauty all see you guys this is the true you guys are all tryhards yeah oh sh should i go try hard no no no you shouldn't you got to keep it consistent did i just live my best life actually all right i like you man be who you are man thank you man thank you okay wait wait hold it we gotta go back a second cuz no one's gonna understand what the hell is going on right now so let me explain before this video officially starts stone mountain who's gonna be my partner in this tournament asked me to play in vic stars tourney now if you're familiar with the war zone scene or the call of duty scene you'll recognize a lot of the guys that are we're going up against and how this works is we play duos in quads so we actually partner up with the other teams that we're going up against and we all play quads but we are fighting against one another for kills now since you're immediately in the winner's bracket you play two games up against this team and the kills combined will obviously allow you to win or lose if you lose you go into the losers bracket and then you fight one team if you lose that you're done otherwise you continue on and you can fight your way back to the winner's bracket without spoiling it it's gonna be quite a long video so i'll hush now and allow you guys to watch it hope you guys enjoy please feel free to leave a like if you did and i'll catch you guys at the end of the video i want clean gameplay good comms we're playing right through the window fall damage right away no no no no no no okay i still want us to play a regular game no that is a regular game what do you mean no waiting okay listen slightly irregular but still regular how about that compromise all right all right no no dying to fall damage off the rip no purposefully throwing gotcha yes no purposely no purpose free throwing holy seriously who invited us dude no making we got to make not content decisions we need to make gameplay decisions all right so we are going through the window right we're going through the we're going to risk it all these guys are definitely going super i can already smell the super on them yeah but if they die right at the start then you know oh there's one let's start for us good start for us here we go you get sent to the gulag then you know i got a gun oh he pulls a stone damn i don't think you get the kill for that then it was your roof yeah yeah yep broke them down already that was rough that's what i go for getting the finish dude i had a feeling i had a feeling did you get the finish i got two finishes but i only got one kill oh god i'm in his ghoulie voice up voice him in game bank right set it up [Music] let's go aculite footsteps aside he's coming up i know what just happened wait fire sale buy me back oh no oh my god oh actually why'd we have to go down so early why do we have to go down so early bro it's okay why do we have to go down so early oh you never know dude this could be it right here this might be it they're dead unless he can sell he got himself off pros got himself he's done he's going for a huge close one hp oh we're still in this game acolyte we're still taking a screenshot you think they're a little nervous i don't know if it was nerves i definitely like whoever i was spectating was shooting and then he went for a drop shot and meleed at the same time while he was still like 30 meters away so he might be nervous he might be nervous he might be nervous listen i mean i'm a little he's going up against us okay there's nothing to be nervous about what does that mean we got last place last time we did this i've partnered with a guy who's known to die to fall damage okay i got a bush i got a bush to back me up oh okay what are you gonna bounce off the ground then is that yes okay no fault they should make them they should literally make a michelin man outfit specifically for you and you can't die to fall damage apparently if you land in a trash can it doesn't give you fall damage i feel like that's just gonna be a meme and people are just be like hot you're trash dude as soon as you land i wish i hear shots like over this way one just jumped in right here ahead he's going into the window other side do you want to cut him off jumping i'm jumping in a second bar ether mine in the back there's three of them there they're very hurt [ __ ] i just mollied myself i gotta heal down shotgun armor hits on it nice one more keep fighting no no no you're good sit tight stairs through the stairs your teammate is right there's a guy still there [Music] big window big window above you broke broke okay moving another one right ahead of me right ahead of me knocked out downstairs plating i don't have plates plates right here there we go

for boss negative i don't think we do yeah no who cares dude the thing is if we get a firefight here we're gonna get held from the next team a hundred percent yeah but all we have to do is beat them in kills if they die one's pushing wooden's pushing close towards them we could pinch these guys no no i think we could do it yeah okay let's do it that's it oh this side i just saw moving towards attack zones pushing here zone three these high threats still yeah okay you watch there i'll watch the front he's got loot i want yeah this guy's a satchel too if we can wipe them real quick then we're fine instant on this guy okay oh i see him silos yellow he's crossing he's crossing he sees those two there three three one farther back gas is closing get to the new safe zone i can't get on

to disengage it the timing dude huskers save us [Applause] i think i do yeah oh that's our luck we had to do it we had to do it to disengage from the other team we didn't really have a choice our trophy vehicle got blown already mm-hmm there's just i think that oh i don't have that's it well they're outs too well we had more kills we're up by three wait are you seeing that oh a hat inside the

spoiler [Applause] we should stick together i'm coming back oh he's on the exterior here team wipe nice see what i mean about quads man yeah doesn't make any sense i have no idea well now we kind of hunt uh generally like this is okay so this is normally a row we drop here then we go twins area and then we push over close towards super because that's generally where the did we just hear explosions behind us yeah do we care to go for that though because we're gonna have to um we can go to twins let's just grab some loot there i think another one just pushed it off another one just parachute 100 stairs going up contact two one's on this roof down nice we should push the stairs roof down pushing stairs okay you rest here but i got eod you got a ud i do we play this right take

opposite side we could take i have a trophy there you go double troph because i think people are fighting here yeah there are twins i just seen it dude we want it that's unfortunate that that's like that's rough that's exactly what we're feeling all day though yeah that's what i mean any anything can happen anything can happen man you get unfortunate off the rip and then unfortunately in the gulag it's like it's hard in battle royales yeah it's it's just completely random it truly is war zone especially battle royales in general it's just they're completely unpredictable but anyways thank you guys very much for watching the next three games that we played we lost so we lost the first game we lost the second then we went to the losers bracket and lost there as well three in a row it was a lot of fun and i wish i could show you guys all the games but i figured i'd condense the video to what it is rather than having it be an hour and a half long please feel free to leave a like if you did enjoy the video and i'll catch you guys in the next one
