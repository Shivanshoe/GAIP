[Music] ugh [Music] uh [Music] ugh okay we got the bow so glad that they added this i didn't think that they would considering they already have a crossbow in the game it's nice though because it's super quiet you can aim down sights with it it's got like this little it's like a nail and if you miss you can obviously go pick up your arrows again which is awesome you can do the same thing with a crossbow well the thing i love the most i think is that if you hit somebody the arrow will still stick out of the body so you can see exactly where you hit them what's that yeah there is a guy over there it's hard to tell sometimes like you can't tell the difference between a zombie walking or player walking least i can't how's he not dead okay where's the other guy he must be yeah he's getting chased by the zombie a husk see it's so quiet they have no idea where it's coming from only if i hit them and they'll know that like the hit marker direction i don't know where i knocked him i think it's right there see if we can force his teammate out it might be up in the tree line there it's a waiting game now this is kind of how people play it from what i've noticed anyways if i push out or die i suppose i could go for the bounty but i'm kind of curious um got him with the bleeding how long did that take that took let me see i was about a six minute wait like i waited that's crazy i was just kind of curious for myself that's why i wanted to wait they're coming in where is that is that the next building over no i saw him over there i heard somebody in the next building too [Music] does he see me no way i set up a couple traps at the so i don't know if i can bait them in then and they run over them they should die yeah i swear there's somebody in that building i got that guy so there is another team he's definitely hurting after that one see the only bad thing i've noticed about the arrows is one you don't get a lot of them i guess i guess two things then second thing is you can't wallbang people so if they're bleeding they go by and cover kinda have to pull the pistol almost got me is that it i wonder it does appear that that is it check again near the exit but uh i think there's one over here actually yeah it looks like that's it at least there's no one on this side of the map or close to me because there's a lot of shots on the opposite side when i was coming over here i suppose everybody die off that's a great round sneaking up sneaking up [Music] he has no idea oh my god i love the ball already it's only been a few games [Music] oh it hits the oh we got him anyways it's the barbed wire it's unfortunate nice shot see this is what happens with only one boss everyone just converges on the same spot it's great hmm [Music] what a fight i don't know how many people just died that was like at least three teams yeah okay so we got two more guys coming yeah let's just leave there's only one bounty might as well might as well let them get one i think that's probably the last team there's so much fighting around that compound i'm so glad that they added this is what this game needed another stealth weapon [Music] you
