[Music] [Music] we already got a keycard so we just head right over there after this thank you [ __ ] what is this it's like a growl or something strange sorry man okay can grab this vehicle and head over to last part of the contract and since we have a keycard we should be able to open one of the gates hoping this game goes well because I still have yet to open one of these interesting Spallone okay I know are one of them is one of them's up near damn it's a little bit far as far as I know though that's the only one I can really like roughly right around here to see if we can check that out [Music] let's see if it works see this is really cool I like this and then we go down in this is really cool I'm so glad that they've done this got here got stopping power cuz I don't wanna use that just yet get one of those mmm well I suppose we can grab that pop no he's just really quickly make sure nobody's near us holy money good lord I suppose we can pop this now I don't really want to use it right now so we come up against somebody it's kind of open for the grenade launcher oh that is really cool I do like that okay integrated monolithic suppressor into the barrel I want to try this thing out I was shown that you don't really lose much range and damage with it and all that so you're why not give it a shot [Music] and then the same levels we go just in time when of this guy when he got his his loadout okay so there's a guy at the other vehicle over there what I should do is I should go and get my ghost loadout I'm gonna do that because I could definitely use that these guys here we got two over there we can wait for these guys let's do that I think I just seen him gonna be climbing up the roadside on the left I don't know the lead on this it's been so long since I've used it oh okay I think he got inside I can't actually kill him oh you're mine see behind he's got to be behind something that's just not rendering in right like I'm not crazy so Louis is so different the whole like aura the feeling of it is just so different squads is the almost complete chaos this is completely different I see yeah I have no idea where this guy's gone we got to go over to storage town waiting for me huh nice seat well good tell me a lie surprise there a little bit all good though I knew I heard you running probably shouldn't make the assumption that he's the only guy in this building that you never know somebody's up that hill right like I got to make my way up there regardless that's where it's gonna be ending I just don't to give up my cover before without spotting somebody 13 12 people left what the hell I need to keep a vehicle from for the last zones definitely that needs to start becoming a thing for me oh my god I knew something moved I thought it was a shadow this is so bad this game I'm gonna have nightmares or SOLAS not the truck not the truck not the truck another truck I need to work the complete edge this is the line okay if somebody died right here I think I just seen somebody down there this game is a hot it's a game of hide and seek with horror aspects I didn't see him till last I can hold my lord this is oh my it really is it's a terrifying experience okay since I eliminated visca I want to make the assumption that there's nobody else over here simply because if there was they probably would have shot at them but I mean half the guys that have shot at now we're just sitting behind trees and they don't shoot at anybody how many we got we got three left one or two in the bunker if I run down to the bunker now you can't do that forever you can't drive around forever oh one on the left side of K we saw one I don't know if this is a bunker I think I'm looking from here so give me a quick second so I can move its 1v1 oh my god I almost cut myself that he's gonna have to move before I do and we got one hell yeah this combo seemed to work not too bad either then I really have to use the sniper all that much but it worked and a win is a win they'll take it 10 kills 3400 damage not too bad the game plays it plays so eerie it's gotta be like one of the scariest experiences so I understand why people they hide a lot and they don't want to move it's because they get that fear in them it's like oh my god there can be a guy around this core be a guy around this corner I used to get the similar a similar experience in pub G but this is a I don't know what it is but caught it so it feels a little bit different [Music] you
