it i missed the early days of this game i really do yeah it's so fun just learning everything i i it's like it happens with every battle royale though right like the metas just fall into place over time because people start learning yeah yeah imagine if there was no meta it would be interesting do you think people would still play uh huh yeah absolutely i think uh if they i think they need to go and buff a lot of the bad guns just give like a just a bunch of buffs out to like most of the [ __ ] weapons yeah but they're not going to do that but it would be so good all right gents zone is coming in ready for the uav [Music] [Applause] oh my god i got him no way no [Music] oh come on one's on this side on green side just jumped inside let's just direct them back to them relocating
