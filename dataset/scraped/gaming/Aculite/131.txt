[Music] okay we got two dead [Music] so oh we got him with the earth can't believe that hit him welcome to spell break now i've been playing this for a little bit now and i wanted to actually show you guys a video of this because i've been having a lot of fun on this now this video is not sponsored whatsoever i just figured i would show you guys or explain a little bit of the gameplay and what the game is all about beforehand so you have a little bit of an understanding of what's going on here if you haven't seen it before so what is it essentially it's a just a mage battle royale which i think is pretty sick so when it comes down to it you have a bunch of gauntlets that you can use you obviously have to choose your main gauntlet ahead of time which has been changed since the alpha which was the very last time that i played this so i needed a little bit of practice before i could start getting any decent or any further in the game and believe me i was getting destroyed off the start it was a little frustrating so there's quite a few gauntlets that you can use i'm going to be using frostborn which is allows you to snipe people with ice shards and allows you to skate on the ice when you shoot those ice shards which is a lot of fun you'll see in the video but it pretty much has all the elements that you would expect wind fire toxic you want to shoot some poison at some people earth which is another one of my favorites and then you have lightning of course so each of these all come with an ability an on-usability as well and you also have these talents that you can select beforehand now the second gauntlet that you can pick up which is like your offhand also comes with an ability but your main gauntlet can only be leveled up when you go inside the next zone so you get some traits on that and you can also upgrade these gauntlets throughout the game as long as you find a better rarity type these are the talents that i'm going to be using runic fluency fervor for faster casting speed casting speed on the ice gauntlet so i can charge up those ice shards a little bit faster and you can see the skills that the ice gauntlet comes with on the right hand side there if you guys enjoy the video please feel free to leave a like thank you very much for watching and i'll catch you guys in the next one the music's always so peaceful before you hit the ground you don't realize that somebody's landing right beside you oh i got a scroll officer there we go so that levels up your talents that you've chosen big armor pot that's good to find i need to find myself a belt so i can have some armor in the beginning i was having a very tough time finding some potions because like i swear i was taking all the damage in the world but now it doesn't seem to be too bad oh there we go purple belt i think the maximum you can have is a hundred hundred armor hundred armor and hundred health did he block that he's got the flight rune allows you to take off like superman yep there it is it makes you so much harder to hit man okay looks like he's running i should be able to catch up to him this is so sick this has to be like 50 of the fun from the frost gauntlet just being able to skate on the ice okay this may go poorly yep i am in a bad spot god that guy was a slippery one i think that was the first guy i was fighting yeah because he had the flight room look how hard that hits it hits so hard one down see if i hit this guy's fireball midair with my ice chart it it will stop it this lightning is really difficult to use i found that wind and lightning are pretty difficult because you kind of have to you have to be very good at tracking please die please die okay it's only first zone this won't hurt too much damn he's putting up a fight i just couldn't hit that extra like 10 hp of them okay so i should get my hover perk now there it is or skill rather so now every time i charge this up i can hover in the air for i think i think it's about like five seconds she's everybody here this is the thing about solos like it's third party heaven oh god with the lightning strike gotta be careful that other guy now i don't know if i've mentioned this already you can combo things together so like yeah there is another poison user i hate poison users man it stuns you for a quick second it drops a puddle below you it's rough okay i gotta get it i gotta get out of here this guy's gonna yeah he's gonna destroy me so for example like if i get an earth gauntlet or that guy's just poison or whatever he can chuck down like a giant poison ball and then somebody can electrify it with just like a normal lightning attack so stuff like that can be partnered together this guy's got earth as well was a good hit nice see if he sees me oh no oh he knows it was too obvious nice it was a decent match got like six kills there was just non-stop fighting there i gotta keep my distance from this guy because he's got poison oh no okay so like example right there from what i was saying last game so he checked down his poison bomb and then i set it on fire and it killed him oh hit him right in the head and he's got invisibility yeah i see you i see you jesus god is so difficult to see when when people pop and biz uh oh time to get out you might catch me here i feel like frozone from the incredibles can't catch me might have lost them should get enough stuff off here to at least fight him okay so he's wind and earth oh my lord that hurt jeez man oh my god i got it what is that i didn't have any more mouse pad left that was it that was the max range of my mousepad if i didn't hit that i was dead what a fight he was good at wind i suck at wind he hit me with so much stuff there looks like there's fighting over here oh if i had to charge that up a little bit more i would have killed him with that second shot ow you just chuck a boulder at me okay so earth users you don't want to be near the ground because the majority of their damage just comes from the ground and pound so as long as i stay in the air which is pretty much what my whole ability setup is used for oh oh there it is okay i get it you want me dead i understand where to go charge it up nice little 84. pyro hurts as well everything just hurts so much in this game if you can hit it i find fire the hardest to use though overall just because the fireballs travel so slow legendary amulet and belt sign me up this is gonna get out of control still six people left nice i'm starting to get the hang of frost a little bit better at the beginning i couldn't hit anything oh that is so satisfying this is why i love frost doing stuff like that sniped them okay 1v1 v1 i don't know what this other guy is this may be an issue zone's pretty small damn nice hit come on one hit there we go okay i need to heal up and then oh he was low that's it we got the victory not bad at all 1700 damage i think that's like one of the highest i've done 10 kills it's like those ending circles it's just non-stop action just player after player i love frost though that's so much fun you
