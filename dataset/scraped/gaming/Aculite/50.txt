i got it though beat his ass beat his ass what's going on another one behind me i'm stuck i'll move [Music] so much more intense than it needed to be [Music] so if you've been out of the loop for a little while or perhaps you've been taking a break from warzone this is their new mode iron trials 84. now the last time i played this was my very first experience and since it's only a duo's mode we decided to have at it again and to be honest i think i'm starting to like this mode a little bit better than the normal version of warzone and the reason because of that is everything is a little bit more serious shots matter fights matter and your decisions overall matter more it feels somewhat more rewarding to get a win or even make it to late game than it normally does in the regular mode now if you have been taking a break from warzone or perhaps you just missed out on the details of this mode i won't go through everything since there is a lot of changes but basically everyone has more health it takes longer for your health to start regening as well as regening back up to full loadouts cost 15 000 and there's no free loadouts so combining all that as well as some other things teamwork really matters so i got a couple games to show you with stone mountain 64. i thought we had some great games and communication if you guys do enjoy the video please leave a like and i'll catch you guys in the next one quick fix yeah okay so i'm doing quick fix stim uh i'm gonna try a pharah and the otis i don't have the otis unlocked though the ots whatever the heck oh okay i was like what is an otis i literally need two more kills rapidly within yeah two two more kills rapidly with an smg and i unlock it but then i could probably start using it full time because this is not like it but one of the best ones right now um it was they just nerfed it it's still pretty good it's still pretty good one though okay i just nerfed the bullfrog a little bit as well that seemed to be the most popular one people were using but they changed that one to um yeah they decreased some of the mobility not much one two percent nerfed the mobility and decreased the ads speed on it as well okay one jumping off towards you oh he got me got him thank you thank you thank you you spawn with a sledgehammer too should be a guy ahead of us dropping a plate for you you just came through that door saved your ass beautiful gameplay coming in from stone i'm out of a plate now i got one ahead of you crackdown no what just happened just dash right through the wall [Applause] you can buy specialist bonus now too what how much is that 45 000 dude who has 45 000. that's that's with the discount of the buy station too almost 50. that is insane um i'd say let's get double self self-resist do we have enough yeah you should have your discount we should still have our discounts okay so friends there we go oh one pack of train i only had 100 left man oh shoot maybe it ate your um free station crack don't we should get this finish i think it's actually nice that only one of us has a sniper as well like the duo sniper is still really good but yeah i'll have to just pepper him a few times and he's just dead yep yep all right what's the plan here you said you want to go top i don't have a snipe so okay i can partially help you [Music] this is so much better in the bike yeah you know what let's keep up here because if we go top bridge and there is somebody up here we're screwed yeah oh god parachuting in right up ahead another couple hundred meters up hill here someone raised behind us maybe that's him maybe there's no real point to dive anywhere because there's no free loadouts yeah it looks like he dove here oh running around there he's partially in under here yeah i headshot this guy under here he's gonna be at least down three plates we have nexon he's in a very bad position yep here's where we mounted it that was another guy over there that you just need to land one or two easy ones on them we do love that only four other team shots up ahead of us here perfect zone here i also may have seen something earlier over here yeah he's behind the rock there going for the bike there is a guy there is a guy on this thing somewhere some saw some sort of movement hit flashstack flashback on this guy beam it come on nice down the other guy's there [Music] big crack big crack he's cracked out of his mind this guy is fully cracked out of his mind cancel that all right again is two other teams one's under the bridge one unaccounted for my guesses is somewhere over there there he is never mind bingo other guys to the right of that guy i'm going downhill a bit i'm gonna need some sniper ram i can give you all my ar as well yeah i got 32 snipe he's still in on that damn zone though so he's not moving at all this guy's peppering oh i'm getting pepper from the left now crack the left guy big crack on the shack okay i got no visual he's moving moving far left broke him downhill guys pepperon big headshot low hill [Applause] the other guys fighting them all right low hills dead crack them behind rock other guys further on down on blue we're gonna have to move crack the close rock he's unscrewing me with the they're pretty pre-emptive air striking careful i'm pushing far down left he's moving left he's moving towards left left of orange mark last seen i'm gonna get a replay so we can find his rock here he's very good very good going for cross angle take your time double centex on that mark broke him broke him pushing flank good teamwork just outplayed it comes that's solo if he would have pressured us more early on that might have been bad yeah that's why i was so scared yeah because if he had a sniper could have been really bad take us out with two hits we were completely exposed to his angle it sucks not getting the one tap when you head shot him but it's still so much pressure like they have to stop and wait for their health regen and they got to get three plates so it takes them a long time to get back into the fight and if they re-pick if they repeat that right they're risking that down yeah yep because if i get a head shot again even if they replay i if i think if they don't wait for the health regen i can still get them it's a cool mode it is a cool mode okay i'm coming up next one's up on roof here guy on pulsar falls broke him knock knock knock do you have any plates by any chance uh no i don't have any okay [Applause] gotta throw my oh there's a guy up here any second i'm coming i'm coming crack them watch the top watch the tub [Applause] in your area hope nobody comes up here with me [Music] yeah you guys you got to deal with that lady dover's done this is bad yeah i should just keep running sort them out or capture the objective man it is rough to find money this is real safe zone life thank you there's a guy here somewhere hi he's a gas station two of them too hey i'm gonna get some money on roof here oh i like this oh i like this that mg's not bad at all is this first zone the second zone where would they be i cracked them up they're over at fire there's a quad coming where'd the other guys go then that i cannot tell you my friend there they are there they are at the bike that i can't tell you my friend cracked one don't beauty both beauty both knocked [Music] are we gonna get this scav i got a uav off the first guy you killed though oh sick okay there's a ladder at the back side of this building okay you wanna try snagging it will i reload my way mg i'm dying uh oh he's in your build kind of a new yeah yeah yeah i'll be able to get an angle in a second here grab this he's behind the staircase he's going over to the middle here i think over by blue standby for coordinates okay yeah he's jumping

a lot of people here brother why is there so many this guy's down here i don't know much money i had but i had some money all right wait for your health to reject give it about 15 minutes you'll be full health again i shouldn't have been flighted thank you thank you is there any guns inside by any chance there's another contract in there yeah there's guns there but i don't think you'll be able to make it i can't even make it to go get finish our contract dude well then i'm just gonna float yeah i just flowed it first guy got beamed whatever yeah he's down this first guy dipped in pd i'm going for this there's there's guns here if you can make it quick [Music] go to dota zone anyways i'm going to buy plates i'm going to buy plates i might want to buy a uav or something sick of my plates uh it's too much expensive i'm gonna buy more plates here okay now even with that because it's in the tower in the tower in the tower the squash just crossed we're goaded we dodged these i think he has a bad sniper and also a burst rifle slide it slide it slide it slide he just rpg himself no he jumped off he jumped off okay big big roof english is tough right now broke him smoke there yeah i'll take that he's over here where the buy would be or where the buy is broke jesus rose skins are tough just one oh come on if i do team wipes another one to our left as well here though he's owning me find the truck broke one one another one behind the truck asking careful i'm pushing back because i i lost my advantage okay grabbing this guy's stuff satchel here he's still playing the truck maybe he's in the ground i'm coming over okay i'm gonna have to smoke us so we can cross we need a cross we need to rotate i probably just drew attention to this hey guys we're crossing over here please don't shoot he's gonna be in one of these bushes here yep you just know it he's ratting nice little comeback so far yeah i mean okay we're safe right here behind you he's sneaking oh there he is we found him there he is aguila i told you he was red oh yeah oh we have big money big money big money we could get a load out with that we definitely could i'm gonna go wanna get low down over on the left here get a really good pharah i don't know if you want that well if we get load out i'm going to get my sniper and keep this smg i think this is going to be enough time i think so it does move a little faster in this mode though [Music] he's one he's actually one [Applause] he's running behind me i have a mask i didn't get him i didn't get him oh he just died his own plus he died of gas it was that one i think i hit him through the once for one through the wall for one tick too it's probably just enough the health regen probably ruined him right so yeah he couldn't regen he didn't have a stem we're in we are in yeah shots over there there was the drone oh decoy decoy that's a decoy on the road over here come on come on man super beam dash ash give him the beam another one over there too we could just push them out no let's wait them out let's wait them out yeah they're gonna be scared yeah we didn't get zone here either though no but they're gonna have to cross first front door for a sec true they're getting held from the right side as well they're gonna be dead yeah as long as no one pushes us from uphill good knock good knock he's like everybody's looking at us it's true man you're looking tasty that is true good shot you guys are dog thank you [Applause] love tempered though someone's got a crosstalk two other teams explosive crossbow well they're fighting dead wait for zone i'm not going to peek here head upper window right side yet rpg we got zone pull dumped out left side flash tags on him i'm double semtex in the back here he's got crossbow the other one jumped out just now crossing broken very hurt very down got your finish back fence is hurt i'm gonna push this while he's flesh got him nice big send hey i can't believe we came back from that that was that was a you winning the gulag is what cam has been came back there right was that it was that the game i think i think so i think he won the gulag and we came back from that oh yeah you're right because i dropped back it back in on the contract yeah i like that about this mode is like you have to work as a team because 1vx is just it's so tough you can do it but if they're working as a team if they're if they're not coordinated enough you can get the 1vx yeah like even just you know you got that base level of coordination you're gonna pull it up [Music] you
