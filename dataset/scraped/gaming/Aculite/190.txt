[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay if memory serves correct should be a secret stash up here yeah there it's okay all right so we're on shoreline I have a couple tasks to do here one of them I just have to wasn't much in that one of them I have to just kill scabs with a suppressor on my eight are here which is my weapon Ally Adar and then I think the other one I have to go into the resort area yeah so this one's third floor in the computer room I think I have one of the keys because one of them leads over to the other one the rooms connect together you know I always say this but this game looks so much better with no visor on I think that's why it like I have to stop using visors or at least I should lift them up and down while I'm playing on these longer and longer range maps you can't really see much okay I definitely should take in a different way up there's easier ways up than this game does it does look so it looks great the visor adds that blur effect and like smudges and whatnot so it doesn't look at that great all right what do we got in here uh a pistola very good Owen one of my last videos I got a lot of questions with the red laser is or the little red the light on the wall it's my laser is just set to infrared it increases your point firing accuracy it's good for me but it's also bad for me because the laser will show up like where your bullets will essentially go right but I have to kind of judge it okay 308 I believe I have and it's already open so there's something in this room that I need check that for now for my task just gonna pick it up and then I gotta extract with it if I die though whenever I get this I really sure where it is yet once I pick it up if I die we thought I'm gonna have to come back in here and pick it up again take the hard drive to those hard drives trade trade 460 around her she's pretty nice alright two of those trades for a sixty router and so what am i gene there's something in here where is it Oh money that's good here it is this is it okay now we just need to not die that's easy that's back up it Resort that's wait house wait another secret stash here no way oh not so secret anymore get my hydration back up if you like you almost need to carry around liquids or some food or something on this map because it's just so large if you ever get a black doe stomach you lose hydration and foods so fast your energy like this another secret stash over here somewhere I remember looting one I just don't remember where it was eluding the cabinets you're losing the cabinet still No we got a runner something I've learned it's never to peek from up hill like this I'm gonna try to work my way around your just easy headshot bait if you peek from up above like that did he run further down late at the forest nope he's dead okay we got him I must have got him with the nade because I don't think the little single shots that are got him all right donates SKS okay I don't understand that he has he has a decent weapon maybe he's got BP rounds which is like the best penetration rounds but he has the Zack armor which and it's a full and 75 like a full one it goes for about 300 25k roubles but he only has a giver home I'm a little confused I suppose it does weird or things it's fine I guess my first shot didn't hit him in the head I must've hit him in the chest with the very first shot or like the neck area I don't know cuz it doesn't look like I damaged its home that's all I can take gas cans are worth quite a bit I heard some shots down a gas station here it's kind of hoping there wasn't anybody down here because then I could just farm the scabs for a bit and complete my task might have to start using the SKS for range oh no they're going away I might be able to catch up to them I don't know Jesus I bet you they're gonna run up there [ __ ] a lot I might have lost them that's a player dead oh there they are they're up to the left yeah they're going to push the power plant looks like okay I may have lost them if they're not over the cell I don't know where they went oh there's one yeah all right head shots only I believe there's only two the only thing I have to be careful of is where are the other shots were because these guys were they were definitely looking for the other guys see this backpack comes in handy it's a lot of stuff that's a grenade what's the Chuck and grenade in there for oh you know what maybe he thinks I'm in there just heard the shots trying to get the high ground maybe I don't see him unless he was like grenading a scav down there I really don't know Jesus he sees me oh this is not a good situation I don't like this I think he's shooting at me I don't know for sure I'm gonna back off I don't want to be stuck in between these guys but I do need some of this loot what the hell is going on okay one office all right I can hear them running Oh okay so two on the right this guy hey quiet down over there would ya my gosh okay there was two on the right and they were fighting so I don't know I'm assuming one of them died so whoever this last guy is on the right he should be the last one hopefully there he is that purple pilgrim backpack stands out so much he's creeping Oh No okay we got him I think we got him I'm pretty sure that went right through his head the first or the second shot those are those are pretty close at least for good measure yeah okay so this was the first guy that was fighting we got this guy too and then I shot the guy up in the cliffside here what a strange engagement okay I don't have enough time I gotta go there's only ten minutes left and it takes me like five minutes to get across the map to extract it do my best here for the mat time I have there's so much loot like I still gotta loot the other two guys okay I don't really care about that that a little bit of bad except ssin seven minutes left oh no I'm gonna have to be really quick okay we got some room in there fill this up put this on the a kay that head said I'm wearing that one goes for quite a bit right now I don't know what's going on with the market I guess cuz of all many players goes for like 40 K okay that's good I'll show you let me see what he's got a bag IFAC ibuprofen okay there with a mag I don't really have time to be picky I gotta go six minutes left no I got to keep my armor okay last guy and then we can head out shoot to make this a 1 slot so what I'm doing right now I'm just kind of taking the attachments off guns and stuff and like the mags cuz ammo costs quite a bit sixty writers cost quite a bit helmets pretty much attachments in general we gotta go though that's that's all I can do I can't really be picky and choosey only got five minutes left to make it through the other side most long as there's nobody camping this it's happened a couple times now people love to camp the extracts I don't know why because it's easy gear I think we're good I suppose I kind of stayed for like a minute extra but that's cutting it a little bit close I wanted to make sure well we made it out oh yeah 10k XP and I caught it I get mainly got it just killing was it five people mainly headshots to see that's what I like about using the aid are the Adar is a lot of fun for that reason just a semi-automatic he'd go in just aim for the head make them count alright ages later and we're finally done solving everything it takes a long time to sort through the UI a lot of the times trying to get a little bit quicker with it I think after the stuff in the flea market cells and all that should be roughly about 700 K 700 K true bull run it's not bad at all plus we got the tasks done l yeah you
