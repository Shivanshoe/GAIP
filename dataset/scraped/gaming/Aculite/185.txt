[Music] season two is finally here sweet finally I'm gonna be playing some rust and I already have the the newest weapon the growl maxed out but this will be amusing in the video and I figured I'd show you guys ahead of time what I was gonna be using I've been messing around with it since this is actually quite a good to set up here if you guys want to copy this 50 rounders I suppose it depends on which map you're gonna be playing but this I found like for rust and some mid-range Maps this is probably a pretty decent setup it's kind of mimicked to an m4 but you can also make it like an SMG if you want to use if you want to use this little stubby thing here you could use 50 rounders whatever you want that's what I like about this cod is you can always met you can mess around with so much in here there's a lot of customization which is really nice but I'm not using any barrels can use whatever site you want I think I was using the tactical suppressor at the time as well as sleight of hand so this is what my setup was in the video I didn't use a laser or anything like that I didn't feel the need to even use an under barrel a grip whatsoever but this is what I'm gonna be using enjoy ten minutes of rust modern day a modern warfare rust who would have thunk it I never would have thought but here it is all right we got some domination so that at least this game is gonna go a little bit longer hopefully it's gonna go longer in our favor wait why am i reloading this the gun kills pretty quickly I got the 50 round mags on it now there's really no reason I thought it was in front oh my lord the crossfire this kinda feels a little bit like a mix between an m4 and an mp5 I suppose you can build it a little bit differently but that's kind of how that's kind of a feeling I'm getting from it and I missed this map I really do it's been too long see shipment gets pretty crazy but from what I've noticed on this map the spawns make a little bit more sense at times so you can kind of predict where people are gonna be once you get killstreaks going there's nothing that's the enemy team can do this is a nifty little spot there's a few different spots like this in this map like a jungle gym and kind of traverse through it I chose the wrong guy to shoot out there the nice thing but this is I'm relearning the angles it takes a little while like you remember the map but you don't really remember the angles oh we got a runner Oh he's still alive you won't die he's got the stim they almost feel like a necessity on this map what's he doing in the turret Nazi I'm when he's wrong think we got the spawn dropped over here now just what you want this is where this is what this map is all about have one guy up top everyone else watching the other two angles okay sorry sorry I'm done using it I don't want to use it anymore I hate using the RPG and stuff like that but sometimes you need to secure the kill but the more you use it it kind of promotes it I don't like doing it can't see you then we're doing well too this is all you have to do that you just grab two flags hold it hope for the best I'm misjudging the damage of this thing sometimes plenty hit up her chest it does pretty not bad at all time to kill is relatively quick I love specialists oh boy oh he's chucking things at me get me out of here hi I'll let my teammate hold that angle hit them from both sides move along there oh my lord that quick-fix perk is pretty good amount of times I've gotten specialist and that saves me just get a kill and then it starts healing you up really quickly way faster than using a stim I always forget that I get it though I'm gonna start wasting a stim anyways no he was looking at me from the right side damn gotta get back up there multiples are great but do so much damage ah Oh mind me and I'm just gonna climb up here ask you hey how's it going you don't see me everything's fine Scott once we did and I am do you think we are able to break a hundred kills I'm not using kill streak it's only specialist so it's gonna be a little bit more tough my head's too big it's getting caught on the roof what are you kidding me a precision airstrike just killed me oh he's up top wait what happen to this guy in the far side now I don't know where they're spawning oh my hey cut that out alright I'm gonna go back around this way then go through the center he's looking at me he wants me dead oh the airstrike saved me read stop please I have a family they're chucking everything at me now grades RPGs molotovs I got to stop doing that I know that they're gonna spawn there yet I continuously peek for no reason yeah we're gonna lose this I might want to go for capping a point what is happening here oh my lord this is why the stims are so good oh yeah there's a guy back there this is a crazy match I know not saying much I'm just didn't like super focus mode at the moment oh I supposed to do at that point I can't bunt them I'm scared of the knifing woman get the sniping woman away from me god damn terrifying oh my lord we can do it two kills two kills that's all we need one two there we go Brooke hundred we lost what we broke 100 look how close that game was to all's I did it was cap one more I think damn what a match never lows so quick with the 50 runner god that was sick I loved that that was enjoyable rust is the best man it's back we could have won all's I had to do was sit on one more flag and we could have won but it was a good game [Music] you
