somebody I'll probably come back then yes but he's gonna come back speaking I left of the building there kill nice good kill good he'll try to play a little bit slower just to make sure I'm not you I'm not taking fall damage from like that second-story ain't gonna jump off the roof don't leave me no no we gotta test this it's for science I had a pretty good jump earlier actually I thought I was gonna die from but here I'll just fall nothing if I swear like normally you would taste now that was just a fall that wasn't a jump but yeah but still it's like I just where normally you would take a little bit of damage from that right yeah I had to you ahead of your red container pushing left from right to left inside container close has oh he is on the road ready left left left left he's got to be loyal condom nice one guy one guy do you have a three humma those nerdy pretty sure yeah I hear that he got the drop well two more two more to the right nor do I say that just pass right containers I'm smoking the cross you want to go for the loot no I'm flanking these guys right ones hurt inside containers one flaking my left downhill rotating there's no killer up the hill and there's two there's two one up on the hill and then wanting to get pushed down into bears let's flank right flank right one that guy's on uphill every smoke so that's fine good teamwork dude yeah that was six other people I'm gonna go check these guys yeah definitely I think one of those guys had a whinny yeah this guy had the arm that was him you know if a sight on it no wonder to X yeah yeah I'm gonna take it for a little bit and maybe the one of these guys that want to you yeah I go check these other guys are we get about to get a W maybe I don't wanna jinx it here but maybe not too bad you got a two arcs on your arm right yeah my vest is a little busted I didn't get a better one off those guys okay let's play it safe I can tank one shot you have an extra red not maybe no I don't close on the rock here closing on rock right two times close on the rock right to 10 to15 edges zone a little short whew the army with that that one might get them these things are so funny he's moving away moving away we should go downhill I guess I actually think we need to take this guy should I flank him in zone mmm actually come down with me come with me if that guy I was just running up the hill there knock that guy well south nice not killing we still got that guy up - all right yeah yeah yeah like that guy at the bunker good stuff I'm watching for the right guy straight pushes out these movies moving ahead 175 hit him I think at the rock there I'll see this just behind the tree you can't see it because of the foliage he might be prone healing at that rock coming down about yeah look at the time oh he's close ice cream Joe I like I speaking it he's hurting to be - to be - we got zone where is he dumb yeah both of them should be dumb area copy nice kill a spray down was what we needed yeah just saw moving behind the tree there they might start running out of meds so we tried it what we gotta move I gotta go to them we should move now yeah yeah yeah he's cresting he's going downhill I saw one just peek in there I think it might have been foliage cuz I wasn't no he's another one just left of him god I'm dude we got one blood splatter I saw that from behind those big the blood one flying in the sky thank God we goin Jesus what a rough day Yeah right we need we needed like perfect teamwork in order to pull that off really no seriously like we how did we had to play that close together yep everything like we had to play that all out and it seems like we needed snipers in order to do anything there yeah right - two bolt actions that'll do it for you last game of the day
