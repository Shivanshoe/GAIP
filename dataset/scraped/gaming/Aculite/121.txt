all right we're finally found a match unfortunately i'm in factory and i can only use a pistol because of this task i have to get three kills on players one down jesus could have killed me with that pbs oh my god [Music] he's got a mosin we got him we got him hell yeah i really like these new animations that they added to the uh the loading screen it's not much it's not much but your character like reloads he looks around he looks pretty good anyways we got the mp9 now i was using this thing uh what was it like last patch or the last wipe or whatever see this is the thing about this game i've always had a little bit of an issue with it because if you're a new player and you come into play and you're starting later into the patch like these big patches because they wipe the game and they wipe your accounts and all that stuff there might be a guy let me just lube of my lips for whatever reason that gives you painkiller i don't know but uh yeah if you're a new player and you come in and you play it and you're really late into the big patch there's a very good chance you're gonna go up against these these extremely geared guys and as the new player that's pretty rough there's only so much you can do you can't even buy really good ammo see underneath okay he must be underneath this guy hi he was using the new shotgun wasn't he like he was yeah he's using the new shotgun why did we why did you have night vision on we're not a nighttime raid so this thing from my understanding i haven't really read the patch notes but you could put like slug grounds in it you can only hold up to three shots but you can put like slug rounds in it shrapnel rounds and uh some flashbang grounds i think that's what he was using he shot the wall or something this poor guy here see like this guy for example he's like he's he might even be new to the game but he's only got a pistol like what if he goes up against somebody with like full level six armor he can't get through that almost done did it work i guess you don't get the like achievement thing i didn't bring in two toolkits there's two you have to fix i'm just going to reset i've got two kills got one of the tasks done i just want to get that's my main focus i just want to get some tasks done and get some better gear from the traders not a bad run sorry wait that's a player i thought there's a scav underneath yeah it's a player no way i got him with that that must have been a head shot i got him with a little wiggle psh with a drum mag oh my god you are an animal sir is it this one no do i have the wrong key am i in the wrong room oh this isn't the right key okay we might be at the wrong place oops hold on it's this one isn't it find the secure folder 031 in a bunk house on customs oh shoot i think oh man this is optional so i think you have to gain access to that room which gives you the key that i have like when you search one of the jackets that actually makes a lot of sense oops trying to think this is the best road to the cabin hmm he's waiting he's nervous he's nervous oh was there somewhere was that not like directly on him i feel like that was a pretty good throw that's kind of cool it shows little blood splatters on the ground now i guess if you're heavy bleeding or whatever uh this mp9 is so sick this isn't even the good one either there's like there's two variants of it one's a black one and then you have this tan one the black one shoots way faster it's actually probably good that i don't have that one oh my god there's more jesus get me out of here artillery inbound he didn't really touch my armor which is nice oh yeah can hear him we got him there's another one no way there he is oh man how many is there of you guys i guess breeding in this back corner what's going on back here i really hope there's not a fifth i mean it's very possible i think he can queue into five on this map you never know you never know in this game people can be anywhere at any time i need to make sure that nobody's watching their gear looks clear over here that's pretty geared i think this guy had the biggest bag hey what did you bring in already the game just started oh yeah factor key ssd that's decent amounts like 50k i think i don't know what all the values are like every time i come back to the game every every item is something different now pretty glad that i killed him here it's a pretty safe spot my fast mt put on his contacts i think he had too much i might take some of their ammo if they had anything decent because i really can't like at my current level i can't really buy too much from the traders and everything is way overpriced on the flea market oh car battery i need that for task oh yeah this is the stuff you want he's got the good gear i must have headshotted him yeah i didn't even touch his vest did you guys get so much gear i wonder if they wonder where they looted because i wasn't in the match for too long before we came across each other looks like this guy didn't have too much i think this is a scav boss weapon but he's got pb19 i guess i can get rid of my ammo this guy had good mags okay where do we have to go i guess oh yeah i spawn on this side of the map what the heck scab player just pops out of nowhere i'm too full i'm already i'm already out at energy sprint four meters and i'm done jesus thanks a lot scav trying to be sneaky over here that's unfortunate timing for him the bad news is i can't even loot him i'm so full i just can't i don't know what to do here because i'm kind of when i pick up my bag i'm going to be overweight so i either try to fight this guy now or i just try to run past him my guess is that they were teammates and he's most likely going to be watching his gear on the train tracks it's hard to judge movement now because they've opened up customs and there's so many angles and so many different areas you can go into i'm just gonna try to avoid them i'm so overweight like i can't even sprint anywhere look they even opened up ah why are you kidding me he was there that had to be a different guy there's i don't believe it if that was the teammate [Music] man we came across like the whole server everybody was in that area what's going on it's a shame that's a good run too you
