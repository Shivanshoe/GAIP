welcome back to more tarkov I know people always like watching some taco I loved playing this game it's always fun to coming back and playing this so this footage that I'm gonna be showing you though is not in the current patch because they recently added a weight system patch so I figured it let you know that but this m1a is what I'm gonna be using in interchange and I thought it was pretty decent and picked it off a dead guy that I found in a different rate and I finally extracted with it and it's not too bad it's got a little bit of medium range to it a little bit of clothes I didn't change much so here's the mods on it if you guys are interested in building it for yourself the only thing I really changed was the laser on it and the shift grip which I personally prefer when you're using a big weapon like this I like to be able to ATS a little bit faster and it adds or economics so figured that'd be a little bit helpful but yeah this is the gun if you guys want to build it for yourself I love it that this the firing range in your hideout it's fantastic cuz and I can come in and you can test your weapons a little bit the wasting ammo and all that see if you like the recoil on it yeah but this is the gunner here doesn't have too much recoil to it it's built I like the sight like the look and let me tell you it hurts anybody over there oh yeah saw a guy last second there he looked a little dirty he had a helmet on I could tell that much see a thing about this map is it's so nice outside but then as soon as you go in it's super dark sometimes I feel like you need night vision okay that one guy was really far out but I know there's another spawn a little bit closer yep I just saw you not cross it looks like he was stuck in the matrix you can die right away I believe his solo now he saw one cross won't never lacrosse but run up here boy did head shot him okay I just took a little of him to die that's all he's the Terminator wait he didn't bring any meds what are you doing man how you supposed to heal up if you get shot at see if we can go find killer I want my revenge on him you killed me a few raids ago just one top to me immediately I don't know maybe him there he likes to hide in dark corners sometimes you're not Killa just a normal scab yeah I don't think he's in here unless he's roamed around to the front side again no joke though when he killed me a few raids ago he killed me by running up the escalator sliding around a corner while throwing a grenade at me and then just laid me out like a couple shots it's probably the most epic thing I've ever seen also the most unfair thing of her soon in my life let's guess retracted somebody no not to me they were locked onto him he didn't have anything use running a hatchet I love it they added that change yeah eh I will now hunt you down if you don't have a weapon I think that's super funny oh people breaking glass - so if you're wondering why I brought this a vs rig I can't shoot me through that right actually I had one scav he blasts him with a pistol through the kibble windows they're supposed to be like bulletproof I think he's still headshot through it and that's what he did with a pistol I just don't even care TT not the greatest loop - fine but this ABS rig it costs too much to repair it and then sell it so I just find it better to bring it in use it as a space saver [Music] yeah you can't shoot through these oh [ __ ] there's more than one okay shouldn't have done that yeah there's just I think there's three oh I shot him in the head no he's like oh okay so I do one of two things cuz this is not gonna go well that's behind me I either way for them to push me no I gotta go now fall back that was exactly what I needed one down I think there's at least two more I think the one guy had a foul yeah there's two more for sure well they took his helmet and stuff so they've already loaded their buddy I'm just scared of this right hole I think they're going to ditch their buddy's gear sneak attack he knows he must have saw [Applause] and we have flashbangs blue if that doesn't get the heart pumping I don't know it does Jesus that was horrible that was a terrible situation if that guy in the right face me right away oh my god they destroyed one homer yeah I should be dead there's no reason I should be alive right now good God lots of loot to go through now you know what I almost died to the fire I stitch I stood way too close to it almost lost my arms okay now to die to somebody sitting up top I'm ready this is how it always happens okay let's guys had some gear he's got a beta backpack oh yeah they must have grabbed their buddies gear so they didn't ditch it using p90 alright we're already gonna do the bag exception okay what did you have yeah so was it BSS oh that was a valve oh yeah do you like as well I'll take that you know what this map really makes me want to use a flashlight or something especially for your viewing purposes but it gives you away so much your feet sky ever player scabs walk around in there oh yeah that's a player just heard of 80s I don't think he knows where I am these tarps are wall bangable I know you can shoot through them I just don't know do I fight this or do I not because my armor is at 15 it's not gonna take much to get through it we got to do it we got to go for it greed is good okay there's a box or something buying that this is either a very good idea for her head and we'll find out we got him doesn't want you right I think oh no there's too much to loot what am I supposed to do now uh okay I'm losing myself in this bag exception helmets worth a decent amount guns attachments always got a military cable even the motors are pretty decent oh you know what I'm gonna do I still gotta like the other guy too I'm just gonna take the attachments and I'm gonna go grab the other ABS and I'll just fill both those up his guns a monster man it's so good okay what did you have oh he was geared to he was more geared even brought me some juice oh yeah don't make this work lunchbox Tina fold that I need to get out of here before somebody walks up and kills me I'm still wondering if the guy that I shot at through kibble windows if he knew that I was in there like if he knew that's where it came from no I have to deal with all these scabs and possible exit campers guys are sneaky little buggers sometimes they just appear out of nowhere I swear see they're so sneaky now to get extract camped please please dear God no one be there I don't want a decent run ruined off another bingo just in case well haven't been shot at yeah so that's pretty good is that one amen this is a pretty good weapon I like the how this guy has this built though a little bit of long range a little bit close I didn't think I'd like this site as much as I do but it's not bad at all pretty clean and we're out so we had the first guy and then what happened oh okay they're very okay so I killed the first guy in and then the one guy after I exited the store to kill the store that was the teammate but they took his tag so and then the other guy killed up on the the second level the cow that didn't have anything but just a hatchet running you know what I really like that m1a though that's fun to use
