I just lost well that's that's a lot farther than what I thought you look pretty good though I see I didn't know I was there this is not the greatest idea ever but I'm gonna try it anyways cuz if I can get around these guys have a better shot and I don't think they would expect it just God how we shouldn't shot take it foggy listen just keep rotating on this guy what the heck I think I'm dead here boys oh wait you can still see me I don't think I hit out oh wait holy [ __ ] we killed him that was from the sniper rock the spine rock how far do you think that was I made five five really how did I survive that I honestly have no idea no idea my armor still decent though Nicky got them with your nades I may have gotten the one with the nade the one in the forest the one that was like be filly geared I don't think I killed because there was still shooting afterwards all right we're back in the game excuse me how did he know immediately I don't think I kill him oh yeah we're gonna start pinching me I gotta do something here I got him hell yeah still in the game I'll tell you have to maneuver with a sniper though you gotta take shots back off know when to back off right I'll make sure we're not going to be run up on oh hell yeah can I am Oh yet sp5 okay I figured as much this guy had the better gear let's check him real quick we can go back and loot that guy as well new visor up yeah we don't need that it's fine check and see what this guy had alright alright let's make her way out I still can't believe we got that shot at the snipe on the one guy the very beginning I want to know if I had shot at him or not cuz I think he's wearing a look level two armor so it might have just one shot him in the chest all right give me the hell outta here did I miss a tag on somebody the very first guy did I not grab the very first guys tagging okay because I know it's gonna be asked and I accidentally skipped over the screen of how far the shot was and I could actually check it I'm gonna go to my overall because it's actually in here instead so it's right down here longest shot distance 506 I thought it was 502 but that was and apparently was a headshot so the very first guy that we killed a very first shot that I was I was taking it that guy was at his home spawn for God's sakes so that was a head shot and then the question mark guy was the guy that I didn't get his tag was a grenade kill was a guy with the Mosin that was shooting at me that was a crazy shot I didn't I didn't think I was gonna hit that it's why you always got to take your shot always take the shot sniping snipers keV kill me please no I'm not shooting you're doing I heard the Bullock who got him nice aah continues crunch is that the one most building I was on construction building air construction I yeah yeah yeah thank you mm 62s through the bolts going I'm not sure nice work [ __ ] whoa man Oh shot on the wall yeah on the blue blue container blue container inside it inside it I think yeah I'm behind it and behind it I just made it behind it might have killed inside well okay I'm moving up pretty sure just laid him out I'm pretty sure that Frank was perfect on another guy outside outside of the wall this is you one to the left side he's bailing for the airport yeah he's running one was really close to us you were the brick houses yeah somebody still blue I'm inside it right now he got out that lucky bastard how did he get out so fast though he ran he ran straight to the extract hole sprint these guys did not know it hit though dude that guy wasn't little four inside that you killed a cue light it again with a frak don't know I did yeah my dad yep frag on this guy the other guy was a hedgehog inside this was the T 5,000 yet yes sniping dude all the sport I was a little bored are you sure that guy got out that was awfully quick yeah they just waiting it wasn't thrown at the barrier and I chucked the grenade and it landed me yeah Dan shooting that me into the right scab don't know where he's behind the truck he has no angle and I see what oh yeah easy sniper leveling hell yeah I'm hitting the left foot you know what now that I think about it if this is looted what if that guy got a weapons case or something and he was the last one to ditch a man because he immediately started running you said right yeah uh well he was outside the wall and just like bailed out when his when his buddies got lit up I can imagine but that's what I mean like on a marquee and coming in here mm-hmm well his buddy trying to initiate a fight like I don't know maybe sure he'll never know okay coming over is that you at the Balaton crossing over yeah [ __ ] nice -
