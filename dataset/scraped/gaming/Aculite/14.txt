[Music] oh yeah we got a few here just a few [Music] oh we got him [Music] a nice little shot just gotta wait for the right moment right opportunity i've seen a guy okay is the winnie just like amazing all of a sudden [Music] oh my goodness we're gaming [Music] you know i don't think it's too bold of a statement to suggest that there's nothing quite like solo pubg every time i come back and play this game it's something that can really capture your attention and it keeps you on your toes you're constantly going through different emotions not sure if there's going to be a guy around the corner if it's a compound that you're gonna rush up to has multiple enemies up in it or perhaps somebody's got you lined up with a vss from over 200 meters away and you're not even gonna hear where it's coming from but every little decision that you make matters there's just something about it over the years it's definitely been one of my favorite games to play and there's never a time where i don't come back and enjoy it there's a lot that i wish they improved upon but it's still a fantastic game there really is nothing quite like solo pubg hopefully the game continues to evolve and they bring back some old players as well as introduce some new ones i know going free to play has helped with that but i don't think that's quite enough just yet anyways i got a single game to show you really hope you enjoy some classic solo pub g and i'll catch you guys in the next video got two people here along with me okay we're just gonna go with double five five i'm sure he landed over there freaking trees oh i'm getting sniped at one more for the road there it is sorry sorry sorry i'll calm down it's exciting stuff i won two gun fights back to back i'm not as terrible as i thought the game goes on um where did i kill this guy i knew the tractor right yeah here three best actually no no i'm gonna stick with what i said five five only got a long way to go and someone's choosing to pull up to this compound now jesus what just happened did he drive his vehicle into the barn oh my goodness this game really does have recoil doesn't it oh yeah it's actually upside down full sent it right at the barn okay we need to either we drive at people and play it fairly aggressive or yeah i don't know i don't know maybe we could just drive it people yeah i don't really know these buildings so this might go poorly i know nothing about this area oh shoot there's a guy right there i drove right past him jesus he almost got me i wasn't even looking at me he almost killed me was it a vector okay i don't feel safe on this hill we gotta go somewhere or directly center the compound compound is a definite no-go there's no windows second-floor stories i don't think i can i don't think i can do that we need to need something a little bit more open damn this map is quiet man holy smokes [Applause] that's a good play i wasn't sure if that sniper was at me or not um we need an extended mag for this thing probably put a comp on it oh we just got dropped oh my god just absolutely taken out oh we got him wow we're calling the suppressor i don't have any more needs it's okay we don't need them i'm just gonna keep using the mk seems to be pretty good he's doing this well so far and might be a little much let's take the six comp for that thing i really like that i gave up that side of the hill but i kind of had to get some loot make sure i got a grenade and stuff [Music] let's get right there oh my goodness that was pixel perfect damn we're gaming doing well to be honest i don't know if it's me i feel like it's just lucky at this point just happened to be in the right spot at the right time looking the right way oh it's a big boy gun that might be an arm oh what the heck is that why he was coming this way oh [ __ ] we got a groza other gilly i mean surely we take this right we have to i still don't like that i'm pretty sure that was an arm like i don't know for sure but it did sound kind of like that got that oof sound to it no i don't really like that he's behind me if he is still alive yeah there he is did i see him oh i'm dead oh no i'm dead shouldn't have done this this is not call of duty no we're good we're good we're good that was extremely risky i should not have done that can't really slide cancel your way inside the zone [Applause] no way that gets them that's a huge plus for us i almost had like a perfect bank shot on that so we got three other guys i'm also running out of vest yikes [Laughter] damn nice shots nice shots all right let's see who wins this i'm curious i think i have the game volume like a little low i'm really trying to listen for footsteps all right good spot good spot i feel like ac's kind of got this get some nice shots on me there good time to move i don't know man i don't know i can't swap to the other guy i can't see what he's doing it's gonna be interesting no ac's got this he's gonna hop out the window isn't he yep he just hopped to the window he didn't see it yeah he's got it his smokes weren't good enough they weren't quick enough if he chucked them out i don't know 30 seconds earlier maybe like as soon as he started the hitting him up when he was crossing over great game though that was a great game well done you
