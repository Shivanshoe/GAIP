[Music] so this is hyper scape ubisoft's brand-new first-person shooter battle yell experience and it is extremely quick I was given exclusive access so that I could play and record the game for you guys to show you some footage now this is not gonna be a full commentary video where I go over every single little detail and explain everything that you can do in the game or everything that's going on I just wanted to go over a few bare minimums so that you understand the gameplay that is going on and hopefully to answer some questions or maybe even some concerns that you may have with the game so first off this is very fast and when I say it is very fast I think when people start getting used to the gameplay there's gonna be essentially no downtime you are not gonna be able to breathe whatsoever you're gonna have teams all around you at all points during the game speaking of teams you can have up to a hundred players in teams of three you can queue solo if you would like although from my experience even though we were just learning the game at the time it is very difficult to 1v3 you have to use your hacks which is what I'm picking up right now you get two of them and I will explain those further in a moment you have to use those a very very well and to the best of your ability to even attempt to a 1v3 because I do believe that team firing is gonna be a huge aspect in this game so what happens when you die well if you die you get turned into an echo which you can then run around and ping for your teammates you're not out of the game yet you can go to a previous dead enemy's location and then once you stand on that platform and then you can have one of your teammates come over and resurrect you so you can do that as many times as you want as long as there is another platform for you to stand on for the hacks you get to abilities which are called hacks and there's a handful of them along with weapons you have invisibility a slam you can turn yourself into a bouncing ball which can absorb quite a bit of damage before it breaks and you can jump on top of rooftops and all that type of stuff you have an AoE heal that you put down on the ground and it heals all your teammates as well just as well as yourself there's a wall but one of my favorites has to be slam when you upgrade this thing it has a fairly low cooldown and you propel yourself up into the sky and then you slam them down on the ground knocking away people around you disabilities are really useful for getting on top of rooftops and essentially knocking somebody up down that has the sniper or whatever the team above you has and advantage on you which to mention from my experience when you're on top of a rooftop you do not have the upper hand advantage all that much because people can climb up so easily on top of rooftops with a double jump and then you have a climb feature now speaking of the ball you can see this guy tries to get away in the ball it only took like one sniper shot and a couple other shots to destroy it and then you can just essentially kill him so there is no down phase when you are dead you are dead but again you get turned into an echo then and then you just go and stand on an enemy's platform and wait for one of your teammates to resurrect you now mentioning of upgrading abilities earlier you can also upgrade your weapons when you find the exact same weapon that you currently have all you have to do is walk over to it and press the upgrade key whatever that may be for you and from what I've seen for weapons it'll give you either upgraded damage or will give you a bigger magazine now for the zone or a circle there is no circle there are certain parts in the city that will deteriorate over time and you will be notified ahead of time and you will be able to see when it is deteriorating it looks like there's pixels being removed from objects around you now once the zone has started deteriorating you'll start to see that buildings will actually start to disappear as well as you will start taking damage which means that you can't actually run across on top of building rooftops or anything like that you're all gonna be on the ground open to gunfire so for obvious reasons you don't want to be stuck in this zone the last thing I want to mention is the crown now in the very last zone there will be a crown that is available and it's kind of like capture the flag if you hold on to this flag long enough you hold on to the crown long enough you will become the winner what this does is it makes it forces all the teams together to fight for the crown to essentially fight for the victory and that's pretty much it actually there's one other thing to mention there will be events that will go on randomly throughout the game so if there is a streamer in your game who streams on Twitch their viewers are going to be able to vote on a specific event that happens throughout the game that happens for everyone like low gravity or infinite ammo anyways thank you guys for watching hope you enjoy now catch you guys in the next one okay this is what we needed we needed like a little bit of a slower start oh [ __ ] sorry wanna be a ball in the ball here I don't want to be a ball I'm pretty sure last time I tried I to me 20 squad remain okay so if you don't like the order of your hacks like if you want it slam on your cue hold G and then you can swap them or figuring it out you can pick up can you drop your hacks that we eat clip then you can yes like if y'all have something that you wanna upgrade for example come get it disability are you sure yeah one of you has it right yeah yep one pushing up we just rush them if you want he's on the roof beaming homies dead holy nice shot it feels like the hitbox were snipers is actually kind of generous yeah here's a golden cipher here coconut golden snipe fully upgraded I think you'll set a golden wall Oh low gravity Oh close maybe on the street dog oh boy yep this LMG is kind of nuts it in nice okay you just stood there him that's a headshot oh this might be a big mistake we're down here there's a guy in that building on purple I gotta wait and he'll oh I see him down here was a guy below me here on purple he's running back through towards you guys right here I got this guy oh there's two in that building I'm trying to let sniping us from the train guy in here I think we should take this train guy yeah I'm the guy here sorry I was trying to snipe the train guy and this guy wouldn't let me [ __ ] alone well it's okay [ __ ] he's the guy in this building nice okay there's gonna be two over near me it's just not letting me do it Taniya me to do it should I leave it was buggin out for me there as well Hey Dude settle with the grenade launcher would ya there's two after me I think [Applause] oh my god I just got demolished up there it's true I think I'm running guys really weak yeah but I had I just had to run real quick that wine guy is very weak I didn't visit again just making up its new you may look dumb okay there's another one I think down below is that the bottom necessarily you guys are live though right that might be yours from earlier visibility with the slam not bad the slam is like super strong it's very strong yeah just being able to quickly jump out of situations they're fighting over on purpose now there's lamb oh yeah mine's maxed out max my I guess I could try to catch time pushing in no they're fighting over here I see him I got one on the roof here this is that up zone oh boy no over there I don't know if we should do this yeah your opinion changes pretty quickly of it was a guy over here really hurt we staged yeah you guys you smile just they're gonna start taking damage in this and the buildings are gonna disappear oh you can shoot through I'm getting flanked on the middle of the road that guy's really way dead yes he's running across the street you can actually interrupt this slam oh my he's right on my body with the grenade launcher careful type something hurts last guy I did not realize that was last man I didn't know that either Gigi [Music] [Music]
