so recently warzone has added in buyback solos and if you've ever played the stimulus game modes it's exactly the same as that except solos so as long as you have 4 500 you can buy yourself back in so there's no gulag or anything you come back in right away you don't have to fight anybody and i've been loving this game mode so far because of that people seem to be camping a little bit less they've been taking a little bit more risk and obviously it works very well for my type of place health because i love rushing buildings and you know rushing at people so you tend to make a lot of mistakes when you do that but you do learn you learn pretty quickly like how to take a building now if i should check a c4 now or whatever back off now it's a lot of quick thinking but i've also been loving the ax 50 recently i've been getting a little bit back into sniping and especially in solos when you head shot somebody long range up close whatever and they just that's it there's no there's no resin them they just die off i think that's just extremely satisfying there's just something about it maybe it's because you break the plate and they just immediately disintegrate in front of your eyes they're gone from the game but i think that's a lot of fun but the reason i've been using the ax 50 so much because i feel like it's a little bit better as an aggressive sniper you can uh scope in a little bit quicker if you used all those attachments and that's what i always use on mine ax50 doesn't matter the sniper actually i use damage range and ads speed for the most part i never use a i never use an extended mag or anything for extra bullets because if you hit the one shot and they're dead then there's a point in having the extra bullets so you kind of challenge yourself now i haven't done a commentary in a long time so bear with me here but i would like to take a moment in this video and thank everybody for subscribing you've been a part of the channel for a long time and i know there's been people that have been here for many many years now it's kind of incredible but we've actually reached a million subscribers so thank you all for that it's actually mind blowing to me that a million people enjoyed the content enough to click on the sub button and and continue coming back to watch some videos so that's what this video is going to be about i'm going to be sniping in the background hopefully you guys enjoy the gameplay but i will be commentary over it as well as just talking about some channel stuff and uh right here i swear i'm the most unlucky guy in the world somehow i didn't spot this guy and he just ran over and obliterated me as soon as i must have popped the drone he uh must have just ran out of the building came over to shotgun me in the face but anyways thank you guys very much for a million subscribers truly incredible i know people have been expecting some sort of face reveal or something like that i'm not going to be doing that in this video because i don't think that's a part of my channel and i know a lot of people quite enjoy the mystery behind just having some game play up and i don't know i guess always wondering what the person is looking like it's kind of a little bit of a tease i suppose and when i was growing up and when i first started doing youtube and when i wanted to start taking a little bit more seriously all the people that i tend to watch didn't have a face cam and i thought that was a really cool part of it because it was always about the gameplay you don't have any overlays or anything like that over your screen and it's just more about the gameplay and the experience and just like having a good time with friends or whatever it is showing off some cool moments and i i think that's basically where my content stands i will reveal my face in the future it just won't be in this video here so if you're not following me on twitter the link is always in the description below i always post some uh some real life stuff there or on instagram or wherever basically just social media so if you're not following me there and i always hate saying that but please follow me there that's where i interact with people the most as well as i do go through the comments section i just don't always have the amount of time that i would love to have to reply to everyone and everyone's answers so one question i always get a lot is what i'm using for a loadout i will do my very best at least for warzone to keep those loadouts in the description i'll always post the attachments and all that stuff but for the most part it never changes from gun to gun it's always damage range and ads speed all the time unless i'm using a shotgun or a hipfire build also can we take a moment and appreciate these zip lines that they added to warzone the fact that they finally i was always complaining about trying to breach buildings and rooftops and all that stuff and it was just so difficult because if you didn't have the loadout to do it you could almost never do it people would hold off with uh with claymores bouncing betty's the whole nine yards right that was just so annoying anyways i'm getting off track here so a couple things that i wanted to address in this video is the future of the channel um i guess everything surrounding that why i haven't been uploading too much it's generally about once or twice a week at most which is uh which i would say is fairly decent god don't just love slow motion headshots just so satisfying i feel like it's a little bit more satisfying with this rather than the hdr because the hdr basically has no bullet drop so you kind of have to lead a little bit with this anyways i'm getting i'm getting off track again one of the reasons i haven't been uploading so much is because i actually got a little bit burnt out not too long ago so i was taking some time off and i was uploading a little bit in between but i was mainly spending some time with friends and just playing games with friends and kind of whatever else i wanted to do get some irl stuff done that i was otherwise putting off for a very long time not only that i was having some insane issues with tech difficulties throughout the year about a year and a half now some things that i've fixed and some things i haven't fixed but for the most part the editing process has become a lot easier for me now and i can actually edit a video about in two hours compared to the seven or eight hours that it used to take me and actually get the video uploaded and ready to go for youtube now would you look at this there's no way you can compete with a bruin lord help us if they keep this thing the way it is right now that gun is so crazy and especially with the tick rate in war zone currently by the time you receive any damage you're basically dead anyways from that gun it just does so much damage you can't return fire i believe it's actually worse than what the growl was when that gun was uh it's pretty crazy so hopefully they do make a change for that otherwise the game is going to get very stale when you're playing squads and getting wrecked by bruins 24 7. and then it actually comes down to the point where people there's really no point in using any other gun because you're so outmatched that there's no reason to so for somebody like me who likes to run around with a bunch of different weapons i hate using the same weapon almost twice in the same day i always mix it up day to day whether it's attachments guns loadouts it doesn't matter i always try to mix it up to keep the game interesting for myself as well obviously for the viewers i don't think everyone wants to watch me run around with the bruin 24 7 because that just i think that's boring it just becomes boring speaking of boring i know a lot of people do not always enjoy warzone footage and i've been uploading a lot of that so in the future i will be mixing up the games a lot more i would playing a lot more solo stuff that's for sure i enjoy playing with friends but one of the main things i've always loved about gaming is actually gaming solo there's something about it it's just it's different it's very relaxing you play your own pace you do whatever the hell you want so you can expect a lot more of that type of stuff in the future as well i have been live streaming off and on quite a bit over the past couple years if people don't know you can follow me on twitch currently twitch.tv aculite just my name link is always in the description as well and you can catch me live there there's not currently a schedule but i will do my very best to stream at least once to twice per week i always like messing around on live streams we'll always do some challenges or you know a certain gum gun combo or just something weird like that so if you're not following me there then well you should it's free just go click the button speaking of buttons apparently you have to click on the little bell notification on youtube otherwise there's a chance that you will miss videos i'm not really sure exactly how the system works anymore because they change it all the time but clicking a subscribe on youtube is not enough anymore so say i upload a bunch of warzone and then i swap to a different game if this is a game that i guess you've never seen before there is a chance that it won't even show up in your subscriber feed so i think you have to click the sub notification button in order for all of them to show up also this poor guy mike i killed him three times in this match because he could buy himself back every single time he kept coming back for his loadout and he was the very first person i killed in this match and then i kept killing him here at superstore i felt a little bit bad so to go back to what i was saying previously yes there will be a lot more games on the channel a bunch of different ones it's not going to only be fps games i'm going to go back to playing some single-player games since i can edit a little bit quicker now and get the videos out a little bit sooner going back to playing some single-player playthroughs i think would be a lot of fun whether i stream it on youtube or i actually just upload the video itself i think that'd be a lot of fun and i miss i actually missed playing those games quite a bit so when any new titles come out in the future some some fun single-player games i would love to i'd love to cover those so i figured i would end the video with some q a since i did ask you guys previously to throw some questions at me one of the biggest ones that i got was the face reveal one which i believe i already covered it's not something that i plan on doing right now but it will happen in the future whether people want to see my face or not that's completely up to them obviously you don't have to watch if you don't want to see it if i ever decide to take a live streaming uh more seriously and i want to do that more full time rather than youtube then i may even add a face cam over that and then that's more or less what the content would become again nothing is set in stone currently and i haven't decided the full future of what i want to do why don't i stream on youtube that was like this is actually a really good question because in the past when youtube live streaming first came out if you live streamed and you didn't get over like a certain amount of views or whatever it would actually affect the algorithm so any videos that you posted afterwards would be affected by that as well so that's why i chose to separate my live stream content from my video content obviously now that's not the case anymore i believe they've fixed that and it doesn't affect your channel the same way i don't know if i ever decide to swap people will know and i will let people know over social media merchandise yes it will be returning in the future i just can't say when nice little quick answer for that one no i don't ever want to become a pro i think that would just be the most boring thing in the world if i'm being honest having to play the exact same game over and over and playing competitively at it at a high high level would be it'd be very stressful to say the least not to mention having to produce content just on that game alone i think that would just become very mind-numbing to be honest plus i just don't think i'm good enough to become a pro on any of the games that i play another comment that always comes up or a question is how i stay comp during any of these games you gotta understand that i play these games a lot so playing games like going from a game like pub g or playing escape from targa these games with like high high stress i've played these games a lot and eventually just become more or less numb to a lot of the feelings that happen in the game and on top of all that it's just a game like if you die it doesn't really matter all that much you just load back and you play again right you try to you just try to learn from the mistakes that you made plus if you're always raging and freaking out and stuff you'll never be as good as what you could be if you just relax and stay calm and thought about the situation as for showing my setup it's literally just two computers one for streaming one for playing slash editing and then i have three monitors mouse keyboard like it's it's really nothing special it's what you would expect i think for the job that i do if you're really that interested there is a picture on my instagram that's where i upload those types of things so you can go check that out link is in the description below as usual how do i train my aim or do i use aim trainers i don't i i just play games lots and uh i roughly use the same sensitivity throughout i learned very early on that lowering your sensitivity until it's no longer shaky and you're able to more or less flick to targets and stay consistent with your aim is more important than you know being able to do a 360 no scope on somebody so lowering your sensitivity will make you more consistent definitely especially if you're a shaky player and you're very nervous about certain situations you haven't built up that tolerance yet lower your sensitivity quite a bit you'll be surprised at how much better of a gamer you'll become aiming wise anyways i think i'll wrap it up there thank you guys very much for watching the video i hope i answered some of the questions that you guys may have had i know i didn't answer all of them or a lot of them but i did my very best hope you guys also enjoyed the gameplay a little bit of sniping action with the ax50 i'm uh i'm having a lot of fun with that gun i'm not gonna lie having to lead your shots a little bit i think is a little bit more rewarding than just using the hdr 24 7 and being able to just point and click on somebody but to wrap it up if you guys are new thank you very much for subscribing it's been quite a journey over the years gaining all these subscribers and uh i love reading the comments and seeing you guys and you're doing the videos and all that and if you do enjoy the videos please consider leaving a like or dislike if you don't that actually helps me a lot to recognize whether or not you guys want to see more of that footage or you know that type of gameplay or whatever it is other games will be returning and obviously i'll be playing some new games here and there won't just be playing fps games even though those are what i enjoy the most i will be uploading those in between warzone as much as possible and not to mention i will be uploading as much as possible streams will be once to twice per week on no given schedule whatsoever i'll be playing games like i don't know fall guys or something like that just games are just like absolutely ridiculousness anyways thank you guys very much for watching for the million subscribers hope you guys enjoyed the video follow me in the links in the description below if you want to communicate with me and keep up to date with a bunch of different stuff and i'll catch you guys in the next one you
