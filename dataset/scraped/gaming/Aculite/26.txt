all enemies all right time what little pickup another one up at top i landed on my plane wing and then i wrote what there's two planes the right side of peak right now okay all right let's take these guys out disabled later don't do that to me man come on not today you did that to me those guys are right below me right below me for this guy definitely should did you get knocked out oh no yeah i had to i had to bail all right he's broke he's broke not hitting these christmas trees man where what the heck is going on how did this cluster just kill me it was a different team no way prove you can still fight soldier it's loady time floaty all right this plane just got me out anyways uh we can hit the loadout then we can just go hit the tree nobody's been going over there there was one team on blue mark there was a guy in the forest over here i believe as well oh yikes then what do you need you need an air yeah here i'm gonna frag this guy real quick i think he's further up the mountain there yeah i killed one of them off here oh safe in the zone nice one down there rocks just ahead of me here on blue left [Applause] oh invisible skin sick yeah i might need backup all right i'm coming over i don't know if his teammate's here he might be inside was the edge of the edge of the edge of the building here on yellow it's close right close right nice i barely won that dude dude his teammate just got ruined that's tough shotgun now we got plates and stuff i don't know this map i feel like driving is gonna get me ruined yeah it's pretty it's pretty messy he's looking at me i'm always looking at you oh that's a c4 [Music] thank you was he broken over oh yeah yeah he was cracked okay cracker rude he's got a bran wait did you get your uh loadout yeah yeah i have the shot i dropped the secondary shotgun though oh no i didn't get the did you buy a second loadie or no i don't remember if we have no no i don't think you did i think i just went straight to my second loadout because wait no because yeah you had success remember yeah oh no we i think we just killed him and then we just immediately ran because we saw the guy we didn't do it yet where is he right in front right in front front to the left rocks that's how insane that is you and i both hit shots they died this game just became hardcore for everybody else playing i like the sound of that guy behind us moving in see if we can see the bounty two non-ghosted it looks like you got two up at that buy station on orange those are ghosts dude those guys i got two two stone real quick oh vehicle he's in the vehicle oh oh jesus oh i'm fried oh no nice the other soft [Applause] wait what your mom's he got knocked from the other duo that was good that makes more sense you might want to just get out of there dude i know but this truck kind of like driver reavers although they might not know you're alive i'm guessing they're gonna look up look down on you are they up above me they were coming from um blue direction there somewhere they may not know you're there though but i would imagine they'd go clean the loot up they're both ghosted look at this what is this game oh my god i'm fighting my own ghosts [Music] i'm in where'd he go there's a satchel down below here if you need oh i know where he went i see him okay he's dead he's dead over there oh god i was up to southeast i also have an armor box there's like somewhere up blue there that's good i can push down low i have a sniper but it's a uh not gonna be the best but i might be able to get an opener with it oh yeah don't you keep perks now so don't i stole my perks oh i see him done the right to the right contract target got him oh my goodness should we get higher out i'm with you uh we probably should but i don't know i guess we could try and go up this mountain route get up there i just want to get stuck down here you know no you're right for end game we're going to want height yup left arm hits on him 2v1p1 easy frags one guy 1v1 it's got to be further up it's my guess if you can clear the top platform here though i might have seen the left boundary i thought that plant was done yeah i don't know the amount of times i've looked at this plant now i know stone's pulling a little your way here look how nuts that is look how insane that is right as i was shooting the second shot he died from or his his armor got broken from the burn yeah with the incendiaries too because you have time between the shots so roast them up plus that makes them flinch too with the incendiaries so they can't even really get great shots on you and they can't heal because they're getting burned right they can't armor up yeah cinderies are super annoying yeah they're so end of a shotgun ridiculous just not okay ggs ggs stone mile we love you is that stone [Music] fancy seeing you here dude hey oh just rest right here where we were at oh my god absolutely obliterated by the brand he stunned me priest done he must have called the advanced down oh you got both of them yeah i knocked the guy out of the air oh how come i can't fight there we go oh one running on the road right up ahead here one less running on the road right over there yeah right there one's pushing down towards us [Applause] [Music] he's up above on the korean side of the green overhead teammates pushing over that was you i'm back i'm going to see if i can finish that huge anus huge anus it's not letting me up there we go i broke his body nasty oh wait this is that was a different team i was shooting at then maybe losing ground moving i got one more uav to pop [Applause] nicely done man i was stuck down there he called me a rat i literally pushed up the mountain towards him okay buddy okay all right we're still breathing oh yeah sweet i missed every shot yeah it didn't hit him once uh we're cutting that clip out edit it out that one didn't make it into the in the video corrupt footage yeah those guys hot blue are in a vehicle yeah these guys are about to come up though i want to use the shotgun do i no no no let's just get the kills and move on never mind he knows he knows did you get him nope he's down but i didn't get him okay yeah well there's actually still alive my hero i had to hold myself froze or else he was going to kill me yup that was a perfect play that's the only thing about this shotgun man i ran out of ammo yeah and it's a slow reload too right really slow there was one other team on the opposite side of zone but we mostly had control of this side of the zone there is a loadout though oh no no it was the zone i think moving in oh no i do see them moving on it's our bounty two of them found one oh my god they're both down flashbang [Music] we have the team from blue they're to be coming up the mountain here wait is that a there's a guy in a bush here got him another one just to the right of that guy about 10 meters last seen blue there approximately just downhill me too oh wow they knocked me fast [Applause] i think i might have broken one i don't remember no he's down there he's down there i'm safe for now i'm just gonna sit in the gas for a sec currently out of armor though i can give you a couple plates it's still downhill do we push this no he's got to come to zone okay can you cover me i'll bring the plates here dropping thank you i'm shooting a dead body i couldn't see him i'm selfing found him nice you're not done yet we can just watch on himself i'm reloading i love it any plates on these guys uh you have a satchel and those are that one there i can drop you one i only have two i'm good i got four i got four two one two one made a lot of noise there okay hell yeah i feel like he's at far side dead body down there someone could use that the uav brother literally the only spot well done well done that's what i trained for as he said like i was like that's gonna be like the only spot we didn't check that's exactly what i was thinking damn 30 kills in a duel man you got like what 14 in the plane um yeah we don't need to talk about that so much oh we're just cutting that out okay it was all with my pure skill it was all with my pure skill and talent raw natural talent that i did that i do agree bringing them home great game you
