okay you want to play captain got attacked by one of those cow things something drove it crazy i had to put it down keep an eye out copy that out writer now move your ass and find [Music] that didn't necessarily look like a giant cow to me but more or less a giant hairless rat anyways a big thank you to nvidia geforce now for sponsoring this video all the gameplay that you are seeing right now is what i am using using their new cloud-based gaming service and it allows you to play the games you already own from steam you play epic games store all you have to do is link your accounts together and as long as you have a decent internet connection you can use their hardware to play the games that you already own kind of incredible really never thought in my day and age would be able to use somebody else's hardware to play games another cool thing is you can pretty much play on any device like pc mac chromebook android mobile iphone ipad so if you're out and about or you're going on vacation or something maybe you bring you along your laptop you don't don't have the greatest laptop it's not a gaming laptop you can just use their hardware and their service to play the games that you already own all the gameplay you're seeing i put it maximum graphics currently they offer two membership plans one being free and then the founders plan the free plan gives members access to servers in a limited one-hour sessions and then the founders plan gives members priority access to servers and six hour sessions for 24.95 for six months and it supports 1080p 60fps which i think is fairly standard these days so if any of this sounds interesting you follow the link in the description the app is super easy to use and it supports over 800 games hope you guys enjoy the rest of the video playing the outriders a demo quite a fun game i enjoyed it and i'll catch you guys in the next one all right let's go through this real quick just so you guys can see if i go to my options here i actually am playing in the highest possible you can even see my my display it's from nvd which is not even i don't have a monitor like that that's from nvidia so i'm playing on uh on nvidia geforce now which is this is so cool i didn't think this would ever become a thing but it is and uh i'm playing on all ultra so you should be able to see pretty much everything in game which is gonna be hey soldier you're eca too right when we get to no man's land we've got to stick together if we want to survive survive what getting our asses fried by the big storm hey i told you to shut the hell up we're here come come back on back what the hell is happening here it's on an altar to carry our guys apart you need to get out of here you think the elders care about a storm  take the back way through the frame and we're not gonna make it out here and what's the captain of the show are you out of your gun how long how long has it been what this this war how long who knows that's before i was born that's impossible come on open the god damn gate and move poke tight almost there almost where where are you taking us i'm not supposed the hell is the matter with you you just wake up with something try oh i just well let me get you up real quick that paradise you outriders promised us guess what we got instead goddamn alien storms no shelter no food just kicked to the curb like exiles while your eca pals got fat in their bunker  it wasn't like that we lost electronics we could have left you all to rot in your cryopods but we can't we stand you ungrateful how many times did i tell you to shut up looks like we're not sticking together you people are insane explorer flag once you capture you can fast travel between oh okay so the unlocks of fast travel i don't know where that came from but all right with that so basically there's a necromancer i'm not sure exactly uh i'm gonna edit this video together but i'm playing the pyromancer class there's a necromancer there's like a ninja class i forget what it was called it's definitely one i want to try later i think i messed around with it apparently like you can dash towards enemies and then you kill them and you can dash back to exactly where you started so that's kind of too cool what happened here what does it look like we got mutilated we had the bastards cornered but they had a captain what's so special about the captain for the captain yeah you know the with powers you get put in charge not a real alter not like we could notice a difference where is he inside the bunker up the hill i wish i could look him in the eyes when you make him pay for what he did i think i'll pay him a little visit for old time's sake altered give that captain what's coming to him um go to your request list and then choose a title i'll track it okay you can only choose one quest oh my god they're gonna kill me oh is it this guy with the sniper that's getting me that's a grenade hey hey chill chill chill maybe i should put on the sniper now we can do this oh my god they're just obliterating me okay looks like he can shoot me through that wall for something pew gonna somehow make it up there no let's uh let's put on the sniper we can't really do this see the thing is my i don't think my abilities reach that far using the wrong buttons where'd this guy come from okay so yeah that bomb ability really helps oh this kind of sniper man [Music] let's go this far oh yeah it does maybe i'm misjudging my abilities distance yeah they can go through walls and go through everything that's awesome okay what do we got here i pick up a sniper it looks kind of cool i thought i'd have a harder time getting back through captain should be somewhere in here okay wait we got it interrupts and resistance altered enemies and anomaly enhanced creatures can cast their own abilities and protect against your skills okay um you can hit a casting enemy with your interrupt keyword skill to stop them okay so it's gonna give me i guess it's gonna tell me what to use uh blue aura indicates that enemies temporarily mean to interrupt a mobilizing effect okay so don't use anything then shield means they build okay so they build up resistance i guess when i use stuff we're just gonna have to kite him around or something it's got an army with them so basically how the pyromancer works is anytime i set people on fire and then i kill them i heal off of it so i may have to use these guys as kind of like toys so i can heal off of them and this fire will not give up nope definitely need to be using my abilities on cooldown this guy takes a lot of damage so that stuns them i can keep the bomb on this guy i can destroy this guy with the bomb and uh he should do some damage to him as well oh maybe not i didn't kill him in time doing some good damage okay he just healed he's cheating this guy's cheating it's actually kind of a tough fight it's gonna do lots of damage if i don't keep healing off of them i'm gonna lose this he's a beast okay so i'm supposed to interrupt him here yeah okay so i need to save my ability because he heals don't kill me don't kill me don't kill me gotta stun him there it is there we go sorry about your luck wait stop you're an altar you can do whatever the  you want why the are you fighting for those those fascist weird ones fighting for our lives do you even know what they did to us i know what you did to me no you
