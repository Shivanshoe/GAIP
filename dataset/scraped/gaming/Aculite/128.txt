[Music] i'm thinking we go super super yeah makes sense if we're going 24 7 super we should probably go super right i actually think we should go super instead you want to go super instead yeah um i don't know why do we always have to go where you want to go i mean i offer another system and then we'll go yours and everybody everybody agreed and now you want to change it from 24 7 super saiyan to a different a different drop look dude you could try it i feel like we always go super hard just feel like we should mix up and go super for a change tom this is a bad drop this is your fault i think it's a bad drop for sure there's there's literally three people i'm going back window this doesn't look good at all i'm sorry i can't i can't commit to i'm already dead um what the [ __ ] [Music] he's he dropped his super dude when we said super oh my god origin as well nice last one here except for us or bean wrestling super and you went super so it's like you know yes that's been the worst point for anyone to tune into a stream when we're like fine we'll go super next time just sounds like we're in full hot argument you know people should know if they're tuning in by now like this is what we do come to sainsbury's you've got better offers hack your walmart what is saint saints breeze or scenes sainsbury's or asda i think asta is walmart all right you're like not even singing dude i can't spell i feel like i've heard aldi before we've got m s if you've got that moolah m s marks and spencers who are they waitrose costco no we don't have costco you know costco you don't have costco oh we got your beat overall then uh you lose by default though yeah what about idea you got it yeah it's the bomb what's canadian tyre yeah we've got a keyboard yeah it's stones don't have any entire there right well i was canadian tired oh yeah cute i'm tired it is a real place and you know what's even funnier they have their own money so like if you purchase something there they basically give you like monopoly money back i do live in a very rural area you need a membership so canadian talia doesn't sell ties made in canada okay so they they actually that's just the name they sell a whole bunch of different stuff like they're kind of like they're like a walmart in a way the hell came up with that name dude they're like hey and i need me some tires gonna be the name because higher means something else in canada no tire is just higher look at it look at the store like i actually look up the store no i'm good yeah that's speaking of stores superstore super let's wow that's big brain right there so now i don't even know what i'm doing half the time i'm just pressing buttons at this point hoping it you know yeah people think i like i'm a decent player or something it's literally just luck i'm telling you yeah that's what you do though you gotta try and do some crazy plays that no one else expects to see because then you know so you get a good content you come out alive the place are you alive here i'm gonna go try and go over to you yeah there's a guy over here near me somewhere below me possibly two more by managers low side by me okay i went outside um i can run underneath though towards you i'm gonna go up a second okay this gun's just better yes i have heard of loblaws by the way blah blah blah all right what's going on over here at costco one's on roof one's inside at least like second roof or top right here one directly above me above like this corner i think uh yeah actually i think you're right hold on should i challenge let me challenge got one shot gunner down you guys sound like a robot to me by the way oh no really dracula he's turned into a robot dude no wonder his norway's aim is so good i can hear both of you crystal clear like yeah you and i are fine that makes sense though because tom's a robot too and uh his name's not good so what oh see me hit that sniper jesus you guys see that hello oh yeah i forgot i can't aim you forgot you can't aim i forgot dude was my bad i'm bodying these guys now but comes down right here on that thing the guys were to the right of them at the uh there was one in front of them might have been yeah might have been daddy we're good let me go try it let me go try it so this roof you can fall off of and you're fine at the very bottom the lowest point well then it's not a good test building though no no but wait wait anyway if you run and jump if you jump off of this you would normally die okay but still what i'm saying is that like let's say you run and jump and land on this you'll still not die because this gives you elevation no it doesn't work wow it was all a ploy to get you to die to full damage just once connor i mean it was mere stone so you know i can't add to busted is a bunch of bull guy ahead two right right right i don't know where you guys are shooting uh there's a guy a car roof of car broke him inside he got the rest this guy's a big teammate here he literally broke me after he was already downed i think i pushed him out the way when i met laid the door you've been getting door blocked enough a lot today where's the head we gotta clear police c4 is on the ground these are the guys we have to fight yeah i don't think we can jump this there you go off the vehicle that's a big brain whoa you good left side police and roof police these guys are fighting no one's on a roof copy you might have been second then two teams yes it was [Music] i broke them i don't think there's a team in here but i could be very wrong nah they're all dead bottom floor uh satchel in here too oh in here in here at the bank vault oh damn didn't hear anything dude he's in the back of the truck who's in the vault actually roger oh my god dude oh god fire breath in there to the right not the close right but in there uh i think i just pray here [Applause] oh man should i have a ghost i think it goes do we want to start a contract or i mean we can just after the loadout okay [Music] oh let's operate window armor hits uh hey we're fine one's in bottom floor yep not here dude i got these this guy who denied my ass i think he went on a route dude i'm so confused different team he's coming in bottom floor [Applause] two teams so like what's happening on that yellow warning thing he's on the adjacent building had a top down on our roof it's not okay i don't actually know what's going on but two teams are dead the one on the roof is still over there though [Music] yeah he's shooting from uh yellow roof there i'm coming back he's like one hp on that roof i'm gonna push him huh hey what he's back up there oh my god didn't make any sense i'm so sorry i can't i can't figure this game out he went all the way bottom floor for no reason and then it sounded the exact same i don't know just all duty things man i guess so huh um any spa place yeah there's some on the roof and i have a playbox oh he's still up there that doesn't make any sense tom we're cursed bro we are cursed it's there's nothing there's nothing you can make sense about it all right i'm grabbing a drink i'll be right back it doesn't make any sense i just killed the full guy off there i'm gonna drop an armor box right in front of you bound i'm plating he's still in that building okay that doesn't make any sense we're actually cursed we're having fun drink and when i get back i expect you to be alone okay i'm hopping there's a guy at the buy or at the box at the box i didn't get my guns back from the roof it's too hot one team didn't say team right nothing's on beep but i think that might have been the two guys that were gonna be googling that roof perhaps i got two beeps three beeps this way they just gas the corner another cluster and i have a trophy it's right behind this rock on blue got him well done oh my god they're alive we're still alive tom and we got tons of money oh yeah i don't know where the other guy went i think he ran i think he dipped you buy all the 390 stone all right keep going get us out of here i didn't jump out jumped in i thought you jumped out man nice holy bean boy i don't know that was scary i heard uh shotgun shots here or around this area oh yeah hear it don't say any one second you can push that i hear it oh one shot from behind stairs shotgun shot me from um where tom was the truck truck oh my god oh my god the beast it's john wick oh no wonder i thought one of you downed him dude i'm dying in like half a second not even he was top floor ladder side always go ground he's going ladder i think [Applause] swiping broke it's one hp building knocked one close building one is the last at the rock yellow rock he's cutting left broke his armor i'm pushing this i'm coming with you it's pushed up to here still no armor he's going for the resident's body easy go double down another one of the another one of the house about uh it's already ahead of me triple down did you kill the other one negative i'm gonna take us to the trees here maybe yeah for sure i just had if i say i'm going to send the car away a little bit since we don't have the trophy on it i downed in here copy checking box the sniper was up at the bridge live on bridge knocked on a sniper if you can airstrike left side bridge i'd be sick uh over here live ping to our right northeast down one at the truck or the vehicle over there we have literally so many knockouts right now on every team across [Applause] that's 150 out i like this tree this is a nice tree finding down in the woods yellow mark he's about to get pushed by zone on green you [ __ ] [ __ ] oh [ __ ] that's good i can't see him 1080p oh my god he jumped my bullet all right it's all done good follow up very nice i definitely knocked oh rotating yellow mark oh i'm starting from the right sniper on the right side from the right let's kill that guy where we last killed the guy is it tense i'm getting owned from stadium it's very tense it's very tense no is it tense not intense it's intense intense 100 super intense i got hit from the right kill them this is your final two three v two both right stadium okay i'm pinching right oh oh four left four left far left uh to west directly west oh the perfect frag down one close broken broken left side just added me directly broken down two down that's it that's it you get hit by one bullet whilst you're scoped in with hdr you're looking at the freaking sky that's true all right so good fight at superstore when we didn't fight anybody good job they call this book yeah did we even fight anybody nobody wouldn't fight a single person that's the whole reason we went there well we got a lot of money there that was good at least yeah and then it was just downhill from [Music] there you
