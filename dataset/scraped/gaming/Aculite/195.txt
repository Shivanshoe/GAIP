if you watch stairs I can go I can watch this way but I swear I heard somebody yeah yeah he's I think he's basement two three yeah definitely basement maybe four do that one more one more I think maybe just three hit that's gonna be it I think my gun jammed there else I was gonna go for the next guy myself others say what the hell a moose - is very small cities made here it's so cute yeah did I love doing head shots and you just don't even you don't even damage the helmet or their best cuz it's a face shot alright I'm ready to extract I'll see you the next raid by now I'm serious I think I could easily extract those those ridiculous I mean and I guess like I'm fully kitted this issue I mean the val is just so much fun it really is is good maybe it's just every gun in this game I don't know I'm out [Music] yeah I don't know we will have to watch they look back cuz I think he damaged you as well unless you got damaged by ask a person yeah damaged by the previous player that I took out I killed the guy like right before I don't don't that's why I was so late in the moment cuz I kept one guy and then I thought I heard one in front of the checkpoint I was like he's got ya at that point you just didn't you stopped listening to everything even if you say okay cuz I'm I feel like sometimes a lot of like stuff I need to ignore like what people say stuff sometimes Adam yeah I'm pretty bad like that too people start talking me giving me a call it's I'm like okay what I'm actually I'm playing my own game I'm not listening at all yep cuz how many times you died too because people are talking and you kinda like oh it's just like I should just try it yourself yeah and you have to tune them out in the middle of a fight or whatever alright the dorms yeah there's just in the dorms area doesn't need to be in sight dorms by the way yeah that I think the areas are quite big yeah cuz I think it was the same thing when I had to go into factory and I had to kill them in like a office area there's that zone itself is huge I like that mission sky bus maybe I don't know I heard shotguns stuff that sounded like it was outside not inside yeah nice over towards dude dorms do you want to go wall around you wanna go yeah I was mmm new stories yeah balcony sorry let's do that start the wall fighting don't make sure there's nobody up here first okay I think three stores Claire

ahead a little bit further there guy one dead okay I'm gonna let you go footsteps and Silverdale okay how many do you need I just completed it sweet my turn one was dead up at the tree and then just closer towards away yeah yeah I'm worried you killed these guys there's a lot of shotgunning under grenades and stuff going off so I think might be Scouts I just had a scab in there I think they would

hearing yeah what are you yeah this office within so far it Owens oh I got dumb dude no no are you serious I'm goofing around for a bit was it a scav um I can't tell you let me know for his Oh think it was yeah I was asked a beautiful spot my whole way come on dude sniper scam how much time is Lucknow sniper Steph is down I might have to just leave your gear it is yeah whatever that's fine I can't even fit your tag at home oh my god dude sniper staff is insane no oh it's a player oh I make more sense then there's like four or five of them really I'm just that man hmm yeah they're all dead go for yep okay what are the odds man just that you know what I think is I think they might have been from a different she was gonna say like big they all scabbed in from the raid previously like if they were on a team earlier I'd say yeah search him for quick key cards don't work Renee it's you know what though it's a good thing I went after them because they probably would have found your gear if that was the case oh yeah like it was like on the hill plus he killed me right what else keys get it back I get it back I mean I had a lot of loot on me too he can fit anything I'm afraid to go up on the hill to be real to fit some more stuff I just had no luck tonight that's how I've been like that honest to god like when I was playing with know why I was playing with you the other day and that's what happened yeah just how it goes every now and then it's Tyco that is tarkov some days he it's good some days it's just the worst yeah all right no exit campers perfect get me out of this raid that was insane only eleven kxb for that got these two players off the start to more scavs I think these were just a I neither two players after that then I know five of the players after that we're player scavs alright now we got three to two three more of those big bags which is nice pretty decent run all right so I'm gonna repair my armor I figured I'd leave this party and I'll show you guys because I know some people are interested in what goes on afterwards after the raids and I guess kind of how you set up and stuff that's understandable especially if you've never played the game before so basically after a run I'll just really prepare my gear I'll fill back up on ammo grenades meds and all that stuff and then I'll sell everything else that I got or keeps keep a little bit of stuff these key cards these labs key cards works like 189 carry now on the market which is nice so I kind of repair what I can even if I got it off players or repair a little bit and then I sell everything to therapist because she gives you the most for like some meds dog tags rare items and all that type of stuff and then the armor that I repaired and it's some attachments I will sell to skier because you gives you the most for that type of stuff and then the rest I sell to mechanic he takes it and then blasts proper if I have any extra grenades or stuff like leftover but I did make one mistake this run I actually didn't realize it when I was playing that armor that kill armor that it just sold it was a it was damaged too much to even repair it to a point where I could sell it for a decent mount of money so I should just left that and took some more guns well that's pretty much it and then I gear back up and I just go back into another read hope you guys enjoyed [Music] you
