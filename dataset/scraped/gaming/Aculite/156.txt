calling me out for using rpg okay but i use it on vehicles big difference big difference are we going to push this route really are we really about to do this i think there's only two up there right let's do it it's good on the other side parachuted in there so there might be three stick tight stack up i have two sun grades so low and tight let's move roger there i feel like we're playing a campaign mission who said that stunning out then we go three two one stop hit go go go go left left left three knocks all dead yikes you jumped in front of my full spray i couldn't do anything yeah i'm trying not to sprint i'm gonna go through this side copy that there's two guys on stone side and one on your side i call it from what i can tell okay one just threw c4 on my door i'm afraid to do this when i'm doing it i got two c4s on my door here oh and a bouncing betty [ __ ] found one coming off the right guy okay my plane works wait there won't be two guys there's only two guys perfect did they even know you came up no they had no idea so this guy like he had like i guess a claymore or something at this door so what you do is you just you jump out the side on the balcony yeah yeah from the side here and then i went around the the outside post and then i just got guys the guy at the other uh on the other stairwell he put his claim on the inside here so as soon as i went to the top of the stairs oh okay he would know so i couldn't i i had to just wait i don't think he would get killed i'm down on the street i'm moving to a screen marker any rockets yeah do you have rock do you have rockets i have six oh heck yeah man i'm trying not to snipe today but it's just so hard not to snipe so i brought in an rpg well i mean i'm trying to get to a secondary gun but i need will you stop judging me all right it doesn't matter what you do i see me throwing shade you want to go buy a cellphone i see him wait yeah he's getting some self-resistance there you go yo it's crazy man trios feels a lot more calm because i guess people play duos as well in this yes people will duo in and they'll duo with a random third sometimes and they probably split up that's probably what happened with the first guy yeah yeah it feels so much the thing is if you're gonna do oq you probably aren't gonna duo no fill into squads probably going to duo in the trios yeah we're we're the only idiots who do that yeah exactly over here getting slapped around okay acula can you are you going to judge me for using double graw then yes what okay what can i use man literally any other weapon like what do you mean you could use an mp5 you could use not an m4 you could use not a growl kill these guys oh you got me flanking right oh the stun i'm selfing i'm good i'm good let me armor nice [ __ ] it careful the other roof to the right there up some plates real quick shoot he's got it he's got it eod i'm coming back it's so dangerous he's up on the roof is your makeup picking up those

the runs okay i don't see anyone on this roof zone oh yeah i do two guys one jumped off so there's just one guy up there oh it's a decoy god damn it i saw the flash and i was like oh god he's prone with a sniper in here in here outside of the buy station he's at the buy station he's easy kill i'm anymore he might be in the tents uh far ahead straight ahead 155 somewhere there's one in the tent two that's two right he's got plates i kind of want there's plates on these guys not going on anymore no we can use the body close south above uh yeah you jumped on our roof no stun yeah i mean we can crawl up real quick get ahead let's get ahead of this yeah we need to get out we'll catch him coming in he 100 jump maybe he's going to buy his buddy back in did you go all the way are you maniac i fell off i killed him across bridge or under bridge guy in the road ahead team wipe some more one guy on the roof on blue i'm crossing this guy inside yellow ground floor as well one more glass guy

there's three guys left careful let's wait wait a second here pretty good okay all right all right all right i'm gonna come to the roof with you guys then i accidentally fell someone open the door below me right below me hey dude killed nice and uh c4 right onto me where stone said under me c4 it's a charge can he get in this building here on blue because we can just wait him out the zone's going to push him out is that the only door it should be it's 3v3 it's 3v3 i'm thinking check down in the river here it's like uh nothing in river nothing a river there has to be mocking you i mean i don't see anybody from up here i heard a door oh i fell oh god for you cover me boys it should be good that was kind of sick actually that was a solid game it's kind of nice not using a sniper yeah
