so if you're fortunate enough to play during this day during a specific time you will know how broken warzone was and let me tell you it was broken but at the same time it was a little bit fair and let me explain i don't know if an intern hit a knob pressed a button whatever it was they allowed you to drop directly into warzone rebirth island wherever with your loadout immediately so as long as you chose your loadout before the game started you're able to drop in with whatever you whatever you wanted sniper rocket launcher ar smgs you had all your perks stun grenades whatever you wanted but on top of that because you're able to choose your loadout you're actually able to choose your field upgrade as well because of this two seconds before the match all you had to do was press dead silence and you had dead sounds the entire match the entire match as long as you didn't die i think i saw one guy come back from uh from the gulag or whatever and he still had it on or something i don't know if it was just a bug or if it just kept your fov the way it was i have no idea but i have a couple games to show you guys on rebirth island we had a lot of fun playing on rebirth kind of like a nice little break from her dance to be honest get lots of chances to come back you can use a bunch of different weapons that you normally wouldn't really be able to use on berdansk and the lighting is just so much better anyways as always if you guys enjoyed please give the video a thumbs up and i'll catch you guys in the next one nice like i did silence on yeah yeah you kidding me that sounds the entire match why would you not yeah but if you die you don't get it right yeah yeah the guy had it he came back alive with it but if you uh if you die right now you don't get to do this okay because then you come back with a munitions box i think oh all right i say we go control center here apparently this is the other hot drop where's that control center control control center control you sorry you should be back in a moment thank you dude this guy juked me so hard how would your writ how would you raise your fps yeah the daddy do i think it's like a daddy first landing on you [ __ ] he's landing on you he's jumped off the building now he's landing on you oh i'm sorry could you not hear me and they went [ __ ] ah oh yeah one second lay down you lose it are you sure yep

have we're three for three on this right now it's because we get 18 tries to come back sure i almost hit alt f4 i don't know why my brain was thinking that but it was definitely accurate wait i have my loadout you actually just pushed all the effort i have my little right so i do too wait i do too what did we do oh no i'm dead i down that guy what another glitch no no no no feature yeah it's a feature man this is a triple-a studio this thing also breaks i i don't everyone has their loadouts okay this is cheater do you think it's a cheater give me level 1000. what's going on you can change your loadout you can change it if you don't want that one anymore oh my gosh what the heck this is oh wait wait wait no no okay after that last game it said there was a playlist update after that very last game that we just played that's what it said playlist i'm dead what is that yeah we're still in rebirth yeah but maybe they changed it there isn't a version of rebirth that gives you a loadout but it said playlist update am i stuck there why does no one listen to me thank you for listening to me that was a nasty angle oh baby get mad get mad turn him up there's another guy on the roof i
