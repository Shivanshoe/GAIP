[Music] all right welcome to realism ground war so i want to hop into this with in the battle pass here there is a blueprint that i think is just super cool this mp7 one i'll show you what it looks like in a second here i'm not going to change it up whatsoever but it has a thermal and a canon sight on it let me show you it's the bengal one yeah this one look how sweet that looks i think that looks just amazing that looks really nice oh look at it it even says goodbye at the end of the barrel here it looks pretty sweet you can definitely make this a better weapon but i like the skin i like the way it looks let me try it out since it has a thermal on it i figured we'd hop into uh some realism ground war try to go for the head shots because it does a little bit more damage i believe so it should make it a little bit easier for me to get kills like i said you can definitely make this a little bit better you can obviously you know the stippled grip which is pretty much the best for like everything could add a laser sight especially for realism mode it'd be a little bit easier to hit hit hip fires but we're going to hop in and see how well it does all right let's test this thing out let's see how it handles they really did they removed the horn from this didn't they as far as i know you can't you can't use a horn on this anymore it's like they added it for a brief time and then you just can't use it anymore i don't understand it's uh let's sneak up here never mind damn he's using a thermal too all right wow the game couldn't tell me that there was a tank in front of my teammate because so far we're not off to a great start that's all right we shall manage so this is the thing if they're using uh if they're using ghost i think it is they won't show up it's gonna make it that much more difficult head shots though we just gotta go from the right side this guy shoots me again i'm not gonna be able to see him i don't know where he was these guys are the most aware players in the world this thermal really helps that's a double kill there we go it's helping i don't know if i necessarily need a thermal in order to use it like this oops oh he knows i'm here i'm watching too many angles here let's see if we can sneak up sorry i had to do it what are you guys doing here this is insanity this is actually really fun to use i like this ah they just kept coming back was this the guy with the thermal yeah an og with the thermal never thought i would see the day i guess i never would have thought i'd be using an mp7 with thermal either but it seems to be working well i mean realism ground war right i think you're doing you do increase headshot or damage in general so it's not like it's necessarily a bad a bad play everything's pretty much viable at this point i will say this though it'd be nice if you could change it so that the environment is white and enemies turn up white or black just so you can toggle it also thank god they added a sound effect for this knowing when you kill enemies because right now it's it's pretty tough wait okay that doesn't really work oh i killed him so thermal doesn't go through the window here this is just white hot but i can see enemies and i could shoot them through this i don't think he has any idea where it's coming from that's a crazy little spot if you had a better magnification scope and it wasn't thermal that's actually a disgusting spot i don't know if i should be showing people that that's gonna be used against me snag that this works to my advantage i can see everything it's like the smoke doesn't even exist oh we got them pinched and the third one go in there ah you might have cold-blooded but i can still spite yeah you can make it up here that's incredible this is so deadly if you had a sniper this is the perfect spot also the great the best spot to get sniped from too wait what how did you guys even get over here i will say this the game looks really good when it doesn't have as much hud if they could even remove even more of it be pretty sweet i don't think you can do that with kind of like ruining the gameplay though of course there's a guy there i just how am i missing these guys they're just point blank all right let's go over to d see it looks a lot more immersive when there's not as much hud all the smoke in that this white phosphorus by the way it does so much damage so much damage in in this mode oh we won hell yeah hey watch your fire all right watch your fire come over there yeah we did okay not too bad guys playing the new map a little bit i like this this is a good loadout i like it i don't think it's all that viable in like maybe normal tdm or anything like that it's pretty slow to ads so you more or less have to catch people off guard but ground war thermal mp7 realism mode that's actually kind of fun i enjoy that you
