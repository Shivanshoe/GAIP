take my American accent and then if I add a little bit make it try and make it sound a little more sweet a little bit more polite and then add uh a rounded around it sound to the to the XNA there's kind of kind of its kind of American but it's also got a little maybe he's maybe he's a quibec woz or something something of that nature so it's kind of still American but it's it's they pull down the sounds at the end of the sentence hey it's too good is too good you're like an Australian accent like an Australian exit they basically go up at the end of every sentence even yes not even a guess exactly the same as a New Zealand accent pretty much but they go up at the end of every sentence whereas New Zealanders don't do that it's like a softer version you know I bet yet in the fine my name
