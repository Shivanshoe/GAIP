[Music] [Music] oh my god both right there you're so mean oh that's great everyone shot yeah hi you look pretty oh god get me out of here it's got to be one of my favorite things to do shoot a flare gun at somebody and then wall bang them afterwards actually just shooting through walls in general is really satisfying this you can shoot through all types of wood it's kind of insane how many things you can shoot through this is a sponsored video so a big thank you to crytek for sponsoring this video i love coming back to this game it's always a good time i think now more than ever it's probably one of the best times to play the game because they keep adding it new stuff all the time and it even hinted of another new map coming out and the creepy guy that you saw in the intro there is a new hunter that just came out his name is monroe and he's from the committed dlc probably one of the creepiest hunters i've ever seen them add to this game if not the creepiest reason i say it's probably one of the best times is because you can actually play solos now and that's through a game mode called quick play so you don't get to deck out your hunter yourself they give you a free hunter and whatever you get is what you get so you go into the game against a bunch of other solos and you go and see how well you can do so you can scavenge around the map see if you can find some better weapons obviously some better gear you know some meds all that type of stuff and not too recently they added scrap beak which is a new boss and this is one of the hardest bosses to solo in my opinion he picks up everything around the area and just like throws it on his back so you can't use anything against him in the area whatever you come in with is what you come in with there's no there's no items you can pick up but if you've never heard of this game before basically it's a pvp ve game and you verse ai while searching for clues these clues will reveal the boss you want to kill the boss grab the bounty and extract with it but one of my favorite things about this game is the sound design look at this at the main menu you can go through the weapons you want to see whatever weapon you want to choose and you can check how or what it sounds like at certain ranges no other game does this it's so unique so if you're at all interested and i do highly suggest checking this game out it's a lot of fun hunch showdown check out the links in the description below thank you very much for watching and i hope you enjoy your gun goes to the ground yeah the thing's massive man does mine do that no are you looking down yeah straight down no not quite you're almost touching like your uh your uh scope is going into the ground like that's how far into the ground it's going now you touch yeah it's a long boy a walking stick it is man it is i'm getting to that age spider banishing well there are both already vanishing all right i guess we don't have to do anything in this game we just leave reset just reset this guy hit him one inside again he's dead knocked him out okay nice there you go tried to wall bang this guy actually wait i do think i did follow him what you got for me brother shotgun and conversion this guy's got a sawed-off shotgun it looks like i take it well someone's aggressive one's that good uh emma later said right over there i know sometimes they run randomly but i know weird oh it's got to my right close right close right let's push here hit him get him once got him now [Applause] there we go very cool did you knock the other one that was here in the building right window hold on did you knock you didn't knock this one no i didn't okay these guys are down there's two guys in the window shooting at it get them both now we must hit different guys then because i hit this guy with an uppercut no yeah i think he hit the second guy that i just downed hopefully these guys can't see me oh that's the other bounty yeah they were sitting in this window and then that far window on this side yeah i've been trying to look over there i haven't seen them once see him in the this photo well it pushed out using that window right there on the thing i hit him please he's down i just think i just heard him die i'm going upper hit one through the wall okay i think they're on your side he's dynamited me it could be in this corner room pretty sure one's below yeah they can jump down there get knocked one downstairs with me [Music] i'm pushing around behind him knife them checking nothing around us nice man and not knowing the rotation on the pistols like when you can fire them again that's rough there's spamming it yeah you're just spamming it waiting for it to shoot i guess we get northwest here oh my god look at this they had eight bear traps here and a trap in front of the door no what the oh now this hurts at the the door down there are you ready for someone yeah they're ready for me apparently thanks man i think he's going to be in the forest ahead of me here he's right here behind this on this mark i saw him to the right at once twice that could be anything i can't i can't i gotta push up i can't hit him i got one nice thank you i really need to heal yeah i got my name hit him with that it's flashed i got okay i'm good i'm good this it's okay yeah i had no choice but to push up i didn't want to shoot you either because you guys were kind of like bouncing around i know i know it's okay you watch now we're getting a third partied immediately where are they at here comes see see missed is there a guy over to your right or something maybe not no one's in there i hear one on one yeah i think he pushed back he pushed back behind the wall here they're moving back to the right is that trying to run yeah i think so yep
