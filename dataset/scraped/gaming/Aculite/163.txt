welcome to World War Z big thanks to focus Home Interactive for sponsoring this video if you've been on the channel for a little while now you know that I played this game roughly about a year ago to date and every time I do I always have a lot of fun it's just incredible to me how they can get so many AI so many zombies or zieks as they call them in this on the screen at the same time and your game just runs so smooth I don't understand it it's magic it really is so the game of the Year Edition is now available as a full standalone version if you're new player or if you already own the game you can just upgrade as a paid expansion the game is also available on consoles so you can purchase the new location as well as the characters or if you already own the season pass and it's included in that a couple other things they've added a bunch of new guns since I last played as well as some cosmetics for completely free and they've even added a horde mode which I have yet to dip my toes into so if you guys are into that and you like what you see feel free to visit the link in the description below where you can get the game for yourself a highly recommended one of my favorite zombie games to date and I'm gonna be playing with sacral Jack frags as well as tomographic in this video there links will be in the description as well some really fun guys highly suggest checking them out
