secure [Music] strength [Music] [Music] so i've been playing a little bit of battlefield 2042 and i must say it's coming along nicely it's not initially where i wanted it to be on its release date but they are making progress with the game and thank goodness they made the changes for the ars the assault rifles so that they're actually usable now which is kind of funny because i'm gonna be mentioning what my one of my favorite things to do in this game is and it's using the m5 with an smg setup which is the short barrel and the close combat magazine now they recently released rush which is one of my favorite game modes from previous battlefields and they brought it over to the portal mode so we're able to mess around in that for a little while i guess until they take it away but this thing absolutely shreds it's not good at long range but i suppose that's the whole point of the plus system you can attach and reattach and unattach things as you go which is nice so if you are interested this is what i'm using for it with the angled grip and i'm gonna be playing as irish with my good friend ryan on some rush we had some good teammates we had a lot of fun hope you enjoy please thank you there's a gun what do you think of them adding armor to the new battlefield i don't know if ever asked i don't like it i honestly don't like it it creates inconsistencies i think it makes angel way overpowered oh he was up top yeah angel's pretty wild okay so i don't know if you know this the sensor balls you can press e on them or your interact key and they become yours oh they're yours they can become yours just check them i'm reloading how's it going this this game is literally more call of duty than call of duty i haven't seen a vehicle yet in this one is this a no vehicle no yeah there's vehicles not like um i just mean on this map oh my god ruined oh yep there's there's a vehicle there's a couple vehicles that's one of my uh grapes with uh ak24 the last unlock is the uh drum mag she think it'd be really good well one it's only um 51 bullets you know it's like playing tarkov i thought it was gonna be like 95 or something yeah once you played tarkov it's tough to go back on ak weapons i'm in there they're not let's see if i can get spawned on you make sure oh wait what what just happened um i'm not sure are we getting it is it disarmed they defused it that was the most confusing fight i've ever been in a video game the t the enemies were shooting each other i thought the guy was on my team oh my god ryan this is the spot right here got a good one oh you're up top oh yeah this is the spot right here we got it there's no way we lose this this is impossible awesome i feel like they added uh ammo or the armor because warzone had it i think that's why they have the crazy sliding as well i really hope that's not the reason they just wanted to do their own thing but who knows god you guys are the best squad ever everyone's rezzing i always have ammo that's the way we're not wasting tickets because of it i only have one shield i'm just gonna stay prone here yep yep stay prone there very good idea pain pain ensues oh more pain got him got him they're pushing though i'm just gonna check nades towards those uh marks i'm gonna smoke us keep crawling brother i'm going to be cool if you could like uh sprint crown yeah i know exactly drain actually get up oh you get way more experience for resupplying this i just realized yeah i bet 25 for now in the other it's uh only five well there's less people in this too right yeah it's like it's probably because it's a bigger difference really uh oh he made it in get him teammate hell yeah brother behind his teammate there's a little bird here really oh no no i saved it surprised they didn't make a squad um voice pumps at least apparently that's something that they're going to add and like every other game just make them disable the bubble ball yeah you would think that they would have it like right away though right i don't know how i saved this ellie but i did save it but it's a good use there but i feel like my controls have changed i think they should at least have it where within the match you can see how you did because unless you're during the match looking at your score i'll have no idea how you did in the end yeah like and it's not even it has nothing to do with like my squad mates like if they didn't do good they didn't do good that's fine i just want to know how i did no i'm very surprised they gave us a heli on this and why isn't there like there you go [Music] i got out hey i'm planting the objective nice oh you don't see me nice got the guy below yeah this heli has been on fire about 90 percent of his match now surprise they haven't finished yet we got it nice wait is there another objective that's it oh okay yeah i thought that was the end the man sniped me out right at the end excellent job well done [Music] rush is fun i'm surprised more people haven't run smokes yet most are the best okay let's make sure i got a short barrel on this oh it's cool having a spun up here yeah it gives a little height advantage snipers can hang out like this guy the rest of us can parachute in and parachute in we shall now i wish i had a rocket already beamed oh i don't know if this is going to work there's three of them here he comes oh no no so i'm using the uh the m5 with the smg setup i got a short barrel on it and the oh that's a tank the short barrel and the smg rounds on it so the fire rates increase so much it's pretty good you should try it if you have stuff unlocked for it it's kind of wild i gotta add the mic okay i can't fight that ooh fred kill there you go fighting rage maybe not oh maybe i did i can't tell anymore so many mixed emotions you win so many battles if you have the armor yeah it's kind of unreal enemy neutralized let's get close i'm gonna use that advantage as long as i can yeah see like i would have killed that guy right there if he didn't have armor that's a grenade oh he's gonna get me all right this is much more manageable to be able to well when it runs way better but you can also go on bigger sprees yeah that's the thing right everything's manageable exactly like you said what there's so many people you always uh there's always gonna be one person on your flank that gets you or whatever oh my goodness oh shoot you might be able to get me i have a shield down here okay now we're here oh got one on the left now hold on oh shoot this guy in the crack got you in the crack between the crack yeah nice okay my body fell though did your body fall okay i'm right above if you give up i'm right above them yep i'll uh be nice and clean nice and quiet should i get a spawn beacon maybe it might be worth yeah i'm going to do it perfect i'm gonna need that oh there's one up here with us oh your body fell oh no hold on uh yeah you probably can't get me yeah you can't come here up i'm gonna need a hospital can go for the plants slaying i'm trying i've island the fence is up i'm reloading yeah they aren't even on the point [Applause] nice no way it worked the spawn beacon i feel like a's gonna be the toughest one to get okay we got shield and we got anti-explosives down well the thing's open behind you too careful um what can you throw an explosive a scar grenade launch this yep there's some ammo oh that's a car he's dead nice guy gonna try to disarm it got him right on me i slid hold on i gotta watch it i feel like we're two manning a lot of this feels like it i'm gonna go behind enemy lines the best flank ever i think i think they're on it there's so many oh they're coming i've seen them on the minimap oh they're coming i got a launcher from the crate all right okay the two of our other squads have spawn beacons on that side we should get one on this side so yeah get them from both angles no don't please we were right there oh there is another i think there's even a beacon down there is oh the tv walked right past that dude bad wolf oh my god what's happening here they didn't even happen okay so this is exactly what happened that other match like i was so confused what was going on yeah we're not going to win it okay oh it's at it good try [Music] you
