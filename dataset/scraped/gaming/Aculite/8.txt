[Music] wow he really didn't hear me [Music] and with the left and the right [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm really starting to like this barrel now now that i can control the recoil a little bit better [Music] got him [Music] oh he's hurting he's hurting [Music] always wanted to try this [Music] this is not this is not gonna end well oh this is really not gonna end well oh it didn't work out as expected hey we got him though [Music] gotta cross the bridge all right oh come on bitsy turn over that's not good okay well yikes i guess we're swimming i think he wants to fight maybe i made a mistake he's just insane at the game hey shot i'm a little bit quicker yeah i knew you wouldn't push that it'd be kind of dumb because you're like you don't know at which point i'm on that ridge right a good little fight though oh there he is body shot the vehicle coming back oh no my vehicle rolled away not ideal not ideal um just gotta get across the bridge i think it's gonna be the toughest part the heck's going on here somebody flipped it that's got to be a bot there's no way unless you know what maybe not maybe not maybe he was just scared to shoot at me it's got a lot of loot so it's kind of questionable what's the guy in front of me i remember the guy from earlier right no way it could have been the other guy had to suppress car 98 all right here we go could be the end of the road quite literally [Music] there's a buggy there i don't know if that spawns there smoke here am i blind there's like there's vehicles everywhere what's happening here why you actually saw me nice grenade man how did mine not hit you though or maybe it did can i check death cam or am i just ruined now that was risky what i was doing i kind of deserved that death definitely deserved it the heck hey we got two people to fight okay we got one person to fight there's a very good chance this guy's gonna want to push over now i actually don't know what his plan is now so he's not pushing over shoot him in the red zone too i think it would have been smart for him to push over personally guess you wanted to take a long range fight maybe load up a little bit more i don't know i wonder if he's still here he's just sitting here mortaring a second ago is he just wanting to use the mortar like i don't understand what's happening should i just drive up on this guy i'm afraid he's gonna kill me if i drive up on him i can't hit him what is this fight yo i'm sick and tired i just want to drive up goodness oh that was the longest fight ever he had six hp left on his best oh no i could probably take the balti but i really want to get better with dmr's i feel like i'm i'm struggling with that oh he's down at the house he went down the hill that's clean where are you a little left more oh yeah you like that one huh probably get that airdrop 30 something like that see like if i was using an mt4 there i definitely could have killed that guy right away [Applause] [Applause] uh somebody else kills me somebody else kills me nothing i can do he's gonna be forced from the zone in a second here though i shot my vest is completely ruined so he could just need right now i don't know how he sees me or is he just shooting he might just be shooting to shoot yeah he's just shooting to shoot he has no idea he doesn't know that i backed off he's damaged i'd be surprised if he keeps driving we desperately need to find more five five or else i'm just ruined like i got nothing then the jammer packs would be pretty cool though i like that i kind of think it should run out faster or zones should be a little quicker [Music] ah damn it kind of need to kill this guy not a happy man i might actually want to do this my plan was to stick with the mini but i guess we did have enough ammo to end it come on oh my goodness oh my goodness luckiest man alive this one he went over a mound as it was a bit dead shot him look over there somewhere can't we get up on this roof or something or is that a different oh shoot that's a not a person we're fine [Music] oh no no no [Music] i like that that tractor's still in play there's two people there was definitely one over this way i just i i don't know if someone's behind me if someone's behind me then i could be screwed 1v1 situation no frags got a couple stuns though that's good i'm not gonna lie i'm a little bit nervous should i be i don't know but this guy's a gamer but he just takes my head off one shot he's got to be this guy over here right once we figure out which rock he's behind we might be able to push with like some smokes and stuff but realistically like he's gotta come to me what if i miss reading this what if he's actually behind me he's at the tractors or something oh he's right there go for it [Music] oh my goodness the one hp oh i think i headshot him right didn't i i can't check i can't scroll down or else he still has a helmet on so i want to know if i damaged him in the head or not i'm not gonna lie that's that made me nervous i didn't think i was winning that holy moly did you [Music] you
