[Music] yeah so i mean i don't think it's hit scan but it's so close to hit scan that it is hit scan and now [Laughter] i mean yeah wherever the zone goes we could just take the train elsewhere you know yeah also train station is just a great starting location thank you tom i've always said it no you have it come on yes i have are you taking my spot away landing here yesterday for the meme we were like oh fine we'll go train station never been there before yeah we gotta stop doing this just drill the same joke into the ground over and over again yeah well you know it's called recycling content yeah reduce reuse recycle you've done them plain mcflurry apple pie combo i have actually done that tom it's very nice yeah it does not sound good at all it's incredible oh no okay right apple pie in a cold ice cold mcflurry the apple pies in the u.s and canada are not the same i know the uk ones are insane oh okay they're very good there's the difference oh dude there's there's subpar in the u.s tom never been i mean they're like baked pastries they're not it's not the one yeah it's like they're thrown into a toaster they're not great oh no have you ever been to the uk connor no never if you ever come mcdonald's apple pie do it stab fest then you can go home corner then you can go home just come specifically for that yeah i think it'll be worth the 500 flight yeah or you could just make it like a good mail yeah mail mail it you know what i'll send you guys back a bag of milk i'm sure mcflurry's pretty similar so we can just think of the apple part you guys can say you can have your own bag of milk you've seen these kind of no i haven't oh my god the giant star wars news 60 oh my god i need that good oh yeah i need that is it it's over here it's way back here we passed it hmm i just feel like you know i might as well make most of the new things of course yeah someone's rest right here though anyway train station it's fun oh yeah oh yeah this is a fair weapon oh yeah mental right that doesn't seem to happen he was doing the whole time connor well i'm out of this guy you're welcome man you're welcome for the kill um that's all me i'll take the credit for that can you send me the clip and i'll put on twitter i mean it does show that i have the kill uh because don't forget hold out your gun yeah because if you pull out a sniper and then you have to fight you're doomed i mean have you seen this not like we're all running and can't switch within a sneeze someone's been here have you seen the easter egg by the way my guns are broken before what finished a bit of multiplayer i have them put down by my side like i'm sprinting around you can get two specialist tokens if you do yeah every single perk in the game there we go that's fine yeah mental it seems like doesn't it stud no i can't know what you said i can't shoot guaranteed juggernaut guarantees can't shoot guys you can't shoot no no my guns are down by my side it's like i'm walking around in a cinematic weapon i tried that i already tried that no uh take my weapon i can melee what if i down myself does that work fixed oh god yeah you're gonna have to down yourself i think okay um somebody needs to catch me on the bottom okay i guess i'm going back down i need to pull a quick stone he's not c4 where's the guy i'm not gonna waste a c4 this is free damage baby um let's go connor all right 360. i dropped my weapons last second that was sick but now you've broken it oh timing they didn't see that it's fine no it's still broken well this is fun i can't wait this is weird i've heard it's quite buggy it's probably because you're n a i don't know i think i tried to swap weapons like as the train doors were closing or something and it might have knowing me to use the right words right on me he's right on me yeah there's people here and people on here is he coming you're just running up i'm mailing them with my bird [Applause] who needs weapons this is great how do you know how do you know which way it goes i don't know well that one is coming the zone is coming as well the train won't go though if it's into the zone i read that notes okay oh yeah you're right there it is is that the right one well well yeah because you just will find out there's two oh jack we need to get this one this is the best um [Music] okay i don't trust you guys at all what if we're going the wrong way now yes is it fixed victory oh my god hell yeah thank you twitch chat these are fantastic tourists by the way i got killed last time went off this track so just you know team on the roof still which was fun i still got one your way stud endless yeah yeah right on the other side of you roger brook he's got an origin dead one nice now look at the roof now look at the roof up here there's just one guy there there's more there's more there's a little one you're on green he's peeking again roof he's dead there we go did you hit him too after this yeah [Applause] there's a guy here on green somewhere jump it down [Applause] this is the most fun i've ever had in a video game redowned him playing hey my mother's a nice lady oh oh what does he mean let me ask you this are you happy that it's currently in the game or would you be happier than it would be oh absolutely but what if they just kept it in for like just a few days for weeks this is what they do right like they're releasing it's gonna be really bad it's fun and encourages people to buy the battle pass and then i'll never forget think about how overpowered we thought the hdr was this has got to be an oversight though i don't think it's a glitch well i heard shots down on green somewhere what do you see what are you saying over here there you go oh no i'm so dead i'm so dead mean the other team hasn't pushed you jack you got this it's 1v3 anyone's getting down [Applause] she's a mountain nice on the right oh [Music] what's cracked here the reef is on blue or green you're cracked jack frank franks still more on the roof yep he's lit shoot him shooter tom all right pistol i got him for you oh come on dude i was freaking i'm just going absolutely i don't know i saw you guys jumping around like rabbits up there i was scared for you tom i was scared for you i pretend i'm going to lose a melee battle accolade protect and attack that's right you don't lose melee battles against pistols everyone knows this spectaculite retaculate he protect you right but he also accurate oh found one down the one that was running roofing sound roof down [Applause] [Applause] [Music] i could never do that that would ruin my voice he just left his buddy one's in the truck as far as i know rtb playing csgo oh that's one of my favorite guns to use [Applause] oh i don't have the hit scan one broken broken yeah you can hit him with 400 broken down down [Music] it's disgusting teammates there you don't even sound disgusted you sound like you're having the time of your life another day in warzone i'm not 220 oh i just broke that guy down [Music] [Applause] oh my god they probably think they're just being shot by cheers come on stop there we go drive wait wait for me jack's gone oh hey what happened to the other guy

come on and get ghosts as well so i can get that fun weapon they probably played it now they probably play it now stand out yeah two there on us i'll hit it again oh god he had too much up there oh my god damn he's a good shot i love these new weapons i know they're not like the best especially when the one becomes balanced okay let me specify here hold on they're the best in like the right situations for sure like val is uh we got a res on blue as well 100 not the best sniper in the game might be under the bridge [Applause] that's three down now should we pursue that yeah let's do that yeah i'm sending him out sending that guy on me repositioning stop right there right there [Applause] pretty sure it's working as intended we want them to keep it like this this is the worst gun i've ever used in water here's why don't bother using the r 700 wow this is terrible this is the someone's typing from the other roof this is that's a killer easy kill where'd you want it just called in the loadout connor's just uh over here guys oh snipe it down below on towards my green marker by sniping us from like green sight for sword whoa okay it's broken [Applause] wait why you calling me a loser i just finished you off right there on purpose the guy the shot started oh yeah they got the roof i killed him he was being shot from below though there's another one on the move oh roger from

run through down a guy over here jack the target okay [Applause] yeah and then i'm thinking we go over here and repel up no we're just gonna start two of them oh being beamed from there [Music] my body hurts in real life that's how you know it's really that's probably how everyone else feels too freaking sniping 24 7 with that thing holy guy just dropped okay let's go let's go back oh he's up here oh no oh no he's like underneath but up i don't know what how old is excellent oh i see i'm gonna say i'm a samson i can't believe you guys will win he's gonna run around moving here not the
