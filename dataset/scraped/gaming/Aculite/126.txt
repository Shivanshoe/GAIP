which window is breakable oh you rest just outside [Applause] with the front it broke them did he go in or [Applause] um yep i'm dead like 100 i'm getting reported i killed him in here with no vision whatsoever just failing waldum i might need to actually take this gun from you i might need to try this thing so it appears there is another bug or uh oversight in warzone or modern warfare so if you guys have already realized or seen i'm sure you guys have the spr 208 i believe it is the sniper rifle has bugged magazines it's not what this video is on but i figured i'd tell you anyways it has two bugged magazines the two last ones when you equip those into the sniper rifle it makes the gun hit scan what exactly does that mean well this gun here compared to all the other sniper rifles have bullet velocity bullet travel time bullet drop it's the bullet's a physical object but when you equip these magazines and make the gun hit scan what that does is make the bullet non-existent it's just immediately point and click so as you can assume that's pretty overpowered and a lot of people have figured that out by now but what the new trend seems to be is this as val with 10 routers what it does is makes the gun semi-automatic and increases the bullet penetration value so when you shoot normally you're supposed to much like fmj be able to shoot through objects more easily however when you equip the 10 rounders you can shoot through everything and anything with zero damage drop off that's right so if someone's on the other side of a building and they're live pinged or something like that you can immediately shoot right at them and do 100 damage it is pretty broken and i'm hoping that both of these guns get fixed not nerfed but just fixed in the hopefully upcoming week because it's going to be a little bit game breaking for a lot of people and i can only imagine when cheaters start to get their hands on especially this gun here you know being able to see people through walls and all that it's not gonna be a very fun experience anyways i'm done using this after today because it's too broken for me even though it was a lot of fun hope you guys enjoyed the video i'll catch you guys in the next one okay i don't know where the other guy went down that was the best parachute i think i've ever done that's nice damn i only got one dude this is so steady is it that crazy here drop it i want to see look at this thing dude it's so steady you didn't even need to like oh dude it doesn't it's not even that it's so steady it doesn't move no it doesn't move at all i'm not even holding [ __ ] all the way out like 300 meters out you're still ah damning people i don't know mine's really steady too yeah that was the thing i did test it i tested it without and just running focus instead and i genuinely don't think you need to have this much stability like this is overkill someone just parachuted in i don't know where from i think it was from the north i think i might have seen one i wasn't 100 sure oh god he's going to kill me going up here i know it [Applause] i freaking knew it dude i knew it or you're dead or i'm dead i heard the parachute i just didn't know where he went he wasn't he was behind us by the way like when you're facing the zip oh wow oh my god dude these guys are the sweatiest tryhards i've ever seen in my whole career dude and they're coming for me where are they roughly in the helicopter they just jumped out and smacked the dude that was chasing me and then flew off in their helicopter that was crazy they just saved my ass am i allowed to go back up i'm dead again bro what is this guy doing actually you might might be in trouble here if you drop here i guess that wasn't the guy then what's happening i'm cursed in this game this this is my life okay i'm gonna land on roof this time and then let's try this the opposite way no it doesn't work this way either stone yeah it doesn't no i think we got him is that not from behind here he's on the roof he's on the roof thank you dude wait wait wait a second what's up wait a second wait a second i killed this guy uh did she accu light you just killed accu lot act two lot no no no no no he's in pasta he's impostor acts a lot dude you know you're the light version he's the lot version are you calling him the heavy version i have an idea i have an idea one's our level both shoot i need another one i'm getting hit from another team though all right oh i'm gonna die no no you're not no you're not you're insane pleading it's from northwest i think still i think they're still up there i think they're still gonna happen i got him in the garage just getting some wallbang kills all right be nice are we in the morning one just jump down right [Applause] broke i just killed him through the entire truck through the entire truck stone oh my god the truck does not even literally watch the bullets i watched the bullets go right through the tire the main body out like everything that went through everything that sorry tracer come out the other side like it was nothing there really was nothing you can't hide you just can't hide there's a car that just pulled up at the buy station that one what though i'm actually not seeing these guys you're tagging there's another one behind the same spot yep okay they're dead this is a fair and balanced man i just shot him through this entire garage building and the truck and these boxes in the boxes uh all right it's fair and balanced yeah it's good everything's fine six is on point you know this reminds me of remember when uh remember when apex legends had all those bugs in them that was like a bunch of fun oh yeah like you know you need like redeploy and fly around and everything yep that's great sometimes bugs make the game like really fun you know as long as they don't stay in there for too long exactly yeah i just i murdered him he's just bad [Applause] you know these these little things you can never shoot through those yeah you can with this again with that though i'm hitting him right now i broke him he's down no no not even joking and he's he's outside the gas [Music] i just like foreshot him through that i'm like i'm blown away right now yep same reaction to me yep this guy there you go there you go pit scan yeah yeah yeah yeah broke them oh here's standby that was the exact same time kill confirmed oh my gosh we're gonna get banned dude i think we really might we might yeah there's been a lot of stuff that happens over the over the years but this might finally be it there's a guy in my building he closed the door i'm not with i'm going a roof still remaining keep it up i think i hear one gas is moving i'm throwing a stun oh i can't shoot through this i see the bullets literally coming out the other side of the building he's in here but i couldn't shoot through that for some reason well it's gonna be out of zone outside left oh i got myself in front [Applause] he's outside left of the building yeah he's at the the gas station there somewhere he's at the far pump [Music] am i out here shoot i am out i gotta get off the roof do we need to go over to oh no you're right you're right yeah good thing we didn't cross over here you're here anybody need this nobody on our side i'll see oh they're they're all fighting they're all fine and then one coming over here two live here okay i don't know he's live yeah wait you can only ping one at a time okay copy that this one's knocked this guy's up right here on the left i might need your help here i can't actually see these guys one just died last one last one right here he's got no armor if you can keep just him live i'm working on it there we go got him i'm hitting him a couple times you destroyed it no i was walking i'm from here here i got an idea where did i move air striking [Applause] is he inside maybe he was just stuck prone behind that wall there trying to play he kept hitting him and he kept plating i think his only way is to go he's probably prone like i think he's still behind it oh it's am i right yeah there we go well played stuff oh do you think we're banned oh my goodness do you think we're getting banned i mean in our defense this is the way these are features in the game right call of duty this is as intended we're playing as intended right like it's not like right we didn't have any hacks or nothing like this is we're just doing an in-game loadout that's what i was telling you earlier they have given us a way of beating cheaters in this game yeah they've given us the tools we are the anti-team [Music] now you
