[Music] what do you have what do you have these my friend are the new pistols and a new pistol it is the psycho pistols kind of glad that the war zone has come out with another weapon that we can at least use up close to change it up so hopefully we won't be seeing the ffr ffar or the far i don't know what people pronounce what they did it's getting a little bit ridiculous people are just speeding around with that thing and it's nice to have a little bit of a variation now because previously the only thing you've seen was some smg's mainly the mp5 and then i can't even remember the last time i seen a shotgun but it's nice to have some variation at the very least how strong are they well that's kind of up to you to decide from my experience the 80 rounds in each mag that that's how i choose to build them i'm pretty sure that's going to be the overall standard of how people choose to build it they are pretty good now you can obviously use them solo as well but what i'm using is the monolithic suppressor the very last barrel one to make it automatic as well as the 80 round drum mag the five milliwatt laser for the hipfire accuracy and obviously the perk to make them a kimbo and uh a very good feeling we we are going to be seeing these things quite a bit they might even be in the meta rotation if you will anyways instead of talking about the pistols 24 7 i will show you guys them in action in an actual solo game that i had unfortunately i was using the og which i still think is a little bit too strong they really need to nerf the uh time to kill on these weapons bring everything back down a little bit so at least you have some time to react because i think uh a lot of people are getting tired of it and it's getting a little bit out of hand anyways hope you guys enjoyed the video please leave a like if you did and i'll catch you guys in the next one nice easy train station drop that's what you like to see it's a good drop doesn't mean it's gonna be a good one wait wait it's an early drop so ah how am i still alive good lord why is train station like this now never used to be like this it's wild here seriously this is crazy oh another guy possibly on the roof oh no no oh man okay i need to get a loadout i actually don't know how i'm alive that was insane of 16 000. where's the nearest buy station oh my station it's so far i'll just wait for a freebie at this point [Music] shoot last bullet there's no way oh i almost did it almost did it that would have been my first my first mistake friendly loadout drop on the way i think it's this one yeah the pistol is it's gonna be a little bit tough because this is solos and yeah like example a if i could just get down to like i'm dead [Applause] that's gonna be it man this august it's just so dumb seriously i hate it so much it's not even the burst meta it's just the time to kill that bugs me see if i can get this guy [Music] be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply hmm jesus [Applause] man they do damage i think this is kind of like the only way to play solos you have to grab bounties 24 7 because otherwise everyone's gonna have goats and you're just like the only people you'll get to fight is the people that are let's see you first sitting on a rooftop or something okay wait we got one in each so the other guy ran friendly [Applause] that's that's why i don't want to use this i don't know what to do i have 20 seconds oh my god his body just scared me i actually thought he was still alive yeah they need to they need to do something about the time to kill this this is awful it's not it's not good it's not good it's not good for the game if people can't react then they're just gonna stop playing okay we got a buy station over here grab myself there's a guy right there [Music] that's a nice try requesting recon on my position uav entering the ao enemy uav overhead be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply i don't even know why i'm reloading still got 80 like 60 shots in each bolt in each gun what's the point there's a guy right there look look how dumb that is look how dumb that is there's no reason i didn't actually uh mean to use this on this class and solos let it happen what just happened here i'm on the same page as you i don't know what just happened i'm sorry forgive me please nobody beat me get some recon up well there's another guy back there maybe we can catch them a little bit after this i'm just kind of third person right now i want to see where they go maybe they'll think the vehicle is glitched there's two of you wasn't there oh i see somebody crossing the way over there damn you really had to destroy my vehicle i can't believe he was using a c4 i haven't seen that since like since like season one people just don't use c4s anymore hopefully i don't get beam trying to cross here is this zone just keeps pulling excuse i wasn't the guy so that's what i wanted to use i wanted to use a sniper with this it's this recon mission i gotta start being a little bit more careful yeah it's just what to say because the heartbeat sensor is not gonna matter you might repeat me yeah see like sniper right there i could have taken him out but i don't know i don't think the nerf was enough what's he doing maybe he has high alert oh maybe that's what he's waiting for that guy there look how dumb that is look at that hostile drop it into the area watch the skies [Applause] did you go back up on the roof you must have right is he looking at me [Applause] look at that man oh my goodness requested recon on my position maybe we can sneak a pistol kill be advised uav is bingo fuel rtb for resupply oh he's up here i have a good feeling we're gonna get down to like the last five and i'm gonna die that's exactly what's gonna happen i'm calling it now requesting recon on my position uav entering the ao but my goal is to use the pistol as much as possible because i do not want to use this hog anymore i feel disgusting get some recon i feel hideous [Applause] sometimes they jump out that was a close one it's getting closer every fight every fight a guy way over there he's gonna get pulled by his own so i don't really have to worry we just wait and hopefully do not get sniped [Music] i can just wait he's gonna sell fresh he's outside the zone only four enemies remain you know what to do okay what did i say we're in top five you watch i'm gonna die now i'm scared i always jinx myself like this one quarry everybody else is ghosted it could very well be a quarry ending up on this ridge okay one when we got in the top building oh there's everybody's up there where'd the other guy go down below [Music] oh we got one guy left [Music] i only got three plates i keys towards the loadout drop area let's find him [Music] [Music] we got him we got him he fell for the truck bait they always do all right well i didn't plan on that being a victory whatsoever i thought for sure i was going to get safarted or beamed by another og somewhere else i'm taking that thing off right now it's it's wrong i feel gross those pistols are kind of insane too they're they're like just as bad as what the shotgun meta was way back when when we were doing the uh i don't know what it's called forget now 7 300 damage wow [Music] you
