okay what do i throw on as a main weapon ooh m4 i haven't done that in years i've been doing the fin lmg it's been pretty good because the reload's not too bad no no no no it's gotta be the m4 you gonna do counties yeah i'll throw the cali's on i'm keeping uh sniper and smg until i get late game and then i might try and switch to it uh yeah do restock with stems corner and quick fix it's when you kill the ghost or the cali this mode like they throw so much at you non-stop that it almost is not scary i feel like i don't know you tell me what you think i mean i'm never scared of this stuff anyways yeah me neither man i'm too i'm too brave honestly no it's not that do you remember last time you've had a jump scare box yeah i had one i've only had one i love you you guys are freaking out at the last ones right let's just do the contract someone pulled a load off it's not bad i'm gonna wait i'm gonna wait i'm killing this guy yeah yeah it's one of the contract things contract complete supply boxes you figure that out i thought it was a loadout because it was red smoke wait what [ __ ] you're nuts yeah you're not happy about that one the door opposed by one [ __ ] door come on man
