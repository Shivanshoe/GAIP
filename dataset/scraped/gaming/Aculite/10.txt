160 flesh yeah i'm being i think he got knocked off for your time oh me again oh yes yeah it'll make a sound okay i can get to you now me [Music] welcome to blood hunt and a big thank you to them for sponsoring this video it's been a little while since i played this now but now that it's been officially released it is free to play on ps5 as well as pc i'm gonna be playing with a couple of my friends stodd in tomographic where we have some fantastic games that i really do believe showcase just how intense the game can be if you're new to blood hunt it is a free-to-play battle royale set in prague where you can play as a vampire of your choosing with unique class abilities on top of the abilities you can gear up and feed on the blood of specific civilians to gain passives which will help you throughout the match these effects can stack up and help you quite a bit in the end game especially if you're playing a character or vampire that has some movement based abilities it'll help a lot when you can reduce those cooldowns and if you're a returning player you'll be happy to know that they've also added some progression improvements so you can level up your archetype as well they've even added a new bloodhound mode for returning players or new players who just looking to improve or have some casual fun this mode you'll have the opportunity to spawn again if you happen to fall victim to another player i know that'll never happen to any of you so i captured some footage just to show you exactly what that looks like once you respond you'll have a short protection timer and be paired with a blue ak as well as a spiked bat to help you get back on your feet you can even regain that extra life by feeding on specific mortals just like how you gain the passives i really enjoyed this mode because it's pretty fast paced and it helps you get back in the action as quick as possible if that's what you're looking for and if you're a ranked grinder you'll be happy to know that there is in fact a ranked mode in ranked you'll be able to earn some rp by defeating enemies and placing high in a match it is favored higher towards eliminations but placing the top will still provide a large amount of rp so you don't have to worry if your kills are getting stolen it'll cost more and more rp to enter a ranked match which obviously means you need to get more eliminations and place higher in the game in order to start climbing that ladder just a little bit more also any of the special badges that you earn in ranked can be used next to your avatar so you can show off to everybody just how good you are now i have a great couple of rounds to show you just how the game plays in a team and it does get pretty wild movement in this game is key which i still feel like i'm trying to get the hang of but i do feel like i'm getting there as always link is in the description if you want to check out the game for yourself big thank you again to bloodhound for sponsoring this
