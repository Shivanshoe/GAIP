foreign everything's fine i don't know how it's working but it's working this is the spot the spot of all oh no no spots no no he doesn't see me he sees me he found me the tanks men they ruin all the fun honestly battlefield 2042 can't come soon enough i am preparing for it as you can see since my last video i've been practicing a little bit and from what everyone was kind of telling me that you need to focus on the automatic fire of weapons for attachments so that's kind of what i've been doing and uh the aek i'm sure as a lot of people know is really good i suppose it's one of the one of the top end weapons in this game fast fire rate it's got decent accuracy seems to be okay at range but that's where it really becomes difficult to control because you need to burst fire it but i am learning things i am learning things which is good and one of the things i'm learning is that tanks ruin all the fun another thing i'm learning is how to use the straw more effectively this this has got to be one of my favorite things to do i'm sure if you guys have ever landed this before which i was pretty proud of this if you've ever done this to a helicopter you will know how rewarding that feels i just hope battlefield 2042 which they seem to bring back the tracer dart is gonna be just as rewarding what i'm playing here is rush one of my favorite game modes when i was playing bad company too this is one of my go-to i always did rush it's just such a good time if you can force yourself through the defenses of the enemy and then you go and capture that point right you have time to defuse it still i don't know it's got it's got a nice flow to it i think because you get to visually go through the whole map and progress sometimes you just you run through enemies sometimes you get ran over that happens but it's always a good time and i have a full game to show you guys as always if you do enjoy the video please give a thumbs up i hate always asking for this stuff but it does help the algorithm as well as it also lets me know if you guys enjoy the video and you want to see more of you know battlefield or you know whatever i'm posting at the time so here's some battlefield 4 rush with the aek which is basically just aim training on rush because it's a lot of infantry gameplay hope you enjoy let's wait tanks man they're everywhere i do really like this gun did he jump over me it's always this guy man he jumps off the bridge and kills me what did i just spawn into teammate i love you okay well i think i'm dead you got me i can't wait for the new battlefield this is gonna be great this is the how you prepare gotta play some bf4 not five not one although those games i'm sure are fun it's gotta be four actually i don't know but this is how i'm preparing for it this gun is wild too ak this guy's lagging all around go back down there's people up there there's a guy right there danger wait we might have cleared these guys out tied right here oh he went around the right side that's one thing i hate and love about battlefield it's like you can kill one person but everyone keeps reviving each other you know because a lot of people like to play medics myself included so it's like you wipe out one guy but then there's an army that just revives like zombies i think i need to start aiming for the head a little bit more so it saves me some bullets get him up give us man some heads i'm coming i'll be the best medic that ever lived i got an idea it's not gonna be a good one oh teammates already here nevermind question is can i do this i bet you i can't [Music] i don't think this is gonna work at all oh no no no no you never know i wonder if this is against the rules it might be i'm in their spawn i might get banned from this sir maybe this is why i keep getting banned holy moly maybe should check no it's not saying anything these guys are so confused don't let me die is he still alive no gonna run out of bullets pretty soon hello oh i messed up i messed up hey we were doing some work we were doing some work so i was told that the heavy barrel it seems like the heavy barrel and the stubby grip seems to be the way to go for this game or whatever adds to accuracy for your gun for automatic fire ever since my last video i was wondering like what would be the best attachments and that's why i asked you guys because i wasn't really sure what was going on in this game what would be the the play hey that other meta got over there too we go again wait a minute somebody's following me yeah let's go this way this way this way come here stealth mission okay no longer a stealth mission spawn on me everybody spawn on me don't shoot him no i'm gonna die thanks man oh my god this man's using a shotgun slugs that's something i want to try i think i need to take off my my laser sight for this it's giving me away i don't know if we're necessarily helping our team doing this i'm gonna be honest oh god [Applause] we're really not helping the team he got him up we're just creating havoc back here i think it's safe to say that we're gonna lose this one there's not much oh maybe if we can get a hundred kills like this would be the place to hold them it's the last objective okay i'm not rising you you're way too far outside sniping like that's not gonna save anybody okay and this is ma'am shoot i thought that was gonna be a good flanking route damn it i tried i tried no we lost this one i think it's over guys damn what a rush it's good it's just like the objectives you get to play out like through the whole map right so it always keeps changing it's good i like that we did have a quite a nice flank there at the beginning or rather i guess midway through the game i joined fairly late though oh we got 67 kills cool battlefield 4. what a great way to prepare for 2042 you
