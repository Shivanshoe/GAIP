finally i get to use this mp5 man i love this site it's so clean the only thing i don't like about it it has a big issue is the reflection has like a reflection of light when you initially zoom in kind of sucks that messy up a little bit oh jeez i killed him pretty quick so i have this thing mainly built for damage reduction sorry damage range and recoil reduction but i added the suppressor to like reduce sound and all that and listen to my footsteps the non-existent man that ninja you can't even hear me plus it helps for hearing other people when you have the suppressor on i'm curious i'm curious let's see how long it takes oh no oh no i can't oh jesus i can't believe that worked there's no way they didn't check it you know they're gonna be watching that kill game and check it afterwards okay time for the war machine support streak by the way anybody can get this you don't even need to get kills this is ridiculous oh he's got a blast shield on or whatever it is ah man we were like 20 we were at 21 kills look at my score jesus man that war machine is ridiculous like okay so it's sort of balanced in the way that if you pull it out and you get one kill with it or you have it out for enough time then and somebody kills you then you just lose it right so but i mean even against flak jacket or blasted or whatever the heck it's called it's a two shot and it's a one shot against anybody else oh you're dead yeah this mp5 is really rough at range okay let's see do you think we can do it twice in a row there's no way right losing alpha oh okay yep he's never not gonna check that corner now 100 every time he plays this map he's gonna before he goes in that room and goes to the balcony he's a hundred percent gonna check that bed i found the spot found the spot yeah wow that mp5 is really rough at range oh no oh now everyone's gonna know about it oh come on i mean it was pretty cool damn see how much that wiggles at the end there okay so it's like the third day of the beta or whatever now i used this last match but they uh they have ninja in the game if you don't know what ninja is basically it's a suppressor for your feet it's a foot suppressor okay there are no footsteps at all somebody could be full sprinting behind you this perk right here number three and you'll never hear him not a chance and as of right now there is no counter to this i have no idea why this is in the game though at least like in the other modern warfares or whatever there was there was something that countered it you can make enemy footsteps louder and it would counter ninja and a lot of people would use that or people would just use ninja but like it's just it's so strong so why would you not use it i mean it is a beta so maybe there is another perk eventually but as right now it hasn't shown anything but i've been having a lot of fun with the mp5 so i'm gonna use that ow i actually like hardpoint i'm glad that they have this in and it's got a little bit of a wiggle to it probably don't really need the suppressor on it but it just it sounds so beefy i like the sound of it sounds so good i don't know for me at least when you picture an mp5 like you just picture one with a suppressor on it holy you can wall bang that yeah wow you can really wallbang that i didn't know that suppose it's like i could probably make this mp5 a lot better if i just took off the suppressor man that really helps having a ninja really helps to hear other people's footsteps wasn't enough my footsteps are quiet they're silent completely there's no way in hell you would ever hear that i think they're coming from back here ow that hurt tell you what though i've used the i used the m16 yesterday and i was leveling that up a little bit that thing is phenomenal once you start getting attachments for it because you can actually increase the fire rate and all that and i think what is it it was like mid-range or something like that it's a one burst to the chest so if you can hit all three bullets you're killing them trying to be an objective player wasn't there a guy back there i'm dead oh i'm so dead yep hell yeah war machine time this thing is such bs it's so bs hey hey stop doing that what yeah like a little uh drone or something that was shooting it out of the air a little anti-air grenade launcher thing forget what they're called man i've used that spot a few times if you hide behind that door people never suspect it it's so good we got this team hold it hold the point oh we need to hold it oh and i'm dead this is crazy map design there is there's honestly so many bushes on this map you can hide so many places i thought i was gonna get away with that one too all right let's get on the point i'm gonna go for the objective i'm gonna go for the next one wait what that didn't even hurt me hold the point i think that's the first win in a while holy i've been losing non-stop that mp5 is pretty good man i'm liking it i am liking it it seems like every single call of duty that i play the mp5 is one of the top tier guns though not sure the reasoning behind that you
