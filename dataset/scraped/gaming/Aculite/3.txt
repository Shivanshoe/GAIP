[Music] I can't tell you exactly why but for some reason this game has been on my mind a lot recently now this is some old footage because the game is no longer active at least at the moment this is all recording during a closed Alpha play session and everybody that enjoyed the game was a fan of it now is just currently and patiently waiting for it to come back and be released in an open Beta or closed beta or whatever else they have planned if you're unfamiliar with this game or you didn't catch the previous video that I did on it this game is Marauders now I'm not a big fan of comparing games but if you've seen or played escape from tarkov then it is a very similar concept it's a hardcore PVE and PVP based system where you go into raid however you want with your character decked out however you would like in this case you spawn in a spaceship and you can choose to fly around in PvP against enemy players boarding their ships or if you prefer to focus on tasks and quests you can go into the main area and try to loot up that way get some valuables and then the goal is to make it out alive now we focused a lot on the PVE and with a little bit of PVP in the first video but in this video I wanted to focus strictly on the combat and just pvping taking everyone else's gear seeing if we can make it out alive now again this is some older footage so basically whatever I have is what I had to work with but there really is something about this game or the concept in general where you can board somebody else's ship choose to fight them while other ships are shooting at you try to survive and make it alive because if you die you are gonna lose every single piece of gear that you brought in you can even lose your ship if someone flies it out playing with my good friend tomographic in this one gonna be flying around trying to board everyone else's ships even going on the giant Commander ship and having a nice little battle I really hope you enjoy and I'll catch you in the next one here look at my character this is the helmet I'm bringing you in oh my God I want to use it because it looks sick but it's lower level it's a trash can no it's a welding mask oh wait my T you fly that is the plan oh back it was cool back to school [Music] the line boom oh yeah I was sick mom oh my God Tom Tom you're kidding me right foreign [Music] oh they didn't see my DM that we got breached oh no you gaming trying to yeah no I believe screened shoot well we're safe currently please tell me they're not going to do this to me how many fighting I just killed three Just Gonna Leave This Guy's backpack though that's really sucks they breached your ship yeah I was firing at it like everyone though did you just stay in that spot you did in the video oh my god um well no it's our ship right so like I was just in the Captain's Quarters oh okay yeah I guess uh more like I don't know the cables was weird I went from standing to sitting on my desk something wasn't fully plugged in well you're good now though right I'm in the lobby yeah I'm not in your game though I'm ready Raj I have another drink verb Raj my name's Tom we've known each other for so many years now God we're starting wait I'm getting Deja Vu last time you left we got raided fast and then you dc'd you blue screened not an AI that is not an AI holy crap he's got like the auto tourism yep he's gonna kill us too we're probably just gonna have to mail it yeah just bail that's the one [ __ ] I had should we breach him kind of you want yeah it looks like he knows what he's doing somewhat how much is true I mean we can't do anything else let me go repair our ship surprise he's not still smashing ship up oh the AI ships down here the big one you go for that too okay I'm looking someone just breached on it where are you I'm still basically okay go to your left screw left left and down please no death please no death please no death we're going in foreign make sure to heal if you need to put you guys down below I'm holding the other side okay [ __ ] you they whispered back were they yeah [ __ ] you [ __ ] you [ __ ] you sorry my already my favorite raid absolutely shredded one Jennifer killed him they might push his mobile they're pushing they're pushing there's one guy over to my right so I can't push don't go outside your bunker because there's a guy way right I think he has an mg too she made that question me I got two on my side you know I think I'm okay for now kill one okay in the same spot holding the door still another oh select one yeah I'm pushing out he's the last guy I'm going to The Far Side there's another one killed him I killed him I think there's two yeah you can I'm inside underneath we're good I knew I ruined that one guy so bad I had to push yeah now I shredded one guy as well but I can't tell if we traded we love that spice all right close all the doors STG Commando bag on this guy if you need yeah I'll say that half plate as well yeah good call on the PVP just seemed another very cool coming in late like that well it can be it can be difficult yeah it would have been a good idea for us to just follow him on the way hold for three seconds to activate Beacon where are you at did you go up yeah have you seen this before no hold on oh three seconds to activate Beacon do you have something on your screen that popped up I'm gonna do it yeah it's probably for one of your tasks okay pinged oh yeah okay it's a task interesting there should be a commander too no unless yeah my house it usually opens this door but he hasn't weird maybe he's already killed him what's that the Crosser rifle you found that before yeah I found it a couple times Thomas in there as well if you need if you um if you come to the ship quite a few times you can you see like all the end game stuff yeah this is pretty much it I've seen quite a bit of it just never that it's just a weird looking gun I can't believe like I just came in a ship shot everybody up and then left yeah that was weird very strange Strat not to disabled people and not take advantage of it maybe just once the space baby I don't know ship it's gonna be interesting these are I hope it's good I've never used it before have you ads with it yeah it's like hip fire right yeah yeah it kind of has like cone fire too oh so it's gonna be awful but it's it's fun like but it's fun all right I'm down mid-range which is most of our fights it'll Shred I mean if you really want to test this we just go board people right away we could but there's literally no downside to doing it yeah there's also just not really an upside there's actually no one flying in we could just breach and he won't be able to hit us take his ship you down uh yeah we just got to do it same time well let's get over the Rocks here you know what let's just do it okay that's the energy I love we just gotta go for the same guy that's all mm-hmm so many people are already potting oh my god wow all right we go for the big ship big ship up top uh we lost you I was right beside you a second ago big ship up top oh I see I see it okay this is kind of bad news because two people already breached on the edge of the map next to the asteroid it's right in the center yeah next to the asteroid up to the right [Music] are you in are you in oh okay I killed him killed one I'm about to preach ing now oh my God what do you see what do you hear I just killed two guys he killed one nice in the store I don't even know if you're on the same ship as me kill two I don't hear any gunfire holy crap no no I think you're on a different one oh my God we're in different big ships that's hilarious that was the most mental flight I've ever seen in my life I think this thing is sick yeah this thing rips yeah we're in different big ships man that's funny oh God someone's shooting at us so you want to play a [ __ ] yeah I'm on like the massive AI Control no I'm on a player [ __ ] brother oh my God where's
