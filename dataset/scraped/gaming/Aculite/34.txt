what's going to me coming hit him on smozin fog out he's left do you think he's left he's left on the rocks got him one more he's right back towards the end i gotta heal actually i can hold this guy's left left [Music] hello [Music] i'll hold it in lasers he's dead no uh it's good to be back on tarkov a new patch a new wipe what that means is if you're new to the game every once in a while the game goes through patches where there's a lot of new content or a huge update comes to it and they like to wipe everybody's accounts so everybody starts over fresh that means you have to do new tasks requests everyone starts at level one everyone starts off with roughly the same gear and you guys have to kind of go into survival mode and battle your way out hoping to survive because if you lose your gear then it's lost forever so if you're new to the game it's a hardcore looter shooter with survival aspects and there's a lot of progression to it got a few highlights to show you guys and then we'll move on to a very decent round that we had hope you guys enjoy and i'll catch you in the next one that double barrel i feel like it's gonna do some damage today oh i'm not using the double barrel i'm using the revolving one oh well she there's two new shotties yeah how many does that one have is it good it's got five rounds in it it's like a revolver right oh we'll try it out we'll see we'll see interesting running across i didn't see anything in the shadows hey what's up pretty sure i saw one guy up top yeah up top you guys want to cease fire on the top he's dead oh my god nice i think i saw two jump down though yeah one's close i think he's pushing it your way he's pushing my way i think i'm gonna run back now he's in the corner he's reloading i think i'm here too i'll better heal maybe rep container i'm at the other entrance right now there's one in the corner like the left post yep left corner when you look into uh i might be able to throw grenade do that too that flashbang this thing is so much fun already oh boy here we go is that us are we gaming right now we're game dude we talk about war lord i'm ready to extract oh boy that's insane yeah make room for

where's he at i might have killed him your second floor and i can't even see through that glass i think my little graphic settings are too low dude lower too high hello honestly if i hit that shot that was pretty sick intro clip i'm kind of surprised they haven't added a revolver to the game you feel like i feel like that's like one of the first things that they would add hey hold on hello did my world kill you asking for a friend literally well it's gotta be fun we better i can one shot upper chest him okay that guy's dead wait there was a guy there hey if you speak now we'll let you lead your teammate at peace okay now we'll press your ass too i mean if we did voip zoom oh this poor guy was level one i mean we're all level one so i'm taking your stuff actually do i yeah you do are you kidding me everyone who's level one right now has probably played for a million years before this so i mean not this guy he was hiding in the corner like he was actually hiding hiding i'm just letting you know if you don't take it i will okay okay oh i guess i have to take it now uh you didn't kill anyone up here that was probably him are you sure i didn't kill anybody up there i feel like i i hit
