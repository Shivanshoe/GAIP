[Music] back in tarkov look at that just spun myself into existence okay it's been a while it has been quite a while what is this i've never seen this before this is a new new combat stim interesting interesting god it's actually been forever i feel like i feel like every time i play this that's exactly is this a player no no it can't be a player wait did they make it so they mimic you they must have they must have okay except for this part wow they mimic you that's crazy wait uh i'm not gonna flip them off i heard that they shoot at you if you flip them off enough i'm not gonna do it oh don't aim at me like that oh you're freaking me out friendly yeah friendly that's incredible and they occasionally check the chamber on their gun that's really cool i mean the ai could definitely be updated a little bit more still but that's a step in the right direction i guess what's this data report it's in russian i don't know how to read russian looks like the stocks have been going down though that's not good and they increase the stocks oh jesus christ oh my god i missed one bullet and he just lasered me with like 50. all right i'm gonna go in with a pistol a little five seven see what we can do mr steal your loot that's me i love that you can change your name in this game i know it's not a huge thing and a lot of people probably don't care but i think it's really funny when you kill somebody and then the end screen pops up and you get see and you get to see who killed you that's always something ridiculous does he know no he doesn't know does he we got him damn this thing's left i want to get the uh the suppressor for this thing but i have to be level 10 to use the flea market can't do it yet oh my god what the heck i headshotted him too shot him right in the head why does he have an essay 58 already i don't understand no way okay from pistol to loot and now we extract because there's no reason to stay in here anymore he must hit the marked room i bet you that's what it is he must have spawned really close to the marked room yeah there's nothing in it yup that's exactly what happened he opened up the marked room he found the s858 on the ground and the money case and he just started and he was like you know what screw it i'm just gonna leave i was gonna let him pass too i wasn't even gonna shoot him yeah he only had a pistol oh he's level one okay i'll leave it he can have that hopefully he has that insured well from pistol to money case two decent weapons one of these is somewhat decked out the recoil on this is horrendous same thing with the site i hate this site that's why i never use it that's not bad that money case goes for like uh probably 350k or something like that so sell that off and then i got some some more money to spend on some gear okay where did i spawn perfect right next to tanker i gotta mark four of them so i'm trying to remember where the other ones are i always forget because it's always it's always so long in between the tasks when they wipe the stashes and all that i'll find them i know there's one other one at old gas station really glad i found this ak he's not so glad well i didn't necessarily find it i killed a guy and took it off him but jesus look at the blood splatter that's intense look at that this poor guy man to be fair though he could have shot me a lot sooner pretty sure he saw me first okay we got one marked we got a guy killed that's good i guess you know got the loot so that's fine god you really can't see anything with a visor see this is why i don't like wearing them they have their ups and they also have their downs the ups obviously being able to save your face from a bullet hold on let me check this thing out let me see what the freak is this i mean site's really clean i like the bravo site it's nice yeah that thing's ugly looking well they changed this area a lot didn't they it's a guy here how many scabs are in here what the heck there should be another scavenger somewhere wait did they open that building up can you go inside that now [Music] shot him in the head like three times he didn't die that's ridiculous i have no idea if that was a scav or player hopefully he's dead just a scav all right ooh juicy even more juicy yeah damn they've really changed up this area this is a lot more foliage here this wall is big now damn it's like they did an entire rework on this area this is sick and they've even opened up this area over here look at this this was never open before so you can go all the way up into that building and old gas stations over there as well but i need to uh i need to go to the new gas station plant the tracker on that one it's another sniper scavenger he's shooting at somebody might be him in the tower now god i love this ak it's so good i want to make sure there's nobody up here before i go and loot that guy see the thing is the more people you kill the more the more loot you gain right and then the more overweight you become so you can't run as long or as fast and it makes doing these tasks a lot more difficult whatever more money level five oh you can keep your gear man don't even worry about it it's all yours except for your drink that i'm gonna be taking it's gonna really suck if i have a decent run like this and i managed to die before i get to plant the last one damn they changed this a lot there's a lot more brush and stuff that you could hide behind so fights aren't as easy anymore not as in the open that's uh that's good to see honestly it makes spotting people horrendous but you know what like that's kind of what this game is it's kind of who spots who first all right just gotta wait this one out and then we're good to go damn people are really going at it you know what i wonder if that's even the scav boss because it might be pass complete all right let's get the heck out of here that's all we need to do we got some decent gear the stuff i can use for my hideout these screws and the bolts that's all it's all good not a bad first day to start off you
