yo what's up guys could be running some twos today with garrett chi if you do notice my camera setting is a little bit different in this video it's because i'm trying on 70 stiffness so it's going to look a lot tighter to my car than usual um i honestly like how 70s stiffness feels i've used it in the past but i never really stuck with it i kind of want to stick with that i feel like there is a really good consistent vibe to 70 stiffness just something that you have to get used to so i'm going to try to play with it for this video hopefully we pop off let's see how it goes all right for the first game playing against nescoff and all these guys are actually very sad i've played them before they always play together so we'll see how this goes see if we can catch the dub that's a really good boom shot off the bat good control from garrett it's gonna wait back here guys should be able to get this nice i'm gonna boot my highest what he does it can be really hard for him actually a really good read from him i'm gonna do the bouncer there we go the bounce shots never fail never fail i feel like on this stiffness i'm like a lot more consistent at just shooting where i need to shoot like i don't do i do less of the the funny business and more of just trying to get the goals if that makes sense good job from gear that's one for absolutely nothing pretty much he's hit the ball one time to the side and he got one out of the play for it so to block him i can go back now behind garrett it's gonna be easy ball for him to turn on nice shot away behind him here again i should be more middle but hopefully i can get this i don't know can't tell what's happening should have let's have another shot here okay got the block it's all we needed nice clear from gear i can get some pads now that was a little bit awkward for sure they had a lot of opportunities to shoot that and um they were quite dangerous they were tough to read so i'm glad we dealt with it how we did bait it up forget it really good follow-up challenge it's all i'm trying to do there's got the ball to get very really going to actually win that challenge back wall just to make it weird for them try to help garrett here anything we'll do if i can kill him it's perfect actually pinched into our net like full speed for some reason but uh it's not too bad gear with the follow nice they're pretty awkward here wait for my time to go and i'll just get a free go out of it yeah these guys are super solid so two goal lead is huge this early on also i do see your complaints about my mic being low i'm trying to fix it so let me know how this video is i mess with some settings trying to kill time for geared here i don't do anything too crazy i'm just trying to make them put the ball in a not-so-dangerous spot for us and let gary get back nice should be fine for us honestly don't have a lot of options i should have taken that made a little bit awkward for garrett but he recognized the situation he recognized i got killed so he was there to clean it up for me i'll let him take that he's going toward the side so i thought why not he's going to block he could probably turn on this and i could stay middle with a decent amount of boost if i could kill this guy it's perfect as long as gary doesn't get flicked we're chilling nice i'm gonna leave the rest of that there for him oh yeah i can get a shot there we go i don't need to waste the rest of my booster i might as well hit that go down get their boost and let gary get the next touch i can rotate around they're gonna have to panic he's ready up for that so no downside of just letting him get that hit there nice gonna have one more i'll try to stay in a spot where i can help him load up the wall uh for some reason my i flip on the ceiling didn't work the first one good try from garrett really good follow-up shot there from gamer let me get behind me there we go should be a goal a lot of pressure there we take our time up the wall i like gary get behind me so even if they do get a save on that garrett's gonna be there for a follow-up shot it's never really gonna be a bad situation for us it's always gonna be a a good outcome try to go for gear here should be okay he's gonna boom that again he has to waste his boost it's just perfect and garrett has a free challenge nice the placement there we go the placements on the shots have been really good i think the 70 stiffness is doing wonders for my shooting right now but let's get into the next game hopefully it'll be another intense match those guys were good as a 5-0 win but it was definitely more intense than the scoreline shows they're really solid all around let's get into the next one stephen keep it up let go let go all right for last campaign is gyro and nuts and now what all right well start off with a free goal then go for kick off so we'll take it again controller you're my free goal yeah only fair oh all right back even like it never happened i feel bad like that what i mean his controller was messed up so he couldn't score so he couldn't go up a kick off so i don't really think you should feel bad for the free goal doesn't make much sense try to control this if i could fake them couldn't quite everyone ranked this too smart let's make it a 1v1 here see how long it took scared to find out so 1v1 isn't expecting to be behind him okay he probably knows at this point i believe all right garrett's got no boost at this point one the fifth you got the boost really good that's a huge win driver has to retreat touch back oh you missed let's go for garrett probably yeah that missed it from gyro yeah say that back to the side or else it's gonna be a goal because guys could with uh time on the ball very good with time on the ball even time is gonna score every time you'll be kicked for being idle i'm moving game oops all right super weak shot but we will take it we'll definitely take it touch from garrett there i had to get all the way around that not the shot i wanted at all but it's fine i gotta mess with my settings and find something i like more i do like how high stiffness feels but maybe a little bit lower than this gotta find the in between that i like i kind of fully trusted the bump there i probably shouldn't it was a little risky but we got back around to it still gonna be a goal yeah i went all in on that something like threes it's fine but the twos not something you should do probably oh they could have done better there on defense after the mistake was already made was try to get that more to the corner it was really hard to get around and get a precise touch but it was more focused on just making sure it wasn't direct to the internet yeah that was a good cheat there i knew i had like a beat all i did was drive into it and pop over him it was rolling toward me so i had the advantage off the bat just because of how the ball is rolling beat him to the ball i'll try to get one more here couldn't quite i really do want to find settings that i can just stick to though i think it's a big problem of mine is i switch far too often it kind of makes me inconsistent sometimes don't have a flip somehow but it's gonna fake them if i don't flip it as i go regardless so we'll take it either way but definitely should have got a flip out of that i think it's one of those boosters no way two three seventy six mmr uh man this is 2400 mmr he hasn't really been doing much it's weird oh sorry i turned there i'm trying to practice being a little bit more aggressive but that was being a little too aggressive there i just gotta wait for the roll up here pass over the gear the actual touch kind of messed them up i should have said it once nice you ready my fake that's a good play that's really good play to me like high stiffness is good but i don't like how it looks to play with it's really hard to get used to the way it feels to play with no offenses yeah everybody give it away i'll be able to hit the paw oh my god all right gg this is funny if you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or a night out of time you're watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys on the next one i love y'all a minute 14 points i put that for gyro on that but love y'all peace you
