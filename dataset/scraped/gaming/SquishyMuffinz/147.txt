yo what's up guys gonna be queueing some twos for today with wonder mic should be some good games let's get straight into it see if we can get some dubs we'll see how it goes all right got ourselves daniel an expert oh my sweaty game that's not this car design i don't know if i like it or not but we're gonna we're gonna try it out we'll see what we get here try to control this if we can play it around it's a good play nice follow-up from one but there we go nicely done gotta get this back right it's a very sweaty lobby for this time of night man everyone's a gamer 340 right now 340. everyone's up i need boost call by the way or like him saying that on kickoff is telling me to go back right or back left i kind of trolled i went for going for the musty instead of going for the easy shot which would have been a goal and for the hard one i thought he was leaving at that point but it's fine i should have waited to beat him to this you're trying the shot better just like the booster in the corner i don't mind getting killed there because i do secure the boots for the next 10 seconds this is awkward though the situation i play from us follows up again don't touch that it's fine should be okay if i bump them play forward i might be able to get around that somebody maybe be able to drift around and get a good power shot but it's okay real quick get a good kill you should boom this actually really smart play not a bad idea at all there all right now we have the ball in a good spot for us let's go for some sort of play off this good demo you can leave all the way back now but i get some pads shouldn't be a bad situation as long as i don't get this short on the 50 which i guess could happen there just not extremely likely it does no boost i should be first man to just make him do something and then i leave it one does no boost either he kind of panicked a bit should be to get back all right he stole the boost yet again they know we're low here that's fine i don't mind that actually i'm missing that's good for us i don't hit the ball away to them try to shoot it you're gonna attempt it should be a little boost yeah one of my nose nice that's a good um i'd say that's a good read on the other the other player there knowing that he's low and he can't actually beat it he wants me to fake close i tried to play it down to him again i went so quiet there we go chased here it's a really tough spot to get out of we do get out of it though my saves from us let's say from daniel as well you try a little passage of play to be honest like a good like 30 seconds there from the save it's almost actually converting on the shot well played from wanda should be eagle that's it on the back folder yeah what i did there i was getting bumped so i had to do something weird to get away from the bump jumped into the net i was able to recover quick out of it as well played then we put a spanish kick off so what it is is the guy who's supposed to go for the kickoff actually just leaves the ball the fake and he goes to kill the cheater so the guy that's uh teaching the other team and is popularized by spanish players why they call it the spanish kickoff spanish players the spanish community in europe is the first to do it a lot happens all the time now in nna it's a good 50 shipping really good job to take our time there yeah good game from us so far it was a very sweaty tough lobby and uh we're doing really well both of us want us playing really solid as well there it is again kickoff is super annoying but that's how you know they're in comms by the way because these guys are pretty close friends i'm pretty sure so they're in discord talking to each other which makes this dub a lot tougher as is gotta be careful of those spanish girl i didn't challenge i thought he was gonna go and commit to it but it should be good for us shout out as quick as i could it's a good shot traded with daniel it's not bad at all one has a free ball here i full boost back pretty good situation to be and i could have hit it around him most likely wow that was weird looking holy he can't shoot yet no way dude i was gonna double reset for sure i had the perfect setup ah that's pain that's so much pain that is so much pain all right let's get into the next one see if we can keep it up get back to big dubs let's see how it goes all right we got a sweaty game here we got beast mode and rapid wow have fun let's see if we can be down here we got the kcp guys all the gamers are up right now this time nice shot from wonder well done very good double tap it's gonna challenge early here and always gonna do is go toward net with that so as long as i challenge in line with the net it should be fine nice well done from one to there good bump my cheek here all right i'm gonna go back to that it's a little bit awkward i know i wasted all of his boost so i just played his left side should be decent for wanda i can't actually do anything about that yeah that's tough so i wonder wasn't where i thought he'd be on the wall there so i kind of hit it too far but as soon as he kind of committed for it and rapid beat him it left me in a pretty tough spot to get up because i'm low boosting they have a lot of options they can solo that they can bump me a lot of things they can do right not rapid fall just unfortunate situation or not uh one day's fault i should say wow i got faked pretty hard i can go again for him here though maybe over me he should be back ball i was assuming one was back all day it would have been easy to clean up it actually made it really tough that he wasn't so that's me assuming i mean being used to like playing with my team in the comms that come with it because a lot of the time if you challenge something like that in threes with my team especially just me there'll be somebody back well it'd be very easy for them to clean it up first guy's meant to just have them waste their touches why i like not being calms and in this game is a definitely a really hard thing to get used to when you're so used to screaming all the time not calming in a in rank is weird very weird a lot of goals happen because you don't know a lot of it is guessing and assuming right here's a flip i'm not gonna go for this again because one of those situations where one is falling for a while there if i commit on that it's not going to end well most of the time oh no very unfortunate i think when they expected me to beat him again kind of trying to just bait the ball out for him i'm not gonna get the weight on that most of the time if i do it's gonna be a lucky a lucky win if that double committed here we can get something out of this unlucky didn't bounce away favorably for us play backwards finally there for that it's a bad touch from them he has to waste all of his boost now just to pinch it back to us i'll just toss that there see what they do i'll wait back hole who jumped him big pre-jump try to bump him here or something oh very unfortunate to say the least we get to go around here it's rough rough scenes nothing touches that's fine i don't mind some more touches here again gonna really shoot you try to get touch back nice save very favorable spawn for us should have it he hit it backwall he kind of threw it away fun actually really good bounce for them back there that's why when i wasn't able to get it hit it around him make him hit it away again i can just play this back my corner remind the situation he has to just keep hitting it into us right oh man so close so close i forced him to have to stay low going for the bump there i think i wanted to knew that that's why he dove in so quick the way i played that out forcing the half to stay low i wanted to get a straight up challenge you'll probably win the situation i'm gonna wait for one to get back here just kill as much time as possible so i'm gonna watch for wonder once he's behind me in a good spot i can kind of throw this away i don't mind it i didn't rotate all the way back which makes it a little bit weird to be honest you cut like midfield trying to hope for a pass or something but it's actually really good for threes but in twos it can be a slightly risky situation you don't want to commit too much in twos like you don't want to over commit and stay on the opponent's side way too long in twos more of a bad thing than a good thing and threes you can open up a lot of opportunities prefer a bump i wanted to get something crazy there i'm trying to back wall to myself right back in the same line there so i decided to cut turn try to make sure you don't have a tough situation on defense killed the dribble early should be fun go straight back to my teammate this first man there on the go challenge one more here just to try to stall see if i didn't get the second touches i go so pretty big touch from us nice and i had no boost was able to recover i gotta go out of that as well as well play very tough situation to be in and
