yo what's up guys gonna be playing some twos for today with dapper should be some good games i've been taking a little bit of a break this weekend from grinding to uh to record all the playlists i haven't played really so on me i gotta get back into let's get some dubs hopefully for today see y'all guys all right this cube took a while but we finally got a game we got tlg fire and miss sk all right two console players are probably good though never underrate the console players me and dapper came from consoles so console players i've always uh been a threat there's always been very good players on console any time in rocket league history i think there's always been at least a couple of very very threatening constant console players so always have to be worried a good start there for sure touch from that with the left side here i want to keep my boost and be in position that i can help out soft clutch that i can follow myself [Music] for a double it's actually gonna be in really well saved from him i like that we're able to recover at least as well off of that we did kind of go all in for that play but we're also able to still be in a position to recover and help out after really good block nice soft touch from that very very smart touch there and it doesn't commit a mullet which is really good i like that a lot the fact that i just drive up to this gets a chip if this guy gets attached to the wall he's going to be able to just easily go for his corner boost there's still low boost i'll be able to have time to get back because he doesn't full commit so everything about what that did right there is perfect in my opinion i don't know if that can get back i think he missed the mid boost yeah that's unfortunate did he miss the beast yeah that's how i thought but am i in there i should have went all in on that challenge even though like in my head dapper can get back for sure if he has that boost i still shouldn't go all and i still shouldn't leave him in that situation to have to rush back like that i don't think that's the spot it should be left in or have to deal with good follow-up 1v1 now i'll try to say middle to help him out again don't want to [ __ ] me on this and look me just keeping a presence here is always necessary to actually keep ball control and possession i don't have to full commit on that and right here we have a good chance touch the score again dapper's committed right so i'm just going to fake him make him back off again if i can make him jump into this flip into this perfect get some bumps on them dabber gets a free ball now end up being the ball again pick this one pretty much space i give myself here flip it to the right for that tried to pass it's not a bad idea i still have all this time to myself right there's so much potential to actually make a play out of this because we're just keeping possession the whole time kind of the the name of the game in in twos and threes just however you can just maintain possession that's the best way to play it so every time i have the ball every time i have a touch or the ball coming toward me i try to use it the best way i can try to give my team the best chance of scoring at all times but in general the main thing when you're playing something like 2v2 or even even through there are some opportunities for it when the ball is coming toward you try to get touched that's light and follow up a bull for yourself and something that you don't hit too far away so you don't just waste possession for nothing right i spotted that he messed up the kick off there so he took advantage yeah don't just hit the ball away if you have time try to make a play out of it try to make it threatening and on offense if your teammate just full committed on something a big thing that i think everyone can work on even pros myself included is just don't commit don't commit on stuff that's not a for sure goal right so make sure it's a for sure goal unless you absolutely need one then of course it's okay to take a risk sometimes gonna touch this soft touch for dapper again just trying to keep that control make them both panic i didn't have to do anything maybe they're both panicked on that unfortunately the dapper got up with you there but really good really good damn well done to get back to that let's bump from him you take this boost now try to get a shot really close to the end of the bar save your drop from that again keep the ball on the spot i can actually follow it up after there we go really good control there i'm gonna go for background boost instead of cheating here that i should have cheated but it looks so fun really close there maybe i should do it all in on that second challenge but it might still work like i passed this time to dapper i like that he fixed that makes him try to throw it away now he gets a free ball and he got the bishop before played off the wall should i just play it around them i'm gonna make a panic kind of just sit there in a spot where they might think i'm going for this down to the ground here go for a bump or so try to just sit in front of the goal line and be annoying be a nuisance we're touching go for the fake really good save if you try to play patient on the back wall from uh miss there soft flush to myself play it to the right side for dapper this gold is so funny and it all comes from just keeping possession right i'm not shooting in the obvious spots where they expect me to shoot you see how he's just defending the shot waiting back post the obvious thing is for me to shoot there so just playing it past middle there's really smart and again really well shot from dapper he's committing in the right way every time i got the wall for myself let him hit this away pretty much panic there is there just because i faked it pass off the dab i can't really follow this up but it's fine because zapper has another one watch this back maybe right to the right wall go to the ceiling here played across the adapter not quite the perfect pass but it's okay oh good we're having some fun we're up a lot of goals yeah are they well played good game there take advantage of their mistakes get possession well wherever you like move the ball down the field and stuff like that the baby committed an offense really well done 10 shots on each of us we're even offensive game as well but yeah good first game let's get to the next one stephen keep it up get back to back dubs on the day but good chunk of points for the first game of the day see in the next one all right so i queued for an hour with dapper after the first game did not find the game i've been playing with johnny for a little bit so i decided let's finish off the recording with one more game go for a block item there it's a good single jump 50. i think my time here i'm last for a little bit but we can get soft touch controller options it's a good 50. very even and it makes them kind of commit fully johnny just goes for me here it's pretty good for us all right jumping really early i usually don't like this from him like what he just did but it's not too bad because he missed her to help him out and john unfortunately got fitted in a pretty bad way there it's actually a really good situation for us after i went for that challenge if johnny had won that 50 or just not 50 to at all i just waited i was prime chance to maybe counter but i did get pretty fortunate on that that does happen got it back though i'm gonna cheat slowly here i just stay around here that way i can follow up on anything trying to go for this plain spot that i can react pretty much anything i'm going to bang this ball back i don't want to control this little too obvious and i don't think they'll be ready for a bang there we go that's the right situation to bang it back right they might think i'm controlling it i see them both creeping up pretty hard but i put it in a bad spot for them to react to and we got to go out of it so right time to bang it i think missed the boost by a little bit i gotta play a little bit safer anyway go for this boost from them can't shoot should be fine able to force them just wide thankfully both up for this is pretty big for us so i can challenge this should be back fine bump them off you're still going to have though really bad touch should be fine uh unfortunate the problem with this like okay the first man challenge is the most important thing in the situation and he didn't wasn't able to like dispossess him at all so he was able to just have full control of the ball even after getting by the first man which is pretty much worst case scenario there that effectively makes it like a one boutique the whole time right the whole point in the first man is to dispossess completely but it was really really hard for for trying to get a good challenge on that to be honest did the best he could just unfortunately yeah my situation is very very difficult at that point that's why the first man is such an important role nicely done good control on that ball good job to turn into a goal when you have that time it's a good challenge and i can get the mid boost pretty big pick the high i'm trying this shot i'm gonna go all the way back here do the mid boost just in case johnny has to get in he's rotating on the same side so i can't get back to it but it should be okay you should challenge me it's on the back wall it's a good challenge there fine if he goes for this they're not gonna get anything out of this really it's fine they're just trying to ball chase and just be aggressive it's a good challenge on both pretty much we both put on there and another good fish he has to destroy that way most likely i thought he's not back actually it's gonna be bad very good he wasn't in a good spot the challenge but i didn't think that would be dangerous at all i think you must have missed a boost or something it's very a little bit patient here there's no way you're scoring that there's no way this guy's storing this either by this challenge just the right time fine block the high he goes under me it's fine i have a teammate back it's a whole point of having two people back on defense you have one person to block the mechanical without challenge one person to be there to follow it up right the whole whole point and lower ranks you could slow down to an extent as well people can do less with the ball which is even better for you so right here i'm really just sitting in front of him make his life difficult teammate gets a free ball nice there we go it's a good play to make a good job from johnny on the demo the the perfect play to make from him to give me that free time on the ball that's what i mean that first first man challenge most important thing in 2v2 by far by a mile i pass it back to him that's fine can't shoot this none of them can score this i know that there we go really good job all right i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace from places [Music]
