yo what's up guys there's only two days left before the new season so i'm gonna be playing some more fusion for today trying to finish out the season strong should be some new games let's get into it let's see how it goes [Music] all right we got a sweaty game off the back here we got bicky is calm and tricky tom loves to demo a lot we know that so gotta watch out for that especially in twos dangerous kind of um i'd be playing against probably being chase yes i am that's kind of what's going to be happening this whole game usually what does happen nice shot wide but good try gotta control this put around one it's not bad play can't do anything with that good bomb for my teammate actually a good try there i'm a big hit not the best but i should be back for it nice good follow-up with the awkward like that i like to get slow and go off the top i think that's a good play to make get past my teammate this is gonna try nice pop actually it makes it really hard for them how about a pie like that they can't really jump for it it's always gonna be a different situation for them i like that a lot nice like i would go for that i should expect the fake challenger likes to do that a lot i was a good 50 from him i should take that differently maybe one for a bump on him instead of the touch would have been smarter this is definitely come down to a bump goal i have a feeling people in this lobby are very bump heavy yeah probably actually ended up pretty well for us not bad at all interesting touch from him which i really will actually i'm gonna fake the first touch here turn around gotta bump on him which is good i don't leave now to be a goal for them fortunate some of my teammates that should be lower so i can actually get a control hit on it but he went for the high hit so i couldn't actually follow it up and i was kind of stuck in the corner at that point but okay it kind of like spiraled badly a few bad touches like from both sides ended up going out in their favor i got bumped and shot from my teammate it's gonna be a goal good job good follow-up it's gonna save cheat here that's a little bit further back so i can react with whatever happens uh winning that boots have been massive but now that i don't have it i should just play for the beat on one i'm gonna fill the boost trying to clean the water off my control stick take a sip of it so i was turning a little bit weird it's a good beat let's touch back my teammate like that's play control smart force the bat touch out of both of them here but those hits aren't really useful for them it's really good for us i have a free 1v1 probably get the bump would have been a goal but good try do i play to make maybe a shot for my teammate it's not gonna go but it's actually smart play play this patiently should end up well for us see a demo nice shot good job well done hard to do a lot with that ball to be honest so i did pretty good with it got good control on it turned into a good bump can't go for this a little bit over me better to play the shot but nothing you can't save there if you go back whilst i think it's always the better play to make drop my teammate i could pressure this i don't have to commit but the main thing is just to pressure it and now i can turn on this if i want to okay to my teammate now take this boost fake this to play it down to make him get for free i played as well it's gonna hit a big hit over all of them that would they have to go back he has to get a big hit back here and try to beat him to the other side and give my teammate some space now good job i can get this boost pretty big i don't think i could be into this ball until you should go for me and get a demo that's pretty big really good 50 and i didn't actually flip into it so i didn't him into it really good pop it up there just going to leave it now do you make him follow it up it's really good to like keep control like that on a fake jump make him panic gotta go for a bump on me i'm gonna pick a panic at you again just by driving close made him drop the ball off this car that's all i'm trying to do there team has a free touch i'm not going to go for this not worth double cleaning on such is going to be a panic hit one it'll be fine teammates should follow this good job one soft touch to myself and then one big hit forward over one try to make him make a slick here if not i can back off it's fine to make sure to go first try to get behind here with pads instead of going for the big boost so i can help out if it's over him i can should be game gonna bait the flick again i'm just gonna try to stay close make him do something with it now i can go gotta go again should be a game yeah it's a good way to play that where i stay close enough that i can cut down any play that's going to develop and as soon as it's time for me to actually get a challenge off that would end the game i can go for it let's see it's play to me all right good first match i played pretty well certainly there's a lot of bumps stuff it's seven saves do we have to get the win there good uh first match against the next one's even keep it up get back to back dubs let's see how it goes all right for the last game we got oh against jasper and cam so sweaty game here jasper's ssg sub i believe and cam is also very solid player oh it's really good as well going to be a good lobby calm from last match actually won the third regional for na they beat us in the final i was v1's best performance in a long time so they've been doing well it's cool that we're uh running into a lot of good players today very solid matches always fun try to challenge my teammate good job nice should be open should be able to convert that well done challenging in twos and in threes lately has been the biggest thing i think just the way you challenge um the successfulness of your challenges i think is like the most important thing because if you just get beat on every single challenge you're gonna lose that game every time so if you can just practice like no matter what rank you're at just practice trying to get a good challenge or at least faking it to the point where it's gonna give your teammate a ball for free every single time the two things you should be trying to do i'm gonna try to pass this right off my first touch try really good pass to look for there always works oh is it so a good opportunity threatening one it's gonna fake going for the touch and just back off so i can go back first backflip here try to get one more touch oh i didn't get my my wave dash off that would have been a goal it's a good attempt though i'm gonna fake jump go back wall wait for flip here should be easy to save by past mid i thought i heard him to my left but i ended up not getting the touch that i would have wanted for it i was trying to pass it just like softly to my left but he was left behind me but wasn't close enough to follow that's my bad i should have tried to display it myself instead of go for the [Music] it's actually fun if i get them out there as long as it's gonna go actually mine's bad now and everyone that's all down so i've seen winning that challenge or not pretty much in that corner getting down there should be fine but i think he fitted it with him i went straight to his opponent or sorry his teammate i should say it's a good cheat though good spacing on the sheet hit kick off as well to go straight up there see how uh the other guy on their team he pulled off to the right too quick off the sheet you got to make sure that you don't turn too early on your cheat like make sure that you're playing what's gonna happen rather than like trying to like pre-read like way in advance try to play like exactly what happens in front of you pretty much that makes sense damn that was good from them but really bad kickoff as well for us it got us in like a terrible spot there's nothing you could do there the cheater i even stayed in a good spot just way better for them so a lot of goals really quick there i'm not going to cheat here just in case it goes badly it's a good save nice i almost played it everyone would have been really good actually forced out a lot of boosts another guy as well would have been huge try to wait for touch here fine you can actually follow this up one touch middle good shot a lot of moisture boost i don't think you can reach that at least not well good play to make 1v1 now for him good job they're going to be really starved here on resources hit around one round two there we go really good play to make good soft touches and good usage of our space and we know that they're low so we're just playing our advantage there four four half the game left they've been eight goals a lot of kickoff stuff bad cheats bad kickoffs on both sides some situations try to play number one here good demo from from cameron try to get in the way it's much better to do than to just let them have three touches on the ball there wait back oh anything he does should be able to react to nice should be shot good try getting bumped by the whole lobby might be bad now actually but we'll see is it done ah good try actually really good don't boost you i can at least fake it try to get in the way not many boosts but again just getting the way they're like stopping their play downfield is always better than letting them have it for free right to my teammate i didn't expect the shut up challenge there but at least you put the first touch to spot where they can actually get a good touch on it nice i have to watch the bump there there's one up going for a bump on me should have this put it back left to my teammate it's a little bit closer than i'd imagine but no situations a lot of literally just guessing they're in the right spot [Music] i've gotta be careful here though make sure we don't get too over committee really get passed back i like that a lot play over one round to the ground nice play perfect usage of our space good job to pass back there first touch around the first guy was good kept it really close he has no way to challenge us he has no help for a long time so it's the best play to make there another really good game for us so far i'm just thousand points again 44 seconds try to go quick for this that's the best thing i could have done it's actually a really good touch hit it around him and pretty much killed all the danger there pop it up can't get a shot on that but should work out well i can go for a bumper or even a shot here it's fine try to bump jasper with any middle if not just watch the angle for my teammate it's fine it's gonna help him quite a bit not the best touch should be okay though have some time good to use it flicked over one as well i have no boost but try to just bait the free touch should be a goal teammate miss should be a ghost though good job good work all right good games today actually really sweaty ones had a lot of fun i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching thank you so much for all supporting the channel as always i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all and peace and
