yo what's up guys going to be trying out the brand new 007 aston martin car from james bond and uh hopefully it feels good honestly it looks like it's a dominant hitbox you guys know i'm not really that into long cars but i've had some long cars that i've actually enjoyed so hopefully this is one of them we'll see let's get into some games let's even get some dumps see how it goes what better way to test out a brand new car than in hoops the most important game mode in the game i'll be honest with you guys i'm trying to search ones twos and threes and i cannot find a single game right now so hoops is gonna have to do for today but yeah let's uh let's try it out and see how the car is all right guys so i still can't find the game i don't know what's going on so i'm gonna cue everything i'm gonna q drop shot rumble snow day and hoops and i'm queueing us west and europe so hopefully one game one game can be found i hope it's been an hour and a half of queuing and we found a game i should have just queued those to begin with all right easy enough hopefully it actually joins us we're just stuck joining please don't please just join me in oh my all right see you in an hour whoa it's playing a song you guys hear that it's playing the little james bond down thingy i found a game after all the time don't don't tell me don't tell me it's a european server and this guy isn't actually going to join in oh my gosh guys why oh man all right all right we got a drop shot game this time all right all right i like drop shot this is fun well this car is longer than i thought i don't think this is dominance hitbox actually this feels more like batmobile whoa it's long i don't like the longness off he didn't go i've been really good this touch are we running we're running the passing plays already game just started i'm just gonna wait i'm gonna have a touchpad i can just kill on this dribble up the wall uh air dribbling with a really long cards like this feels weird to me man i can't quite get a a grasp of like where my car needs to be on the ball so much more different than the octane but i have used octane for like 10 000 of my 13 000 hours in the game so it doesn't make sense nice one more unfortunate it's a good attempt nice big damage keeping that in touch down to me yes sir we still have a clean side i shouldn't have said that i think we're gonna get damaged soon i'm gonna wait for a touch here nice block big block this car is so large though i feel like there's no way you won't get at least a touch on a 50 50. minimum all right be two of them here which is good wait until this guy goes and hit it over i actually played that really well these guys are geniuses in drop shot touch it once try to follow this myself he's like that right there okay on oxygen i can get a scoop on that every time and keep dribbling on this car it feels impossible it actually feels impossible my teammates are crazy though i'm not gonna lie no problem as soon as the goal goes in sinister is crazy though he looks like he's a drop shot mate understands the game mode what is that bounce dude that's not normal right no way that was normal double tap this if he misses he's gonna have it though you know she keeps it up it's the big touch i could be into this maybe yes sir these are crazy though they always get the next touch oh my gosh i almost faked our team out i'm not gonna lie i tried to i tried to pass it down so that my guy next to me could follow it up but i'm really glad he was ready for me to miss because i wasn't even expecting myself to miss there big touch let me go quick should be damaged yes sir big damage this game was actually really good i like it has a lot of potential i can't believe i didn't get the the last touch on that my team is crazy though teammates are actually insane get off the wall oh my a little bit confusing sometimes they're like the misses that randomly happen but i thought of that the game mode is like it's chaotic but like it's a good level of chaotic where it's still fun you know i feel like chaos like four before is actually too chaotic oh my did i snipe that something crazy i touch from him play off the wall again play off the wall just beating them as many times as they can they run out of boost eventually even though there's like recharge they're still gonna run out of boost i try to think of it the same way i think about like actual 33 like dwindle down their their resources and you're going to eventually have a good chance at goal they're always there they're always ready to really touch from sinister try to spike this down if i can osu that's huge all right good i shouldn't have hesitated there i'm surprised i lose that battle even my car being so long i feel like you should be able to win like aerial battles so much easier pass into him on the wall wasn't quite ready but it's fine pop it up once try to follow again maybe the car feels weird dude i don't know what it is i think it's because it's so long it just feels like i feel like a plank i don't feel i feel stiff that's the best way to describe it is i feel stiff i don't like to feel stiff normally i like to feel loose like agile feels like um feels like batmobile that's the bit the best way to explain it if you guys have i've used that mobile before it feels exactly like that mobile it's just that stiffness to it but i think some people like that stiffness i just don't personally outside that the car looks really nice i don't know how to explain it that's the best way from the first game that i can tell you i feel about the cars it feels very stiff feeling very long very plankish um let's get into one more and see if we can keep it up get another dubski with this beautiful beautiful car and uh yeah let's get into it all right we got ourselves what is this rumble rumble for the last game okay okay my rumble skills are probably a little bit sketchy it's been a while no we were in the octagon you guys fun fact this actually used to be in ranked for a little bit i know a lot of you guys might not know that but i actually used to be in ranks for a bit and a lot of people complained about it a lot of people really didn't like it me included i didn't really complain about it but i didn't like it i'd much rather the the standard maps but this used to be in rank it also used to be a wasteland which was curved a long time ago used being ranked and that felt really weird really really weird to play on and the ball would bounce very differently when it hits those those curves on the ground as well so there's a lot to get used to but yeah the car on a normal field feels pretty nice actually when you're on the ground so i noticed but drop shots a lot of aerial other aerial heavy um touches you know you're not really on the ground that much so it's kind of hard to tell that so i'm glad we got a different game mode for this also haven't played different game modes on this channel in a long time so switches it up a little bit you know well i just got all tabbed what the heck hopefully i didn't mess up the video too much i hate when the ball is frozen i never know what to do one more middle to my teammate freeze it now we're gonna get juked out by that one guy did should be good well maybe i can shoot this for a touch real quick for this how am i losing that i feel like i'm so long i shouldn't lose that battle there maybe i think i'm longer than i am oh blow him up chill what just happened what just happened i got sucked by the tornado i guess big demo there the tornado like moved me a bit it's the aston martin james bond car ot did he just predict the title we'll find out i don't know i don't know what i'm going to name it michael i almost i almost have a thousand videos on his channel guys i don't know what the name videos anymore i don't want anyone to call me clickbait i've never been called clickbait before like i've never had a video that the title isn't oh no oh i'm so sorry teammates um i've never had a video where the title is lying about what happens in the video so i don't want to lie about nothing uh i made that harder i think by sucking the the ball in with the plunger i got this boost is that just in sniping oh okay i don't feel crazy comfortable shooting with the plank cars i don't know what it is something about it just feels so much like i'm just driving a stick like a little skinny little stick and i always feel like it doesn't go oh i wow have a lot of points it doesn't feel like it goes where i want it to all the time i thought you'll always see me in octane even if i like a car there are there have been some long cars that i do like i'm not lying when i tell you oh my god wait that was crazy that was actually that was actually insane but that's a very hard catch i'm not gonna lie i just impressed myself because i normally am not that good at doing that with uh with long cars like this with often i could do that pretty often but with long cars i just impressed myself truthfully so this car's it's growing on me it's growing on me all right i wasn't expecting to be able to do something like that with this car so it's growing on me i'm gonna tell them it's nice it's nice not bad not bad two and a half minutes left pretty much a little bit more than two and a half minutes but let's see if we can keep it up get some more good goals hopefully i wanna i wanna have a good review of this car for you guys oh and then i switch with that guy oh my gosh that was genius i air dribbled and then i switched into the as the other guy and i made him score it look like i made him hit it i made it that was crazy that was actually big brain i i switched into the guy i air dribbled it passed it to myself and the net passed it back to that guy oh no that's a goal i wasn't prepared i think i i got a little bit confused thinking my teammates didn't have a 50 on this and i moved up a little bit all good though that's on me you can always play patient in every game mode if your last man back should always play a little bit more patient because you don't want to assume an outcome like that and you know be wrong and push up too far definitely like if i'm with my pro team there obviously i'm going to assume that he's going to get a better like a good 50 on that and then you know we can get a goal out of it but in ranked much wow much better to assume the worst and try to be ready for the worst that was pretty crazy i don't mind i'm not forfeiting to be honest having fun learning the car no problem nothing to apologize for dunking them oh it's all full boost though which is good i didn't use any boost oh i got my i like this ability we can just bang the ball i missed oh you killed one though you can get another shot of this no it went so far i forgot that i had it on i was trying to dribble oh my didn't have one more touch on this you miss oh i mean bump i'm gonna get them out again i'm getting kicked oh ah series of unfortunate events truly truly just to make this video a little bit educational um because there's a lot of random stuff going on he may bump me there but that's not because he was unaware or anything that's just because when um you're rotating back like that if you're not rotating opposite side of the ball most of the time that will happen because you're rotating back and you have your ball cam on like this i don't see what's in front of me right so he doesn't have his ball cam on there he doesn't know what's in front of him it doesn't know what's happening really so obviously he's going to accidentally bump into me every now and then that's why i'll do it in a second to show you an example the balls on this side i'm going to rotate opposite like this that way i'm in a much better spot i'm so much more spaced out from my teammates are and i'm going to be in a better position to actually do something with the ball when it comes to me that's why you'll always see me try to rotate the opposite side of what's happening so i'm gonna rotate opposite right here try to be behind my teammate that way i'm not in the same position as them and it makes it easier for me to actually make a play on the ball next time that's something that will help you avoid accidentally bumping into your team like my teammate did right there it wasn't completely his fault that we got scored on but it's something small that's really big to practice and somebody that separates the the lower level players from the higher level players and that'll actually help you rank up that alone i think is a really big thing that'll help you let's see what power up we get i hate getting the ice cube here i'll freeze it right there though because that'll get that guy out of the play same situation try to rotate opposite if it's right in the center if the ball is right in the center of the field there is really is no opposite you got to kind of assess the situation which side are your teammates on are your teammates more on the left side or the right side they're more on the right side opposite would be left side obviously that's what i would tend to do if the ball is going straight down the middle and there really is no opposite of the ball um but that's a really big thing though it's really overlooked skill i think is to do that i'd say it's more game sense something that you learn over time you'll always see me i do it now like subconsciously without thinking this is better to do it that way i'm going oh i might have had one more touch on that maybe a good pass middle either way fun game though almost broke a thousand points the car feels pretty nice not gonna lie liked it i did like it i got more fond of it as the games went on but i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one i love you peace [Music] how could i trust you when you hurt me
