yo guys gonna be queueing both twos and threes trying to play some uh more threes game to see if we can get ssl but i'm gonna keep twos just for safe measure because sometimes q3s takes a long time so we'll see we'll keep both whatever we get we'll play and then eventually the next videos will play some of our unranked games for 1v1 because i haven't really done any of this season so we'll do that in the next few videos i'll try to make that a priority and till then play some twos and threes and yes have some fun with it all right i found a two's game really quick we got lion blaze against toki and bambi it's a good match good first match here gonna be a 21 good challenge right behind him with full boost ready to react to anything good big chance for him i almost ended up making it into a goal which is good waiting left for the potential pass didn't come through we could still probably get the beach room here which is good i think of course i won't be one for lion blaze i'll try i'm gonna wait for the bass to come to me a bit more but i'm hit that it's fine it's not a big deal at all again one more touch won't really do much i'm gonna make them jump for this and i could just wait big jump here it's a good play let me get the bump on him well i'll save from him to be honest really good play there good turn from linebacker good shot as well that was a really good save from uh from tokyo he was forced to go back there such is always going to be bad because i was forcing the bump but he did a really good job to get out of that and actually got a really solid save out of it to be honest by past middle probably shouldn't expect it there we go good goal there good idea to look for the past even though we didn't actually see him on our screen we assumed he should be there obviously in lower ranks like you can't always play that assumption every time because in lower ranks people might not position properly but in high ranks you can somewhat expect that the good player especially someone that's you know considered a pro should be there for it nice actually really solid start to this game they'll probably forfeit if it stays up at this rate but it is a 2v2 game and at any point this can definitely change the way this is going kickoffs have been really good though it's gonna fake my presence to my advantage there let them touch that and turn forward again again just faking playing my presence essentially get ourselves a go off i'm just kind of just sitting there being in a spot that's really hard for them to play off was really hard for them to get around right behind me nice good fault challenge as well i'm not gonna go with him there he's already in that position so there's no point of joining in he has no boost i know that so just trying to wait for the ball to come to me for free which it will eventually if you wait long enough let's play into a weird spot for him force him away by driving for the bump sit back full boost here what i had to say which actually worked out that i missed that i'm gonna fake here might actually have been in it's really good play if it was not sure but good first game it was cut a little bit short so i might end up doing an extra one today but we'll see since the next one seems to keep it up let's go go all right this time we got toki against angel and bambi this is a sweaty game for sure turkish in the last game angel's pretty solid player baby's from last game as well nicely done we'll see what uh this game has in store for us i'm not sure what to expect to be honest news can be a very interesting game mode in a sense of like it can feel a little bit random sometimes it can feel a little bit you know i'm not explaining it's just like hard to predict the outcome of a two's game a lot of the time even if you know all the players in the lobby and you know how everyone plays one little error changes a lot in this mode it's all like 1v1 that way 3x3 you can get away with a little bit more in terms of like little mistakes but in two's one little error which happens a lot in twos it's so gold a lot of the time my first flip here after using that this play is essentially done i think my jumping for me there actually in a way ended up helping it didn't look bad but in a way ended up being a good thing that's unfortunate ended up actually missing the shot which is really unfortunate but all good so much time to shoot that there you expect them to get around target it gets it off the crossbar and it goes down into you on goal happens like that a little bit unfortunate but what can you do do it away a bit good first touch that's always too much boost in that challenge if you throw it away it's actually not bad you missed you have it for free and though i'm missing that's fine i played around one stop touch to myself jump for their double bomb good save teammates should be a little bit closer for the shot but it might still work i played a little bit too fast away from myself unfortunate i had the time to get a goal there for sure it was definitely a tough situation though but i'm hit at one stick the boost can't do much here so i'll just go straight back how to fake the low take a challenge gotta wait though he has all the advantage there backward like that i actually had so much time to shoot i thought he's gonna be so much closer the other player i thought i heard him like super close behind me so i panicked my shot of it but i had so much more time than i thought good follow challenge let's get attempts well actually really good play i like the idea a lot there they're both kind of just camping that kept it really close i still had the advantage all the time let's just stay on that probably a pinch after and clean it up here let him hit it even if he does it should be fine if we touch my teammate can actually follow that can be way too way too hard to get a good touch on that and i might just throw it away to them i can't really commit to on that try to stay on this myself maybe a double if he misses good attempts it's very unfortunate i think my teammate a little ahead of himself all good though last back for a while you never really want to go for um a pincher like something that could result in pretty much what just happened like you never really want to put yourself in a position like that or the play you're making can result in getting you scored on like that that's all good over them should be a goal nice they look funny though that pinch attempt this is always going to be a hard game i'm doing a good job trying the shot don't go for anything like super all in there i want to say grounded that's why i just kind of round shot it i didn't want to be too risky on the final shot attempt there even though i could have and there's a chance that if i did do that it might have been a goal but most time if he's in that there you go respect the defending he's probably going to save it all right this is actually good stretch for us 60 boost so i get a flip early on try to use that to my advantage i like that my teammate didn't go right away here but his challenge also has to be good you need to kill some time for me i was really awkward to read that whole situation did a good job i shouldn't have pre-jumped would have been a goal if he just waited but i think he thought the password of record required a pre-jump so i get what he did but it's all good i'll touch the left nice actually super good first touch it could be a goal oh my that was crazy done that first touch was really good it put a lot of pressure on them on the wall to catch that fake jump too i don't know really well play for my teammate at the same time i think that's badly played from them the other team because of zero seconds you know he's gonna probably try to keep the ground because if he flicks it high you can't fall out of himself so i would say just play the baller every time the fact that he didn't play the ball got him scored on he played the read on what was going to happen next and he would have been able to get both if he just played the ball but it's all good again very high side thing might be a little bit nervous or something who knows um either way well done for my teammate honestly i was really going to push it up there especially after a little circular second man and i put a lot of like spots there safe because i like to do that in twos more often than not like i like to play those like more situations if i know i can't get a for sure goal like it's not for sure i like to play it safe and then if they mess up try to play off of it but either way we did well it was a really tough game to win so i'm glad we want to let's get into the next one keep it up get back to back dubstep all right for the last game we got a actually very difficult 3-3 game we got two very good south american players and drops and uh bradson i think it's someone with their name change but i know they're both very solid players our team i'm actually not sure who the players are but i hope they are talented because we're gonna need all the talent we can get yeah it's gonna be hard it's gonna be a hard game not sure who anyone but the south american players are in this lobby so let's see he gets a pinch here a try nice good first touch should follow up as well it's really quick the sequence there i know the guy that made the touch couldn't actually fall from the ball so any soft question myself is good because the third man's kind of trying to see what's happening he's trying to fill that situation i have all the advantage that i feel so i think we played that pretty well one touch out good try i think a shot might have actually worked there because there's so much confusion in front of the net but again hard to hard to read that like really really hard to read that situation like look at this stuff that's going on like it's very hard to like look at it and be like oh i know what's happening next very very difficult almost worked wait what is going on i can't actually go for this now it's gonna be really awkward try to play the double what bump the other guy if i can nice at least delayed enough time for my teammates to go i almost get to go out of it as well really good read from uh infinite like to me maybe i can't touch all the way back to me early softback remember his furthest back get the free hit uh pass may have been a goal for sure there's no way the backlog i could have actually helped out with that if i didn't die so good demo from them not gonna be in but it would have had it even if it was it's fine not a big deal mainly trying to cut out the past day huge dunk should be free touch my teammate looks like you missed the i think if you missed that it's better not to follow up your own touch because you're expecting someone to clean up your mess right but if you go again right after you miss most time you debate on your team which will happen there i ah i like the past the first step is really good the second just throws it away hit save like any kind of shot there doesn't matter how fast it is not really going to score from there ever or just create some pressure dump just in case because it took a long time to challenge don't want to give mechanically tons of players that much space in the situations really good pass i play back my teammate i just leave it i like the situation like anyone any touch forward there would have been bad so the last time i tried to like touch back my teammate but i know this touch would have been bad so no point got a fake dunk as well pretty big two players out of the plane i can just leave it now take the boost much more useful than getting any bad touch on that ball it should go i say done fake take my time here put a fake again would have been a goal that's just like playing the situation to see if you can get a goal there like if he does mess up capitalize off that every time it's her in here probably keep it in wait for his hit actually well done right past maybe really good read from him actually i can't believe he actually got there i had so many extra touches like last second i'm gonna get a lot of pressure though here you may should be able to win this as well we can keep the ball in their half for the rest of this game there's a chance to get one more really big opportunity here two of them up for this bad touch pass it right will be huge run for the double which they're always going to be there for i don't really like going for a demonstration but actually could have worked because he got bumped out there try to play the block but should be fine a lot of time on that touch one more chance here i think i play patient though i don't want to get scored on look for something too over aggressive here should be okay you have to play it to the wall should be fine a lot of time i played the shot just in case but almost never going to be a go there again oh my god oh my god almost two crazy zero second goals in this video actually really good i think you thought there was no way i could have got the shot on that it's a really good touch for it should be a free ball if he turns he gets one more it's huge idioms oh my wait left left pass would be massive oh too far left didn't leave me enough but it was the right idea i like that even went for the pass at all a lot of people wouldn't even have done that oh i didn't you didn't think that i'll miss i didn't either to be fair is it flip killed one should give him time to jump back or control it let's stay in front of this gonna get the boost from me but it should be fine i hope my teammate can kill some time here barely got back to that one more touch should be fine wait middle here because my teammates have anything on the net oh it's a really really bad way to lose that that's all good teammate had very easy like yeah that's like a big issue i think that happens a lot in even pro games to be honest but it happens a lot less than programs and doesn't rank but i'll show you an example of why that's so bad what he did and it's actually very easy to like get out of that situation that he was in he just put himself in a spot where he gave the enemy like way more control of the play that he has and it kind of makes whoever's behind them which is being a situation just essentially useless uh so it was infinite i think in that so when you're in a situation never sit like this like never sit in net like this you leave so much okay here's back to the double committed at first that's why so the issue actually goes back even further i think because they don't need to get that kind of touch there but it's fine it's not a big deal that's not even a problem you should instantly come out and jump at this if he jumps at this at least right here makes contact 50 or anything it'll go out even if he misses this it's much easier for me to read that it missed here like way over here than it is for him to miss right here at that point it's impossible to read like to read what's actually happening next because from my perspective obviously i'm used to playing with professionals all the time it looks like there's no way he can miss this ball right because it's like bouncing very slowly in front of the net there's no no way he's missing this and at that point it's way too hard my mind was already going forward with where the play would have gone because in a perfect world even though he made a mistake already if he gets a soft touch to the corner here i still have my momentum going i can get an easy dribble with 100 boost go up the wall i have all this space on the field right so big big mistake that cost the game but it really is just the little things that led to the situation like just coming out a little bit wider coming with more momentum toward the ball would help a lot and it makes it much easier on your teammates to know what's going on try not to make anything a question mark for your teammates try to make it as awkward as possible for the enemy team especially on defense don't ever make something a question mark for your teammates on defense because that's when it becomes very very messy and it becomes double commits and stuff like that but either way it was a good uh good set of games you have very tough opponents every game even that threes game is very tough component so hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is watching this like comment subscribe and see us on the next one love you peace you
