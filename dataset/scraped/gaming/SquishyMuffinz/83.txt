yo what's up guys so the brand new beautiful energy black and white decal is finally out this thing feels insane in game and i'm not just saying that genuinely this is my favorite decal that i've ever played with i'm not even kidding i will probably use this for the next like whole year maybe two years i don't even know this thing is insane but i just don't see myself switching these are the cars that i'm running with right now i'm just gonna be changing the wheels only um there's gonna be an away decal as well which looks insane as well i can't if you guys see the way decal when it does come out i've been mainly rocking the white reapers this thing it just feels crazy in game i don't know how to explain it it feels so good but there's also the dominus and the fennic decals as well both of them look insane and they feel even better in game and if i just load up into into the game i'll show you how insane this car looks just to look at it from behind it looks crazy just it looks so good i don't know how to explain there's such a good blend of what you see from the back of the car with the whites and the blacks it looks so good it looks so so good but i'm going to show you guys how to get this for yourself if you guys do want to cop it and i do highly recommend that you get this because it feels insane i'm not going to lie to you like i genuinely think this is the most fun i've had using the decal in a long time and i'm just so happy that it's our teams and i could rep my team my squad and also feel like having a good time playing the game with the decal so go to item shop go over to the esports section on the far right go to north america a to r and then energy esports each of these decals will be 300 esports credits there will also be a way decals for us that will be released i don't know exactly when but they'll be released pretty soon i think and you'll be able to cop all three of those as well for the dominus fennec and the octane but these decals are so beautiful man like i honestly am so happy with them and i think that i'm just going to be addicted to decal for so long i could just tell it's everything i like in a deca honestly it's super clean feels fast to play with it feels like you could tell where the fronts of your your corners of your car are when you're using it that's something that i like a lot in decal's little small detail that i find is really easy to tell with this car um and in general honestly the price of all these decals like every one of these decals is actually a really good price in my opinion for what you're getting out of them you can't really get a default like black primary color on any decal in the game so that's something that i've always wanted on a decal for us and i think we finally finally got something like this i'm super happy with it but the dominance feels really nice as well dominance with white zombies i've tried that feels really good uh the fennec as well with white zombas or any kind of white or black wheel that goes well with this car and white or black wheels are the cleanest so that's why i just i love everything about this decal but this is just the home version of our decal we're gonna get an away version soon like i said that's gonna be extremely nice as well it's gonna be white primary with black secondary and it looks super super clean i can't wait for you guys to see that as well i'm super happy with that decal how it came out but yeah 300 um esports tokens for each of these decals let me know down below in the comments when you purchase this for yourself and let me know what you think about it because i think it's honestly one of the greatest decals in the game i'm not even just saying that i'm being honest with you guys when i say that i know i've said that about um certain cars that i think they're really really good and then i don't use them anymore but this is something that i genuinely think i'll use for like a year at least minimum just feels super nice but but for today we're gonna play some extra game modes i'm not sure what we're gonna play yet but i'll probably just cue all four and whatever we get i'll end up playing so let's get into it stephen get some dubs see how it goes all right so i queued all four extra game modes and we ended up getting snow day which i'm not too happy about because this is the most like grounded game mode of them all but we'll see what we can do we have an afk guy off the bat now this decal is crazy i'm air dribbling a puck i don't think i've ever done that in snow day off the bat i start air dribbling the puck wait that's crazy what that would have scored it too i think your title is glitched oh he's saying the rlcs yeah i'm so happy with this decal though i'm not even i can't believe that we actually have like a black and white decal that's just this sick and it's not bacchus mod it's finally not on a mod you guys know i've loved the black beak house for so long like i've made so many videos on the black decals on different cars and stuff like that they always feel so nice like the perfect blend of the black and the white on this car also too i'm just so happy that you can use any like black or white wheel and it just works perfectly and reapers they match up so well with the way this decal look i actually kind of like snow day now it's kind of vibey oh no i thought my teammate had it all good all good i was getting ready for his touch across look at patches patrick's car is drippy though got a little hat on i wonder if there's people out there that just main snow day like they only play this mode it probably is it's actually really a pass big 50s my passive patches oh my teammates should be back though i want to run like a viewer attorney sometime i think that would be fun as well if i could somehow like maybe post on my youtube like it's just like a community tab i can post on tell you guys to join attorney and run a video like that i think that would be fun be a good idea as to me i actually did but i can't do anything with it a little bit behind me but i like that he actually passed it oh my god wait what is that what is that you can see my my thirteen thousand hours of muscle memory the balls rolling or the pucks rolling toward the wall i think it's gonna go up it just goes out that's funny so used to the thing just going straight up there i actually don't know like what the meta is in this mode i'm guessing bumps are insane though because you have to stay really grounded it might be scorable funny out of his way nice patches is on one right now was not missing i'm like the most aerial based snow day player i swear trying to like air dribble the the puck over and over again i don't know why i love the way the decal looks like when you're just looking at your car like this just looks so good great line lines up with the wheels i know what the right word would be like aesthetically pleasing i guess is the the way to put it it just looks right looks good i'm figuring it out you just gotta stay grounded a lot to stay on the walls go for some bumps be annoying wait let me set on the puck i actually said it the puck wait i didn't even know you can do that i was just like joking i tried to see if i can do it but i guess you could okay so that's a mistake there i don't think you should ever flip into this that was a ball i think it's a good thing to do but i always forget this is in the game dude i keep trying to flip my muscle memory it's so hard for me to break things that i've always done oh i'm trying to score off of it thought maybe i can get a pinch out of that for round one dribble wait that's crazy no oh i might have a ceiling shot out of that that is crazy no dude i'm almost going off but i'm just short oh all right we're good should be fine oh alrighty does he have that i've done some insane stuff this game i'm not gonna lie we've dribbled the flip reset how did i flip i i single jump also i'm gonna add the controller overlay back to the videos guys i keep forgetting for next video we'll do it for sure let's save but so much pressure we just can't score i'm gonna uncue snow day after this so we got a different mode because i don't want to play snow day two games in a row oh i was right to him you guys are too smart though they just stay grounded okay that was insane that's all on the decal that's all in the decal i'm not gonna lie that was insane what why did it look so clean all right eight seconds left you gotta hold it down luckily they're all wait they know the pinch straps oh he would have had it too it would have been another one that seemed play well you dropped from them look at this car dude patches got a crazy car all right let's get to the next one that was uh interesting first game of the day let me un check snow day and let's cue hoops drop shot rumble see we get all right for the last game we got rumble of course we got my two least favorite extra modes oops is my favorite i think and then drop shot but i really like drop shot but you have to play with three people i think if you solo q drop shot it's kind of messy at least rumble's like the normal game just with extra stuff that you got to worry about wait for this hit so we can kind of use like where we normally play which is nice i guess you don't have to change completely how you play like in snow day we got spikes though which is good off the bat no i hate this boost one wait wait that was almost crazy mid oh my that's crazy i'd like to see how people like i've learned to use different power-ups in this too people that have been playing since they came out like if they figured out certain things like there's a lot that we don't know oh he froze at the perfect time but that was almost just in no way i forgot that was a thing as well oh my i tried to use my power up if i didn't click l3 hold on it's about to be crazy i'm just going to hit it away so he doesn't score off that because that power up sophie the plunger i swear is still the best power up i swear you could be like so far from the ball and it pulls it's like way too much power in any direction you want you can even pass yourself with it i actually like that power up so much i like that in the grappling hook i think the grappling hook is crazy the back wall ah crayfish was up for that he's ready i'm about to go on a tear and actually tear here oh i'm watching the ball because i was watching him these guys use their power up so defensively i feel like they save them just for defense maybe that's the strat got my spikes again hopefully i can actually use them this time no oh my god hello i love that power up so much dude you have so much power you do so many things looks so funny man it's honestly so scary there's nothing scary in this game then someone with spikes is slowly creeping up to your net in a one-on-one it's like no way to defend it really unless you have a power up to counter i guess let him click this oh i switch to this guy pass to myself no my teammate launches me all good save the pass it back to my teammate a little pop take that guy for fun that's fine i'm just gonna hit it away i don't know what i had in mind there did not work how i wanted it to he's not a boost though so it should be fine dude these guys are so smart with their freezes they keep on giving me this power up to pass down oh there's a movie closer dude they're using all their power ups on me made that guy boost also i think that that power is good for you sometimes it's like choose want to use that very smartly that's even a word intelligently it's gonna 50 them my first touch maybe i could bang it off of it oh no i couldn't get the angle it read from him actually i'm liking these extras a lot like dude these guys are crazy with the freezes five freezer will get off his spike oh it doesn't i just wanted to check it let's try to read his spikes here that was genius it's kind of genius low key let me tell you i have it go for the bum yes sir and then he uses boot on me instead i'm just blocking my teammate right that's actually crazy i think i blocked them from being able to use it on my teammate shooting that let me know if you guys like these extra mode videos by the way i haven't been in the mood to play ranked videos lately i'm not gonna lie so i've been doing some extra mode stuff probably get back to ranked in the next one but anyway anyway i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this if you guys do not have this decal yet definitely go into the shop pick it up for yourself i'll make a video on the away decal whenever it comes out because i can't wait for that one as well i've already seen what it looks like it looks super nice i think it looks as nice as this one if not even better so hope you guys enjoyed that one as well but yeah thank you guys for watching i appreciate y'all love y'all have yourself a good one peace you
