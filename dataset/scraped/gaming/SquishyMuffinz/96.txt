yo what's up guys gonna be playing some games for today with a chronic gonna be dual queueing either um threes or twos because we obviously can't play one so i'm gonna be playing either of these games i'm gonna cue both i think we're high in both them right now let's see we're currently 65 and ones 25 and twos because we haven't played and i think we lost one game actually on stream so we dropped like 20 points but a lot of people um grind twos so it's pretty hard to stay up there unless you're playing it a lot as well so i gotta keep grinding too so 25 and twos number six and threes so we gotta get back on the cry i took one day off and we dropped in every single uh every single playlist so let's get back on the grind gonna be playing both twos and threes with the chronic hopefully you can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we gotta split a game off the back here we got um skills and nitros let's see how this goes i've actually never played two of the chronic but i know he's very good player i think he's on team liquid it seems those tag says must have just joined them i know for sure he's a really good player first time playing with him though so it should be fun take my time here in the dribble it's fine if you hit stack because the chronic should beat them like myself on the wall it's always a safer play to put toward the wall like that you get a demo as well it's pretty big maybe go for the other bump try demo from a chronic i'll challenge early i think a really bad ariel with that to be honest so if i just go early it shouldn't be too bad for us good job challenging that where i faked them played through the wall to myself finally and i got the bump which is pretty big try from a chronic i don't wait here patient this is where the 1v1 comes into play those situations take this shot hopefully it's not over there we go those are always so awkward you're unsure if it's over or not you know that it's empty but you gotta get it fast enough right it's always an awkward situation i feel like wait for his touch you should go for this fine if he hits it away now get patience from a chronic i maybe double try i gotta play basically here i'm gonna jump off the top of the roof yeah it's really really awkward so i was just getting chased all the time all good that's the only downside about like the shot that i kind of went for there if he doesn't make contact on the second touch and they all just wait i'm pretty much gonna be in the one with two every single time there but obviously there's a way that i can get out of that if they mess it up or if i don't get bumped it's very hard to get out of it because i have to take some sort of evasive action actually missed my bounce good for us too yeah it wasn't the best bounce for him fortunately we got to be careful of like over committing though i think we're both kind of going for pretty shots like that right there could be a really good shot but at the same time it leaves the next person back in a really bad situation most of the time faking nice actually good shot could create some pressure on them let's pre-jump this doesn't have his flip i get this challenge should be fine easy challenge on that should have a good 1v1 opportunity here i must have gotten fake i'll just wait for the the respawn behind me play it high i go for the bumpy i should have maybe just shot to be honest i don't know i think in my head i thought maybe a car could be back quick enough but then i think he was just demoed so he couldn't be a try it's like a challenge there we go this is a good play to get the bump there wrap around it also for and you guys want to use my settings right now i've been messing with 108 and 109 fov only thing i'm really using different so i'll use 109 for the rest of this game i feel like it's kind of a cheat code some ways you feel too fast and 110 109 is like a little bit slower it's nice in that way it's a good fake i got the ball cleanly ain't got to fit the middle here is good i actually could have just went straight in but that creates a lot of pressure on them doing that well done and then a chronically able to just clean it up and get a good shot really good control day i can't go for this touch i'll just rotate behind was ever awkward for you just get into a better position behind your teammate that's all you can really do to try to help i mean that situation is still really bad for us regardless but either way that's always the best way to make you're just gonna put yourself in a spot where you can react a lot more than if you're just kind of like sitting there you know if you just sit there behind your teammate in an awkward spot you're not gonna be able to do much trying to put some pressure there by just sitting around i'm gonna stay on this i have 30 boosts so any kind of 50 here is fine then it's going to be really good for us single jump 50s are perfect to be honest good job but kong to be there well done with them i think that's like a really underrated way to the 50s they're just a single jump and make good contact on the ball and it's going to be enough to create a good opportunity for your team it's fine should be enough for the challenge but i miss i missed an empty net it happens to the best of us i'm also so surprised that that was going to be empty that i was not expecting to have to be able to shoot it to be honest that's all good oops it's like a challenge i know you couldn't be there so i was just trying to make it touch that keep pressure should be okay still you have a two goal lead here 30 seconds it's a good 50. frank should go for this me play to the corner if you missed this i have a shot i'll play off the wall now they're good that's to make in threes but in twos you see how it was like i feel like that was more awkward for him than it was good for him but in threes it's like a good that should make his the defender has a disadvantage there massively and the person facing the ball is always going to have a huge advantage so i like to touch a lot in threes but in twos it's more of a bad habit to do something like that because i think it just leaves your teammate in a bad spot but you know that's a good win uh we got some good amount of points out there like six points pretty good get into the next game see if we keep it up get back to big dubs see how it goes all right the last game we got ourselves same people we actually messed up this kickoff but it worked way back here patiently it's a bit of challenges pretty easily pick my time look forward got this boost maybe grab his back boost as well what the heck played around middle well done well done it's a good pass very strong pass to make out middle i think it creates a lot of pressure on the other team right middle here called boost doesn't have to use me but i'm just here in a position where i can react to the good and the bad right they bang this away i'm there the chance to score i'm there as well oh yeah it's a good shot most important thing here is the first touch right here actually be able to follow this up and uh place the shot off of that right because if that first touch gets too far from me i can't really do much put high in a spot where it's awkward for me i have to just throw it back to my teammate which is what i want ultimately should play this right wall maybe if you get the beat i'm back for it again the such isn't going to do much for them unless it's a perfect double which is not going to happen very often put this forward i would have been back for anything to save anyway so i don't mind that not being on target to be honest i think it makes it a little bit more awkward for them to save i gotta be careful of the bump here i got away from it somehow right down the middle to my teammate could i get this back left boost as well now that he had some control i missed it but it's fine let him touch this follow it up now it's a good block including the boost we had we actually created a lot of pressure there which is really good it should be wide super crown i can follow this up i'll be mid now i don't wait too long middle here i'm just gonna i'm just gonna dip to a safer position it's a good 50 go go for a bump here as well makes even more awkward because now look how he has to stop and get around that ball right through like a bump to make on that the last guy back there don't want to focus on this i am last man he may not be back for a while so that's a much better play to me he gets the ball in a safe position should be okay now really good pop what a flick uh i think i've been into challenging too much i think you just read it there good touch to the corner i don't have any boosts here should be fine there we should come back soon all right just waiting i like that i can get vision of him there off that touch creates a pressure by just driving up to him makes him have to throw it away makes him a little bit more rushed don't give too much like free space in those situations especially if you're lower ranks i feel like that's so underrated just drive up and create pressure by like just this for example driving up and doing that he's dead and now his team has to do so much work here as long as the chronic challenge is okay we're fine but he got done by the fake a little bit even though he probably honestly probably shouldn't have been able to get fake because the ball was grounded but either way that's a really good thing to do if you're first man you go for the bump like that or just like pressure them like this this is another good example just make the throat away as soon as they jump as soon as they jump like that i can leave and now my teammate gets a free ball this guy's not gonna air double across the map there's no way so it's a really good thing to do just early pressure like that it's massive against any good player you don't want to give them all that space right it's a good idea we're on the right side here play four i can't get a shot of that would have been too slow let me go straight back again it's off to myself here minus a 50 should be fine maybe a shot from a chronic he's gonna go for a solo play i can't actually follow this because my boost i'll just play back i think it's the better play it's gonna be and it gets about to win that every time so i like making that play rather than trying to force or go out of that oops should be fine though nice [Music] it's all good all good happens i was ready for anything middle anyway if he did miss like that i would i would be there i was hoping i wouldn't get bumped into that and my team would just have a free touch there i'm going to challenge this one i think should be able to get back maybe uh i'm lucky you guys would be kind of assuming that chronic would be oh it's actually unfortunate that mid boost is gone i wonder if kind of watch that back see if i took it if i took it then that's on me for not remembering but if that moves up he would have been fast enough to rotate play to the safe space take my time here really good 50. really strong 50. played high forward take this boost as well let's throw this way back to my teammates he make him maybe boom this to me finding it for solo i have to play this patient i'm not back for a while here i don't want to get bummed i don't think my teammate can even help me yeah you can break the big hit get a bump on him i kind of want to keep it up low key i want to get another goal but it's fine all right i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all from places [Music] i've never seen
