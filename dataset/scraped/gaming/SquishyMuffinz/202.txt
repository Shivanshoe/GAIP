yo what's up guys going to be playing some more games today with alpha cap and gyros really good games in the last video so let's get into it see if you can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game playing against da poopoo and dino and junior bond or jr bond i think i've always called this guy junior bond for some reason but it's probably not that it's probably probably just jr bond huh should i get one more here should have probably left that after jared went up i'm gonna go back here get this boost try to be a position where i can get the ball from my team i shouldn't even flip there to be honest like you shouldn't have to flip it a challenge like that that's me making a mistake i'd say should be gyros to get nice couldn't exactly reach us that's fine i'll take that better than throwing away possession my team still gets the ball and it probably faked them out a little bit as well bad challenge to go for full speed a couple mistakes already in terms of challenging they're not big mistakes but they're little ones that i definitely do notice to get past should be a goal there we go yeah those challenges though i need to take them slower 100 and uh it'll make my team be in a better position for the next play i shouldn't be rushing that as much as i was i'll put this over to the left side again those touches are okay but you want to try to avoid hitting it forward to the opponent as much as possible instead make touches that are over to your teammates or even leave the ball in spots where it'll give your team the ball like that situation is really good for me not even to flip because i hear the guy behind me if he kills me he's gonna hit the ball exactly where i would hit it because i'm just in front of it i'm body blocking the ball he wants to kill me he has to hit the ball as well so there's really no upside of him bumping me there i'm gonna just stay behind the ball here same situation i'm just gonna drive to it if i get the bump in them even better good control from kept a little bit like dangerous obviously right in front of the goal like that but good control to get out of that situation now wait at midfield here drivers never touch it's going to be on the back wall i'm just going to leave that use my wave dash from my flip that i got i'm not going to be there to go all the way back nice from cap you're trying to pass tried to flick that over pajaro it's a good idea shooting there isn't a crazy good idea because more than likely you're not going to get a go out of it i shouldn't be trying to pass that mid when i see gyro on back wall cap's never going to be able to go forward off that so i should definitely play that a little bit different all right i just want a situation where i need to slow down a bit try to create a play that's going to go back to my team it's good you pretty much almost never want to give your opponent like two consecutive touches like that right there is gonna be a really bad thing for us almost every single time they might get a really fast shot of that or they might get you know a really good like solo play out of it because he's creating space for his teammate so right here you want to try to give this to my team however way i can so that's a really good thing to do right there what i just did yeah worst case scenario there should have been fine but there was like a couple of unlucky things that happened it bounced off the wall slash post there and kind of went over to the right instead of just staying where most people think it should have stayed right should have probably just went straight out there but instead it bounced to the right which kind of messed up gyro endcap good save i'm gonna play patient with this i'm gonna just bait in the touch get it across i'll try to stay on this i'll fake the touch again here let's play it over one not a bad idea the only thing about those that are kind of questionable is when you think about it you're only moving that ball forward right so you do something like that you're moving the ball only forward you can never really get that over to your teammate it's never going to be a consecutive touch type of play right it's always going to be you just air dribble forward and then it just ends so that kind of play is not good for that reason i was unlucky from jar i should have been back i think i stayed too long on their half not playing too good this game but it's okay it happens i'm just making a couple mistakes here they're getting possession out of my touches you want to try to always look to improve that kind of thing right where you're keeping possession to your team that was a good play to make actually because the forces touched middle to my teammate the bump kind of forced him to rush this play good bump from him should be okay i'll leave that boost for gyro cause i know he's gonna land and probably try to take it good play from kepp he's gonna pre-jump might be a pinch you gotta kind of be careful for those those kind of pinches pops okay again i might try to stop doing those as much just because it really doesn't accomplish a crazy amount right there's a lot of space made here this could be a goal good try i'm gonna go back here try to block them still kind of forced out only one option on that touch room which is good from us that off the back wall the track from gyro go behind now huge dunk from cap mighty to go in the second here i'm gonna fake this try to pass over to kept side i'll be middle here just could actually to a ghost though the consecutive passing plays i was talking about i shouldn't wait for that close good try yeah good touches there a lot of good decisions we're making there good like micro decisions i should call them because there were really small ones that make a huge difference like stuff that you would definitely miss if you weren't paying really close attention to the game really good safe from them i'll take the mid-left boost here i should have probably scored i should have placed that better shouldn't have dove full speed at that should have stayed grounded go for a double ear should be okay for a second gonna play this one forward i'm not gonna be mid for a second cap's gonna be all the way back which is really good for us i should have taken that mid boost i didn't think it'd pop up let's pass the cap would be good forces them to hit the ball back to my team are you behind a mirror full boost all right if i get a block here it's pretty big for us waste two of their boosts out pretty well it gives my teammate that's lost back the ball for free that's why you want your third band back to be really far back in a three situation like that because it's just gonna give you a huge advantage most of the time your third man's in a far back spot that's unlucky slightly unlucky jar pops it up he just pre-jumps the touch it was good that we got you out of the ball for free like good possession but that was just really unlucky but he got dunked there like that they wanted it more they did want it once all right good first game let's get into the next one i could have played better it happens let's get into the next one though see if we can uh at least finish one and one on uh on this video we lost like 10 points off that probably the same thing we gained in the entirety of last video that's how it is though a lot of times the higher mmr games you're gonna gain like probably five six points you're gonna lose probably 10 up to 16 points so that's why it's hard you got to be very consistent you got to not lose very often and we don't lose very often but it's going to happen it's bound to happen like that so yeah i'm gonna call for kickoff let's try to win uh the one to one game for today should i go one in one try to follow us up one more time beat two of them there just pass over the cap as well i'm just gonna go back take time here let's bait somebody in i didn't even see him he honestly challenged that super well he was behind the ball the entire time that's something that i should try to like think about more i feel like when i'm challenging trying to like disguise myself behind the ball i never really do that very much i also get fast from gyro one of those situations where you have to kind of trust your teammate and you have to be there for the shot so well done from him try to cheat up here save all my boost stay midfield 50 if he wants to use me i'll stay behind him i want to stay in a spot for if he loses this 50 or something goes wrong here i can kind of react to it right that's where i am there we go i'm going to spot where i can also get a go out of it if the situation prevents if the situation presents itself i can still get a go out of it right ended up bumping each other i saw that so i just went in on it and got the goal so i don't think we're gonna be able to get super sonic legend out of this video just because we ended up losing that leave that one for kept close but yeah it's fine though i enjoy playing threes regardless like i think threes are more enjoyable than twos personally i just love like the team play aspect i think for me it's like unmatched i love how it feels i don't think you can get that same team play aspect in in twos try pass over to gyro as i say that i better have a nice little three man close i can wait right wall again create another play here wait for the bounce i don't need to go for the ball here i can just fake that guy try to play this mid one more okay that was going to be a good idea but i ended up ended up going downhill there i should have went for that i don't know why i jump put a little bit dumb there for a second try to snipe one there we go we're there for all the shots this game i'm trying to play a little bit more anger last game i wasn't really going aggro enough so i decided this game i'm gonna try to go a little bit more aggressive try to be there for the shots that i wasn't there for last game we've done it pretty well go back now hold on to my boost gyro might have a double if not i'll fake this bake them all in hit that over one at least make it really awkward for the guy middle i could have stayed with that for myself might have been a better idea they have to kind of respect my touch here it's a good 50 they can play to me forward now that's fine i don't mind that at all because again gyro is sitting right there right giving the ball for free there's no real downside to that okay i gotta be careful here now could definitely be a risky scenario yeah so that's really tough to be in because that obviously wasn't what kept wanted on the double i didn't get that back boost he missed the double tap which is what i was originally covering and that shot was a bouncer which is extremely hard to stop especially if you're previously covering a different angle so all that was just really tough to deal with there was a world where it was savable i just had to position a different way put that around two of them really good patience though i feel like we're taking our time in good spots we should keep on doing that keep on making that a habit because that is easy to rush every single ball and think you need to hit every ball as hard as possible but it's good to slow down in spots like that for sure she's gonna wait for her touch here again i'm not even trying to panic to those situations i'm just trying to force out the touch all i'm trying to do and especially the lower ranks it's going to help you guys a lot it might look weird in high level gameplay because everyone says very grounded but that's how you have to play these days the same ground gives you more options that's unlucky that's very unlucky i'm just gonna straighten out that but yeah same grinder does give you more options right right there if i had flicked that that's probably gonna be a goal i tried to go for the fake but it didn't even care about the option of me flicking it he's just gonna straight for the ball which is really good on him try to just like narrow it down to one option and just cover that and stick to it um that can go good and i can go bad and it went really well for him that's something that on on defense you know you have to make that choice and just stick with that's what i was talking about i don't know if it was last video or if it was the previous game but sticking with your instinct is a uh a huge huge part of rocket league and you have to trust your instinct a lot of these situations i shouldn't went for the shot there though you definitely have to trust your instinct in the moment you can't you can't go back on that if you made a mistake deal with it after but most of the time whatever you you thought was the right thing to do was probably the right thing to do that's what you feel is best in the moment that at least ply applies for like professionals i don't know about lower level players because your instinct might not always be the right thing but you have to trust your experience what i'm trying to say from what you have seen it's all you can base your your thoughts around that was really good patience the first first little bit of patience there to take take an extra second on a touch was really smart this should be fun for us it's fun again i go straight over to gyro that's like one of those best-case scenario situations you gotta shout out to my teammate again i don't mind letting them shoot these at all i'll let them dive in on this corner all day long because it's not going to really give them anything i want i want to challenge me again here because like teammate's going to get the ball in a second we got to free clear out all that we're going to go out of it so i don't mind being the first man to let my teammate get the ball next right i'm just going to stay grounded and give them that opportunity to get a free clear to me it's really quite simple i have to deal with that stuff on on defense it's just it's easy to overthink it right and think there's a lot more that you have to do or you have to dive into every ball you try to win the 50 50 in every single ball you don't need to it's very unnecessary a lot of time you can just play patient and play smart and it'll get you to win yeah we got at least one win today unlucky on the first game a couple of things didn't go our way exactly but it happens hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times you're watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys all next time i love y'all peace you
