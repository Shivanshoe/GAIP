before we start the video guys I just wanted to quickly say thank you so much for all the incredible support there beginning anywhere between 3,000 to 5,000 subs every single day if we maintain that rate we're reaching million subs by like April or June which is nuts literally before half the year is done and we can reach a million so which is just ridiculous and think about thank you guys for making it possible if you are not subscribed please go down below the channel right now press the subscribe button and press the best you're always notified when I upload a new video thank you so much guys I love you enjoy the video guys just a few things to talk about before we head into the games for today's episode we changed our name from Kevin to Jim who's also Jim Halpert from the office obviously we're gonna keep it the office theme throughout this whole series most likely that way people don't really recognize us if they watch the previous episodes let it record quite a few in a row so so if I play this Kevin now it's already been like three or four episodes out so people would already know that Kevin to me if people have watched and we're in the game with them so we're gonna head into the games as James from now on and we finished off in the last video at Diamond three Division four so today if we win both of our games we should head into champ one pretty comfortably so let's get straight to the game for today hopefully we keep up our wind shake we have yet to lose it take a look at the stats really quick we are 17 matches 1-0 losses which I'd hope so we have to put anybody past diamond quite yet so generally be losing any games quite yet hopefully we can finish the entire stage without losing any games but yeah let's get into the games for today and hopefully grab ourselves two more wins to add to that tally let's go all right so we got ourselves everyone over 1100 in this Lobby so everyone's well into Diamond also guys the the controller overlay as you see is different it's really dope it was made by a viewer of mine on twitch and yeah it's a the c9 logo on the side of my name's on the little touchpad at the middle as well which is really dope so thank you for making that I'll get the the name of the person who made it and I'll shut them out after this this game I just faked that I head back here team I can grab this I haven't recorded one of these in quite a bit so something weird adjusting back to how this rank plays but my team is dribbling very well so we could tell this is pretty much a champ Lobby here so let's get a slow double touch someone on goal puffed up there again see what they do so you could tell everyone's way more comfortable with how the area so we'll go for you know some some of the more advanced stuff but not too advanced for where they can't sit like that double touch I went forward wasn't to domestically definitely got back to it wasn't in but it was slow enough to depart where they could save it good shot for my team it to be there good so everyone's already super consistent except for the fact that my teammate didn't go for the ball there on kickoff and pretty much shaved him a freak oh oh so as I say that super consistent might not be the term that we're looking for because that was not a very good touch I mean he had a lot of space no one was really challenging him in any way but he's still paying anything am I free to go oh man he didn't go for kickoff which is the biggest mistake there obviously if you're the person on the corner that's like a bronze mistake not to go for that I want to say bronze I say bronze maybe don't know yet but it's pretty obvious bronzes I saw more bronzes and we're like the entire team goes to the ball and then no one goes for well see this after sir I can stay with this ball team he should be going back he should write it up that shouldn't have been following the ball so I try to use my time wisely okay never mind tissue that's so classic so classic for for the lower ranks I swear like I had so much time there my teammate positions a middle I can get a wide open pass to him and it's probably gonna be a goal but instead he decided to take the ball away from me to challenge it a little earlier it's fine there so he's gone for boost so I'll just try to bank never mind and he was me I hate these rakes do this I hate these rings I just I just came off a very very frustrating 24-hour Street because I was like so out of energy guys and I'm recording this right now and not have to deal with someone while you me when they're the one that's cutting me off oh my goodness he probably thinks he's carrying to you is the worst part that's the worst part it's getting to his head he thinks he's carrying right now I guarantee this is the kind of dude he's gonna type he's gonna talk to me hundred percent if I take a ball off of him that he thinks should be his he's gonna talk to me for sure I'm trying to play it like I said as possible try not to lose over aggressive link for the ball chasing carry am I trying to do that my man is afk dude oh my lord I popped it over one I want to go for a full map arable year but I'll stay on the ground here try to place the shot my teammate was straight-up afk so he's not the greatest ago for kickoffs would have noticed but his arrows aren't too bad just has that one big mistake at the beginning again like on defense hitting the ball away from your goal is only part of the save you gotta get a get touched at the corners well they can't follow up on and that's a huge tip for this rank cuz I notice a lot of it issues are defensive like he's probably get a good touch here if you at any time she's gonna be bad most likely actually a good idea to control to the corner that's the one time that I didn't see this team panicking situation but I just faked challenging for a second and I got three possession out of it fake challenges and this ranked guys be able to hit the ball for free it's the same thing as like what they were doing and diamond well I mean I think this is chamber ready right actually never mind this is still diamond setter mine it's the same thing is what they're doing plot they're lucky you can you could fake challenge these players and they'll give you the ball for free I think that that remains the same even the grand champ want to see if you do it the right times that's something you should always try to incorporate regardless of who you're playing but it works really well against these drinks cuz they'll throw it away for free like almost every single time whereas grand champs tend to read a little more often than these drinks would so I just swung got really wide took the emptyness shot better get a good angle on that then jump really when I know I have time to get around the ball and just take a fast shot doesn't have to be like well-placed or anything it used to be fast enough to get by the last efendi item yet why does it not go for kickoff so we've all right very interesting gameplay from from this match right now I don't that's very weird but we got the win now that was quite quick to be honest she might have to play next one we'll see how quick the next game is but let's see how many points we got from that we got 28 points we got the champ one off of that so we're finally into champ one now so hopefully these lobbies are a lot more consistent with like their aerials and everything we'll see the difference in the next game obviously hopefully we play all champs maybe not play any more diamonds but yeah we're trying to play two more games I think because that was super short but yeah not a fan if I my teammate was was acting I feel like he was he was cutting me off quite a bit and then the one time I go for a ball that was definitely my ball like he was going for the boost and he could get the boost you should have left it for me at that point if you see them going toward it the one time it was my ball he gave me for going for it so it's one of those teammates who probably thinks he's just like better than everybody so he doesn't anyone else touch the ball but him that's just it seems like that's the way you played to be honest but he wasn't bad by any means I mean you know it hit the ball hard at least and I think the other team is making 20 mistakes on defense they're just letting too many opportunities go through like that guy should have challenged me on that play right there as well just give me too much space on the shot but anyway let me just find the man who made this beautiful controller overlay second properly shout him out all right so huge shout out to Hayabusa for the beautiful beautiful controller over there thank you so much man he's also made one for other pro players I didn't ask him to make it or anything either you just told me he made it for me so that was I was super nice to you man thank you so much I appreciate that and you'll be seeing that on my channel from now on so he was the one who made it yeah thank you so much man let's get into the next game and see if we can take some more wins for today let's go also that put us at 12:15 mm ah right now and I'm pretty sure grand champ is 1,500 if I'm not mistaken so 1,300 is champ to 1400 champ three and then 1500 is grand champs so we're not far off by any means so let's get to the next game like I said let's keep it up yes someone's all right so interesting Lobby here we're playing against uh a champ one and I think that's like a diamond q together and we have a champ 109 team as well so pretty much in all champ Lobby outside of that dude who's on console but he knows he could be higher ranked and playing with a friend on his counter so I'm not sure but we'll see not the best shot again we still see a lack of consistency on just being able to like boom the ball like that and me I'm gonna hit the ball fast like that it's still more than enough to get you goals at champ one and I do see the comment of a lot of you guys saying that I'm in plat and I play people that are much worse or much better than this all the time and it's not fairness which she just gets lucky I've always played against it's not true haha it like every single plat players around around the same level I'll be hundred percent honest vu and the reason why it looks like they're worse is because they are playing a pro who knows where to position earlier for what's gonna happen next whereas if you're in plat you're not gonna be in a good position to capitalize on their mistakes like I could shoot this and get a free goal if I really wanted to but that's something that a lower level player is not gonna be in a position to go for do you mean that's the whole point of it apprentice  you guys is that but this thing alone is gonna give you an advantage in these lower rank so it's not that I'm playing worst players and you play and then you're just unlucky you can't have that monster you're never gonna let it be into that shop my teammate nice to them I wasn't trying to shoot that because I could get the angle and I knew that so I went let's figure that could off the wall for my teammate and his spot that he kiss you and good finish rim job to be there even though it wasn't fast he got on targets all you needed yeah that was a comment I'm seeing a lot like why is what she's so lucky with the players in these ranks he's playing against but I'm not lucky it's just I know where to position and it's fairly obvious what they're gonna do a lot of time and I have a lot of hours in the game so I've seen him a lot of these same situations so many times okay I can't lie to you have autopilot of that this is my problem dude I took a little break from recording these so I back recording these I'm just playing like I'm playing grand champs again but I shouldn't be I'm sorry I'm sorry so distract Sheila papasan sorry the city does see how they react to these still kind of awkward for him but I mean that was the chamber one as well so yeah that still does the job man if you have space popping the ball hard on goal doesn't even anything crazy I feel like that's gonna do damage all the way till we get to like champ three and then champ threes will pretty consistently save those yeah it's all about just putting it like the opponent awkward situations over and over again until they eventually can't break out like right there again just pop the ball on goal good job my teammates are waiting in a good position there they left early again it's all it was a simple pop I even tried to like bang that I could literature sports from there I try to take a super fast shot on goal but then a slower pops and see what he to do and he you get rid of my teammate for free so everything outside of the like cross matt flip you said thingy that I did was everything that a champ won't player can do it's just a lot of the times they like the consistency and that's just been the the consistent thing throughout this entire series this is that each of these ranks you seem to lack the consistency in there the car control the ability hit the ball hard their ability get touches that they want on the ball so a lot of it just stems from practicing in free play like I still haven't really done too much that's out of the realm of what these ranks can do it's more that these players just they don't have enough control over their car to the point where they can consistently save the ball and get good touches on it or get good shots like I am right now so that's the one thing I see is lacking it is just overall mechanics but also being in the right position to use those mechanics cuz I have played players throughout this that have better mechanics in the ranking I can tell that they do but they're just not in the right positions ever and they're carding the teammate off they're right next to their teammate when they should be positioned across from them they shouldn't really be rotating in to where their teammate is they should be rotating around them so it's the same mistakes I see over and over again but let's get to the next one and that might be the last one we'll see how long it takes because we had two forfeits now so we'll see how you feel after this next one might be the last thing also we're at 1243 and we got division three off of that so we're getting closer and closer to champ two already all right you're playing all champ ones all champ ones in this Lobby everyone's over 1200 good kickoff I'm just gonna shoot the song goal nothing crazy just slow down lined it up it's got a good powerful shot on goal good kick off those well done for my teammate very good stuff sneaky off as well you can have the newbies just fine pretty much eats it takes the mid beats just go back for the corner I'll jump early for this just to beat it to it I'm gonna try to kill this guy on the way out here so let's just help my teammate give him a free ball and I can back off now you can come in nice aerial and I realized that he was missing so I said that sorry is missing the other the other guy that's waiting for a shot is gonna expect the hit and if there's a Miss from him it's gonna be a Miss from the other dude as well was expecting it so at that point I just move up a little bit closer take the free show I'm gonna wait it also remains the same in Grand Champion if someone's expecting a hit and the hit doesn't come through the person was expecting also misses you gotta try to position for that as well see there was me trusting my teammate he says no boots it's all gated from it was me trusting my teammate a little bit too much that's just a habit from high ranks because hiring flavor and everyone will never really miss that so you should be moving forward for the fall out touch rise if you're in this rank that is more of a mistake on me because I shouldn't really be trusting him to the extent that people are not consistent with that at all so yeah I'd say when you're in these lower ranks like I'd say if you're like can't you shape one don't fully trust that like whoever's on the backboard is gonna get the bang I would say kind of stay stay back more patient cuz if I had waited in gold it was a very easy save on that goal that they got that's me just having a lot of trust in my team which obviously isn't a bad thing especially for high ranks they just off the wall I'm gonna kill him no had a bump on them bump him again I couldn't quite I don't know happen what she made to be honest I couldn't see well we'll see how they set off the water on one and I bumped him my teammate looked at my card so joke no problem yeah if he didn't make that mistake their mothers been an accident obviously it wasn't actually but it might have just been like he actually flicked his stick the wrong way or something or didn't flick a stick at all so you double jumps it's good spot to control the ball there I don't want a penny for that faking him pass this middle okay go for the bumps at that point I just go for a shot looking for the past middle day I'll turn on this to help my team Timmy should have this for free nice got a killing wants an open up space you just have space to boom so go forward free double yeah that's like the fourth person who's asked either Kevin or Jim to but it is so lucky only I'm gonna pass it down to my team I'm not gonna shoot even though I could I see you went way faster than I wanted that's a higher rank I probably shoot that ball but I'm trying to use my teammate more in a fake challenge I'm just what I'm talking about before for something give me the ball for free I could drink you crazier the dribs this is about there let's see and they're not fully comfortable in the back we're just they wait on the ground that's a huge difference between this ranking grand chipmunk on a grand champ Lobby that would be just boom to the other side of the field off the wall almost likely yeah that's it you can just tell like there's a lack of comfortability went on the wall or the balls put in an awkward situation people don't know how to deal with it quite well that was a good boomer though well done and we should get another like 25 points yeah we did 25 more points from that and we should get quite a bit closer now to chamkila server after that yeah we're champion one division for 1267 right now we have 24 points from that not too bad at all but I think it's gonna be everything video we've played three games hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night
