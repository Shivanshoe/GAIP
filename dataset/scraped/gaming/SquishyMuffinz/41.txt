yo what's up guys so i'm gonna be queuing ones twos and threes for today so whenever you get one the playing um we're currently 9 out of 10 in 1v1 so if we do end up playing once again today if we do end up finding one then that'll be our placement game we'll find out what rank we get so yeah let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see it goes all right we got a standard game off the bat here we got beastobonium and delta on the other team so two pros i don't recognize anyone on my team but it should still be a sweaty game it should be pretty close only one here for snake is the energy decal on i respect it clean that's actually really close this is a good try on the shot every snake's touch here going for a solo play it's not a bad idea nice actually good shot teammates should go here put a touch left i played around one i'm gonna be there for it but it's fine you may can get it i could turn it as well always try to like keep yourself that's not unfortunate that we both went to the other always trying to keep yourself in a spot where you could turn and like help your team so they don't have to be alone in rotation for too long it's like a really important thing to learn early on it's actually really hard to like get in the habit of just turning and keeping boost just to help which is keeping the ball and also keeps your team like in a spot where they're not really ever boost start when you do that that's really good got to look for the past there have been careful again there's two persons on the team so you got to watch like their passes together and overall just their ability to work together is going to be good and i'm already double committed quite a bit so it's kind of stuff that does get you scored on when you're playing good people nice it faked my teammate actually i think his mid pads is like really overpowered i think by the way you're just rotating back it's not a bad idea to say longest mid-pack so you could turn left or right same amount of distance pretty much whenever you want to it's pretty useful underrated skill to have it's been messy but it's what you can expect i think from like a solo queue game i save we've had our chances as well it's not bad can't complain trying to dodge the bump there no one's really taking control of the ball that's the one thing i've noticed in this lobby like look what the pros are doing look what everyone else is doing right people that are actually taking control of the ball and like trying to make a play happen or the people that are most threatening right now everyone that's just hitting the ball away like that for example it's not really doing much that's easy to cut it out it's fine if i get a demo there i honestly know boost for a while that's kind of a good thing try to move forward grab some pads good 50. it's gonna wait it's fine if he hits this can just control to our corner let him hit that as well teammates should be there no one's actually up for this but ended up working out even though it probably shouldn't have he should have been there probably a lot earlier but you don't get scored on can't really complain too much a lot a little past me there for like a transition forward have been perfect but again solo queue people don't really do that so can't be too picky with that stuff it's challenging for my teammate if i get b it's fun should be okay let's see done let him hit this as well again like also judging like what's actually dangerous to go for like that i know i need to go before there's another play up for that so knowing what to go for in threes is another like really important skill teammates doing actually a really good job of challenging the good stuff that's worth going i for him close actually really at 50 from delta there can't do much else there it's fun for now dimitar actually a pretty rough spot he has to go for a quick touch or just bake the whole time and he goes for the fake option i'm gonna leave it can't do much else with it hopefully my teammate wins the fifth year that's pretty much the biggest thing we're relying on wow that's crazy [Music] okay i did not think i'd be able to score that but i was able to get to it somehow well then my team has actually been a super sweaty game so far it comes down to the little little mistakes and that's always what it is the highest level like the tiniest little mistake the tiniest bit of hesitation it's gonna get you scored on i feel like they can definitely tie this up on how things are going here good fake my teammate well done oh my gosh how many boobs i can just play back while it's fine not a big deal i don't want to stay forward too long here my team gets beat it's actually bad if i can turn on this works out quite well it's going to leave it now forced to make a bad touch and i can rotate back i should have it if not it's going to be my duty to cover up for it jimmy shouldn't have went it's actually like a pretty big mistake could get a score on here late game because we don't need a goal right and you're committing two people for a ball that definitely doesn't need two people on it but it didn't work out too terribly for us teammates should just go for me really good challenge hold on i'm gonna try to kill this i got a bump i'm gonna go for the boost instead there we go next best thing there if i get bumped can't go for the ball no longer my my duty just leave it try to get the the ball just dead and take their boost stop anyone that could actually get touched on that from being able to do anything useful with it yeah good game there and they're taking out two pros um very very sweaty very sweaty silky game but it looked a lot like what solo q3s does look like disjointed not a lot of passes not a lot of trust but we did what we had to do in the right situation so yeah good first game against the next one's even keep it up get back to back dubs let's see how it goes all right for last name we got a zps on our team against alvarez and mill and a safe cheat here i think that mid boost is actually super important one that we just won let's see if i beat him here what a bump maybe actually give you both of them to commit at least so i'd say that's a a victory that maybe this is super important it really does like set the whole like tone of what's gonna happen the next little bit we have all the pressure right now because of that and we probably need to go here unless i missed somehow it should be pretty unfortunate if i had that much time and missed but yeah that really all does come down to that mid boost super important starts off your you know your amount of pressure that you're going to have put up the back wall kills pretty huge awesome wide by a little bit it actually be bad for us like a demo though i'm not gonna grab this back we have a lot of time for it i'm going to watch this guy's bump surprisingly it was ready for me to turn that way i tried to turn like a weird way but expected it's enough oh actually a really good cut but better read from him i followed up myself here no flip somehow it's a little bit unfortunate but we still have pressure out of it that's still a goal so we'll definitely take that i don't know how i didn't get a flip i literally sound like you got to flip and everything would have been a goal for sure off of that but take what we can get put off the back wall and just wait a night here whatever you shoot shouldn't be enough to get around that the only thing is like yeah that the low 50. any shot should never get on the stair but all you can do is play the 50. he wasn't in a good spot for it unfortunately we both jumped for the same ball we know any shot there it's not gonna be dangerous so it's fine to wait on if we did been very it's unlucky of awkward situation i'm gonna go quick did end up being too terrible i mean if he was a little bit closer it would have been bad but i don't want to wait there and be in a woman too for too long especially when there's someone trying to bump because a little bumping especially in this mode it's fine it's not terrible it's like forced to beat him there so he's gonna have no boost i know he can't really do too much should be a goal nice good play there gotta take our time and like play it's open space to the left much better than overly rushing a fake jump follow it i actually like that pop even though like you obviously don't get a guard of it or anything it's still good it gets in the way quite a bit and i got his booty it's actually huge here's the force all the way back now ah good save he held this ground well i mean i could have flicked at any time and it's probably a goal but just playing the 50 the whole way through should have enough time to get back to it now if i play mid i'll be close enough might still be okay that actually maybe not wait made it back somehow i don't know how i'm gonna fake big touch here if i keep faking played over one it's fine that more than does this job i feel like if he gets past that guy i missed a boost but i act like i didn't even though i most definitely did they didn't throw it away it looks real play from them i tended to like cut down the space a bit to like see if they throw it away but they didn't i was all done playing close to themselves like that following my bluff [Music] i'm actually beautiful i missed ah that's a good play from them i think i could really do there another smart okay pre-jump because you kind of had to and the shot ended up being underwhelming like had you waited obviously like in hindsight it would have been a lot easier for me to deal with but you have to that works every time against a good player because they always expect the best and if you give anything less than that it normally outplays them two of them panning so hard on that just a little like fake touch it's fine 50's more than enough there i don't really like that he went for this i'm probably in a really bad spot now but we're good ended up getting out might actually be a goal for us i'd be very fortunate if it is it is yeah this game mode never truly it never truly feels rewarding it never truly feels rewarding regardless of if you're winning or not it just it just doesn't it doesn't feel like you really won sometimes what is that that was actually in i kind of want to see if they can score this keep it up keep it up keep it up i was in all good though all right good games today hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this
