yo what's up guys for today's video i'm going to be queuing all three game modes it's been taking so long to find games lately so i don't want to q one mode away for like an hour so whatever we get we'll play but i'm queuing ones twos and three so yeah should be fun let's get into it see how it goes all right we got a 2v2 game off the bat we're playing against first killer i'm pretty sure he's a top five player on the tuesday board right now so gonna be tough one we'll see would be a pretty big dub start off the video i tried to pre-jump the the clear couldn't quite get it but there's a chance that if i do don't come there to meet goals so i don't mind taking a risk especially my teammate down the other guy as well really good play good job from eva also these wheels guys they're in the shop right now i just got them i think they're pretty sick i probably use it for the next game but i think they're cool i'm testing them out looks wise they're insane i think but the feel of them isn't crazy good but the look of it is just insane super nice wheel good demo attempt from him let him hit this doesn't really matter try to stay somewhat relevant i don't want to go all the way back here that way i can challenge if i need to it's going to be really hard situation to deal with though it's a good save good job to take my time on the shot like actually try to understand where it's going to go instead of just like pre-jumping super early i wanted to make sure that i knew somewhat where it would end up he's gonna float here whatever he does we should be able to get it goes over me it's fine teammates back wall so that's good i beat her just for some wide there let me panic a bit here if i can make him flip that's all i want here so if he flips right here it's really good he actually did good not to flip but he still threw the ball away so i'd still still say i did my job there by forcing him to at least throw the ball away eva should go good job i had it blocked if he didn't have it so it worked out so i played a rad i'm delayed my my touch started just an extra second so to go around him i should have tried to take a second to like see if i can score that but i feel like i would have got a demo it's better to just clear the danger let's do a side where it first can actually do anything with it straight back all really good challenge good job nice what you said as well all right well eva's playing crazy i'm not gonna lie he's not really making that many mistakes he's one of those players that i find he's either playing insanely good or he's trying to do a little bit too much and it kind of hinders his team when i play against him but this game is doing really well for sure i wait for the double here it's not gonna have enough boost for this so i'll just fake if it came down a little bit more it would have been good but close could say from first the latest approach just enough there's a flip still better fake them now i could shoot good first jump to fake that good job from you bro though he had a really good play there and first i just wait goal line it's well done they could definitely still come back there's two and a half minutes left first obviously one of the best twos players in the game so definitely capable of coming back here i played around one here maybe 50 of it in that there we go i might forfeit that was a good job to yeah they forfeited good job to uh slow down to play their midair take my time get around one and then first in a spot where you can't really do anything he left the goal line defend like that so if you can get the ball close enough to the point where it is on the goal line it's pretty much gonna be in a situation where you can't do anything it's a really good first game we'll definitely take that let's get to the next one so even keep it up get back to back wins let's see how it goes yeah and first killer we actually just made him lose his number one spot so we just took the number one spot for me by beating him there which is pretty cool yeah let's get into the next one see if we keep it up and get another dub here all right we got evo again we got omar and i'm actually not trying to say his name but that dude with a long name i'm not sure but he's obviously a good player pretty cute into him good for evos touch him and fake this to the committee which is really good and i could just shoot there we go thank you that was good i get fake to force the first guy to go and then omar felt like you have to follow it up solid a little detail that made a big difference it's like some mid boost pads on the way back gonna have full boost and i can support my teammate if he goes okay i tried to block the shot we ended up missing so ended up making us both miss in the end ends up working though timmy gets the ball for free so we'll definitely take the situation go for the mid boost here should be okay we bumped each other though so it might actually be bad alright good really hoping that would be a bump on him but not too terrible that's our back corner really good block might even be a shot opportunity it's a pretty good read i need to be controlling that so i was trying to just wait for him to get that soft touch and then try to play off of it after take one touch toward net if he misses i can just shoot there we go it's my way to play that out right made out of his mistake as soon as he makes it i'm gonna take the shot if he doesn't make the mistake then you know just wait for his next touch either way i'm still in a safe position to help out eva says he's lagging a bit oh good uh his teammate just shot right away i've been really good because i was getting bumped but went for the slow play he didn't trust himself in the shot i guess let's stay on this my goal here is not the score i just want to beat bowl and we did that and my teammate has an empty net let him touch us he's gonna have to jump that's fine no big deal he's gonna pre-jump can i should have now job bypasses back i don't have any play toward net there so it's better to keep possession right no point of trying to play that anymore forward when we can't now we still have a good pretty situation out of this except that i'm in this 1v1 for a little bit all good should have probably just insta-challenged because he did mess up a little bit back there like his first touch control wasn't great so if there is that opening he should take it but either way it wasn't a bad situation for us really wasn't terrible i played to the boost here one first touch fake this touch soft touch and maybe a shot there we go all right and they've left already so it's good quick games today really good touches though really good job to maneuver around them we'll play one more game because both of those are super quick so play one more oh actually omar just should have ragequit it's not even over he just straight up left all right well i did not realize that i thought it was a forfeit for sure but i guess not well oh let's see if evo lets me on this guy who's turned into a 1v1 match flippy set musty a little bit a little bit too much sauce give me a go better go for like a peak shot i was going for one back let's see it nice nice pass them the shot oh of course all right well i guess this one's uh yeah this one's shocked it's fine we'll get into the next game i'll play one more game hopefully it's not a rage quit and hopefully it's not an early forfeit um but what can you do let's get to the next one all right we got evo again against first killer yet again for the last game here and the same guy from last match so let's see how this goes oh my what a dunk from eva he plays like a psycho sometimes i swear and it works because it is 2v2 it does reward the psycho behavior just very interesting to watch sometimes should have this or i should turn on that probably it's fine you're just gonna kill time on this a smart play to make how's it safe first try to place the bottom corner i think that was right idea for sure on the placement there play this around to the right nice back mid good job perfect play really good job to look for me there your passion as well that's like all you can ask for in a situation like that if someone's up field like that and you have a passing lane toward them definitely look for it best thing you can do i never flip out of that could have actually been really good if i had a flip but it's all good i've been trying to pass him first a little bit too far for him actually really good touch for him but mainly just to beat me it's not gonna be something they can score off of necessarily but it was really good to beat me there game i should have for free invaded it pretty well better get back and help out here to beat him and follow it up that's fine i don't have the boost only bad thing about this is i just so i saw my boost to go for that and we're in this awkward situation now that's fine played it well read the empty part of the net very good good kill i bumped him as well as a goal but didn't quite very good first touch here you're trying the fake first usually good at reading that so i don't really mind as long as i don't like take myself out of the play fully for it i don't mind they have the reed let him hit that should be okay maybe i should beat him to anything what a pass i don't even know if he meant to do that but i was really good nice forcing to cut it out which is good i think this boost now played across as well i'm gonna follow it up myself actually good read from first gonna be a goal it's all done should be a goal okay not the other guy would miss evo got demoed as soon as i jumped so i was pretty much in a really bad spot that was a good reason first i should have went up the wall i should just keep faking on the wall but it's kind of a hindsight thing because i didn't realize that you've even got demoed should be okay you can't shoot off that's not gonna be anything dangerous better stay on this go for the slow play just to keep possession try to get some 50s downfield and then evo comes in like an absolute psycho he does not care dude oh my god he literally doesn't care purse is definitely tilted i don't blame him because that stuff is annoying but and so interesting how some people play twos out and just wait back off nothing dangerous good demo i forgot to have another one as a goal it's not going to be a go i think oh really unlucky on the spot can you do that which one around him let him hit this it's fine i'm gonna panic a bit more a big deal get some pads chill my left mid let's see nicely done good slot right in between them the first is good in those positions for sure he like prefers to be on the back hole or like in the goal line usually going to stop whatever but as long as you can create enough pressure to the point where your teammate can follow it up it's not really a big deal if someone's going to save myself on the go line i'd rather them save that goal line then my teammate come in and get a you know an easy shot it's always the best case scenario yeah really good games today if you end up winning this this is a lot of points we gained for sure i've only been playing twos at all to be honest so we we hop on and we just take the number one spot from first or make him lose the number one spot not too shabby oh i went for something crazy again but it's fine i'm trying to hit like a perfect top corner off the sidewall like that but if you'd be gonna stay on this play it around make him go to the wall at least or something nice oh it's immutable i might land today damn they're just turning over and over again they kind of have to though they're down too [Music] 20 seconds left probably gonna still continue to go all in here do whatever i can to kill time made one get beat and i get to stay on this 51st whenever he goes makes him waste at least 40 booster and his teammates up on the side so i just ruined their whole play pretty much there we go it's going to be the game very very solid stuff today the first twice um both pretty good games and another one in between that pretty good look like probably 26 27 points off of him so solid solid day all right hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace [Music] you
