yo what's up guys going to be playing some games today with the brand new lamborghini see how this car is i know i told you guys i would do my ssl finishing games for youtube but i ended up just playing them off record and ended up getting it so you guys won't be seeing me actually reach that on video we'll play some 2v2 games for today though because i'm not quite at supersonic legend yet in this so we'll see if we can get some dubs with this car we go over to the garage there's the brand new car right here is what it looks like in the garage we have two options we have no decal and you could change the trim and the primary color so the trim changes and the primary color you could change as well completely up to you whatever you want to use obviously it's not a good combo but you have a lot of options here i would do something like this probably something like black on red or purple on like a blue or something i don't know something cool some cool looking but i like the the decal that it gives you off the bat you have two wheel options for this car as well i like the black ones more and it gives you these two flags you can buy these all in the bundle in the item shop if you guys go to item shop go all the way to the right also if you want to support me when you purchase this pack just go to the top right here change support and type in squishy muffins the full thing it's not just squishy it's the whole squishy muffins that's my creator code if you guys want to use that also applies for the feature tab i don't really mention that too often but if you guys want to help me out a little bit it's another way you can do that but yeah it looks really nice guys you get all these things when you buy this and uh it's pretty clean looks pretty clean we're gonna try it for some games today though let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first time we got ourselves turtle against azura and candy see how this goes pretty quick q here the car itself sounds really nice by the way guys one thing i really like about it is the sound that have been an insane double safe if i got back to that i honestly didn't think i could make the first day but i think the the height on the car actually helped me get there in time it's pretty good for a safe yeah the car sounds really nice like that about it for sure can i wait for the bouncy let him panic a bit turn around if i hit around one let him control here go for a solo play air drubal i should send all right we'll take it well what is this skull explosion that's so cool i like that gold expression a lot i wonder what that is i'm gonna cheat here grab this pad as well and go back for the boost now i'm gonna fake the big hit i can panic a little bit and now i'll have full control of the ball and it gets by with a lot of boost actually really good situation for us if he passes let him stay on this a little bit awkward right away for the bounce the patience on that how do you alone here maybe a 50 would be good i can't go for a go off that but it's enough to at least keep pressure for a little bit yeah my teammate's not back yet so i gotta wait for him can be a little bit awkward yeah situation is very very tough to get out of because i don't know if he's going for an air dribble bump just left and only one for a very long time there i got to play it out best i can he did a good job full control of the ball there here's a lot of options air drill bumps the biggest worry for me there he didn't actually end up going for one but just tough situation you can't be sure what they're going for so the very last moment he disguised it quite well you're left in a lot of those situations in twos you should always try to minimize the amount of ones you're leaving your team in and 2v2 that's a big thing that will help you a lot if you leave your team in as little 1v2s as possible you're going to be in a pretty good position most of the time a lot of the goals come from that those situations i want me to and the last guy back gets bumped that's normally what you'll see dribbling this but i can make a panic just by kind of beating a bit better block again good play i'm just going to fake this now make him panic because you guys try to touch this across should be okay here i was gonna try to get very slow i actually like that attempt saved my boots i didn't have much left but actually made it pretty scorable wait left side yeah i'm gonna go back now it looks like he's going alone that's my cue to go back it's probably to be a 50 and i can't follow this up  off the bat and go toward them let him hit this it's fine look forward here gotta wait till the very last moment to get a touch on that and just speed it up a little bit didn't quite make contact but we're gonna have another chance here if he misses still say 50 boost is a smart play well right damn this car actually feels nice not gonna lie like the turning on it feels super instant really really hard to explain but it feels super instant i actually like it a lot like how it feels i'm not a big fan of long cars i don't think i'd use this all the time but it feels like insane if you're a long car user it actually feels really nice try to pass the to the left should be okay actually might miss but it should still be fine especially come back in a second it's gonna wait hit the ceiling should be fine putting a back wall here wait for the bounce i don't want to panic on this better take the safe route because stay on this ball good 50 i wish my teammate luck here there's a situation you don't want to leave your teammate like i was talking about it's always going to be awkward they messed it up quite a bit it's always going to be a tough one to get out of but we both just defended both of those situations well that was gonna be tough he got stuck on the inside of the post so i moved out a little bit here because i figured this touch most of the time he's gonna have a good chance to just wait on the ground and bang this out and you probably would have been able to you just find the inside of the post right there and it was enough to kind of mess them up a bit i'm gonna bang this i gotta wait try to keep it close to myself it should be a good opportunity to go for solo play here hit it off the wall to myself get safe from them got this corner boost and just try to get back pop the server one try to follow it up myself should be okay here be back on good amount of boost trying to control this go down to the ground unlucky if i got that boost back there it would have been really good situation wouldn't have been risky at all it would have been a pretty good spot to maybe even score off of so definitely unlucky unfortunate i'm not snagging a boost the turning feels so crisp on this car man all right this is a very tough situation let's go quick dodge the bump because one guy was bumping me but you see how that's the most there anything that can happen in 2v2 game there's all these these situations very very tough to get out of i'm being left in a lot of them right now but you have to be able to improvise and actually get out of them sometimes sometimes you have no other option doing good though the height on the car the extra height is definitely helping me gotta fake this all right you should be okay actually might be in a bad spot now you missed i could just wait are we good good well the first game the car feels nice again to the next one see if you can keep it up get back to back dubs let's see how it goes all right we tested the car in twos it feels pretty clean let's try it in a 1v1 game see if we can pull off some clean one we're going to play some flicks maybe some dribbles with it we'll see all right we got reveal this is an instant queue so it's an ssl player as well a good test a good test that's probably a god at once even though i don't think i played them before it's probably absolute legend i'm just gonna fake this save my boost here put it off the wall there we go smart play so i know i can't cut that enough to turn actually get a shot of it i know he's going to be in a panic situation so i'm sitting off the wall there's almost always a safer play i don't waste my position i don't flip into it and we're in a pretty good spot to fall whatever happens from it let's take our time here try to play to the left around them go for a shot the cutting to the left or right like that is also a very very good thing to do in 1k1 gives you a lot more options if you just play at the net your options are very very limited you can't really cut left or right you can't incorporate fakes stuff like that just doesn't work a little bit of a mistake there i tried to go for something crazy not gonna lie i popped it up and last second i tried to fake the the hard touch get a flippy set and then go for like a ground pinch or something i messed it up though good idea i'm messing with the car experimenting so i'll give you guys an example of what i mean by how cutting it to the left or right gives you more options if i have the chance to probably just stay on the ball hard here because money was giving me time he's getting scoring off of it i could see him just staying super hard on the ball for the rest of this game gonna be a lot tougher to have freedom can panic a bit here so i'm gonna take a touch to the side and then just pop it see he does also gives you a better view of the opponent and what he wants to do with the ball make a panic a bit here throws me the ball back because i'm just baiting out a challenge take one touch here kind of give myself space to the side again in this situation the boost again there you go as well play we're making him constantly have to panic constantly having to play the ball into me and i'm always going to win the next challenge no situation so it's a very good thing to be able to do over and over again just bait them in make them be on the back foot the whole time even right there it's a good idea that pressure early i went for a bump it's a little bit risky but in general you want to like pressure as early as you possibly can make them throw away the ball and whether you can get back to it obviously we got scored on there so i didn't do it properly but you can get in the way early and bump just be annoying best case scenario for sure how's the other play went up to the very last moment gave a lot of boost as soon as i heard him jump use the rest of my boost hit it over him we're in a very good spot finish it off i couldn't get back good shot from him to be fair get the work for that kickoff goal but you can tell this guy plays a lot at once by the way he plays probably makes a lot of adjustments mid game i tried something weird two kickoff goals in a row i made two slightly uh readable plays on the fakes well played from him but i think we're playing well when we have the ball and when the game's going on we're playing better i think so we'll be able to win this one there we go he's got to get past the kickoff and we'll be okay i'm not going to try anything crazy i'm just going to go for a normal kick off save like 20 boosts being a pretty good spot to get back here it's a good fix i know he has no options he dropped the ball already wow i can't believe that can't believe that that's just my luck should be able to get there fine we forced them high enough we can't really score off this i don't know what just happened what the heck it's a good 50. still have a good amount of boost here i can't see him going for that off the wall so i just stayed close smart play to make there there's no way he goes for that and tries to get a shot almost no way angle's way too sharp it's not gonna be a fast enough shot even if he does make contact and he's gonna be stuck flying into my half so i know just off assumption that he's probably not going to go for that i don't really have to panic about it gotta make him click early it's gonna be bad all right good block the angle back flip shot we thought it there's a bump like that as well which is another good thing about doing that you keep your position you dodge the bump you also get a lot of power on it we get out of the way the bump perfectly and the tip of our car just long enough i'm pretty sure this is a dominant hitbox definitely it definitely helps in situations another chaotic goal all good three out of his five i think working alcohol so not a big it's not a bad thing when you see something like that in a game i don't think because you know you're not playing them when it comes to like the actual in between kick off parts of the game what's important very good dodge on the bump there very good play good end end play there don't look at like you have goals as a negative thing especially if you're still winning the game after getting scored on by a bunch of them try to look at it as if you could improve your kick off you could be winning by more right now that's the only thing kind of look at the positive in it got to learn to improve it he's going for more air dribble bumps now it seems okay he backed off in the air drill bump with the silent wide but the thing that's hard about that is if i don't go wide there he air dribble bumps anyway so it's a very tough situation to be in had a really good setup for it if i go straight for the ball there probably a bad situation for me all right so i have full boost here i know i'm going for back boost i see him so we can play it to our corner put a wall here just spot for ourselves now we go with the ball bouncing to us so you see how the ball is coming toward us they have a big advantage in that as well they can panic a bit fake this big hit make him back off click again right here unlucky we tried to fake a little bit too much but it's a right idea right there for sure baited him in quite a bit there gotta pop pop it up delay tie me and challenge early all right i didn't go for a robot most likely gotta get above it should be a game keep it up one more one more for the boys keep it up i don't care if we get this scored on oh my not flicks are crazy i wasn't using the flicks more clicks are insane on this thing all right instead of games for today i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this i would recommend getting this car it's pretty clean the turning feels nice that flicks feel nice and in general feels good for both twos and ones for from what i see so far so yeah i
