before we get into the video guys as you know we're on the road to 1 million subscribers are trying to reach that incredible milestone and you guys can help me along the way if you're watching the video right now and you enjoy my content and you're not currently subscribed please go down below the video press that subscribe button and press the bell as well Sarah is notified when I upload a brand new video I appreciate y'all you guys have been absolutely insane I can't thank you enough seriously I hope you been enjoying the series enjoy the final episode you know what's up guys in the last episode we finished off at champion 3 division 3 so today if we win two or three games I think we'll get into grand champ off of that and the series will be done and then we can get into maybe the solo standard road to grand champ or maybe we'll get into a little bit of a break and then into the sauce and rotor Grande ship I'm not sure because we've now done two back-to-back rubber grand champs as soon as this one's done obviously and that's a lot so if you guys want to see a third one this one will probably be the best one out of all three because there's gonna be so many tips in there and it's gonna be the most helpful because series is obviously the main competitive game out in this game if you guys want to see everyone back to back to back I'm under percent down and this was obviously like I said gonna be the best one so let me know down below of course but today our focus is getting grand champ and doing it without losing another game hopefully so yeah let's get into the game for today but before we do that let's randomize our car for the last or what could be the last episode if we win our games let's see what it is alrighty not too bad this car it's kind of swaggy not gonna lie it says get cracking get cracking on the side get cracking nice I like it sushi love alright cool cool cool alright guys so there it is this is gonna be the car setup for what could be the last video of this 1v1 route 2 grand shape series with random car presets and what would have been also random camera settings but we decided that was a bad idea like halfway through so let's get it - alright so we're planning it's a lo grand champ I know I know the name dangles I played against this person in twos and threes in grand champ all the time so there's actually a solid player there's actually to be really tough sounds got good mechanics fighters doesn't play ones at all I know this guys good grant sham player we'll see what we can do here the games tested us give us a nice little matchup here for our our final games good start though give me a little bit of a mistake there you played passive played off of it so you got a deal wait what de servir I don't know what I felt like I don't know probably went through me I was worried was it gonna fake you go off and we actually could have won the challenge off of it too but we're a little late today yes might be gonna go over this I'm just gonna wait and guide the Beast instead start up that starving rhythm get a goal [ __ ] off of that and it's probably that you don't want to dive in for the shock because they're gonna be there first anyway well you gotta start up that pattern I'm just going for their boosts taking shots repeat that process I shouldn't be going all in for that shot there could get pretty bad for me take it back though and control I have controlled the ball which is good see who does it the flick there it's a a pop this one I'll go again it's a suit he does again take his boost I'm surprised you didn't go back to go there to be honest with you I was I was a very questionable decision to go for the boost again the hallways are why I didn't even go for the second touch Center when I could have it's good thought I'm just gonna dribble to the side so I kind of gave up on the idea of it I tried the shot actually really good attempt yeah like I said his mechanics are good like I play this guy in gran sham games before I know his mechanics are good oh so you got to be careful they can score pretty much anything any angle matters pinch this back pain chef inch using the ball for free as well I'll go quick now you both on the opposite sides here grab some pads best bet is to go for it and block pops up once you're trying to bump me there you got a flip be sad if it was good I gotta take this game's more serious obviously because a pleasure playing are actually really good yeah there's no way I would have reached got chef Kai's with the right of settings I would never be to player that's a that's a solid with those settings there's no way I don't think it's possible I can't tell if he's mad or not honestly can't I just one thing cuz I don't know I I just know he's gonna take the ball slow he's driving super slow toward the ball he wants to control it obviously and we'll take that that's a really good first one there he might have been grand champ I don't know I don't know if he left too quick for me to be able to tell now yeah he was great shape so we already played the grid should I play wait it's 12:15 what oh no wait I was told 50 my saying it's 12:00 it's like 12:40 I didn't know that it's 12:00 44 grand shape and once I already reached it what the hell alright well there you go guys we made it but I got to do one more game right okay in there I got to do one more you got 25 points net jeez man alright let's do another but that's uh that's grand champ reach like I said that guy was so it obviously knew his Grinch ever just because how he's playing at putting some before on my main account so yeah let's uh let's get into another game but we're grand champ already that's solar grab the grip done or playing another another grand champ player this guy is high grand champ as well because our lowest player not Tyler sure about that but this is gonna be a tough tough game yeah I would not have wanted a this tough case yeah I mean I probably lose this game to be honest even with my normal settings now today I wouldn't want any of these with my my scuff settings there's no way yeah bought me probably yeah these games would be way too swanky there's no way this guy's on the stuff under and ones I think but they're like this is like a 99 or - mm mm our player and ensues should go in there we go boss let's see this would be the last game over the video last game of the series and one so hopefully we can finish it off with a win for the fast he got there no one for the fake probably try to bump me fuzzy didn't to be honest but we got a go out of it here we go notice it's pushed up super super far there so got it over him nice nice and easy and we got ourselves a good follow up as well over that seemed to go against most likely I was like good fifty you actually almost made him own goal off the 50 which is good could have went the other way but he didn't control the 50 to go there there we go find solid man the rippers the play men Tony Rosario Pete I kinda like the idea of like they don't know who I am I feel like people play like they try so much harder when they know it's it's me a lot of the times every game just feels like a full-on like sweat fest by feeling right now he's just like mad that he's losing to someone he doesn't even know at this point oh I thought we're gonna bump him in swaahaa they were doing really good keep it up you should be able to finish our last game with the win only game he lost this series well the game against the ac3 who was super solid with settings that we couldn't even see the pole at the time so not bad at all can we even count that as a loss yeah I think we have to because that was the point of the series but we didn't technically lose any games but I really with the next series when only my teammates are a lot of score I can't see us being undefeated in that anyway we'll see Oh yep I messed it up no I can't get back regardless but I try to do the chain - on the wall I messed it up you can still come back for sure this is a solid player and this here officer really good as well exhibit a it's not over quite yet three minutes to go we get still strengthen our lead here let's go down here see if they throw away they have a double so I look forward ready blasted on gold City does you know when I was just a bad choice if it goes out the wall we're good if now we're probably screwed yeah I was about choice I should wait there I figured he's gonna take his time we hit it back away so I know next time to just kind of wait for just follow-up touch instead oh no dude we're gonna lose we're actually the leaves were choking took my foot off the gas for a second you can come back the app is replay good players man till you fall out the gas for just a second that's all all it takes gonna be there for that have to kill there gotta get it on target in there we go gotta back to the three goal lead we'll try to keep it at three goal lead three goal or more it's a comfortable lead so we got to get biased kickoff scoffs you're good my hips are not great on the river I'll be honest I never had a good get off some long cards long hitboxes so I think is back oh just got killed ie we should spawn in time it's a little close to the wall yeah I knew you could just shoot directly off of that so we didn't panic quite yet and we got to go out of it stay close to the wall friend to jump off and get a shot right away I want to fake challenge again worked earlier gave me the ball free here we go tries to get really quick to kick off but gives you the ball for free if you fake it gonna block me take this Boosh see it does alright interesting let me go back take the peds I guess I faked him though I didn't feel like I was gonna fake him but I did now you can't do any at this point I'm just touching the ball around them a lot kill time if you get a shot of that wasn't fast enough playing it's here one more time just stay on this not give many options really hit the ball into me here we go pretty solid game though and those other a tough opponent so good game to end off on for sure I'd say that main takeaways guys are you trying to get better in 1v1 you're willing to practice your mechanics like that's one of the big things the better you are mechanically the better chance in have it beating other players that are good mechanically obviously you wanna be able to hit your shots when you have the chances to you want to be able to hit those hard angle shots when you have empty Nets encounter so I'd say mechanics are a big factor for but also have a good understanding of when to steal their boost when to want the challenge of course when the fake challenge you gotta throw on this fake challenger to throw them off a little bit and you know you got to get good of your flicks as well obviously because when you have control the ball you have to be able to use that control to score almost every chance you have you don't want to admit you don't wanna be missing those opportunities when you have a dribble on goal right you want you want to be able to score almost every single dribble attempt you have on gold so you gotta practice that stuff and free play obviously that all goes long and free play mechanics but the main things in terms of like game sense and awareness ones is like one of the the least extensive that sense because there's only one player in the field the positioning is down to how you choose the position there is no teammate to position around so it's really not that hard in that sense you just got to choose when the challenged correctly and how to use your time wisely and don't throw the ball away for nothing those are the main takeaways I can give you guys you're trying to get better at once but yeah that's the series done guys we've reached grand champ and we're up to 59 games played and we reach the grand champ in both 1v1 and to v2 and I never done that we can move on to the silver standard row two grand champs cheers I'm not sure what I'm gonna do that yet if there's a lot of support for and a lot of high four and you guys really want me to do it without scoring a single goal throughout the whole road to Grand chip and only only setting my teammates up only assisting the whole time and shot to give you as many steps as possible if you guys are really happy to see me do that I'm 100% down no problem at all certain that as soon as possible but we'll see I probably make a video or two in between this one and that series because I haven't done a video on my main account a while but uh but yeah guys I appreciate all the support you guys have been insane as always thank you for the support in this series that's -
