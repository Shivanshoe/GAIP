yo what's up guys going to be solo queueing some early morning 2v2 games let's get into it see if we can get some dubs see how it goes all right the first game we got ourselves hail rider against uh leoro and wolfram see how this goes here for this bounce i'm gonna save my boost here play possession as well i throw that away there we go wait for my moment again just kind of waiting for my opportunity to actually get the shot but if i can stay close enough to the balls that they can't challenge that's what i'm aiming for i got that whole sequence i couldn't really go because i kind of had the advantage in every single moment of it i could have just hit it away from them at any time they decided to challenge if they did right that's why it looks like they're giving me so much space really they have no choice to because i'm beating them to the ball in every way there i actually saw a comment um on a recent most recent video against uh fairy and alpha and someone said that in low ranks they don't give you time they rush everything which might be true but in all honesty if they're rushing everything that should be an even easier win than if they're giving you time because giving your time is a much stronger way to defend in general good time to see what's going to come of it but when you're just rushing everything you're kind of throwing yourself out of the play immediately right i thought you don't really see pros do that because it's not the best thing to do so if someone's rushing every single time you can make a very easy outplay touch around them you can flick it over them pretty easily you have a lot of options whereas if they're playing it more patiently it's actually a lot tougher to go through so don't look at it as it's not possible to do the same things that i'm doing because they're rushing every time because that's not true at all if there is these two guys are rushing me in every single play it'd actually be better for me i'd find a way to make that better than uh what i'm normally doing so don't look at it that way there's a reason why they're lower ranked if they're doing that if it worked every time they wouldn't be still lower rank right it's a good example look at my teammate he instantly rushes this gives them a free goal so that's something that not a good thing to do and it's actually it gets you punished at this rank and that's what i'm trying to tell you guys is good players will punish that and it's more than just oh you can't do anything because they're doing that if anything you should be able to do more because they're instant rush on you so watch back your replays and try to find out why it's working as well as it is for you against you i should say it's fine it's gonna wait for this pop here here's one more touch patient and that i still control again put myself in a spot where i have to throw the ball the whole time hit it off the wall now go for the bump so it should be fine actually i thought maybe it would be dangerous but i'm dead okay pop this one time to myself go for the 50. nice jump good job to be there the reason why people don't insta challenge every ball is just because think of it as intubations you have obviously people like to challenge the ball right if if you're instantly throwing yourself away and you flip all the way onto the opponent's side off of a challenge you're leaving one guy in a woman two forever that's why you don't see that in 2v2 she's not smart and threes you will see people in insta rush stuff like this i didn't say russian threes for sure or in general if the dribble looks like it's not controlled very well i'm interrupting it but it all depends on what the opponent does right so in your ranks your lower rank you find that it's probably because the dribbles aren't very controlled and they're very easy to read so you notice the position that i put the ball in when they're actually not challenging me is because at any point during my dribble i can get the ball around them so they don't want to throw themselves out of the play it's smarter to play that way man you can even see this game great examples right these are mistakes that happen at high level and it's just causing goals every time i'm challenging a ball like that my teammate's not rotated back yet and i shouldn't have challenged i should have looked for where he was he had a slow rotate so if i looked i would know he wasn't back yet and i wouldn't have went and that's the smartest thing to do there is not go that's the biggest mistake that happens in high level plays though is the idea of just challenging stuff that you don't need to challenge right that's something that you should look at in your games guys oh this back left isn't that good that he's doing it goes way too high back but he's again above the ball mark the joystick's more awkward than good for me back left guy let's go wait here you have one more touch it's fine when i don't challenge you see the difference in the balls that i don't challenge it's just gonna create a much better situation for us most of the time should have a shot on this didn't actually go for the shot surprisingly i'll just keep it in awkward touch for them should be able to keep pressure off this can't go for that though quite high and i'll go for a bump as well you gotta be good situation to go for it that's good job job to look for the the pass there again a really good situation to go for a bump because it leaves that guy in a 1v2 very awkward situation for a while there let me get some pads here my team's going to get that back boost so i want to stay relevant take a shot off that should have another shot off this oh good if you can't get the like the greatest shot at it i also recommend like a situation like that just to hit it to the side keep control don't touch that go for a bump all right i have time on this but he's gonna go for this that's fine all right 52 of them off to that uh again i don't i don't like the interrupts on the shot there when you have a little bit more time that's probably a gold starting opportunity but the tough thing to do perfectly every time obviously unfortunately i got bumped there you should hit this one more time it's fine wait for his touchy it's gonna be awkward for him to control this uh humans in an insta rush that's fine i'll just wait nice take my time on that double i don't need to rush that at all i have full advantage right so if i take my time as soon as i have free back wall i could choose to shoot it on the right side left side bottom middle as long as it doesn't touch the ground i have a lot of time right it's a good situation to be in when you could take your time on that back wall touch but good first game there and you can see the goals they got on us were all off about challenges exactly what i was trying to say early on is don't think of your lower ranked games as no one's giving you space they're challenging badly and you can actually take advantage of that if you watch the replays and try to look in but yeah let's get into the next game let's even keep it up and get back together dubs let's see how it goes all right for last game we got ourselves the minister against uh stanley and fumes i think they say that play through the wall grab this boost you can have a flick here so i'll let him fine again try to pay attention to what i'm challenging i'm not challenging this game and you'll see there's normally a good reason behind each challenge and the idea for each challenge and there are definitely people that you run into at high ranks that like challenge absolutely everything but most of the time they end up losing the game so kind of what i spend this this game on is trying to explain to you guys the good challenges in the back you see this guy didn't challenge he's able to pretty much save anything that comes as well even though it looks like a dangerous situation if you're confident in your in your goalkeeping probably gonna be fine most of the time let's go should be fine for a second i had a challenge again here it's gonna be interest leave it i thought maybe i'd have to get a redirect touch on it but as soon as i saw that the opponent again challenged badly which is what the goal comes from you see he's challenging from right here for no reason whereas if he waits further back it's gonna have a much easier save right i literally bounce on the goal line but like i ended up flicking it so wait for the bounce on the wall here good fifty oops didn't mean the way back that early i turned into the net for a little bit again challenge my teammate look at the situation i'm in now for the challenge wasn't that great ended up getting out but everything is is led from a bad challenge every single situation that's not good for someone is off of a bad challenge so i was in a 1v2 for so long there off of my teammate having a bad challenge that's exactly what i'm trying to explain to you guys is challenging everything right away fast isn't the best way to play by any means there's a reason why high level players don't do it because it leaves their teammates in a very bad situation i'm queuing early morning right now their lobbies aren't like crazy high level like they're not like extremely high either so it's a very good example of players that don't understand that concept that well yet and you guys can learn from this for sure so one of them's up that's fine it's good for him to challenge that but i'm in a bad situation now for a second that's a good one for me to challenge because my teammates stuck in their net so challenging that early is good just fake challenging this one i get the ball for free now there we go so that's another reason why not full rushing is good because all i did was show presents underneath the ball he made a mistake and then i was able to give myself a free possession and get a go out of it how many boosts here is like a single jump 50 probably and i can just leave he may again full rushed and now i'm in the situation and i can't save it because i don't have any boost so perfect example again no reason for him to rest that well he could learn to stay grounded and we'll be in a really good situation but now i have to dodge a bump and save a shot that's really high in the net with no boost so you guys are seeing thousands of examples like not thousands it's an exaggeration but so many examples of where it's just not good it's not good at all too the challenge early and this is what i've been trying to tell you guys in other videos and i hope now whoever made that comment can understand the people that make that comment in general everyone doesn't give me space in my rank not good to not give space in some situations so i hope you guys can understand now why it's bad drop my teammate there so to catch some off guard the bounce here it's fine if you get this i can go down don't commit my boost and it goes right to my teammates that's pretty good situation for us can't challenge on this it's fine maybe a little further back good control touch there i almost got it over him like some pads here we go for a bump like i've jumped from behind that's actually a really good thing to do there doesn't commit me at all but it makes his play going forward pretty bad not gonna be what he wants at least they're just gonna wait here right here you have to play the ball into me but for a touch it's fine you challenge that as last man to make you have a free shot try all the way back for background boost temperature turn and go for this for me that's a good challenge to make that's one that they don't have full control of the wall there trying to pass i thought he'd missed i just tried to stay grounded in a spot where i could react to it like the big touch he has to respect it there we go bit of them both in really well off that can't really get the power i need on this shot though that's a good play to make for sure i don't have to go for this no point you can throw this away in a second should be okay i would say the big thing you just have to learn early on is just what balls are actually good to go for and which ones are just not going to benefit you at all those are the the two things that you have to try to understand as early as possible i think whether that be from watching replays or it's playing a lot of matches and learning what gets you scored on and what's going to get you goals or put you in good situations tough spot to be in another okay i don't blame i'm not bringing my team i'm just using as an example it's not a good water challenge again because it just gets over it's gonna get over you and you're gonna get stuck on their back wall and then even if i'm in a better spot to deal with that i'm gonna be in a 1v2 for a very long time so you want to avoid leaving your teammates in like 1v2s like that for for a very very long time and that's something that he's not doing by challenging earlier like that and he also should be cheating on these balls so being pushed up off the kickoff but that's fine there's a lot of really good examples from you guys to learn from in this game to be honest let off the back wall 15 seconds i don't know if we can actually end up winning this but we'll see this one has been tough guys all right so our last chance gonna be dead there probably i just threw it away unlucky alrighty well honestly i'm gonna leave that as the video for now because i think you guys could learn so much from that to be honest i think there's so much that uh you could take from the mistakes that are being made on both sides um but yeah all right having a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and also let me know down below if you guys learned what i was talking about in the previous videos and uh whoever you were who left that comment about everyone challenging everything in your rank perfect video for you guys to see why that's wrong and why it's not a good thing to do and why this game should have been very easy to win they honestly shouldn't have got a single goal in my opinion um so that's like what i'm trying to tell you guys is the much more consistent solid way to play is the way where you're not diving at every ball not throwing yourself not leaving your teammate at a bad spot every single time so that's why you should probably probably practice playing like that and watch your replays back and try to find out if you're doing that too much if you're challenging badly too often but yeah love you guys enjoy the next [Music] [Music] cause i
