yo what's up guys they're gonna be playing some threes with justin and musty two of my fellow energy brothers obviously justin is on my professional team and musty is one of the energy content creators and a close friend as well so it's gonna be good games all around must have gotten a lot better as well she'll get some good passing plays in gonna be sweaty games me and justin are both top five or at least we were both top three yesterday people actually caught up by a couple points but if we win our games for today should be able to catch back up to number three spot and have garrett justin and me back in the top three the whole team in a top three of the global leaderboards it does look pretty sick though like it was like that yesterday garrett justin and me were top three on the leaderboard but from then to now people already passed me up so i gotta get back on the ground with the boys hopefully get some dubs and yeah i'm not sure where must he is or if he's even on the top on a little board he might not be but i know that must have definitely gotten a lot better as well so it should be fun no matter what let's get into the games see if we can catch some dubs let's see how it goes all right the first game got ourselves catalysm ivan and rizex i believe these are all european players and they recognize all these players so we'll see what we can do started off with uh a demo show off the bat i think because they're from europe and correct me if i'm wrong if anybody knows this but i think because they're from europe it actually makes the server more laggy for us too even though it shows you have good ping i think it still makes it laggy for us it's a weird thing but it's something that i do notice every time i play someone with high ping the server in general feels like way worse than it should try to follow this up just don't have the next touch on back wall just make sure that everything's blocked there but it's down right just wants to follow i'll just go for justin here gonna give him a free save to the side right back wall it's fine i can't actually reach this but i can wait for the next shot at least i save for musty good follow-up i have no boost here though no choice but to go back wall yeah really awkward situation to be in still had no boost in a very rough spot there kind of all relying on a musty to win that challenge really hard right which isn't normally going to happen every single time especially when the guy on the wall has a huge advantage my first touch here muskie should have this 50 killed one by accident to be honest nice should go down getting bumped so i can't really help out hopefully it must be okay he won't be because the guy just slaughtered his shot perfectly they're just chasing around a lot they're trying really hard to get their demos on our side but it's okay we have a lot of time catch the dub here i don't know why i thought justin wasn't doubling that he always does he always takes it himself in those situations thought maybe it was a pass but it's all good that was a good touch from justin there trying to bump him here can't go for a bump here i'll just go back for the mid beast we have three minutes left if we get some good plays going forward here we should be okay honestly we have a lot of time to come back seems far from over that's a lot of you guys are communicating though i think this might be a full team to be honest from europe feels like they're probably communicating with each other catch the dub here yeah it's a good challenge wait for justin put his high forward justin probably need to beat this play down left i'll just play a shot there's all i can really do out of that situation but if we can get some pressure here absolute best case scenario because we might be able to get a goal of this a little bit unlucky so we could say from them though definitely unlucky that it didn't bounce very well for us no boost here for me either she better get this one we have two minutes left a lot of time to make something happen on offense you can make the comeback full faith step one to making the comeback is believing that's the step they won't tell you about believing is the ultimate ultimate key to making any comeback played over to musty that was a really weird place for them they double committed back wall i had no idea he was touching it and then they ended up getting actually a really good touch out might just be in all right we'll take it minute 36 definitely enough time to come back here a lot of time to come back yeah they came out they keep bumping a lot right so that's something that kind of adapted to i think the bumps aren't doing as much anymore now comes down to just getting one more goal the finisher on the comeback over the past mid here should be okay should be followed up now there's one guy back here i have no boost back wall so i don't have a lot of resources to deal with this ball musk is going to take it it's fine i'm going to get some boost and way back but the corners and i have this justin should be here get away back here i thought that would have been a goal to be honest so i was just waiting in a position where i could follow up next i play from justin get control but he's wasting all of his boosts not gonna be anything too good uh that situation touch from musty couldn't beat the other guy i would have been a huge huge beat through the ball there if i got that oh just a bump nice i saw that coming sound just hit it in a good spot just to do something with it the bump was very smart to go for there because i didn't have many options that was a good play to make play right side get the mid boost here 20 seconds away from completing the comeback this game's been really messy though i'm not gonna lie i've been kind of confused as to where to be that's okay those games happen especially when you're playing people in rank that you haven't really played before you're learning a new play stuff oh almost got the bump would have been huge just keeping it up keeping it up back oh could be huge no way the double oh so close that have been actually crazy to end it off there got the mid views he's trying to bump again been kind of the end of this whole game i'd say the bumps from them looks like they're their favorite strategy when they're not on the ball my first touch gonna be bad probably go for a 50 it's gonna be high for dressing i could bump one here at least force him off the ball that's fine good fake for musty because you hold his position there as well he doesn't throw his position that's the big thing about that fake let them hit this i'm just gonna go for a bump now any kind of bumping in situations good at least forcing them off the ball forcing them further away from the challenge anything there makes that better i'd say but it's mid i'm gonna be there for that but it should be fine in theory justin would have rotated back already knowing the timings of like when someone should be behind you already is really good because they'll give you more confidence on your challenges right it's a good flick from us my first touch played down and awkward for him i'm could challenge this i'm not gonna go again actually i can't go again here why not no reason nazi doesn't keep this in now don't touch that should be okay mostly should go now maybe it's time to go for the ball you have that same player going for a bump yet again pretty usual thing so far this game it seems like that's the pattern should be really good for musty and i got his boost which is extra good because if justin could win this next touch here off this ball taking his time i think so i'm gonna just take this boost from that guy that way he doesn't take it got a free safe to the corner here trying to follow it up myself beat another guy i don't have any boost here so it's going to make a little bit awkward but i guess i'll pressure it at least get the ball over to my team situation might become awkward now it's fine okay it wasn't scenario where that could have been really bad but it's not terrible yet try to get some pads here rotate behind put this forward took my time because i figured why would someone be super close there and i already know two guys committed to that ball put it around one so i played mid one more shot here i didn't know as much as there too i shouldn't have went i was trying to challenge more i figured we'd been winning in midfield kind of assuming that he'd be extra patient on that ball good follow from justin not quite in we're getting super close on a lot of opportunities here good challenge from us this is here here's another maybe one more not bad at all good thoughts from justin keep it to himself nice good job justin played super good that game but that's expected it's just even when the game's awkward and like sometimes you feel like you have no idea where to be against teams like this like the teams we just played against he still does show up and plays well and he gets the shots when he needs to that was as well played for him but really awkward game all around to be honest they played it in a way that it felt like uncomfortable the entire time but let's get into the next one let's even keep it up we gotta get amount of points off of that we got nine points off of that so i already already got number three after that pretty solid let's get into the next game so you can keep it up i gotta go all right got the exact same team here i'm gonna cheat see if we can be done got a good block middle he did not get the thought she wanted you can kind of tell the way he aerial there gonna go back here have full boost behind stay in a good position wait for justin to do something here on the ball nice for musty i'm just gonna wait and go honestly because this situation is kind of awkward and i see musty keeps trying to turn a challenge so i don't want to cut him off and mess him up right in that situation it's a good challenge because he's justin the ball that's kind of what i always try to do in terms of my challenges to try to create space for justin that's exactly what i was able to do with that challenge right you just drive into it that means that you're going to lose the challenge but it's a good thing because you know your teammates behind you and you know that when your teammates justin and he has that space he's gonna do some crazy stuff with it right good kickoff cool really good start to this game nice from musty he's gonna have low boost here justin knows this he knows i'll kick off so we're just gonna wait wait it's long enough and it's gonna be a pretty good situation for us most of the time take this away from musty pump it over one that's fine if he gets that challenge because it's probably going to be won by my teammate after this unless they play this absolutely perfectly which in that scenario will play to them and they deserve it i almost i went for the backflip shot only i can get power on that the angle i was coming at the ball then i have one more on this let him touch that it's fun i bumped the other guy mid so it's a 1v1 at that point get a block from us don't have any boost here though i'll try to just go for their boost their corner after i land got a bump on one which is huge it's gonna open space up for justin and again you give him that space he's gonna make a play out of it right you can almost expect it every single time try to give any kind of touch back to justin here's fine just force them in a way that it's not gonna be dangerous for the guy behind you but you know you're also going to give your teammate a ball in a good uh situation it's not it's not anything that can like be super risky right it's what you're trying to do out of those baits let me try to go for the ball like that it's fine if it gets around me because again teammate's going to be back there especially if he's on the back wall they have such limited options right it's fine for musty bunny right side full boost here let's get over justin it's completely fine i'm lucky definitely the right idea there though just slightly missed the double play back to me let me go down lesson again one more time probably to be musty's ball and i can just rotate behind me grab these pads and be in a position to whatever may come ah a little bit unfortunate i think me and justin double committed on that i'm pretty sure yeah he was behind me he went as well we had pretty much the same touch though so in that situation obviously when you're playing ranked you don't know what the other person is doing at all times right you know you're not calming anything so it's hard to know every time what the other person wants to do what's gonna play for them is a good idea i think we had everything blocked though unless he was playing front post i was playing back post so in that situation their options are so limited that don't have to worry too much about how good the shot is more just standing your ground it's gonna be awkward for justin he gets away with it though of course he does because when doesn't you get away with something like that just going straight in but he's going to be there wait for the turn middle i'm going to have one more touch for sure i'm not going to go for this though it's a little bit risky she better trap this ball i was gonna fake from him justin wins his next ball though smart for musty to give justin the ball you always try to get the guy behind you the ball in those situations it's a really good thing to do there we go it was really awkward situation you just kept faking over and over again worked out pretty well for us so i'm gonna take all these pads going back here play over mid to musty killed one which makes their situation a little bit harder to get out of defense and he has no boost here justin's gonna know that nice either 50 from us flick it over another one that's fine i don't mind i'm hitting up there because again they don't have a play going forward there's no way they can get a counter attack out of that threatening so as long as they make a touch like that i'm fine with it as again still waiting to spot where i can kind of challenge blocked everything in the air and must have everything on the ground so everything was pretty well covered there it's fine it might be a little bit dangerous now but i think we're good there we go had everything blocked one guy challenging that one guy behind for the flick the classic freeze rotation i got to play out those situations going to be a goal at the end there off just the the mistake there we go played it solid though so you have to play threes especially high level threes and these guys it feels like they're calming it does feel like they're calming it feels like they know where each other are it feels like they're like going for bumps the right time so it does feel a lot like they're in comms they're all partied up they're all from europe and i think they might actually be on a team together i'm not sure but yeah two really good games to win hope you guys enjoyed that have yourself a wonderful day or night
