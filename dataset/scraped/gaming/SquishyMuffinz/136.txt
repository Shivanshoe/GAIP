yo what's up guys so we got our threes almost the supersonic legend already so for today we'll be playing some two trying to get a little bit higher up because we haven't really played many twos outside of our placements so let's see if we can get closer and closer to supersonic legend where today let's get into it see how it goes all right for the first game we got ourselves uh leo9 on our team against sensei and wayne so let's see how this goes sensei tokes i like the name it's clean wait for his next touch here wow okay almost unfortunate since 2016. that's commitment right there that's no [Music] g like jump here i got this bishop just in case he lands try to take it it's fine gotta be careful here should be okay trying to stay grounded because it's going to keep on flipping and i'll eventually have a free ball to work with if i just wait play patients actually a good backflip to delay me there teammates should challenge behind me so we should get that message challenge be the first man to make him do something wait for his next touch here teammate should go let's save again you should just leave this to be honest but it's fine as well so i play for this mid boost i'm going to create some opportunity here because i can pick the first click again pick again here i'm going to make him panic a little bit let me back with full boost now in a good position good spot to be in trying to play patient here because a lot of these situations have been weird so far and potentially dangerous trying to kill one here taking his boost just as good to be honest gonna be on a side regardless gonna bounce down there we go it's a good read i had to take our time with that one all you had to do is get it on target i saw that the last guy back ended up missing it was a hard read to mate so that's a good uh good shot to take your time with not rush it not overthink it all you really need to do is make contact in a situation like that teammates should go once your last guy was up i'm a little bit quicker than i needed to but it should be fine here bumped one off which is good try to just be annoying stay on the ball good touch my teammate i've been a good spot now with full boost nice kill good job pretty wide open for a bit well played for my teammate so the good thing about controlling this ball here is i don't know if that demo is going to come through so the fact that i have full control i still have so many options after the fact right even though i didn't know the demo was going to happen it kind of covers each situation if he didn't get the demo there i still troll that ball and i could probably make a play out of it regardless so it's a good ball to control there kind of covers every option could be finished as well as well played there so i noticed that his first touch was a little bit too heavy i went up quick hit it over and well and i had a lot of time to react get back down to it gonna get shot on goal gonna soft cheat here so i put a little bit further back just in case later one actually did a really good job to get back to that i didn't think he could well played for him take my time here make him panic a little bit i'm gonna fake this one first right down to the ground good 50 dropped from him really good job for my teammate to keep that in it's a a weird ball and if you get beat to something like that it's probably gonna be really bad well played for sure to the wall to myself good read from him how to beat that one guy should be open now i heard the last guy out so i decided to take it off the ceiling gonna be easier for my teammate to score that rather than if i go for a shot maybe get blocked you never know right so that's a safer player there get into the ceiling get into a spot where a teammate can follow it up ended up working out well i should take an extra second on the shot i would have had it you may should have this if not i'll go nice back with full boost here grab some pads it's going gonna pressure this i'll make him do something now i gotta wait it's a little bit awkward situation so a fake jump gotta wait for his bump attempt awkward spot to be in there for sure i don't wanna jump too early and give up my positioning it's a good spot to do a little fake jump in there so get 50 back to my teammate let it go for this again hit ceiling at least i hit it around them i'll be back with a good amount of boost here again awkward touch from the make on the wall here i gotta play safe here cause i lost back for a bit doing a good job of that good buff from him i try to play to the wall to myself try to take a shot wasn't the best shot but it was enough to at least force him to the corner and i got a good demo on the last guy back so you have to be forced to make a touch let's try to pre-chop his head forward but he did it to this corner that's smart from him could be free ball mid pass left maybe the him again ah i could try oh good all good i thought it is about to be a crazy passing play let's get 50. it's gonna bounce good for us i think i got all the way back here just in case this situation unfolds dodges the bump i know it's gonna be too far from the shoot so i don't have to worry about it good demo it's gonna be game though four goal lead i actually didn't realize we had four goals until just then when i died i was so focused on the game i guess i didn't realize how many goals we scored good first game though let's get to the next one stephen keep it up get back to back dubs get one step closer to that juicy super sonic legend logo and the brand new season and yeah should be good let's get into it all right we got wayne from last game he's on the other team but now he's on ours against hoppy tie and pills what is that guy's boost you guys see that it goes so high up gotta go for this here off the back wall is fine to be honest it's gonna be effectively just my goal at that point it's gonna be over the last guy back he has to expect me to shoot that that boost is really weird looking i don't know if you guys see what i'm talking about it like floats so high in the air look at that it goes up what is that i gotta ask him what that boost is that's so weird get 50 from us try to stay on this ball put around one i think that's good enough in that situation teammates should be fine in theory nice it's only bad if you get to be to that ball there which is pretty unlikely i use the second flip already so there's no real danger in that but i'm have that that's fine it might be internet i can't tell there's a demo well at 50 should be shootable might be able to get back here it's a little bit awkward though let's stay on this you pop popover one i made them double cream as well which is good not a bad spot to be in at all there gonna be a backball here covers most options same thing i could just easily save that to the side and i have full control of this ball now better bump them there we go it's a really good setup there go for an air dribble bump kind of fake the high touch a couple times throughout the air dribble and last second you get the bump once you see they're up for it if i hit it around them awkward let me try to challenge again it'd be fine i had the high touch block so my teammate went when he did actually really good timing to go for that had everything covered i'm gonna fake this first one here the left side now oh should i get a backflip off that good idea should be a little boost made him jump so he's gonna have very little option now going forward one light touch off the wall and i have full control on the situation kind of fake go to the right side maybe bump this guy oh my gosh i stole it that was a really good uh really a pop middle very hard for them to read that then i have a lot of options in terms of what i want to do after that i go for the bump if i go for the redirect he doesn't really know has to be worried about all the options kind of touch one more time to me maybe just gonna be in really good pass actually very very well played oh no he's telling us he made the forfeit oh boy i really like that guy's boost man like i would never use it i just think it's cool that just like floats up i've never seen that before a good bump from him i don't know if he was actually looking for that bump but it was a good one miss uh gotta head back for the back corner if it gets flicked here i have the flick that's how you should set up in those situations because you cover both options the first challenge in that situation always makes the flick for the guy behind and there we go good second game there's a little bit short so i'll play one more i don't consider that a full game by any means into one more game to end it off with a back to back to back though see how it goes all right for last thing we got ourselves fisher against carter and kalian this is how you pronounce that see how this goes i just wait for the bounce here it's a good shot you should have it followed us up now baited out for my teammate so me just showing a little bit of presence there and just kind of fake challenges turning toward the ball they have to be worried about me and that forced them to throw it away to my teammate which is best case scenario in that situation double tap off the wall eventually it's a really good play it's a good idea took our time well these are options made them very uncomfortable as well there was never a point during that where they had an advantage in challenging me really good fake good job i wasn't sure if he's gonna be able to score at the end there i didn't want to say it too early that was smart play again he had all the advantage in that situation you always want to try to put yourself in a advantageous spot where the worst case scenario isn't really that bad it's always going to be a good outcome for you there's a smart way to do that with that 50 if it was a 50 ended up being a fake but if it was a 50 it's not a bad 50 by any means nice yes at this back if not then my team is going to have a free ball someone with low boost this is still good spot for us to be in i'd say hit it across my teammates can be open space for a while use it to dribble that's probably the best case scenario get fake again good try i should have one more here can't really challenge it but it's fine i'm gonna bait this for my teammate that's it it's gonna be enough of a pop so he gets a free ball don't gotta throw myself out of the way for it either gotta fake him get a quick shot gonna turn again here he may went so i'm just gonna wait i've got a challenge late i don't know if you can get back for this it's gonna be tough potentially again you missed should be okay it's a little bit too far for him to shoot a little bit awkward so i'm just gonna wait back here i'm not sure what's gonna come with this gonna have that gotta be patient again good save follow don't dodge the bump i go for a shot here let's make the situation awkward not really planning on shooting and scoring off that mainly just shooting and making the situation awkward unfortunate should have finished that let him hit it into me that's fine i'm gonna go straight back to my teammates that's always my goal in a situation try to get that straight back to my teammate and a good spot for him all right it's gonna be my ball next to my team on the other side of the field so i'll just bait it again three ball for him maybe one more here a little bit awkward maybe even better just to leave it because my teammate would have known that i couldn't get it ended up working out if my teammate had known that i couldn't double it would have been able to shoot probably off of it it passed so well played all right i did some pads here he's gonna grab my corner well played there situation actually really good team bump take a shot put some pressure on them go for a bump on them make this path to the ball a little bit more difficult i love any booster but it's fine like a fake the big touch try to just flick this here make it a weird high touch that he has to waste a lot of boost to get to and it's not gonna be dangerous for a second at least might be now it's all good if my teammate had waited there's no danger in that all you can do here is waste on a boost and hit it straight up right so if he just waits on the ground there's really no danger in doing that that's why hitting the ball up high like that's a very good time killer he waited an extra two seconds for me probably on the ground one guy's falling down with no boost the other guys probably have to commit to a bad shot he would have had a free save and i would have had full boost back could have been a really good spot to counter attack right a little things you have to look out for like that but also easier to call in hindsight and teammate might have been looking at something different in the moment so it happens you're fine you're more touchy let's go back now because worst case scenario again all you can do is hit this into me it's gonna be a pretty good situation for us most of the time i get to go to learn too is what is dangerous and what isn't dangerous that way you know what to the challenge and actually dive in on because i know that he can't do anything with this ball again all i can really do is keep it in the corner flick it away so i don't have to even dive on this yet until i get full control of it let me get the bump on him there good bumps very annoying probably to play against but a good bump say pop this up for myself kill time for my teammate to get back but also it's a pretty threatening play and you should be able to get this most likely not everyone unlucky should have been fine i feel like he doesn't really need to jump early there especially if you know you're gonna get beat but it's very very rare situation that just occurred to be fair can't blame them let's do a demo should be okay here he hit it too far it should be his ball i thought i just take another shot it should be a goal potentially if i can place as well maybe off the next shot close maybe a little bit late here i can actually beat him to this that's fine just low 50ing it should be okay my teammate kind of like made an adjustment that he probably wouldn't have made earlier there he didn't challenge off that when he felt like maybe he could have let's go down twice off two balls that probably could have waited on right so that's a good adjustment to make mid game and it's good to see like improvements being made already just within one game right the challenge gotta wait for the bounce here right to the water myself pick the big touch here pop it over one if any get bumped maybe it's a go for us how to place it low i like to go for a low shot there just in case maybe they pre-jump and we get a free go out of there right i'm lagging a little bit you get 50. go straight to him trying the shot i should say all right we'll take it very very interesting game there a lot of weird stuff went on but at the end of the day we got the wins came out with the dubs got three back to back to back there and we should be at least a little bit close to supersonic legends i don't think we're there yet but let's see what are we at how do i actually check this or we divisioned up so division three grand champ two so we're almost there not too far off i'm not sure what it is in uh two or three this season what mmr you need i'm not even sure what it is at 3v3 but i know we're pretty close but yeah we'll get in the next couple videos for sure
