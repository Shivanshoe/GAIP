yo what's up guys so i've made a settings video in a while and i know i see this comment the most out of any comment probably like what are your camera settings where's your sensitivity what is all that stuff so i'm going to dedicate this video to doing that because last one i made was probably like i want to say it's probably two years ago i was just like a straight up settings video to um like kind of like show you guys what i've been using for a while and this is what i've been using since uh since sweden and i'll probably stay on it to be honest i'll probably end up using this even for the la major that's coming up soon so we're into it first it's our camera settings we got 110 fov these are the ranges in which i think are usable i'll just give you guys the ranges for each setting that i think are usable and what you should mess with if you are not happy with the settings that i'm currently using this is what i think is viable in professional play so i would say 108 to 110 is usable still 260 to 290 i'd say nah i want to say 80. justin's actually using 280 again i think it's one of the only players like very good players that's using 280. um so 260 to 280 i used 270's in the middle of that height i'd say anywhere between even 80s kind of viable i think there's some eu players that use 80. i would say anywhere between like 80 and 110 is usable but i would say between 90 and 110 to be safe i'm using 100 though i'm using in the middle of that as well angle i would say anywhere between negative five negative three is always where you want to be it's like the the sweet spot not many people mess with the angle too much though i feel like this is kind of a a setting that hasn't really been messed with all too much uh if you put it all the way to negative 15 it kind of messes with your perception of things uh you can see it makes it look a little bit weird so i wouldn't really recommend doing that um that's why it's always been kind of around the negative three to negative five uh margin zero i actually remember i messed with zero for a bit and i kind of liked it i thought but it's been so long that i don't remember i don't think it's worth it though it kind of like messes with your perception like the way yeah it feels weird i already feel like i'm weird i'll definitely stick this around negative three to five i'm using four right now though i'm using the middle of that so i'm using about in the middle of every setting i've told you guys it's kind of like the the middle of what's viable in pro play or what most people are using um i'll go to the rest of settings i got carried away okay uh stiffness this one's a little bit of a weird one there are some people that use even low like super low like 20 or 30. um i would say this goes anywhere between like 20 to like 70 75 is like viable anywhere between there i'm using 40 most pros i'd say between 40 45 around there there's quite a few that use 60. um there's a couple that use like 30 but most of the time you're going to be aiming for around 40 45. transition speed this one i recommend having like between 1 and 1.3 i don't really think it's worth breaking your neck every time you want to get a boost kind of hurts my head like i'd get a headache if i'm playing like this all day i don't know if it's because i'm getting old i mean i am 21 now but i hope it's because i'm getting old but this is breaking my neck every time so i wouldn't recommend having that uh-huh i'd put it's like 1.2 1.3 um where it's fast like the transition's fast but it's not something that's gonna like bother you i think that's a good middle ground to have uh for swivel speed this is how fast you have to move your red stick or how how much it moves your camera when you move your right stick i should say um i have this right in the middle of five some people have it at 10. some people have it really low it doesn't matter it's all preference for me i think it's a good uh amount to like snap to someone if i want to snap to like some of my left i can do it really easily like this um but there's some people that like to have it at 10 so you can snap really quick like instantly the left to the right and maybe i might even try to practice with it at 10. the only thing is my right stick like my dead zone on my right stick is kind of it's kind of messed up i think like the stick's just a little bit old so it starts to like do this little like shaking thing where it does like this on its own so the higher my uh swivel speed would be like the more i'd probably see that um kind of shaking motion if that makes sense so i don't want to have that too high but you can literally use whatever you want for for that i don't think it matters all that much now for sensitivity this one's changed quite a lot throughout the years people used to use um people used to use 0.1 controller dead zone and like default steering aerial this is what i used to use when i was like in conversation for best player in the world 2017 this is literally my settings and i use default controller doesn't um but it's changed a lot and these days i think the majority of people use 0.05 and around 1.3.4 something like that i've been using 1.4 for a while there are some people that even use force sensitivity you can use whatever you want for sense but it's more just make sure you feel like you have control you should be able to very easily control the ball on your car be able to do minor adjustments but also major adjustments like very easily and just be like just you shouldn't feel sluggish is the main thing you should be aiming for try to not feel like you're turning through like molasses or something when you're turning that's like the main thing you should be aiming for honestly try to feel like you have some fluidity to your movement and uh if you have that then that's your sense but you shouldn't be shaking too much like if i raise this like five cents and try the dribble you would see how much my car just shakes randomly and it's just very difficult for me to actually control like micro movements especially in the air i would accidentally like air roll for example on high sand so i don't know how people like monkey moon um actually can control their car on that sensitivity especially at land like a situation where you might be a little bit more nervous or more prone to shaky like hands i feel like it's got to be a little bit difficult but i prefer to stick to the low consistent sense i feel like it's always going to feel the same you'll never have like peaky days you'll have days where you you know you just feel really solid and that's what i want for my team and that's what i want out of my sensitivity and my feel of my game every day i don't want to get on i feel like i might be insane one day or i might just suck the next i want to always feel like i'm consistent and i do feel that way when i use uh the sense that i'm using so i recommend just messing with it and just trying to see what feels good to you but it's really all about just finding what's right for you because you can use my sense and it could feel terrible and then you can use something weird like five cents and it feels right to you so i think just try it out see what's good for your controller as well because that makes a difference some of your controllers might be super new might be super stiff some of them might be old and you might need to actually use a much much lower sense because your sticks might be super sensitive so the more stiff your sticks are the higher sense you can probably feel viable using because your sticks will be you know a lot uh less sensitive to micro movements and like little touches on your stick and stuff like that um anyway daughter's dead zone this is still like kind of the same thing as it's always been 0.7 is kind of like what everyone uses uh some people use more toward like the 0.5 range 0.55 but i would say like 80 percent of pros maybe more use 0.7 around there and it's there's nothing there's no reason for this really it's just like it's a good middle ground to not accidentally backflip because some people if you have this too low and you're trying too fast aerial like this like you're doing a fast stereo you might accidentally backflip if you have it too low like if your thumb like excellent presses the stick or you're doing that second jump it's actually hard for me to like accidentally do it but you know what i mean that's like the biggest thing probably in pro play when it comes to aerials is your fast aerial game and if you can't do that without backflipping that's gonna futurally difficult for you so that that's like incorporating pretty much anything area related unless you're going for like a like a flip shot but anyway i would say to keep that around point seven it's a really good point to have that interface highlights the same for years 100 140. um i use this at 150 140 plate scale some people use 100 some people use even 80. i recommend it it's a little bit higher i think it's useful i think it's a useful thing to learn the length of the nameplate and what it looks like behind the ball when the ball covers the nameplate completely how close the car is to it stuff like that i've thought about over the years but 140 the 150 i think is the best to use for this i use 150 or 140 depending on if i feel like i'm playing too much based on the nameplate then i'll lower it if i feel like i'm not using the nameplate enough then i'll raise it it's like a little weird placebo thing that's the only thing i'm kind of perceived about um everything else here you guys should copy default time updates only so it doesn't get in your way connection quality indicators off color by mode i use it at sweden actually i actually liked it a lot the way it looked it changes um the color of the name plates and some other stuff but obviously it's good if you're colorblind so if you are colorblind you should use this um forced default team colors i have that on so you don't you have to use the team stuff when you're hitting the game that's not very fun for me i don't like it off off off and ball air on some people have this on little red thing on the bottom left i kind of like it it reminds me of when i first got the game maybe i'll stay with it on i haven't really looked in these settings for a while but maybe i'll stay with that on it's pretty good i'll leave it uh video obviously native res i'm not going to use stretchers for a game like this not going to be beneficial to me everything lowest quality the only thing i change here ever always make sure you have transparent gopro songs this is very useful in a competitive aspect moral detail i'd have this high sometimes that changes the grass to make it taller so my wheels go into the grass it also makes it so when i slammed the ball really hard there's going to be a multiple ball trails behind it i don't know if you can see that compared to when i take that off just one ball trail that comes out of it i kind of like the multiple one more i think also reminds me of when i first got the game makes me a little bit nostalgic more than anything i used to think that the multiple ball shows helped me read stuff more off the back wall and stuff like that now it's all like a lot of things are very preference based but this is a very good like baseline to use because i've been playing for a long time i've tried out like every setting i feel like by now playing for over 14 000 hours at this point and i've tried out for sure every single setting so it's definitely a good baseline of what you guys should be using audio doesn't really matter again it depends on your computer your headset how loud everything is i have 21 12. they look school 2 1 and 1 2 backward i don't know i didn't know what to put but it's a good uh middle ground and it sounds good to me and uh yeah that's pretty much everything guys i hope this was useful to you and i hope you guys can use this and refer to this every time you're wondering what settings to use and the the ranges i gave you guys especially for the camera settings just mess around with those anything within there is definitely more than viable you can use some weird thing in that range like 108 280 90. negative three and use like point five five like anything like even this this is very usable very very useful actually feels good i'm not gonna lie actually feels nice it's that easy to make a good camera setting so you can even come up with camera settings and let me know them in the comments and i'll try some out you guys find the new ones that feel really good uh that's a good example of just how you can make a camera thing that easy like be unique be um an individual when it comes to it and try to if you like how an angle feels keep that angle if you don't like the height okay mess with the height go to 110. if you don't like the distance okay lower 260 if you don't like the fov okay raise to what you like and then keep the elements of the settings that you actually like and you'll eventually get the setting that you want so look at that i'm still able to play with it because it's all within that range that's how you can find the perfect settings for you and hopefully you guys enjoyed this video having some wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and see this on the next one i love y'all peace [Music] you
