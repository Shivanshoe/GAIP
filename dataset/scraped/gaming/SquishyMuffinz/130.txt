if you guys aren't aware every single day there are multiple sonics running tournaments in game uh i think it's at like three six nine and 12 something like that i don't know if the three o'clock one is a thing if i'm making that up but you can see right here six nine and 12 is definitely a thing um but yeah we definitely are going to be playing this one right now that's what i know for sure and we'll be trying to get a dove here so we're going to get into it we'll probably have a random teammate i'm pretty sure uh unless mostly gets someone before this starts but uh yeah let's get into let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes i ended up picking up one mic for our tournament for today we're playing against uh blossom vibe and lobster the first match here musta ninja team musty won the squish all right playing lobster goated stein you're my daddy hi i love you squishy i will give him a heart all right see how this goes first round i'll show you guys the bracket after this see what it's looking like i'm using some different settings right now abuses in past video not too long ago experimenting a little bit they look like they have potential i'm trying to oh my what a shot trying to close settings right now i'm on the closed settings wave looks nice man it feels nice just takes a bit to get used to i'm not someone who gives a time has to feel good right away or i don't like it wait for musty clean we're gonna start so flippy set from one to get past hit up the back wall there must have probably trying to shoot for being honest but is a good enough shot that ended up being a perfect pass to me honestly those are the best passes those ones that are just near misses on shots often the best ones pass from musty should have been a goal for me that's fine took a little bit of a rushed approach at the final touch there good challenge from us good finish as well settings are really nice though the right amount of close not too close and the right amount of stiff and not too stiff i don't know how to explain it it's like a slightly modified version of what i made in a previous video where i messed up my settings a bit the other closed settings i was using the touch from musty i thought one would have that so i'm a little bit delayed i ended up liking it the worst time as well that's so unfortunate all right everyone server the whole server just died for everyone at the same time i'm pretty sure yeah when i press the scoreboard there everyone's pings was flashing i didn't let me flip on that one my first flip attempt back i'm trying to pinch it off the ground in the net would have been crazy i've been absolutely insane if i got that big boost still gonna have nothing to to get back to that even if he did have boost really well please shot for musty but yeah not only did he get in his way there but i also took his boost he's on zero boost trying to defend the shot that's plays perfectly in the top corner right it's a very tough thing to stop diamond three no ways damon dude he's an ssl attorney he's actually diamond three that's crazy i don't think so though really he's joking really talks about the being from uh one to there if you're up in this position and they have the ball like that the best thing you can do is try to play the low play force them high if you absolutely have to but when you pre-jump high like that it gives him a lot of options low and most good players would have went higher that's why i wonder did block high not that that guy's a bad player but most high-level players would have went high not a bad thing at all to expect try to pass to one today instead of going for a shot yeah most of the time blocking the low on a dribble like that is much better most of the time there's air drumming alone here pick it up the wall i'll take my time on this got her around two it's gonna be freakel wait for musty to be there so i get this right side for a wonder i always try to get the key off to your teammates if you can so you do that by going the opposite side of where you want the ball to go most time it'll force it it's not too difficult it might look more difficult than it is but it's not that hard it takes a little bit of practice and you'll be able to get it almost every time i could pretty much control like which side it goes to if i wanted to go back left back right how far forward it goes i can control all that stuff at this point because i've been doing for so long competitive threes like with my actual team i do it every single time i try to control where the the ball goes on kick off look for the bounce here played around one once again touch probably the application on this ball one that also went so i can't actually go for a shot there i have to play patient on that because if it goes badly it's not going to be uh very good for us right if i just rush that they're going to save off the back wall or something some really bad situation for us all stuck on their half things feel very simple on these settings but nothing looks like super cool that makes sense like the cool looking stuff doesn't look so cool any settings it's hard to explain we gotta stop scoring man in too many goals well i'm recording this by the way guys i've been up for over 20 hours now so i can put my body shutting down as we speak so forgive me if uh i sound weird or like i'm stuttering or tired ish try my best my eyes are slowly closing but i'm trying it's gonna bait for wanda place off the wall lots you should have and actually i touched on that is really tough hard for monsters to get past me there so i don't blame him for hitting that behind me just a hard ball to get out of with a good pass right off the wall i got the boost here i'm gonna wait on it it's gonna come to me in a second i believe i can see the future one more the musty atsis hold on i still see the future musty goes in a second here it's gonna get over him but then one is gonna get a touch and then musty and then i wait again then i wait again and then i wait again and then i go and then one the is gonna pass to me pre-jumping off the ceiling never mind all right maybe the future that i see is uh incorrect it's a glitch i'm glitching my psychic ability definitely it could have happened there was a world where it was possible a different timeline maybe that was a crazy kickoff shot doesn't have that wait musty to me ah close close that have been crazy actually anglo is coming at that oh my what's up 10 goals what's happening good pass back there there we're going crazy let's go pretend let's go pretend you get me on my off day eyes gonna get there unfortunate i bump two that's huge one more keep it up i miss miss yes let's go i had to get the ten half we take that take that and we run all right next game surely is gonna be tougher surely's gonna be tougher i don't know why that one was as much of a bloat as it was i don't think those guys are as little ranked as they're saying they are but they might have been who knows it's like a weird like pearlescent-ness to these wheels it looked really nice actually kind of like it let's get the next one though so even keep it up and see if we take down wieners incorporated see if we can do it all right we actually got to start a game here recognize all these players are not pro players but they're definitely high up their ranked players so we'll see we shall see the best award here let's make this on the wall stuff like control the ball play it around two bump the other one and you must see a free ball on the wall which is good put you all the way back here find it throws that away it could be easy for one though one thing i could shoot but i might be able to fake and bump there we go really tough shot for me to shoot there's actually no way i could have shot that off my first touch it was better just to leave it make them think i'm going for a shot and then just leave it back off get a bump at the end there best thing i could have done that situation let's say from them i place it there we go it's a good turn there we're on low boost we turned middle we knew muslim could have passed us and this guy pretty much did what must he was trying to do anyway so i was there for it it wasn't hard to read because that's what i was expecting from musty regardless the background boost here took the mid head to the right side i found that i died there they're gonna be in a really awkward spot one of them was their boost to kill me so we take that engagement i'd say he won there still 70 boosters good but it's down right monsieur should get back nice challenge right back right here play four left and i have a bang got to be careful because musty moving forward don't want to get too aggressive there should be a good opportunity for us could even be a goal a lot of time there on the double a lot of space to convert that last guy back was in a really awkward spot right if they're on the ground they're like backflipping still trying to get back you know you have a lot of time to take the double all you got to do is just place it it'll be very tough for them to get out of that situation most time let's fake the very last second wonder was up for that so honestly i thought he's gonna have it so i left it for a sec fake there we go i was gonna fake it down to the ground and then dribble it but ended up working out because one that was up so again one of those situations where what i was trying to do anyway ended up working because something else happened it's a lot of what rocket league is these days expect one thing but then something else slightly different happens that still ends up working out and you just take it i'm not complaining you know fake this stuff for control he's forced to waste his boost throw it away and then play it back in the musty so it's gonna be easy ball for him way back wall here should be good for my teammate to follow me fine again gonna be really easy for rwanda most likely can't really see right here but it's fine play patient fade in another one okay left off the pass play back to me maybe i think you went for this shot i couldn't tell maybe it was a pass back that he messed up just a little bit it's a good 50 it goes back to my team gives him a chance to pass back to me i thought it followed up quick not the best idea it was played into them they're always going to win that ball if they go for it it's one of those situations you just have to wait very tough spot to get out of there we can attempt though wait right side here one that should try to get this right one for the back left instead of look like like the big touch here it's gonna make them both back off so now it gives behind me a free touch take my time on this try to place it it's fine has to throw it away to my team again basically scenario if your first man in threes and you don't have the ball is just try to make them throw the ball away to your team so must he's doing here it's a good idea as well he didn't get the ball off them which is no reason why that was bad but it was still the right idea and he did the best he could in a situation because driving up to them is normally enough to be honest that's what you want to be doing is first man just try to drive up be annoying show some presents make them throw the ball away make them give your team the ball for free didn't have that it's fine i had the net blocked we have full boost back now right left side really a block for me i must have missed i could probably follow this up myself let him hit that should be okay but to me now crazy fake big brain this is huge brain oh flick to me hold on the calculated pro fakes man no one ever expects the pro to miss no one right in that corner here it's gonna come to me this is the one my psychic ability he's telling me this is the one i gotta stop saying that every time i say what what just happened i guess my uh my psychic readings were off but not really something crazy did happen oh my gosh what's happening that was insane though i've never had a touch like that i don't think in 13 000 hours of playing i don't think i've seen something like that it's kind of crazy when you think about it you think i would have seen every every possible touch by now every possible pinch nope i haven't seen i haven't seen that right there that goes straight in kind of crazy all right we we took down wieners incorporated time to take down noble scarab and we're onto the semis if we beat these guys see if we can do it all right we got ourselves tino some guy with a blank name that i just can't read i was upside down h's for some reason that like character on steam just shows up as invisible in rocket league and uh it's like his name the original fire i thought from us didn't panic or anything unless he got the boost there so we got to just back off i'm going to go for the boost honestly why not let's make their uh side empty here not a bad play to make they're going to be low boost for at least the next 10 seconds gonna have a full boost here and the ball to clean up so the controls go down to the ground should be good for musty follow maybe nice i can't score off this touch right away so you can just wait most of the time it's fine fake jump here they control this now we just fit them it's fun really good pass hold on it's gonna play to make back there so we had a lot of time on the ball it was really high up we only had 20 boosters so for ariel for that ball also we're gonna do is hit it off the wall right better stay grounded you know your teammates gonna be waiting behind you you know their opponent's gonna be waiting for your touch so it's down to you to make a good play there he made a pretty good play to get forward on the amount of boost that we had ah that was a good double attempt good idea boost at the end so we couldn't quite get around it definitely the right idea there can't go for double sided sway go for a bump here instead right left side if he wants to use me good beat there's gonna be a good opportunity for musa to get a shot super weak almost goes in and that's crazy wow he just pinches it off of off of them wow i did not expect that to be the goal that goes in there but uh we take it we take it and we don't complain my game's like dropping frames a little bit i don't know why not terrible but a little bit of a handicap for sure just went for the shot there would be better play trying to just play it over somebody but nobody jumped wasn't worth it and like pro lobbies much higher level always definitely better not to go for a shot there everyone's ready for it but most ranks you just go for a shot of situations if you place it well it's gonna be a goal i just had the habit from pro lobbies to always try to beat people get it over there rather than going for the obvious shocks i'll be shot normally isn't going to go in against most players nice my left side here try to fake them pick them again hit over two of them back to the wall play around another really good 50s from one i don't know how how he won either of those it's crazy we did well to get around all three there but unreal from one day you won that 50 and you won another one to get it through this crazy four goal lead again we're going crazy this tournament let it fake here keep full control of the ball i don't touch this now i'm gonna be free i know my teammates back ball so it's honestly just a pass back to my teammate if i let him hit that i don't mind the situation at all forces their boost out and gives us the ball go for about before i leave here killed one no one's dead so i'll go for the third bump killed him as well i have a really good counter opportunity keep the ball in it's really good musty and controlled us now i see done on my bed didn't see one they're going for that i should have waited if i had waited it would have been fine if one did await it would have been fine one of us had to make the choice to wait there hopefully it's a good light touch there back to my team get to run the last guy back he has pushed up way too aggressively but they kind of have to be they're four goals down obviously they need to go fit around one killed him as well which is good got the boost waiting to get spot right side if he wants to use me and he definitely did use me he used me quite well there very good pass good vision to have me there trying to fight this year i'm gonna fake it go for the dribble musty hit though so i decided to maybe try to read his touch at the end just like this he's gonna pre-jump off the ceiling which is good for us pop it over now play middle i want to pre-jump really far forward i wasn't able to see it till it was a little bit too late a little bit past your musty good idea i jumped out of just the force to touch out to my team again again effectively works as a pass back i don't mind that take all our boost in that challenge is really good go down to the ground and wait for the bounce jump for it we have a free air dribble once you can take it pre-jump is double down oh imagine if you missed that and i read it it would be crazy really a play though the patience at the end there finish that off like a mid-right boost here two of them left surprising like this let him hit it away i'll fake this again make him hit one more time at least panic to it pick again should be fine so i got the whole team to go for that ball and all i did was waste my position because that was only one that ended up challenging so baited their whole team in for just that and it would have been fine obviously a little misplay at the end here we could just chalk it up to trying to get the brazil honestly chalk it up to going for the brazil wasn't a mistake it was all calculated crazy that the brazil thing is like still known still around from as long ago as it is and insane no way man again i'll say it was calculated i was trying to hit it into him to get sport on there even though when the mic was trying to own goal i tried to try to save it but uh you guys don't need to know that just looks like i passed it this looks kind of cool too rocket boost i definitely wouldn't use it but it looks cool all right semi-finals we don't know who we play yet but uh i'll see you guys in the semis all right for the semifinals we got ourselves against fly garage go in uh caliber i think they say that so see how this goes you guys got to be solid they made the semis definitely not bad i know go rocks go from a long time ago i haven't seen them forever now got the rlc season or rival series season one challenger take on that's like probably 2016 beginning 2017. that was a thing let's try for musty still here for a second all the way back past mid looks like try to play it around them oh my first touches in a panic i almost almost read them it's a good idea i'm here for the background boost here one day is the main chase around so i'll leave that semi-free ball for one though most likely probably in a good spot for the the next pass here don't want to overstay on their side good passes wait for caliber here it's a good read notice he misread the touch on the wall there and a little bit off the wall you're trying to catch it so as soon as i saw the bounce was bad for him to catch that ball on the wall i jumped immediately i didn't hesitate because worst case scenario i'm first man there if i don't get the touch on that my second man gets the ball and it's really just not dangerous at all so there's no reason not to try to go for that my opinion oh you're shot from one they're very powerful what can you do if you're the defensive i'm pretty sure this is the best of one still i'm not sure the best one the best of three my best friend i know the finals for sure is best of three i think that's the best of one there we go challenge nice one about to follow one more touch probably try to read this off the corner uh such a close attempt there gonna wait for the bounce wait for the second bounce off the ceiling don't need to rush this ball put it over to baited them both in which is really good all because we didn't rush that you got two baited in and now we're in a much better position where they're kind of in a spot where they have to rush every single touch here and they are uh trying to get it over him quick i rushed him i didn't need to because he was obviously a lot farther back than i thought he'd be press back the wonder touch forward two are on back ball here one of them's gonna miss play down left instead of shooting there's one back hole one ground so shooting that was never gonna be the the right play there they're going to save that every single time play around one wall good 50 right left side for musty touch actually a perfect pass for mostly it was coming through i saw the vision can't shoot that's all leave it i mean wonder real wanting on the on the back wall oh it is the best of three you can see it on top so there's like two little little ticks i don't know if you guys see it or notice it to the left of uh the one to the right of the two normally not there i guess they're gonna fill in so this is the best three as well wait for musty's touch here should be able to play this forward nice let's go for this why not so where's it gonna happen my favorite thing to say is what's the worst that can happen just to see what the worst that can happen is my middle i'm trying to pass oh my i bumped him into bumping my teammate i don't think that was worth it gotta wait for the bounce here he's gonna go again quick which is fine and that i'm missing again isn't too much of a big deal if i can pass back again i can control this ball made two jump which is huge actually mustn't get a good hit i only use six boosts on that which is good i can still follow up the next needed big challenge here make him rush this hit it away to me don't have to go for a play an offense there fine fine again none of these situations are dangerous quite yet here we go let's drive into that simple challenges are almost always the best ones play back to musty good touch around you hit off the wall one is a little pushed up is third there so might actually be bad it'll be fine maybe a shot here from us one more the patience from them one is playing really deep third now which is smart all you do is bait the touch don't have to be into that two is pretty unreasonable there to be honest like to expect to beat him balls coming toward him very like favorable spot i'm not really expecting to get the beat there this is rocket league nope it is not this is fortnite oh well we'll suck we'll suck fine though we can when the next one hit our way into the uh the grand finals hopefully well my eyes are slowly shutting because i'm on no sleep in the last 30 whatever hours let's see if we can do it all right see if we can get back to back here it's the same squad they're coming out faster they seem faster already had to be careful there actually really good he bumped me into the pass might work out sometimes things just work out you know without much effort everything just falls into place and you can just tell you know in like tournament day sometimes everything's just working you just tell you can do something really dumb and it just works out better than something smart would have how you know there's another a force outside of everything in the game that's controlling the outcomes you just gotta let it happen go with the flow i'm just gonna fake challenge here megan with the ball away got his boost play it back be annoying be annoying again match from wonder one more play mid now play back to me can't go for this like a challenge now let's keep it in there i'm gonna play it forward no one's there ready for it but should be able to get a bang out of this right back wall here oh that is such a weak shot these guys are just getting so weak that's crazy so much time so much time to get a very fast shot on this and he takes it like that definitely hard to expect that when you're used to playing people that just launched the ball maximum speed top corner uh maybe that's the play though maybe i gotta start doing that little little off there's see what he does here oh how is that not a touch middle i feel like that was on the ceiling wow i don't even know how i reacted in time all right sometimes things also don't go your way here at the crossbar like four times this game it feels like already it's been half the game oh beat him let's watch the demo there we could do something out of this essentially wow that was kind of crazy low-key went fast to the ball faster just touch gotta flip fake the first guy got under him waited to get the perfect perfect shot good bump on one that'll fake him here pick again damn we're going crazy with the face right now really good first fake good second fake there makes me have to back off because i have the flip potential during that whole time wait for one day here past the mid baby wants to use me should be fine press left don't touch that it's fine move forward here or one that should have actually i get a pass across here i'm just waiting like a shark oh here it goes what what is my wow the server wow server just exploded i'm gonna flick over one my first touch here all they could do to this forward so it's fine if it goes over me because look who's back there play forward gotta watch the mid pass very dangerous here there's block him if he goes if not then like the the shot opportunity also every time you get a full boost shot again in the habit of saving it i don't do it sometimes when i'm recording but in general you want to always try to save your foot boost when you get it it's going to leave in a very very good spot to go for very creative stuff because you have so much in the tank at all times right so even off kickoff getting the habit when you get one save it full boost drive around slowly you don't need to be going full speed a lot of times you're just baiting the ball out for your team very unfortunate situation because rivers lost back challenged at a bad time but in general like you don't have to be going full speed for the ball most of the time you could just wait bait for your teammates they'll be in a good part they'll be in a good position to do good things a lot of the time and you'll have full boost whenever you need to go for the ball and you're up next you open this quick and that's what makes players faster than other players their boost management a lot of time because if you have a lot of boost you can just keep going and going and going and if you have 100 boosts you can be people to the ball that have much less than you it's based off the momentum you'll have going toward the ball most of the time that's the case so i'm just able to go for both those balls back to back super easily and it looks like i'm going crazy fast both times but just because i had full boost that entire time right we're almost dropping a thousand points here didn't even notice it's a good read can't fall out again i'm gonna waste too much boost on that's all that must ago should be fine like that should be okay here one more goal for the boys ah waiting for the one to touch to follow it up all right good games again we're into the finals now we got two games left to take the dub here we went crazy that game let's see if we can get two back to back at the end here all right we got ourselves bubbly reaper frimzy and your this is just his name is your i'm gonna fake this first one run to the ground try to get a 50. excuse the the steam messages sorry sorry sorry i can't control sorry wow just keeps on coming really should start going offline when i record that's unfortunate go back right here another best of three here hit the dub good fake got him off the ball big fake here again got around one around two potentially pretty much gonna fake the second guy a lot of mind games you see me go for these days a lot of times i'm commenting now i hear me saying about a fake stuff over and over again because it's one of the most useful things to do now everyone expects the best from you almost all the time and faking is almost always a safer route because worst case scenario it goes right back to your team and that's only a good thing play around one make him panic a bit touch from musty two of them up for that which is huge for us see he does here head over to wanda sorry again i apologize faking faking there we go kind of instilled fear into his eyes he knew his last back for a long time kept the ball grounded had full control of the situation all i have to do there is just wait wait till the last moment when he inevitably lets me score on him i'm panicking a little bit too much i can't get this one i shouldn't fake this one just because i know i can clean beat him to that ball better just go for the beat straight up in that situation wow that was a really good opportunity actually i'm not gonna go for this everybody up for that and he's gonna always always going for the second boy actually can't go for it so like you to go laid out the one out for musty or wonder actually works quite well as well oh bang that i'm gonna wait for the bounce here better read it off the bounce i was actually good idea so i picked the fit up shot off that tried to read off the backboard balance would have been really good it would have been actually super clean i don't really go for those much like that let me just go for the shut up shop i decided to go for something different there again yet another incorporation of a fake another fake pick him again fake him again i just put so much pressure on them because they have to be worried about the fact that i could shoot in those scenarios but most of the time if you do shoot it's easily savable right so it's better not to sometimes nice play this right side try to keep it in oh my god jesus actually crazy there's been some insane goals actually in this journey from the jump let's get one more around them bump the last guy back always if you're going for both guys target the third man the third man is the biggest biggest gap in the team at all times creates a lot of pressure and a lot of bad situations for the enemy team if you can kill the third man so cut a third man there and that's all we needed to have an opening a very good position there let's remember those two things you're taking anything away from this video you're trying to get better at threes when you get a full boost you have to hold on to it as long as you can like this hold on let the ball come to you in a scenario you're still full in a good spot save your boost on your 50s when you can and when you're going for demos try to demo the third man that's the biggest gap in the defense you can kill a third man you're going to help your team get forward and break out of like a very tough situation very easily only use your boost when you absolutely need to and try to always be on 100 boost when you're off the ball that's the best way to think about it if you keep that in mind you'll always be in a good position to score i didn't need to fake that because i honestly could have scored but about it they could miss but it's fine because we're in a really good spot again full boost i can just go back now first facing the ball will have a better opportunity to go for this than me it's fine don't mind that bump them off the block oh my god a shot in fake this again i'm third man i don't want to dive full in on that fake is really good there there good pre-jump very weird but also very good right across here muscle should see me wow they just missed such a hard thing to expect if you can expect to miss there if you know when no one's up obviously it's a pretty goalie easy one to slot home but the fact that somebody's up there i feel pretty quick to it gonna make me take a bad shot obviously that's what i mean by the pressure like the fakes caused so much pressure that guy didn't even go for the ball he did go for the ball but he missed and the fact that he was even up for it causing that pressure for me to kind of overthink it a bit and miss right then i'm missing the empty net all right good first game in the finals here you need one more to get the dub let's see if we can close it out here alright for last game same people we just got to ice up oops one for the same balls one that's fine though just gonna grab the normal pattern i go going back get some pads don't wait for him to go here it's fine doesn't really do much for him wait again here should be able to bang this see what happens you guys are going crazy balls come with me so i could fake the big hit make him back off i actually didn't back off so they're becoming immune to my face kind of crazy another double whiff only so many situations i can get out before we were going to get bumped in one of these spots save our boost here we're going to use enough to go for that might as well save the rest grab two pads someone should be back wall easy safe for whoever it is should be fine here wait for his touch on the wall making the panic so hard i'm not really doing anything kind of just staying on the ball when i can better round one one i should have maybe double probably the read them is a good idea nice pass back down i like the idea a lot we're in the mid boost here should come back in a second right there it is he ended up getting it there i was keeping track of that one i figured i'd be on the side of the field around when we come back tommy was a little bit off but it was kind of right i was as red as i was wrong try to wait for the bounce here to be on that much she hit off the wall good idea i had to place that as much in the corner as i could because they were like i was blocking we could try very tough shot to get off where that pass is coming from don't know what to do with this really shout out is double mid i have many other options touch from wonder my frames are dropping so much right now hope you guys don't see it that would suck if so really bad right now so easy for musty actually a really smart fake because he gets full control of the ball now off that instead of just rushing full beat instead of rushing full speed there put into a really good spot after that big challenge here get the ball for free go to the ceiling play it down to myself i played around this last guy got the boost here go for a bump or two really good touch for musty oh my gosh what is that fake that's crazy that's crazy didn't do anything anything at all he wasn't really even close to making contact on that ended up working out funny man the fakes are key play mid no way okay i thought he did it again the calculated whiffs i couldn't quite get back a little bit out of my reach also wondering where i didn't use booster i was already full speed using my basement really do anything else there i was just saving it just in case i make the save i can actually get out of that in a good position put it around one more guy one time he played over one more one on the wall should have this we're tied up here i didn't even realize i thought we're up by one gotta focus wait for his next touch still has some more boost leaving it now looks like a little bit more in a tank i didn't realize i did not know how to shoot that i'm not gonna lie i was very confused as to if i could shoot it but uh i was able to i guess go for some bumps here don't even necessarily have to get any when you're going for them just alone caused a lot of pressure most of the time nice little pass back action there i got 20 seconds to hold on here play the time played around and don't need a goal i'll play it like i would rlcs go for this don't need a shot again even though it is kind of open probably just go for the time kill take another one here pick another one here take another one no reason to put the ball into them over and over again when we have patrol in all these situations and there you go so my games are so deep they ended up just slamming into their own that they couldn't take it anymore all right good games all around fun tourney will play the wonder and uh musty gotta thank musty for the invite
