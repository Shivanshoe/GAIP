yo what's up guys gonna be queueing some moving on games for today i actually haven't played ones a little bit on the channel so why not let's get into someone's games hopefully we can play well and catch some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game we got ourselves against lacroix i think it's how you say that i'm not 100 sure but uh let's get into it i don't really recognize his name to be honest but he's pretty high up in one so definitely gotta take him seriously i think we faked him a little bit there it's gonna be really tough to stop he's the whole net but dealt with it really well get out of the situation you've got the booster going for the shot it's safer to wait for the ball to bounce here i was a bad shot i tried to catch him off guard getting back post instead of shooting like the obvious spot there but he was ready for both so i played from him i was unlucky got bumped a bit and i lost the boost battle like pretty hard there got the waist on my boots to get to that boost and he just won it so just go for flippy set fake maybe still get back and recover that's why i like doing those if it gets under and you have a free goal and if what happened happens then you can still get back let's pop that there you have to panic a little bit he's actually playing it pretty well here it's really a 50 from us though and it should be a goal even though i almost slammed it at the crossbar just practicing my placement i'm just kidding i actually have a bad habit of doing that i have an empty net i love the shooting high as long as you wait to play against who's actually like an instant queue for me which is surprising within like probably like five ten seconds of queuing i found him doing well so far been quite back and forth i could tell he's like confident in his dribbles he loves it to take the ball down to himself it's a smart way to play it wait for the bounce here try to control this ball it's gonna be bad it's probably gonna be a goal there's very low chance he messes this up yeah it had to bounce really well for me to even have a chance there it's quite unfortunate he instantly rushed it and got a really good win on it well played by him i'm gonna wait for the bounce here try to make him panic a little bit same situation i'll always reach this ball next if you have to flip for a ball like that i know he's low boost so am i but i'll always reach that ball first so there's no danger in doing that try to just control this for myself take a shot make him have to panic a little bit gonna make him back off here with a couple of fake jumps and if we win this boost and he has to back off he has no choice but to leave and i know that now we can go for an air drill bomb a high percentage play that i'll most likely go in and that's just like pretty basic way to score goals in ones just you win that corner boost on your side you know they have to back off and you go for you know a high percentage play that you'll score most of the time it's the way to do it close spike them out a little bit i'm gonna grab this boost first and then i can come in with a little bit more speed i have more options i give myself more options like this gotta play it around them take this boost again it's gonna spawn i can go up the wall with this try to stay with this the other wall if i could bump him and be huge he actually wave dashed on me which ended up bumping me somehow and all my time playing i don't think i've ever seen that that was really weird he would dash on me right here and it bumped me down to the left if he didn't do that i actually would have won the ball pretty sure so that's actually an insane thing to see i've never seen that before i've never seen that situation before so that's like that's so cool about rock league i mean the amount of time i've played there's still situations that i haven't seen it's just crazy to think about and grab this other boost here should be fine for a second let's play it across can't shoot this he has to kind of play for the boost should be able to score hopefully there we go just trying to play that quick as quick as i possibly could because i don't want to get bumped there taking one extra second too long the main thing is getting it on target i know he's low boost so as long as i hit it forward faster than him it's gonna be a goal did get another one out of this potentially if i can play this wall play properly i'll play under him nice that was a good play kind of force him to have to block his net then we have options to be there above and below him below him is better because we have more time to react to the bounce not the waste is much boost the ball kind of comes to you more if you hit it above him there you have to kind of chase the ball which makes it a lot harder go for a quick shot here maybe couldn't shoot off that but it's fine because look at the boost keep it in be annoying i'm gonna turn one more time here fake challenge make him flick make him flick again make him flick again hopefully so being close i'm gonna do it one more time just to see if he does and then i'll hit it let me commit to the actual play all those little fake challenges were enough to debate him into eventually giving us the ball and that's the smartest way we could have played out that situation so well played made some mistakes here and there but oh no pretty well played let's get into the next one let's even keep it up and get back to back dubs let's see how it goes all right we found this game instantly we got ourselves davitrox who looks like he's from south america with the ping that ping is pretty common south american players around 130 140. so you know it's going to be a really tough game he's from south america they're normally extremely aggressive players most of the time everyone that i've played from from sam they like the challenge really early they like to not give you much space and they like just be very just aggressive not giving you time to actually create plays so we should try to take the upper hand as early as possible they're gonna be a sweaty game for sure i have played the this guy before like i said in twos and it's always a tough match for sure huge bump for us good pre-flip from him it's gonna get the mid boost here it's safer give me a little bit of space fortunately the bump didn't do enough there to be honest let the bumper do a lot more maybe even kill him potentially but i didn't do much yeah it's surprising i didn't kill him if i kills him there i have a free ball rolling back to my back boost i can gather the back boost and the ball and again like i said go for one of those high percentage plays it's going to go in more likely than not i'm going to fake the ceiling wait for his touch here look at the boost everybody down to the ground here let's try to fit them into the net hopefully there we go what i like doing that is because i'll still have 60 boost after the fact so worst case scenario there it's a 50 that goes either left fall or right wall best case scenario i picked him into his net or he misses because he thinks i'm gonna be going under him so he gets faked um but i like that because i still have boost to work with after the actual play itself yeah we're doing well we're getting some really good shots on goal we're making it very tough for him to defend his net and it's all you can ask for fake it's a good demo from him let's see he does here probably a shot that's fine how do you shoot it again so i'll just wait i know it's almost impossible to shoot a scan and then this is not really the score of opportunity all you can do is hit it around me so i'm gonna kind of force him to have to do that again same situation here all you can really do is hit it around me so as long as i don't give up my position and let them beat me for nothing like if i just dive at something that's not very smart to dive at then i'm gonna get scored on but if you take your time you play patiently and you realize what they can do with the ball there's no one else to worry about on the field that's the beauty of 1v1 it's one guy to worry about that's kind of the classic fake movie he's trying to do there you kind of fake the mid boost off kickoff and you try to take the shot that's a really good shot might be in my shot i'll play those really quick um but i was saying on kickoff right there he faked going for the mid boost try to wrap behind the ball and then score on me if i tried to steal his mid boost um i read it i also think that i was going to go for the boost so it was a fake on a fake there it's actually pretty deep high level stuff there that might have went unnoticed gonna be a goal i think i don't have any boost here yeah unfortunate i missed it by just a little bit but i knew as soon as i missed it that's it smallest of margins is enough to get you scored on at this level playing very good players should i control this for myself let him have that for a second so he does unfortunately it's not unwanted he actually got a lot of power on that touch back to me as well played from him try to fake him here that'd be a spot where i still have control of this play that's all i wanted a situation i kind of forced him to do something should be enough potentially to get a goal of this again i wanted to play at the patient way because there is a chance that he hit that back into this corner or is the chance to get some weird touch that actually goes back toward my net that looks like what he was trying to do get a touch that goes back toward my net somehow by getting underneath the ball and he was hoping i'd flip it i think trying to shoot so i waited an extra second instead went for the patient play and no matter what day if i wait i'm going to have the advantage so that's more important than getting the immediate goal if it means you're not going to get scored on or your chances of getting squadron or lower good demo it's going to be a goal for me tough bounce for me like there's definitely a world where that bounce goes well for me and there's no way he can get a goal right but that's the beauty of the game as well it's something you have to be ready for the fake work but not how it's supposed to work he just went a little bit too fast made a little bit of a mistake there when i kick off i'm gonna go fast here after i fake twice i go fast switch it up make him worry about it let's go for air dribble bump maybe there we go such an effective play it's almost 100 effectiveness like the only thing in the game i still stand by this that is almost always a goal when it happens there's nothing else that's quite like it you have time you have space you have boost and there's nobody else that can get in your way and just one guy back pop that ball up go for their drill bump let's go every time every single time very effective thing in 3v3 as well if you have that 1v1 opportunity you can even turn something like this to a drill bump it's a little bit tougher if i just put it toward the net and i go for the bump it makes them have to worry about it it's a little bit harder like i said because the the way the ball is coming down is much different than just a normal air dribble but it's still definitely something that you can do let's take our time here we can bait him in here we have a lot of space to work with gonna play to the left again kind of bait him in make him have to come for this ball i have a two goal lead here is a minute 30 left man i mean i i could win this game just like this it might be boring but it's true this is the ultimate strat and then as soon as he starts coming up a bit i could just go for a shot like that but i still have the advantage in the same situation here play it to the side again as long as i'm keeping the ball here it's fine and a fake jump makeup turn back to his neck that little turn that he did back there than that was enough that's all i needed big jump again i could place it behind him as soon as i see him turn off that fake jump that i did that's all i needed yeah it's a tough spot to be in i have full control over the play and all those scenarios that's why he's respecting me and going back to his net that's 100 how you should play that situation now that's a really well played shot only way you could score that that's exactly what he did that was very well played you sped it up a lot you got a very powerful very powerful touch on that and there's no way i can get back to that if he does that i'm gonna slow down right at the end here maybe it's into me all it does is stop like the immediate kyogre from happening against me not a bad idea don't want to interrupt this although i should have already backflipped i think but finally made a mistake there we go it's really awkward actually the way it landed on my car i wasn't sure if we'd be able to turn into a goal but we did so well played we got a three goal leader 40 seconds we have to make pretty big mistakes to lose this at this point yeah i don't mind doing that cuz i do end up getting the boost here and the only way to score is if you hit something insane and actually ended up missing so it would have been horrible but i bumped them off the miss so let's take a shot there we go it should be the game should be the game it doesn't have enough time to come back unless he scores a bunch of kickoff goals but obviously i'm not gonna let that happen i wouldn't do three or four bad kickoffs in a row so you have to try something different there and he did i was well played from him to try to switch something up only way you can actually win this game is catching me off guard on kickoffs yeah very good game good adjustments we made throughout it and uh well played i'll play from him right there as well so just never shoot that i jumped early i was kind of trolling a little bit obviously because i have a big enough lead to just win the game but there the mistake is just obviously jumping early you jump early you show your hand too early you want to save what you want to do like defensively for as long as possible whether that be how you challenge the ball whatever it may be how you challenge how you position the net you don't want to show your opponent what you're going to do too early i jumped early there and it gave him an opportunity to just get a free goal um well played to him played really well and that's going to be all for this video guys i hope you enjoyed see me play some once again have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace even more
