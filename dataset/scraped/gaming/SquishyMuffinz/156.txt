yo what's up guys gonna be playing some twos for today with ajax from united should be some good games let's get straight into it so you can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first time got ourselves kaz and sharp already starting off with the shot good save from us and grab some pads here i don't have time to really leave and grab a boost so i might as well grab pads at least stay a little bit more relevant stay midfield that way i can follow up if something happens make it panic a little bit just by being here really good challenge from us it's going to leave ajax in a really good position to get a good touch caught him leaving the net in a ship vehicle there we go so my eye was pretty much locked on the last guy back as soon as i saw him leave that's when i knew my play was to take a shot there if he didn't leave in that situation i would have just taken a touch to myself and try to control go for a 1v1 play something like that but because i saw him leave i knew that was the best play to make so like really firmly locking your eye on your opponent in a situation like that is actually extremely important i'm gonna launch a ball downfield here i'll just float wait for it to come back to me i missed unfortunately but ajax was slotted for some reason i over thought the bounce a little bit i thought i was gonna go down for some reason a little bit more than it did and because it didn't i ended up missing but it happens and as long as you get that goal that's all that matters mistakes do happen as long as you learn from them try to make less mistakes next time so i think my big mistake there was not taking a little bit slower knowing that he couldn't actually get there my place to the ceiling for my teammate there we go good pass from him to me and then get past the ceiling back to him and very good placement to be there and take the shot realize the play that's forming i'm gonna fake the big touch here make him have to kind of go for it let's try to beat me there in a situation again fake the big touch now i have a free ball the situation i'm gonna let him go for this it's fine i don't mind i know he has low boost he has to play for that boost as long as he doesn't get bumped here we're good normal air dribble is not really gonna be enough to get by him there might be a goal still though yeah he ended up landing a little bit further than i thought he would and because of that wasn't able to get back to the next touch but that was well played from them they played it really quick kept staying aggressive and that's how you gotta play out that situation to get a go out of it so i'll put check the big touch go right down to the ground pick the bounce past middle could be a goal there we go good fakes there a double jump there good fake on the wall waiting for the bounce makes them half the weight they have to respect the fact that you can bang that on net or you can first time the pass and if you use that to your advantage then you're gonna do well there play to the wall he's faking him a little bit i'm gonna have a touch here but it's fine ajax can now get a ball oh if i was able to turn that just a little bit more in there would have been a really good shot it's a good try though how to use the power of the flip to turn the ball just a little bit there good 50 that's gonna delay there clear should be a free ball now for ajax to kind of throw it away too early maybe a pinch him i'm gonna try to pre-position for the pinch if not i can go back again put yourself in a position there where worst case scenario you can get back best case scenario you can maybe even get a goal out of it try to always position for both scenarios and you'll see that a lot there are rockley that's a lot of what rocket league is is trying to place yourself in a spot where you can react to the best and worst of each scenario so right there again teammate could have won that 50 really hard or you could have lost it like he didn't i got to be in a spot for both of those things it applies to almost every situation you got to cover two angles almost at all times messed up my touch stairs not what i wanted trying out the ps5 controller right now it's a little bit wonky to me but i'm trying to get used to a little bit give it at least a proper try i didn't give it a proper try when i first got it played down to ajax gonna touch this but it's fine and go for a quick shot maybe snipe it get safe from him well played wait for ajax here again it was one of those situations like you see how many times after i mentioned it that those little things apply be there for the worst and best case i'm gonna fake here try to go for a bump okay let's get a free ball here i have zero boost i'll just let him go again faking again not the best 50 but it's gonna be tough for him to shoot at the very least i messed up should be fun i thought he would have the shot on goal so i remembered the net but he hit it off the wall so well played from him if you try to hit off the wall if not still well played because it worked out i think he pre-jumped i'm not sure though to be honest yeah he actually see that was that was all played from them to be honest the pre-jump i mean it's a little bit unrealistic and not something you see very often in like um much higher level games than like pro games because it's very risky in a way you're throwing yourself away if you get beat there kind of just flying in the air for no reason if you get beat um but that was a situation where ajax was was only positioned for the best case scenario right and that's okay to make a mistake like that to be honest and that's something that happens quite a bit that's the only thing that goes in these days in pro play is someone positioning for something that is only the good outcome and not positioning for also the bad outcome you want to be in kind of the middle of the two like i said that's one of the most important things in today's meta in today's gameplay it's a good 50 back to him can't wait for a touch here it's going to be a free ball to clean up so i'm not going to boom this even though i could have technically passed to ajax i take it myself if it wasn't twos i think i would have passed that but it's a very real chance it doesn't go well for me if i do pass that i was bumping there trying to delay the rotation a little bit hey that's gonna be last for a little bit but it should be fine i think they messed it up there we go it's gonna be a game all right let's get into the next one let's even keep it up good game all around though and you can see just so many times after i mentioned it um just how important that is to position in a spot where you're covering both options and i'll talk about it more in the next game but that's something that um in general i think is the biggest mistake in pro play right now since ajax did dip on us we're gonna be solo queuing some threes for the last game of this video so let's get into it let's even get a dub let's see how it goes all right the last day we got ourselves sip yolks and shadow let's probably see these sip solo king threes i wonder if he's only playing threes now not two so i wonder if he has the same mindset as me when it comes to twos i think twos have reached like as good as you can get from it like you can't really gain much from twos anymore but i like the solo q3s i'm gonna slow cue it all threes is the the way to go for sure yeah it's gonna be really sweaty game we got two pros on their team and we got two pros on our team um even though delta is like a newer pro kind of uh on the lower end of the pros but he's still definitely up there see what we can do here definitely winnable game that's for sure that's a huge play nice play from us in general as a team good job from the third guy to be there and be ready for my pass really well done the team play aspect of threes is so unmatched to me i feel like if there was ever a four before game mode it'd actually be really good so it has a lot of potential good demo from us and give our team the ball as long as they win the challenge we're good only gets scary if we lose that challenge in the corner there interesting bumps i might get out of this with the goal potentially or get scored on now all right we're good we survived play it over to space in the right corner one more touch off the wall here to be pretty big no one's ready for it but it's okay i can get a plate of this potentially can't touch this but maybe it fakes them does no one expects a pro to miss the beauty of uh being pro level being known as a pro you can get away with some dumb stuff not gonna lie but it works against pros too so it kind of cancels each other out when two pros are playing each other it can definitely work against itself that concept no one expects pros to whip that's just how it is and then when a whiff does come out or they can't reach a ball and it looks like they can't reach a ball it does change uh a lot of stuff people get confused very easily my first touch here just going to take it solo classic typical play loves to just solo himself there should be a goal no one is ready for it unfortunately could have actually been a shot [ __ ] off my 50 there no one's back oh i'm very worried about the outcome of this yeah if you're back wall there in that situation you should always depend back while someone's on the wall that's always like a rule of thumb for me personally in threes someone's coming at the ball on the wall always defend from back wall always going to be better than putting yourself on the floor i think fire after is the coach of their team or the sub or something um so he doesn't play a crazy amount i think so i don't blame him for not knowing that or not doing it but it's definitely the advantageous thing to do there in that situation you'd have a pretty big advantage most of the time look for the bounce here so it never goes as well as first man i always forget but doesn't really ever go he just baits it constantly try to bump him all right unfortunate miss should be able to get back wow that was extremely scary scarier than it needed to be for sure got away with that is it messed up actually could be huge for us should be there for this potentially off back wall yeah so you went back wall as well and it kind of just cancels out my touch completely because if you're on backboard you can get to pretty much anything ah it's unfortunate that he shot like that i don't think he saw me landing recovering so again typical and back all day it kind of is the cancel out to any kind of good shot if you're playing back wall you just have such an advantage over everybody i feel like that's to me maybe a little bit harder to do that when he passes to the wall like that a little bit harder to get a good shot on goal but it's definitely possible still just have to hit it very perfect ah it's not going to be a goal again the back hole defense is what comes in clutch in these uh these last second moments here should be here for this a little bit further back again had a lot of opportunities to score to be honest it comes down to to being there when it matters there it is there's been quite a few chances where i think we we're about to score it and our last kind of action is a little bit far maybe a little bit of nerves not sure right game might get into some people's heads the elo involved but never really thought of ranked that way never really like cared about that either from rank to be honest trying to bump sip it's like a counter to the back wall plays if you go for a bump like that in those situations people don't expect it a lot of the time try to bump again yeah good patience from delta not to command a ball like that that's almost never going to be something that works out all right i'm very scared i'm unbelievably scared i'm not gonna lie i'm back well here very low boost though should be dead all right it's not dead but it should be dead in a second i don't really have it play off this gonna go back right i was scared because my teammate jumped for that well facing our goal and the ball is coming at him very fast so something you don't really want to do especially when you have someone behind you just leave it for the person with a better angle than you open again the back wall defense it's clutched out so many saves for them that's how i was talking about exactly that those situations that it's worked for try to delay the shot as much as possible teammates should go quick i'll try to help here it's the only way we got a situation i feel like it's about a minute kind of butt in somehow what a free jump it's very scary though now but good pre-jump either way it's a good read it's fine it's okay to double commit there in a situation isn't that awful i dropped the wall for teammate no one decided to go maybe it's gonna work out though almost no boost here on the wall but under the guy on the ceiling kind of forces a little bit more pressure on them i missed the mid boost but it's okay maybe my teammate can rotate out and get it played around them definitely an awkward situation there having to play it around someone like that that's coming in on you but god of it well i gotta be very patient here my teammates are both not back right so i know he has no play you stuck in the corner here just kind of like at least get in this spot where my teammates can react to their next touch it's a really good 50. good back wall position play it right to open space see how much open space is oh my teammate as well okay this is probably a goal against us unless he goes huge which he did okay he went massive he wanted 50 on two people that's actually a huge player there he's playing fashion i know zip always goes for the pop as soon as he beats one he goes for the pop right away so if you know that then you just gotta wait for the first beat and then get ready for the the high touch huge kill for us nice he doubled that would have been massive oh this is big this is big never mind you got dunked the big sip dunk gotta wait for this it's fine might be bad now okay we're good good with my teammate the only bad thing about that is he wasted quite a bit of boost so i got to just try to stall time again here 50 is huge we want it quite well now we gotta hope our team does well here cause i can't help them nice one's up here i think behind me sounded like someone was yeah good save from him came in from the side kind of blindsided me and i'm not able to help out get back in the play quick because of it good pass nice good play that was a sweaty game very sweaty game all right we got it a lot of chances we could have scored much earlier to be honest maybe a little bit of a lack of trust in each other um maybe a little bit of ranked nerves i don't know to be honest but we got up with the win and it was a very sweaty game against two pros not sure who the other guy was actually kind of check who he was all right so the other guy uh yokes has his profile completely private his name changed could be another pro i don't know i don't think so though the way he was playing didn't seem um like insanely consistent but he was still a good player as well definitely high mmr definitely highest so but there's definitely that difference between pro players and uh the highest self players but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time as you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys on the next one i love you peace you
