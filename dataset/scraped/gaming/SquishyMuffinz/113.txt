yo what's up guys i told you on the last video that i'll be doing some ongoing games for today's video so i'm going to stay true to my word and actually do some 1 games for today so let's get into it let's see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right the first thing we got ourselves gyro this is a funny one very very sweaty one indeed i don't think i've ever 1v1 before so this would be interesting to say the least also tried to up my game volume a little bit i'm testing it out so see we'll see that was really good at those tapes so i can't really expect to score off stuff like that going down the ball wall here take my time me to get touched to the side let him turn on this should be okay there's a flip still so i have to be patient on that and as soon as i knew that he used his flip that's when i was able to make my play so i sat in front of the ball in a spot where i can react to the best and worst case scenario and we got that really well sat ourselves in a really good mid middle ground there took my time on this touch instead of rushing it let him panic a bit take his boost put him into a bad spot here another shot on goal let's make him save it there we go it's really a fight to make just to keep it in just to keep that pressure up make his life difficult don't want to go for anything too easy for him to save there but also don't want to commit too much resources into it because we can land and get a better shot off of it that's what we want there big challenge first we'll try from down get safe from lester cover our options again can i stay on this i'll let him have it's not a big deal it's gonna challenge pick the double let's go really good patience to stay on that ball let me know if the the gameplay volume would be too loud i hope not i wanted it to be a little bit louder than how it usually is i actually like playing with it like this as well it feels quite nice gotta wait for the double take a shot again make his life awkward difficult there we go we gotta go on it faking he says he can definitely come back three minutes left i played pretty well so far i haven't really made any mistakes haven't given any way through so we could definitely still throw this all it takes is a few easy mistakes and jar is very very good so the second you you give someone like jar space and a chance to come back he's gonna be doing stuff like that and he's gonna make a four goal lead feel not so comfortable he's that good gonna play this into a safe position he's gonna play at the same spot himself because he knows he can't shoot off that it's a good play from gyro here i just stay on the back wall though i cover most options i got a really good 50 as well i'm gonna have to go back and try to defend this the situation's going to be all in my hands to make a play so i'm going to fake him i'll go for the immediate shot take my time let him save it again take my time again who should come back now sitting pad they know he's getting pads so this is where i'm just going to let him hit this panic a bit and then i'll take advantage i know he's gonna want me to make a play there so if i take my time i'll let him put the ball into me i'm always gonna have the advantage in this situation just gotta play it out patiently wait for your chance to succeed in a spot like that he's very good off the back wall very good with his reset so situation that he can't really get out of if he has full control i just have to hope that he makes a mistake that's a good shot that's the beauty of getting control of the ball off the kickoff and that's why kickoffs are so important in ones it's not even about scoring directly outfit just getting that control that makes such a big difference because i have all the control off this ball right now because of that kickoff and i could just take an easy shot to the back corner that's well played take advantage of our possession try to hold on to some boost and kick off here kick off take my time up the wall i don't want to commit all in for a shot here so i'm going to the ground i'm just going to stay on this i'll let him panic a little bit try to see if he can get anything out of this backflip now it's a good demo it's going to be a goal for him very unfortunate had my backflip actually gotten the ball off of his car would have been a really good position i wouldn't have died either so a little unfortunate there in a situation big challenge i haven't done that yet i have full control of the ball now gotta bait a minute we did he's desperate for a goal we know that jump to the wall here try to take my time turn the ball so we're all played touch there around him not to go for the goal too early we know he's going to be blocking his goal there right for the bounce we know he's far pop it up and again just go for a touch off back wall try to tuck it in very good touch make it safe from him let me go all the way back here i know he's a little boost so let's just play the shot going right away he needs a goal he's on quick he knows that i know that so i'm just gonna stay in front of the ball here play my lead play my lead smart and we'll be good bruce gonna come back in a second i'll get that drive up here drive one more time into him try to make his life difficult play back up to my side safely i missed the boost by a couple seconds i think still landed got the mid boost that's fine should be to play this safely into my corner grab two pads maybe one is fine as well couldn't get that boost that was a really big boost to grab he's probably gonna end up scoring out of the sequence now if i say guess because i can't really win any of the other boosts off of that i gotta play this next flick while i did so i can get boost now big challenge first really good challenge well played this cover my whole goal here so i'm covering everything for the most part but he picked it well it's a good play i had everything covered so what what can you do the only thing you can do is fake it go for the low play and you did that yeah that all stem back to that one boost i told you guys i probably end up losing that sequence after that boost and i ended up losing the sequence again tough situation i'll kick off he has possession he's gonna get the boost first i have to make a point in the ball he read it well it's good to go i'd say even though he's gonna get the ball and the boost still awkward to get control of we could save took our time he's forced to go back here if i just pressure him he's gonna have to hit it across he's taking it down for his ripple he has 20 seconds left so the fake challenge early make him have to throw the ball away and go can i see him make his move pop it up i'm gonna jump again myself just kill time here let me go to the back wall keep control of the ball you should be dead there we go well played game very tough one to win dire is a very very good play so very very tough one to win i'm glad we're able to walk away with the dub there if you play him again i think it's gonna be another sweaty game he could definitely take it it's gonna be a one flip every single time put two good players up against each other and 1v1 it's always a coin flip i feel like so let's get into the next game see if we keep it up get back to back dubs a lot of fun though a lot of adjustments we have to make throughout the game so it was a lot of fun let's get into it all right for the last game we got ourselves that be trucked i think it's how you say it i think he's a south american player in rlcs over there so gonna be another sweaty one that around them well unlucky post bounce to be honest i'm not gonna over commit for this ball though we want him to panic because we're in the the driver's seat here i'd say we have the advantage unlucky we didn't win that boost still keep the ball in a bad spot for him to the side make it awkward for him set the side again get ourselves a back boost here now we have control he has to wait for us we have to say in what happens in this play so one more touch over him here make them have to jump there we go it's a good way to play the situation and that's why i like doing that because i feel like i put so much pressure on the opponent they have to jump to make a save they waste their boost they're falling into their net i'm gonna be able to land pretty easily and get myself the next boost and keep pressure right i'm gonna fake this that's very unfortunate to be honest it's good good play from him to defend it but extremely unfortunate so i go for the fake shot instead of going for the quick shot how do i went for a shot right away i think it would have scored based on how he defended that but me faking that it went into him pretty perfectly and he got a really good stop on it there's definitely a world where it doesn't go into him so well there and i have a good chance at net job to recover from that we play each other in the uh the world cup coming up soon team canada playing brazil i think he's on the brazilian team if i guess it's a good save or maybe he just wishing me good luck i'm not sure but because brazil is probably very hard to to make uh very good boost steal from him i bumped him into the ball there which is huge if i had a little bit more boost i got a shot away here but i'll go for a shot now make him have to save it he has to jump again that's why i like doing that any shot that you could throw on that makes him have to jump is a good shot that's why i'll do that over and over again to make them jump waste their boost hits the ball to the corner i grab the boost keep the pressure up same way over and over again you don't necessarily need to to threaten a direct ball every single time you can slowly break down your opponent and that's how you should play out 3v3 and 2v2 as well the same situation him and pop it up take a shot that makes him have to jump i could turn again now take another shot and eventually again there's only one person that can save the ball right so put into a spot hard enough for them to stop the first one make it awkward you'll always come out with the advantage that's how i've always played one of the ones out and that's kind of how i play threes and twos out is the same idea i have full control i know that he has to back off i'm gonna get one touch here to the left give myself some options if you go to the left like this you open up some options some angles on the ball and you can swing make them jump like i said now i can fake jump make things awkward make a panic of it always using the ball here i was gonna play for the boost i'm gonna fake jump again then i'm gonna go for a pinch here make them jump early so now i have a little bit of an easier time it's not going to be a very tough time defending this but a little bit of an easier time because i made him jump so early it makes his his whole play have to be a little bit more rushed than if i didn't fake jumper if i didn't show any presents at all right he played it well and it was honestly in the spot where there's no way i could have reached it but that's why it's good to do little fake jumps like that just little ways to show your presence into play that was really well played there really really good job so i did a little single jump hit it off the wall to myself i was able to beat him to the boost because i kept my direction facing the same way i didn't get bumped stayed away from the ball and i got a really good shot the follow-up well played it's a very good opponent two really good opponents today back to back though really fun really fun game so far go for a solo play i'm not gonna have anything too crazy i want to save my flip here go for a musty maybe there we go we'll play very tough for him to do anything to save something like this a lot of height once he gets big he has a ball let me go for a straightaway shot and again if it's fast enough if not he's forced to use a lot of resources and make himself a lock okay so he can't do anything with this ball this is the kind of ball that i like to just wait let him hit it away dodge the bump and i'm good there's no one else i can follow this up oh that's really well played honestly probably out of absolutely nowhere i'm not gonna lie he landed so well for this i couldn't see him the whole time he landed perfectly so i could have i could have obviously like beat him to the ball and hit it over him if i went really quick to it but i thought he would have backed off knowing that i could have beat him so he kind of like didn't show respect there because he has a couple bows down so that's really well played from the only way he could have actually gotten out of that with a goal let's play it to the side instead of going for a goal here go for a low 50 and then maybe follow up with the shot and then we've broken him down a little bit really good first touch it's gonna be a goal i'll play i like that first touch a lot he faked going through the corner boost last second he turned away got the perfect cut perfect first touch that he can follow up again really really well gonna touch this there we go we stayed in a good spot where we can react to that touch gonna went back for the booster like you normally would but that's a ball that i like to stay aggressive on better grab this boost here i hear him really close to me behind so i'm going to grab the all the boost try to make him back obviously i got both i know he has to go from the boost i can pop it up go for a solo play here really good save well done i gotta turn this now one more soft touch to myself i'm gonna pop this up just a chip on goal make a panic a little bit another little touch on goal here see if he does try to make him panic and i still have control of the ball right so we're just breaking them down slowly we don't want to over commit for any of these plays we don't need to all right well quite the goal quite the goal no triple flip reset action i'm playing really well though that kick off for me i didn't take a good angle on it she deserves that i ship this to myself really good shot there all right 37 seconds left four goal lead hopefully we can hold on here we'll see we'll see oh my what a pinch this game has been crazy all right veg and tnt all right good game though there's a lot of fun a lot of goals in there hope you
