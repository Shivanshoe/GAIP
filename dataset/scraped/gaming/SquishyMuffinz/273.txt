appreciate each and every one of you guys more than you know seriously everyone it's been sup their channel for a long time and everyone is brand new subbing thank you so much you guys mean the world to me seriously and I'll be guys enjoy today's video you notice the guys are back with some more freestyle grain shape with energy Justin and the last one that we got three four fits in a row I believe which is obviously expected in these unranked games we're up to 7 or 36 mm all right now so I'm not sure exactly what rank that is but we're getting up there by the time we're out of our unwrite games I think we'll be around time and are ready to be honest if you win every single one and we have won so far every single one as you see we're honor percent win rate 5 games played and we've got a lot of good goals last ever barely missed got a lot of really good ones but hopefully this won't be better and like I said after the placements are done we'll be getting into some calms for the remainder of the series most likely I'm most likely saying that because I'm not sure how we're gonna feel some days but most likable games that comes for the remainder this series Astrakhan rankings yeah let's get to the games like I said 5 it a template so I was getting 2 or 3 done and then the next video will play 2 or 3 again and find out what our rank is but yeah let's get into it guys alright was the first game playing against D law and Messi's I think his name is D law I'm not sure I'm gonna call him D they need me go for the the kickoff so I'm just gonna go to the side here try to put the wall for him these guys are already getting better you could tell so we're gonna need to be more creative for sure that's what we go for no dude I was so close to getting a touchdown so close that was really hard to get to but almost we get passed from Justin they're just hard to get around it to the part where I'm not gonna hit backboard but I would steal it yeah I mean Smurf smiley face I noticed people were getting much more upset with this series then when I did the other one is like a very noticeable difference though Justin got a flip off that I should have been nuts Passover dim I'm just gonna does here it's fine I go for the mid right boost and just wait for Justin pop it up oh my god dude those would look so clean if we get it perfectly that would look so clean I'm gonna cross Justin's probably deal with this most likely not gonna get dribbled on these lower ranks said I can't score anything these calls are so stupid all these y'all have been so stupid he's last year I mean it counts we freestyle dat game he says they're vtf for that I was I wasn't even that good the part looks so stupid [Music] I'll try to puff it up this guy's booze dude oh my god it's a throwback I forgot Rima boost is that annoying shall I get some passes going I sell wheat I'll try to see if just to get maybe get like a flip off of that I didn't want to absolutely bang it to him I could have but one does even go for something cool out of it dude why I can't pass my passes are just weak right now a weak sauce let's see we can guess on me guess is still up I see him oh my god right now whatõs nuts dude I thought it was actually insane hopefully that was nice those passing plays are nuts I'm not gonna lie you actually said that's impressive that guy let's see let's try to get a play going here again for us is probably gonna be more comfortable for us to start up like that especially we get to higher ranks just were more used to you easier to set up that way bang trying to get a top corner there's gonna be a lot of passing players I think once again today high rank once you get into higher rank stuffily gonna be a lot more of those kind of passing plays than just the pre jumpy ones those ones are a lot more what's the word conventional nice only cool goes though there banger passing plays or double tabs so preset it's only cool stuff we go for another double and then a flipper sit at the end flip it really do anything because I didn't flare I'm gonna back right I shall look no do you take it under it and freestyle it's hard sometimes the passing is like the hardest parts where passions don't get enough credit I wish I was good at this chain dashing like on the spot chain dashing oh my look at him go faster Justin on the double clothes I didn't give him enough speed and be able to do it each other gets off corn it doesn't just flying in no dude he's just doing like barrels telling some funny all right good for his game a lot better goals in the last game I feel like the one passive player is super nice you got to do it more like that for sure though just looks so clean always and they'll work the entire level opponents as well so scan through next if you keep it up landing at silvers and golds now so Stephen get some more good games let's go to chip what dictates we're going with I guess whenever anywhere asked us that we're champ queue and champ one all right funny get suspicious and velocity for it could be the last game depending on how quick he goes you got a rogue decal on I'm gonna flick this weight yeah I want it to be a back flip I'm just launching Justin I see no the team pinch - good thing he preached up they got their fruits and I tried to like a speedy - it was almost the nutty team Finch how does it get freed up from distance yeah ain't comms will definitely get a lot of pages actually asked me to be like one of the things that so much easier doing calms when you know if you want to go for it oh my god that's the setup right there I think we got to set up more bypassing back probably the better way to do it now we say please was not what I wanted passing play some edits Eve are blind and I pop it like that no we actually got scored on you're not cool he said yeah I was maybe that too I was gonna put a sad face as well for Jake a heart I was already reading about the type of sad face he's gonna have that it's gonna be too floaty over the net pass back all my Chuck dude that was actually nuts I needed to get the double reset I'm just floating the whole time I was actually insane those are pretty those are definitely pretty what sound take a shot maybe you'd be ready for fake these guys just missed like I didn't even allow us to go for the fake kick off and pass it back oh my god get it back I could have made that guys so much higher all right this is the player here oh dude we're like inches inches man so close this is the one bang this feels so nice to you all right super clean super clean set of games again this is why 1710 let's play one more for this one and then we'll do the last two in the next to find out what our rank is alright for the last point against redneck luxury and Max Payne alright this is gonna be the 8th placement game like I said for the last video we'll find out our rank little bit better pass for sure cuz you guys are definitely getting faster than every single game you could tell I play up the wall I pass there we go you gotta just weave your way around the opponents first and then you find that passing lane you jump from the grab that is ceiling got a flip unlimited flip man I swear you know there was a time where in Rockland there wasn't unlimited flip that's kind of crazy to think about how much less you can do in this game without the unlimited flip there would be no flip reset still no ceiling shots nothing man they gave you so much empty no dude shut the path up the double reset it was too selfish oh so hard to get around that could have definitely been better I'm just gonna fake like the panic oh my god it is fakes honestly middle if you can pass Oh yeah these guys are getting way better you could tell it just like the control look people are playing is this much better than before I just didn't know the past there's such a podcast I didn't know how to get that across so slow I'll be nice and say thanks even though I don't think it was a good pass it was it was pretty bad these guys are nice stuff it'd be cool I know I went for that approach as it asbestos back below I'm just trying new things experimenting oh my god right it's gonna be the one right here to me I got the boost that's it oh I thought he's gonna pop it up I'll shine I don't oh my god dude what is that 26 boost I didn't really know how to shoot or pass back kind of just floating it doesn't slip back to it these goals man all right yeah I didn't feeling to see me a quick one so it's good to be added one more yeah one of the extra placing games out the way yeah good set against again for today got a lot of goals and I hope you guys enjoyed like I said definitely check out Justice Channel all these games are uploaded from his POV on this channel
