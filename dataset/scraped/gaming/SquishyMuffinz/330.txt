brand new video I appreciate y'all the support has been unreal we're on track to be the second drakul youtuber to 1 million way before the end of the year if we keep going to this race then he has so much so thanks to you enjoy yo what is up guys in the last video we finished off at 15 16 mm R we are now low grand champ like I said I wanted to play two or three games and low grand champ to finish off the series just to see what it's like to have a taste of what it feels like when you just enter grand champ who you're playing against where you're coming up against and you know just just things that work against this rank still so let's get into it and let's see what we'll learn for today we got two or three games like I said the Pens he'll how long the games go but between there let's go alright so we got the lower ranked player on our team this time he's not Grand Champion and the two players were playing against our low grand champs this is what I wanted to have a good taste of what you'll play against here so I got by the first guy for free with the tip I was talking about in the last video of trying to just fake them out while keeping ball control good 50 good kill as well so at that point as soon as anywhere for the kill their eyes on for a low shot on target really good job for my teammate I like that kill a lot I was very good good 5050 and after that his momentum is already taking him toward that play or why not go for the kill doing a stuff shooting so I'll just try to get behind them here getting support if they 50m I'll try to react to it I can't go over that yet it's a little risky gotta watch the bump though play the patient fake the one for free again and I have this space and I can use it to pass across there we go again the same situation I got by that first guy for free and I gave myself some of the options by just swinging out wide well she just cuz she Buffett says a fat [ __ ] alright I should have changed my name but it's fine this is the last video I should fake challengeable that's kind of autopilot and to be honest that's funny not a shroud meme shroud is a fat [ __ ] I'm gonna go quick for this to beat that guy to it I said 44 bish now I'm gonna get back here my team I can go for this first his job just to force this ball out for me even though it is gonna be awkward it's kind of rough in a situation like that the problem just because if I wait a second longer he dunks me there if I go a little bit earlier he probably gets it over me so the only way I can get contact on it it's probably to spill up badly how I beat this guy good patience I like that my teammate waited there he's got some solid off the walls like you can already tell is a much better much better gap in how people are controlling the ball off the walls my teammates just there's only issues just not challenging at the right times so it's putting me in slightly more difficult situations because he's not making contact on my first challenge but at the same time these are Balban situations that could be saved regardless we are trailing currently so we got to get it back again let's try to see if we can force him to make a mistake here for that middle job so here are pre positional wall I see he's going toward the wall balls gonna roll up there I'm gonna get in the spot where I could pass it down to my teammate somebody on the wall gave me to hit that down to my teammates in a good position to shoot that I really like that he is middle there my biggest issue so far has been on defense for nine good positions to help each other I'll try this out the backboard for my teammate good try I'll take some pass knocks I don't want to get a position for a big boost they like to go off the walls a lot for a dribble as it seems these guys ball controls pretty good compared to what we've been playing sure that around all of them I track for my teammate and they're controlling the ball a lot guys seem a lot better than the the Gretchen's were playing before the low grand champs could be our first our first loss could be so try not to do too much when I guess I couldn't do more now I so I just wanna get my teammate involved as much as possible try to kill this guy off my teammate left the bish me as well she's good nice pass good job so I'm position middle there I know he left a [ __ ] me which is really good I like that and I didn't have much booty so you can't get that hard middle so I'm gonna be close to him to follow up his touch it's just a matter of reading the play let him touch that to me it's funny they took my bouche most likely so I gotta worry about that guy here's off the back and off my teammate well done well done again like I do for sure that that first guy were just gonna go for my boost so I I just completely ignored him I consider that as getting by him for free at that point and just trying to get by the second guy and give my teammate a shooting opportunity trying to stay in front of that ball I let my teammate get that it's a little bit awkward for him but he del with the wall I let him go BSS any bad he's gonna think I'm going I'll be playing patient on defense honestly just don't panic like they both panic to that and that's exactly what I'm talking about like if they find that play that more patiently just hit it across nice and calm there's no issues but they both panic forward because as soon as this front of their gold I think that is a threat so I kind of position myself in a spot like that where they have to be worried about me I'm gonna pass across good try I'm gonna go quite yet goes to the wall he's on the wall already so this point I'm trying to make him throw the ball away I'm just sitting in front of him so he wasted all his boost my teammate can go for it for free now there's a dribbling again try this cut it out team a can go first I'll I'll get the touch after nice the aerials are much more solid than what we've seen before the already could tell but the classic banging on Bowl strat is still to Opie it's still too ope they're just not ready can't pre position in time like he wasn't in the spot where he can get back to that yeah definitely an upgrade in the skill level I'll be been playing for sure my teammate plates old though considering he's not even technically a grand champion you might be I grant ripoff of that Diddy not quite not quite a couple points away he'll get a next game but yeah not too bad at all cake a plane I was a pretty solid game it's getting to one more one final game and hopefully is gonna be as good as animal so we're playing against a 1397 what 3097 in 1563 our teammates 1543 console player feel like we have advanced with too many console players draught this I'll trust them I believe all right I was going in our goal again I'm just positioning slowly on the backboard air so I can react whatever comes you want to panic - Baldy that pre-jump them and they're coming at the ball slowly you know it's gonna be a slow shot to me probably should leave that if he's already going back to goal let the person on your team with my man I'm taking it trying to win the 50 make them eventually give up the ball to me for free I'm in a weird spot here so I want to rotate back take some pads I like a turn here you got my bouche which is fine this is my teammate so this is going to someone who can help us maybe after that you missed okay that was just honestly muscle memory because when I'm playing I'm playing higher grand champs so never missed that so I wasn't expecting it at all just didn't even bother going for it but it could have been a free goal alright I got my one for free he I'm he's my teammate on the pass close schibetta use on your money and go for a Sun shot of some sort but that's fine city does see patient again don't need to panic for that ball I'm a fake just blast it on them bit of messy game to be honest but throwing a couple of fakes here there and sports like that especially where the last guy was gonna be panicking literally suck my Johnson well you guys are pretty solid I do wonder if they like on new accounts I feel like I'm not look she said a little higher seemed better than load you see maybe not I don't know they're very consistent seems like they're spamming me out here my fake challege them like you picture all this [ __ ] does and I'm not gonna doing anything but I just for something give them I just watch them to give the ball to my teammate by doing like nothing at all no boo she wanna see if they perish nice Shawn gonna come back middle and a sake bomb I hit off our own backboard be a hard for them to shoot it on a follow up touch in this fake challenging your for a bump on me let my team in oh I thought he waited on me they're kind of had a moment we were figuring out who wanted to take it are we on the right if he wants to use me or the air drew what like I was a really good start up to the pop there yeah I had space there so might as well go for either a dribbler a dribble I had a nice place to go for born old irritable they're just keeping the ball slightly above my car and saving my boost until they come so I could just pop it over them both times really surprised didn't get fake but I was going in full-speed even try to jump the block me try to fake him again and got by they got for free off that fake a challenge team is gonna be behind me anyway so don't worry too much and I got a kill but around 1 hey it over my team in a backflip going down here let my team I have I trust you gotta believe oh I want the double fake you could really use some people panic like that to advantage on defense like I got a shot there I probably scored immediately off of that I just want to see how far you can get with the fakes and stuff man should I pass to him nice bag how much I pass it back to him oh you're my back try to pass it back to me they go for the boom nice I'll turn on this Oh a little bit unlucky my teammate like Goomba stopped me all right for situations like this is gone the backboard and wait what can they do really yo purely calculated all right so it's probably to be like this upper till like I'd say sixteen seventeen hundred I think seventeen hundred my starts getting better I'd say it sixteen fifty is when there's another big skill yet because I'm used to playing like probably low seventeen hundred anywhere from low seventeen honors to like to point to K MMR is like the range that I play against all the time and seventy hundred players like eighteen hundred is not that big of a skill gap but eighteen hundred on there's a big skill gap again so there's like a bunch of little skill caps throughout like grand champ but low grand champ is definitely the weakest in terms of consistency but there's definitely a much better understanding of how the mechanics of the game work you can tell people are air drilling way more people are going for just way more mechanical things they can air hole their car with ease now like before they could really do that very well so yeah I think it was a good idea to play two more games just to see what low' grand champ was like we got a pretty idea of it and that finishes off our road to grand champ series I hope you guys enjoyed 35 games played total after at all and we finished off after 35 wins in a row at 1551 MMR so we're pretty well into low grain champ now not too bad at all I hope you guys enjoyed the series yeah the next video I'll be announcing now the series is done the new road screen champ in 1v1 on this account but there's gonna be a twist to it you guys wanted to see me style on people so I will be trying to style people and just do as many cool things and just win by as much as possible every single game but there's a twist and I'm gonna have a disadvantage so don't worry every single video I'll have a pretty big disadvantage it'll be fun though and I'm really really excited to get it started at I hope you guys are as excited as I am to finally see what I've been talking about so yeah I can't wait till I can announce that but until then I hope you guys have a wonderful day or night whatever time it
