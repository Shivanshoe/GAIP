think that you say that i'm not sure take our time here let him hit that should be fine to make it probably go for this oh you went for the back boost okay i thought it would have been a net so i thought it'd been fine for me to go for the back boost but it happens do it's on a mission for the bumps i was trying to just get a low shot most of the time they're gonna bump low to the ground so a low shot should work nice wait for touching the wall here it's probably gonna turn we're trying the 50. got the boost room which is pretty big and we have a pretty big advantage here bumped one as well take some of their pads i think my team is going to take so i'll leave it probably one more touch across i'm just gonna wait there both of them like use all their boost in this play is actually good for a counter i'm gonna be in a good situation now i wanted to pass across my team actually wasn't close enough for it so i feel like it was worth it's a big win any boost though not a bad 50. should have a touch here good control i'll be middle if he wants to use me nice not for 1v1 let's save actually i played that really well i found like the the weaker side of where he was defending and he actually did really good there but i could say from him he matched the shot i had a lot of options i could have even kept faking as well a lot of things would have worked there but well done it's like confident defending he trusted his gut so you have to do in the situations nice place off to myself fake this touch it's gonna make him panic a bit i almost made them just like pretty much on goal there but not doing anything beauty of just like playing to let them make a mistake there's those situations right there i'm gonna try to flip to the wall and maybe follow it up but not the flip i wanted but still a good demo now he's alone for a while everything i was gonna get bumped there so played a little bit safer by backing off put over one there which is good you can leave now force them at least to this corner for the boost that's fine go for a bump just unlucky awkward situation for my teammate i think he thinks my other guy would be so close and i didn't either so when the bump came through which was good like the second guy was just so close to just followed up honestly worked better because the first guy wouldn't even have passed that probably wait cross here my team wants to use me nice to get a control touch it's fine i'm not going to do anything with that actually really at 50. if it goes up like that usually it's really good for you most time that'll favor the attackers i feel like the situation trying to stall this ball play it a bit that's fine you know it's a lot of boosts here for not much that's good pick some pads could bounce up for us pretty well your ground can't actually get there in time miss 50. oh i tried something crazy i tried to get like the perfect like like there like that that worked coming from like a blind side angle his perspective he doesn't see me until the last second there he's gonna be looking at the ball whichever free save go to my teammate to trust me i'm gonna keep my flip here try to go for like a ground pinch or something if you ended up challenging but you didn't one touch forward here well maybe it's horrible oh i scored that land next week one more for my teammate i did stay better played safer which is smart should have that i'm just gonna trust him okay i wasn't sure if he was there for that one though he waited so long to go that i thought maybe you wouldn't be there but it should be fun maybe behind with full boost here he should be first guy on the challenge i think it's like it should still be fine we have everything blocked at least as long as we challenge there and don't give him extra space because if we give him give him time to get that back on his car it's going to be dangerous but good first match there buddy i'm gonna go one game away from top hunter now play one more see if we can get a dub there goes i got the same teammate against coral and sling see if you can win again here that's right it would be huge that's fine is it 1v1 nice password would have been a goal for sure would have been way too hard a shot for the guy back to stop he was like going to be flat-footed in that with a really really fast redirect coming at him it'd be really difficult it's going to be hard very good patient defending usually pays off there make it weird for him so you can't get that like cleanest win on that challenge that's the main goal there i don't have to do anything on the back hole ended up working really well nice all i have to do is just sit there most of the time if someone's like air dribbling doing anything like double tap related if you just sit on the backboard it's gonna be way better than if you're diving but it's obviously very situational and you have to assess the threat like sometimes you might have to dive there like a flippy set a situation where i'd recommend diving like it's smarter you can actually follow that but it's a good attempt behind me if he gets flicked i'll be behind him i'm not gonna go straight away give my time to make him panic same thing here and that's gonna use all this boost so i can bump him as well i'm to delay him a lot see him at the only one for a while now if that spine play it to right side to be open space there jimmy wants me to go again put it right now maybe oh good i thought it would have worked should be fine at least force them why that's like a good good outcome there i'd say put it around one wind up try to take a good shot it's a good cut off from him i was playing for the goal there like if that guy does somehow miss or like somehow goes too quick to the read it's gonna be a goal for sure so i don't mind going for a shot there at all i think it's smart i'm often the not though when someone's like dribbling at you you really don't have to do much like it's underrated to just kind of be there like just show presents but not actually like overcome it and flip into it let's play it around same thing here i don't have to go i'm really just trying to kill time for my team i can let him hit it again if i want to really won't do anything if he hits into me same thing here if this guy wants to hit it into me i won't do anything for him you know when the bomb at that time i'm gonna fake this should work close i went quick for it tried to fake the high actually did work well i just wasn't in miss reddit being in you make him go now he has no boost nice again wait backball just being patient good win i don't have any boosts here but should be fine so i got that one which is pretty big let's show another example of just waiting back wall when they get a big hit even right here like if you shot that have been completely fine same thing here hopefully nothing like there's nothing you can't deal with if you just go back wall i feel like and just play it patiently i'm gonna backflip here putting mid she wants to use me trying to let him panic i don't have to commit here i know he has no buddhist right give me out for free yes i wanted them out of the play and the other one wasted all of his abuse for that as well i'm gonna fake this should give me some time really a challenge good demo though should be empty all right here's the same thing i'll let this bounce over me and then just take a free dribble here try to bump one like about the mid guy it's pretty big kind of like just completely eliminates their offense the guy's gonna be working to get that ball middle that's crazy i saw the opportunity so i said why not make a play out of it one of them actually just showed up left alrighty all right send me the game today hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all you
