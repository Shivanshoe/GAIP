yo what's up guys so we're gonna be doing all three game modes yet again for today let's get straight into it let's see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right first thing we got zapatos against the rhyolite and rhys using slightly different video settings so the game looks different that is why i'll show you guys the map of this should i play around one good shot to start it off good safe from him though just to match that usually i don't like to like over commit for a shot like that in twos and get you scored on more often than not but it didn't work out too badly there could lead to a goal as well so worth a try i'm going to take this way behind my teammate save my boost here which i just got to pressure but not full commit i can back up on this you give like a little bit of space why not use it get behind my teammate let him stay on that why not ended up working out really well that's good i feel like that's a mistake that happens a lot even in high level twos like my teammate has full control there well not full control but he's definitely gonna go again so getting too close and making his play a little bit harder because i just wanna touch the ball is definitely the wrong thing to do there it's a good challenge of course that is touch back there as well i could save my teammate let's hit me back when he should be let me go back all here play patient isn't that much of a play here i know that let's go back home again it's fine i don't have to panic for this really it's just gonna be bad no matter what it is i'm gonna fake this should i go back down to the ground then get another touchdown and i did okay now what my teammate wanted but i actually didn't work out too badly they go for a bump on me gonna make this fall touch bad and my teammate get the free hit now which is good good challenge i'm not gonna commit because again look at the play here he has no angle on the shot no angle again i can just play patient wait for my chance to actually break out here played over one can't follow it up i can grab the boost get into a good position again i don't think i like the lens flare i was trying out the lens flares but like that right there a little lamppost or whatever way too bright way too bright okay i'm gonna fake first then go back well i had to lay a little bit i'm gonna fake jumpy oh if i got that wave dash perfect timing would have been a goal let him touch this it's not gonna be very good for him if i could roll fast enough it's gonna be a goal nice little bit of patience there take advantage of that i'm going to take off the lens please that feels better there's unnecessary brightness i feel like having that on the challenge nice good follow-up challenge as well wait for what happens here main thing is not to overcome my team is dead so trying to play this in this in a way that you can at least spawn and get into a position to make a save is good put it over him he might be able to shoot it let me go for a shot here why not nice it's actually good so my teammate jumping for this pressure him to make a touch around him he didn't make a touch around but i read that obviously the only way he can get that ball with my teammate is the opposite side so pre-positioning there's the right move to make every time i think a lot of um like the lower ranks the biggest problem they have too is just their inability to read where the bulb will be next so like just trying to pre-position in advance will help you a lot if you could figure out something's on the left side of the ball most likely the ball's gonna go to the right stuff like that it's very simple like the basics of that is very simple but if you can master it and just hammer it into your brain and do it over and over again you're gonna be much faster than your opponent you're gonna appear to be a faster player like everyone goes the same speed in this game that's the thing everyone goes the same speed but you'll hear people be like wow that player is so fast this pros so fast they're not faster at all every pro is the exact same speed their car doesn't move any faster it's just their ability to read where the ball will be next is a little bit better than that of someone who isn't as experienced as them is the thing that mainly separates people in my opinion we got on the two's game here we got reuben against forkey and our teammate from last game so let's see how this goes fourth is a solid two's player as well a sweaty game reuben's got a double off the bat maybe try i'll put it to myself on the side with the boost it might be bad i think it's a goal all good i think my teammate went at the same time i decided to cut it and then i died which is a really bad time i should have looked back for my teammates ago but i thought he was way more out of the play but that was my fault not being aware enough that he would insta challenge again right play for my teammate although i think he would have probably gotten beat anyway i still shouldn't have cut him off i was mainly just trying to help him out though i wasn't trying to stay on the ball more so just to help him got it back though the backlog boost here every time you get a boost guys big boost make sure you hold on to it try to make sure you have that boost to utilize for when you have to jump so every time i get a big boost if you watch me you'll notice that i just try to hold on to it the whole time so i get this i try to just keep it for as long as i have no pressure around me off the ball if someone's bumping me then i will i'll use it but my teammate okay my team is going way too aggressive that's the situation i'm talking about last game uh where a team was staying on it and i gave him space to to stay on it right my teammate this game is going for balls or i'm so closer to it your teammates closer to the ball than you are you should leave it for them every time should be kind of like rule with them they if they keep uh if they keep on dribbling or like they're still closer to the ball than you then just let them have it because it's causing double commits and in twos if you double commit well that's your whole team out of the play i'm gonna fake jump here just to make him panic yeah that was enough to take him out it's kind of funny a little fake jump i know he's gonna be into this ball right but he can't see me so if i jump he's gonna panic and go quick to it all it took was the sound cue it's actually really really smart little detail there i'm gonna try for the ball okay i actually worked how i wanted it to but i just gotta get touched over my teammate so i went for the the ball over the boost there and they made him kind of have like a slower trail back to net which allowed me to beat him and get a good pass middle covered everything my teammate didn't have covered there don't have any boost i can just wait for it wasn't happening you can do them away didn't have a touch across here i tried to play the miss i figured i'm already there why not get back here again saving my full boost so that if i have to make a defensive play on this i can get the other back boost because they're probably going to play for it actually good play from them i'm going to stay on this now i can kill a lot of time for my team played over both of them with that almost got the shot as well this is a good try take their back boost here and a fake challenge i hit this back to myself gotta stay on it better to keep possession in a spot like that down to myself again keeping possession and now i have a 1v1 it's probably going to save it it's pretty good in this situation working as a once player so you can expect them to always do well in this spot good shot my teammate really good job hold on all right two minutes left gotta keep playing smart something i was talking about though save the full boost as soon as you get it i actually have a lot of time to make a play on this now and that's just probably a forfeit yeah all right i think i have to do one more thing because i was just a little bit too quick of a set of games whoa is those glasses looks sick the pixel shades guys on all right one more game let's get into let's even get some dubs all right now we got a zapatos from last game against forkey and ruben from last game so i just have fork his teammate and he has mine i'm gonna let him flick this there's no play there's no boost so let's wait for his flick play it after 1v1 now for my teammate good job to get in this position got to be careful though the world where you definitely just get straight up dunk into his net there i'll take the back boost i know my teammate from last night a teammate that was in the last game was not having the best team he owned gold twice so he might be in his head a little bit so if he makes some mistakes hope he doesn't tilt fully off of it because not the end of the world just ranked good challenge i didn't use too much was trying to go for the other one i just wanted to see if it was possible and then once i knew it wasn't no point of full committee for the boost here the soft touch schmidt should have this nice see he does here good job if you can stay on it's actually really good i don't think you can oh we missed nice okay well that's the beauty of twos man even when you have good lobbies even so lobbyists are people that will make a mistake your last man back like that it's just the goal straight away so good job my teammate to recognize that that was happening you should go again here [Music] i was hard he's in a really bad spot there he has all the advantage in that situation just sucks ended up not being in spots like properly challenged and he was going to have a better challenge of me pretty much no matter what i did there if i play this back to my teammate or just around one ah good bump actually worked out really bad for us damn pretty much like the main thing porky is good at is just those flippies that's pretty much the only thing he does so if he gets a 1v1 it's going to be almost at a time honestly pretty lucky and they got that bump on me i can't really help out if i'm out of the play for that long i guess to the right side i should just go quick here i can't do much without the wait for the bounce i played around one trying to change my settings quick all right challenge both of them well good touch should stay on this oh my let's try on the flick i'm gonna fake him nice this is a good play to make i could have flipped it but he was reading the top like the highest shot so decided to just keep the ball close if he read my fake then it's still going to be a hard save for him to make i could probably just bump the last guy now there we go really well played a little comeback two and a half minutes left see we can do gotta stall to the corner touch wasn't the best if your last one back when my teammate was there don't go for the like immediate aerial on off gear up challenge like that usually doesn't pay off like you went for the so the ball like i'll kick off most of the time will bounce out the left ball or right wall and twos it happens a lot and if you're the last one back don't miss a jump for that because their their cheater is not going to go for the ball if it's coming toward you i'll try to show you guys an example if it happens like this for example i'm not i shouldn't full rush this here's all the advantage here but the problem is i was like so close to him regardless that his shot was still good enough but there if i full rush that ball you still bc2 it still scores so i gotta find a way to like bait it so that i still have control of the situation but that came off the situation was honestly like very very different but main thing is if the ball like bounces up high off the wall you don't really want to challenge something that's going to make you uh be following for like a very long time if that makes sense like if your recovery time is more than like two seconds and twos that's pretty bad like you don't want to be going for anything that's going to make your recovery uh very slow like that i'm not going to have any kind of shot here help my teammate let me just control that because there's a lot of time but it's all good nice so good play to make pick the high i like flipped around for a second and gotta get shot at the end i think i can show you the better example of the wall thing i was saying it happens in threes a lot and if you challenge that ball you usually gets wrong so there's my teammates shouldn't go for this ball ever that's really bad to go for that ball like what he just did is way better than just jumping right away for that ball here again you should stall i should not try to shoot this i think any situation where your last back for a long time i think i played that really well whole situation you played really good like here i'm last night for a long time i should not go for these balls and look ends up happening most of the time they end up just throwing it away like they get a bad touch nice run teammate just stay on this i was gonna back off so i have control now i can go to the wall to myself there's some plate around them in jumps there we go they play from us oh you come back though i don't know a lot of little mistakes scheme both sides but a lot of valuable stuff as well to take from it i think ah probably yeah that was open oh good i should have hit it for like blasted forward would have been completely fine i was playing for the goal which is a bad play there cause we have a two goalie but it would have probably been a goal if i got a little bit more space on the ball oh no oh no that's that's my bad i did not think you'd challenge like that awesome bad that's the bad challenge there's no threat okay what what porky did there yeah it's all good that's all good about that there's zero throw with what he did like the area play there is really bad the ball ended up bouncing on the goal line like super low like that so when that happens if the ball is ever going in bouncing on the going like that someone challenged badly that's all it is shot wasn't good all right well this game was destined for oh wow that could have been bad this game was destined for over time though let's be real all the stuff that that went on all right let me get the mid beast he's probably just in his own head a little bit as well he's making a lot of mistakes so it's easy to get you know tilted at yourself it's easy to like let your your mentality kind of consume you a bit you guys have probably had those days too i've had those days i know that for sure making a lot of mistakes very easy to get in your own head about it guys just bumping me now probably gonna work out better than if he was actually going for the ball gonna have a touch here okay oh we got a thousand almost down 200 points very cool we did we did we had to do we won that somehow i have no idea that was um all right yeah you're like that happen like if you're ever feeling like you're just making mistake after a mistake or like you're a burden to your teammate i've had games where i feel like that even in pro games i feel like man i can't do anything today and if you feel like that like you know you're human after all you're gonna make mistakes you have off days is what it is no matter how long you played this game man i've played this game 14 000 hours i have days right i feel like i'm just not hitting the ball right it it still happens so no need to like get in your head about it but i think yeah there's actually lots of like learn from that game from both sides and everyone everyone made mistakes that lobby for sure so it's fun for you guys to watch i think it'll be a good thing for you guys to watch hope you guys enjoyed having some wonderful day or night whatever time it was guys watching this like comment subscribe to see us all in the next one i love you you
