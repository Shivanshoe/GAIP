yo what's up guys gonna be doing my 2v2 placements for today i've done four matches i believe so far out of my 10. it's obviously the new competitive season season two they released a new rocket pass alongside that there's not that many really cool things in here i think my favorite thing has got to be this goal explosion though this go explosion looks really nice where is it the light show on it's got to be the best thing there's nothing better surely there's nothing else better in this but there is the brand new car which if you guys want to see me try out i can definitely try out the brand new car let's go explosion is pretty cool too but i think the other one's definitely better but yeah this is the brand new car once i unlock it i'll give it a try on a video that way you guys can you know see what it actually looks like it's probably gonna be pretty nice it looks a lot like domino's hitbox if i had to guess uh so yeah i could try it out let me know down below if you guys want to see me do a remx gmt video but yeah outside of that guys i just wanted to say a huge thank you to everybody who has been supporting the channel consistently and everybody that's brand new here

league because i always provide high level content i always give insight as to what i'm thinking as well that way if you guys are trying to learn it's your best way to learn it's free coaching pretty much and you got to watch some high level game playing hopefully yeah let's get to the answer today hopefully we can get two more wins on our placements let's see how it goes all right for the first game we got ourselves bjs 105 underscore p all right it's a pretty hard name to say but against tensai and woah justice i'd normally cheat but i'm not sure what to expect out of these kickoff so i'm gonna just play it safer i don't think not cheating is like necessarily dangerous in this lobby i'm not sure what to expect i don't recognize anybody here obviously it's a brand new season so this stuff's always going to be a little bit uh foreign a lot of the players that i play i'm not going to recognize until everything like levels out a little bit nice good pass for my teammate well done in that situation i'm just trying to take my time read the balance i know i have time i know i'm not going to have anyone really challenging me outside of the guy in goal so only have to focus on him and just focus on you know the bounce itself so that's a pretty good play for my teammate to pass that hold on good start to the game to make sure you go here i'll stay behind him full boost if he gets beat it's fine all right a little dangerous here but he kind of threw it away already so i should be able to get underneath that nice cuff for my teammate i'm just going to pressure this i know i can't score off of it if i can display it to the side it's a win for us i'd say close again just trying to play it out around them pretty much i'm going to fake jump here try to make them panic a little bit i'm gonna say this one time it's fine it goes straight to my teammate anyway as long as he gets a good touch here we're chilling right behind try to get in the way of this doesn't mean anything crazy it's more just to block the potential threat good block my teammate i have time here i see the opponent so i'll just make him panic hopefully teammates should be there nice i have a lot just my teammate in solo queue but i think it's a good way to play because i play in my competitive environment with a lot of trust in my team so you want to try to put your teammates in spots that aren't terrible but at the same time you're you're giving your team an advantage by you know making a fake challenge you're making a specific play so i always try to think about those things when you're playing i'm gonna jump once again here i'll just turn around go for another good challenge i don't have to go for this one i can just go back wall it's probably more productive than jumping for that taking our time on that teammate should have pretty easily as long as he doesn't get dunked which he did unfortunately all good unlucky he had a lot of time and i think he just might have thought he had more time than he did even though it was already a lot just took a little bit too long i also hate when my teammates have their quick chat like on team chat only because i can't reply oh i didn't flip i'm trying to flip that past them i can't reply because it looks like i'm just chatting for no reason to make sure to go all right he has to stop dribbling in situations like that because that's super risky if you get bumped right in front of your goal like that off trying to dribble it can go really badly you see how like he took that soft touch to himself and then immediately got bumped and if i wasn't behind them it's probably going to lead to a bad thing so you got to try to be careful when you choose to control the ball you should try to boom it out in a situation like that clear danger instead of you know going for a controlled play in a spot like that it's all situational really i don't think there is a a one thing works for every situation in rocket league that's not how it'll ever be to be honest but you try to figure out what works best for each situation and just abuse that when you can should probably score that but it's fine i could turn here i also thought i had to rush that double more than i did even though i was pretty much open i've been playing threes all day today so i'm used to having that one extra guy back it should block nice i have 80 boosts here just got to play defense let's go type the angle is here into goal he has no option but to go middle that's kind of like the cheat code if you're defending from a corner look how small the angle is they have to shoot right in front of goal is a little bit harder but when it comes to defending the corner it's not that hard because you know their angle is so slim that's why most of the time you see people pass those rather than shoot because the shot's going to be very hard from the place perfectly and if they do all you have to do is double jump here and you defend the whole net right it's going to fake challenges or bump should be fine nice pass from my teammate hit the crossbar because i tried to slaughter this absolutely hard and beautifully as i could but it's okay just having fun with this match a little bit pop this up to myself take my time as soon as he jumps i'll use the rest of my boots and i'll be cool obviously i could like just shoot that ball for my teammate very low and guarantee the goal but it's a youtube video for the content go for the best possible top binder obviously if that's in a tournament like i'm gonna get above that ball as much as possible just make sure it's in should be to get back here nice took my time make sure i get a good 50 on that and it spills out very nicely to my teammate what is that goal explosion what the heck yeah see that nice number one if you didn't bump me i probably had to follow but it's a good bump from them nice i can't go for a shot here i know this i have to wait for the bounce let's play it mid in a good way i can go back now if he gets beat it's fine we're safe again killing time for my teammate here trying to put him in a good position it's around two of them team it's not gonna be mid so i gotta just try to put this in myself i actually made it back well done i thought it was gonna be a little bit too far back but honestly i guess because i played a little bit slower in the corner there he was able to get mid so i didn't even need to go for that again myself you to be you tubby yes you i am tubby this is true all right good first game let's get into the next one hopefully get the back-to-back does but yeah very very quality first dub there let's get to the next one see if we can keep it up all right for the last game we got ourselves bishop against nugs and the bj guy from last game so let's see see if we can do it could read from him i'll wait for his next touch here probably one more if not i'll just fake challenge get them to both back off the ball teammate's middle here i'll just toss him a pass see if he wants to do anything with that he wasn't playing like super aggressive mid i don't blame him for that you really want to do that in twos instead of leaning the turn for that next ball but it's fun as long as you get a good challenge here it's okay wait middle foot boost for my teammate he's gonna have one more i'll just let him touch it it's fine i want him to go for this low key all right i wanted him to hit it though i didn't want him to miss i was not ready for that good kill though should be open there we go very hard spot for him to be in there it bounces up over his back wall all you have to do is just kill the guy obviously and at that point is going to be a free goal for your teammate well done from the be there i'm the luckiest no seems to be a solid teammate so far unlucky on them i'm just gonna take his boost because why not i could possibly go wrong and i'll get the free go out of it i feel like you have to okay this sounds bad but when you're doing these placements like the first games of the season like first first games of the season you have to be a little bit like just aggro and just be confident and just go for the ball because if you just play too safe no one does anything it feels like sometimes so you just gotta try to just be confident and trust your ability obviously don't screw over your teammate consistently but if you know you can go for the ball over and over again just keep on going for it because sometimes in these placement games like everyone's afraid to do anything oh they're locked i did not realize their luck ought to play that much different but he can't score anyway not yet at least oh my god he missed all right we should be fine got the vichram it's a pretty big boost still should be a goal nice i expected him to hit that shot so bad that i blocked the high angle and he could have honestly just faked it and went low but but yeah that was something i probably wouldn't have went for if i realized my teammate was uh was locked there because it was really risky and he probably should have converted but again these beginning of the season matches especially solo queueing is very weird i think my teammate won as well he did just gonna try to let him hit this doesn't matter what he does really from back hole his options are gonna be limited nice back wall is like the most overpowered way to defend in a situation like that because you have so many different options to actually do something useful if you're sitting on the floor there it's much more awkward right backwall you just have so many options it's a good shot though good double very good start to this game we have three minutes left four goes up looking good i just beat him i want to go for the goal straight off the bat playing tickets back for my teammate potentially he got that boost this could be bad i'm gonna try to take some pads mid here get into a good position instead of going for a back boost nice let's look look at some pads try not to waste anything my teammate's just busy scoring what more can you ask for just collected some pads trying to fill up the tank and you got bishop just getting goals what more can you ask for you know also i'm gonna have a little bit of a break for christmas like off rlcs and stuff oh my god i was not even thinking when i jumped there um so yeah i'll be able to upload extremely consistently and actually like you guys won't be seeing like as many i know i had like two or three uploads where it was from my twitch streams i don't really want to do that too often because it's kind of lazy i'd rather just like upload specifically for youtube like i always have even though you guys didn't like dislike those videos it's just i don't know i prefer uploading stuff that i specifically recorded for youtube if you guys know what i mean played around one so yeah i have a little bit of a break from rcs and stuff oh i should have been crazy i delayed delayed the flick i never even tried to go for this yeah i think i had like three weeks off no tournaments for a bit but i think we're still screaming practicing but i'll have a lot more time to to stream all the time for sure i almost had 700 000 followers on twitch i think we're almost at 200k on twitter too which is crazy so you guys are going absolutely insane on all platforms right now but yeah i
