Justin we're finishing our placements for today we currently have a data template so player our two games figure out what we're ranked at and maybe play one game I would have a rank or play net and every single video after this one will be in columns and it should be a lot of fun going for like team changes and stuff like that yeah we're good to go let's get into the games for today let's get some doves hopefully keep up 400 percent win streak let's see how it goes hi for the first game we're playing against the big fish and damn damn it's got a console player in a steam player so only guy that I can actually type in chat his big fish I know you guys for some reason like the reactions I don't know what are these folks some of you guys like the reactions let's eat here I'll look for a pass to Justin right off the bat try to hit it back to me but go straight in I'm not gonna be trying to shoot it back to me to be honest but either way looks nice I could've got a better higher pass to him there definitely could have been higher would have been nicer nice a good idea going for the the fast feet off on those oh my gosh the touch from him was actually insane duh I don't know how he got there see what he does justice on my right so I pass it to him off the wall no I play it back to Justin you could take it start something going forward oh my how did I just bought it that far forward but these guys are just full time defense is this the strat no dude he just dropped us sick I'll have a booty shot for that oh I might flip to you I'll try to hit it in same with with my stomach so I can get a flip back off of it and then use the flip to finish it off each other interfering with everything now oh my gosh the demos man they're making this so hard the double let's see it does I just want to get a feel for how they're playing to be honest I'm backboard scorable oh my cut way that in I'd have been so unlucky the straight in trying to read it off the backward but that's still nice all alone they just keep up all right that's one place we came down okay play one game in our rank we'll try to see what the games are like and whatever rank replays that I'm guessing minor plays diamond one if you win all our games here so let's get into the next and yeah we're playing plots already I think that's a plot to or plot one looks like plant one actually it's ready playing plots I think we played apply in the last video as well so I'm pretty sure we had replaced a round diamond if we wouldn't this game this is our last game I think I'm a column giddy IRA playing gator and insanity the chaos is so much slower that's one thing I noticed right away compared to high ranks takeoffs are so much slower I love the slope this slope assing plays back and for just around them every time [Music] that one that guy was actually gonna save that I think I hated around him those are the trollese goals but they look kind of funny and nice at the same time Justin oh dude I was like so close to getting that I felt through my bones that's fine that's gonna be behind me find he's faking it and that guy just free flip into almost a dribble there I'm gonna try to score a double bang oh my god dude what are these Guinea was it so quick play my game just froze Irie good that's why all right not bad at all let's see what our rank is I'm guessing diamond one I'm sick of a diamond one we definitely ought to play one or two more we got flat three placing that flat 3 flat 3 dip 3 all right we're close the diamond so let's tell you one or two more dipping out for pig oh let's get into [ __ ] kiss all right putting us Lobster and it's yep there's you guys are probably flat diamond ish I don't have MMR on that [ __ ] yeah oh no I was so close almost read it off the post at the boost it's a win-win I can't really pass this shut the bathroom bang close no dude what they're missing they're missing I don't know diamonds players diamond players missed that I like the third verse dribble like but you missed again why was this happening oh why am I doing this I don't know why I thought I heard I'm free jump I just banged it off the wall like a dummy nice I mean I guess it works the pre jump they're all ready for that you just be like straight across then went straight down see y'all chill carefully go Freddie Galvis go for a boost that's the game you may be it's the one I live for this no I shouldn't got a better pass down their home again after I miss that nice patience speed out the ball I said a right side oh dude that was gonna be the play I felt it I'm gonna be off the wall right back into me nice not as thin as I would like to be no why am I going so quick to the ball day I wasted all my boosting a stupid take off I'm not I'm not jay-z is it is it wait this will come into a goal somehow dude oh my god I'm just wasting all my boost too early then I have none to actually finish the shot when the ball changes shut up ensure with them that is the one this is a set of rare Giudice can't score why what's wrong with me I'll pop it backward oh my god that was good that was good this is stop okay that was actually good that'll actually it could have been better I could have hit a better pass off the backboard but still really good I gotta hit my shots man we gotta be one more game after this for redemption why am i trying to pinch it with him I can get the boost oh my god dude what's his past like how does it even get that past I went for my fart the little soft touches Joe definitely see the difference once we get into like champ ranks where you have to go for like those really quick passes to each other right now we don't really have to do that you can go like super slow no still work oh let's try it it's a hard angle to get them definitely doable I'm not freestyler e-enough did that yet I look for Justin E pinched nice I just leave it if I tried the picture with them for being honest to myself it probably goes off they're backward into our net oh my gosh did my passes are off for sure right now I don't know why gonna have like four more really cool goals if I could actually pass the ball No - I can't hit the ball shall we break up off that nobody didn't we we had to have gotten a div up for sure I think we gotta give up I don't I don't know why I didn't show us maybe we didn't get one we're playing against TST gamer and that boomer sooner all right I promise I will get all my passes at all my shots where they needs to be this game there we go all right started off much better Redemption game redemption game nice it was like so nice for some reason they're funny-looking but they look nice we're doing better we're doing better I gotta hit the ball this game I feel like I'll definitely do much better when we're calms these games are obviously just like hoping things work but in comms you can like actually calculate everything and be ready for everything it's gonna happen mud Jessica I don't have enough to see like I was ever gonna for her I got the urge to go for a double reset so let's try it we'll try one this time maybe unless like a pass I could pass so imma try it go for it oh my that's the worst when you're like so close like you're so damn close in the ball that does a little ghost it may be there for that I'll wait for Justin again to respond with Boosh I'll try to picture with them [Music] I can kill him we can get something here maybe I just don't want this stolen oh my god nope oh dude everything about that was so nice Justin Oh I doesn't one this long nice surely one of them's it ago and we had like ten shots in a row ten attempts I keep following that just in case because if he does hit off the backboard maybe I can follow it up check it this left forearm and go right Boosh it's fine to you close I probably sitting them one down so low their freestyle past back oh my god dude sure it's so mean everything about that sequence is just show me all right we get something here why wait why am i trying to pass I was like in between passing and shooting Oh it's not a get my car to get off at the pinch all right I can get rid of way off this dude this game has been something else that's the goal bang we're being so weird this game that was so funny there's like a 20 second period of just passing around them little clutch just hit them it around hopefully you can stay at the kickoff you I should have followed I missed I wish them a boost high 50 it'll do I got for the double I'm gonna try double homicide double when I get a chance do you guys these guys slow down enough and I have the ball I'll go for one all right Holly I'm a pass I guess I don't know what to do I see just enough I don't want them to just like have to watch me go for it that's too selfish no these outside I hid it in the home I'm such a weak double I found the pastorate day to the tip of this car yeah those are just he's selfish I feel like in the higher ranks he'll be fine because he kind of have to go for it oh dude why can't I hit that I literally felt like I was banging his one eye just go right by it bring down another Siegfried stop PTDS I know how to got a flip but I know how to flip somehow do it if I have more boobs one more I believe nice alright sure that we get diamond off that surely there's nobody we don't get down it off that run what 12 game win streak I think that's definitely last one of the day but let's see wait okay we both got diamond I was gonna say but yeah it's gonna be all for this one guys I hope you enjoyed have yourself
