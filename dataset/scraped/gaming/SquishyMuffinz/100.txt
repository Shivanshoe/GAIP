yo what's up guys so as you know the brand new season's here and i'm going for top five in every single game mode so i'm gonna be queueing all three game modes for today's video whatever we get we'll play let's get into i'm queuing both west and east servers right now because it's pretty late at night so hopefully we can find the game let's get into it let's see how it goes all right we got two game strapped about we got chew on our team and it's faded and exiled i gotta swear to game i'm actually not sure who chu is but i recognize the other two players so this is gonna be a hard game for sure challenge form here my conflict should be easy save drop my teammate put it to the corner well i thought it's the middle here if you can get it for me it's fine gotta be careful with that demo it might have been going for on me better play to the wall right to the opposite wall here maybe get this boost it's good huge booster for my teammate let's get that across there because i know they can't follow that touch up and somebody's always going to be good for my teammate to follow up that's why i like doing that touch the boost here i might have a shot i have to be careful remember the fake it's fine blocked high teeny head low behind me this challenge is early gotta be careful my teammate did commit to this but it should be okay i got to the ground here free ball for him to clear not bad just gotta wait it's fine i knew i could probably win that challenge it wasn't a bad one to try to go for i'm gonna fake this up put a fake again got the boost here that's huge try to fake now there we go i don't need to go for a far poster especially when i have like 30 boosts left i'm not going to waste the rest of my boost trying to get that touch over them when i could just try to go through him or under him right so i can use that 50 to my advantage there's a lot of like boostrab that we probably didn't have one that actually got a cycle over time try to challenge my teammate again just make him flick it and i can go back should be a teammate's ball now played into a spot where he can't get a good follow-up right away that's fine if he has to beat me there that's okay only gets dangerous now but the demo came through but we're good i had it blocked anyway i'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad situation though hopefully my teammate loses boost he did really good of him to do that and i have a perfect opportunity because he left me that boost right if he had taken that that would have been a play that could never happen right obviously i can't make that with zero boost so that's pretty much all of my teammate for leaving that boost for me well done from him been a little bit of a messy game honestly i could be doing better a couple mistakes here and there but we're getting the goals and we're capitalizing we need to so take that away from me so far even a few positional mistakes i think though play patient here for my teammates stuck in nets this is as far you don't want a full dive on this most time it's going to let you live in a really bad spot though that's unfortunate that i got spun out there kind of takes away what i can do that situation i'm going to single jump that way i have a good recovery time maybe bump him off this one as well so get my teammate the ball for three maybe a goal good try tough shot honestly they challenge that make him jump throws play away early i could also real challenge that like just full speed into it could work i just think it's a little bit less likely that it works out well for me good timing on the challenge might be a goal here it depends on my teammate can get it over him nicely done really good job so on twos we're actually about to be top 100 i think if we win this game so pretty good start the season i've only really tried to play two so far i haven't been playing a crazy amount i'm gonna try to start grounding it harder because i am going to try to reach those goals at the end of the season top five and everything let him flick this it's fine should be okay i shouldn't have an immediate follow-up should be fine for a second this might get a little bit dangerous now yeah cuz i was getting bumped and i i couldn't have a follow-up no problem i think my teammate must have gotten bumped as well i didn't see what happened but i feel like he probably could have been back if he didn't get bumped yeah there's no way i could have really recovered to it i was getting bumped on the goal line like that ah might actually be able to come back in this game they have a lot of time they have a minute 42 [Music] one of those leg touches on the goal line i had to right i touched it and it probably would have been saved but they didn't give it to me you may should have it gotta play this to the side get the boost i don't mind if he hits this my teammate should be okay and he's more than okay i know for sure if the guy hits that ball there not only do i get the boost from him which is good he's going to be low boost i made him waste resources on that but my team is going to get that touch and keep it in and then i'm going to be able to rotate middle and be ready for his pass right so i'll definitely take that i mean our goal there is absolutely best case scenario you obviously wasn't trying to do that maybe fast enough could save i didn't want to go to like all in that shot there i don't want to like full speed flip into that and everything commit my whole play to it so i saved a lot of views i saved 80 boosts on that gotta pass this middle off the wall there we go the threes play right there like the classic threes play that i always go for if i get that touch forward play it off the wall it's always a really good pass middle always very tough for the the defender or played from true he played really well the whole game all right against the next game though hopefully we can keep it up and get back to that dubs on the day but we did pretty good i'd say made some mistakes but we did pretty good let's see in the next one [Music] all right last thing we got fated against greenocks and drops two very good south american players see if we can end off on a good note here so there's a fake challenge drive up quick back off unfortunately he missed that but i can play patient should be able to get back it might be a goal still a little bit high it's gonna crossbar and down this would have been dangerous let's get that he may gotta touch on it there can i save my boost go for a quick shot kill one as well which is huge try to stay middle let's here that mess well done try to keep myself relevant in the play there i don't want to go all the way back better to try to stay in there you have to be more useful if i go all the way back for a boost straight away as soon as i'm empty this takes off what you can do with the ball right takes a lot of options out the way really good demo i was gonna try to delay the shot but i didn't have to as soon as i saw the demo i went for uh just a free goal obviously i was gonna fake the original shot but that works much better very good that man should i challenge my teammates should be behind me by the time i go we get a challenge not any boost here so i'll go back get some pads now let us stay in support though it's about to be back so always keep on look out for that is a really good good habit played around one with no boost should be okay here not the best touch i gotta wait back hold now good follow up there made up for the mistake should be a good situation for us i i jumped really bad on this better played around him that's actually not bad now i gotta take this boost as well it's actually really good turned out really well wow that turned out really well what the heck it almost looked intentional if i got the right um touch on that ball on the first jump i would have definitely been able to score i think at least so it would have been better i think to be able to score off that had to go for the a bump bit of wishful thinking there it was a tough bump to get so to go back post you can cover a lot more if you go back post why i went that way it looks like you're leaving so much of the net open but really you can react to anything like that nothing can really surprise you challenge form should be okay nice try to stay back your full boost way on the ceiling he gets beat it's fine do a full tank you pretty much deal with anything if you just play safe for the most part unless you just get dunked something like that that's one of the few things that i did save it right but if i have no teammate to help follow it up it's going to be a very very tough thing to stop and i have to kind of jump if i don't jump for that i'm going to get bumped here 50 is going to end up bad regardless so it's one of those situations that no matter if you have a full tank that's the only thing that you can't stop right you can't stop two things if you don't have a recovery off of it thought of forces flick shot challenge now it's a good fake try to take some pad then again i'm going to turn infield right away try to stay in the play he's annoying as possible don't let them get the ball out of their hat for free right another fake challenge there now's about back off and see making challenges for me wasn't the best challenge i gotta still play patient on this [Music] should be okay good job really good save from him you bump him a couple times maybe unfortunately he's gonna get that boost and maybe even the back boost which is bad all right we're good how to save my boost on this i don't want to waste it off i could beat him to the next touch maybe even beat him to this one as well i still have a little bit more boost in me so if you can save your boost for like multiple challenges like that that's huge too it's a massive massive skill to learn early on just saving your boost and not wasting it for stuff i think that's something that every pro can get better at still me included by far i can get better for sure with that you get a boost you want to use it right away right that's just like a habit that everyone kind of has i think again situation always comes up right you can go above but why go above when you still only have 30 boots remaining it'd be hard for you to get a good couple touches above them try to play it through i'm trying to play under the smarter play every single time touch this get up the wall oh my almost the perfect dump thing put under him wait backfall you should hit this to me so close i should've went for passive back honestly i normally do go fast back there i think it's the higher percentage play that's okay i don't want to go all in on this time it's not back yet it's going to be a tough thing to save but he played patient maybe a good chance at it let him hit to the side i missed my touch i wanted the light touch go for the ceiling shot it was such a weird hit from him what the heck 27 seconds left we should have this will most likely secure this way to cross here full boost i don't want to go for that though a little bit risky let him shoot this instead now we get saved did we get it there we go good play again good boost management to actually choose one to use a booster went the challenge it's okay to take that that like situation a little bit more passive there i don't think it's a bad thing at all if you believe in your one-being ability like when it comes to your defense obviously yeah good games for today guys hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and see us all in the next one i love y'all [Music] silence
