pouring into the video guys I'd like to quickly say again thank you so much for all the support on the previous video we got 6,000 brand-new subs on the release of the last video which is nuts if we keep up this rate guys we can reach 1 million subs easily before the end of the year so thank you so much for making this a possibility for me you guys are incredible if you guys aren't subscribed right now and you guys are watching this and you're not subscribed please go down right now press the subscribe button and press the bell and turn notifications Joey is notified when I upload a new video let's get into the video I love y'all peach you know what is up guys so we're back with some more wrote to grand champ games in the previous we finished up at 658 MMR we are still playing bronze players I believe not exactly sure when silver MMR starts still but we'll get into it and we'll try to keep up with whatever the reich's doing we're gonna stay grounded I'm gonna try to play smart and we'll just play around what they're doing and try to make them make mistakes so that's the whole goal of the video really yeah let's get into the games all right so we're playing somebody with 19 MMR something with 285 anymore and our teammate has 311 and we have a ps4 player it looks like on our team so we'll see how this goes also guys I didn't mention the previous video but everything that I mentioned in terms of like boost management's in terms of just hitting the ball hard or certain mechanics that I mentioned throughout this whole series I had tutorials for all that stuff on my channel I've talked about it all at least one point during my my YouTube channels existence so if you have any questions in terms of like how to manage your boost I just made a video on that if you have any questions on how to hit like power shots I made a video on that like three years ago so there's literally tutorials for everything I've made on my channel look over the time so if you have any any questions that I can't specifically answer throughout these videos there's probably a video for it yeah pretty much keeping up with the main thing that we were trying to do the last video which just put the ball in awkward spots our teammate already seems to be slightly better than the last video I'm gonna pop this up should I just finish this off it's really awkward for that guy I'm gonna try to get my teammate as many goals as possible I'm gonna try to let my teammate score most of the goals this game auto shutter center it for him as much as possible we'll use the corner I'll show you guys how effective the corner plays are in early ranks but even it still remains the thing throughout high ranks as well you can still use that corner to your advantage but it's just more advanced what you're doing with it like it would get a double touch off the corner and that'll be much better my team is going on the wall well done I got a ground pinched on no boost what dude okay we're playing a little bit better than the bronze level right now I think but again we haven't use much boost for staying grounded so this is all things that you guys can do I'm not doing anything out of the realm of possibility of what a bronze can do so trust me if you could just practice here your ground bangers you think I'm gonna go on the wall for this bronze probably wouldn't go up there some way for it to bounce down and even then we don't need to panic cuz I remember everybody else is also bad alongside of us I can't be dribbling this I'm gonna hit it off the corner for my teammate I'm in at this middle in a second so I look for my teammate is all the way back so I'm not gonna go for the hit middle for no reason it's fine baited a touch nice hit oh I went up the wall okay you went up the wall too it's fun reasonable I can't go for that there hit this forward let it bounce middle and be awkward for them do you at the free goal Oh close then problem gigolo the challenge again people can't really flick you - well this ranks up you don't really have to worry about the possibility of a flick going over yet I say just go from where the ball is not gonna jump for this let him panic and there we go free goal the ball bounces awkwardly for you like that there there's no reason to try to jump with this ball and go for this unless you're playing a really good play for your grand champ high grand champ I would jump for that every time and go for the double tap cuz that guy's on the ground is gonna read that every single time but if I'm in this ring someone's gonna miss that they're gonna jump too quick they're gonna pay me for it no one can Ariel consistently quite yet so let them panic and then just clean it up I'm pretty sure the same kind of stuff will be said up until we get to about like Platte then people mechanically start getting bedding I gotta throw in some lifts every now and then oh you're really blending on the way for real quick I can't even with my brain doesn't let me with the ball by accident on purpose I mean I'm gonna miss this on purpose I really legit alright just gonna toss this off the wall you know I have an empty net so you could just try to shoot that ball but let's see what they do instead there we go I just toss it into a corner there just tossed about them I made it their problem here take this and this is what he does my teammate has a wide open goal so again I have an open net but you don't have to be good enough to take that shot on the opening all you got to do is thrown on their side wait for the mistake I generally wonder if this kind of gameplay is entertaining for you guys I bought these first videos which is not gonna be fun to watch me get my passes maybe okay it's fine so he's playing the corner strat I'm just gonna bump him I can't jump for that ball I can't you're an airline I'll good enough I'm only bronze but I can't bump the guy I'm stealing this something good thing to start learning early on as well if you start getting yourself into good habits early on even if you can't pull off the mechanics yet if you have a good mindset and what you should be doing like that's gonna get you so far like it's crazy how important just like repeating the same steps over never again if the balls in a certain position okay I'm not gonna go for that I'm just gonna go back wait for their touch here all right now you messed it up it's kind of my turn to go mighty me turn so no way I'm just kind of getting myself used to these these same three things even though this match is not what I'm used to you can still kind of follow the same the same rules they're gonna make mistakes and they leave even more wide open Nets all I did right there was wait I waited for them the Panda turn hit the ball away to me eventually the same thing we're also applying grand chance they have to control the ball let them throw it away to you let them give you the ball to the point where you have space and you can create a play that's the whole point of waiting is so that you can take control of the play after they give it to you yeah good first game of the video we got drift queen drift queen tag you're trying to party up on me this guy is silver so silver is 300mm our so we're ready above silver I think we're really way about was silver army I think we might already be in gold we just got 31 points from that that leaves us at 690 right now so we can get into our fourth game right now I think we're ready at least at the back end of silver maybe even getting close to gold so let's get the next one Steven keep it up I'm not gonna queue with them because the whole point of this road the grand champ is to be so lurking the entire time but yeah Juggalo GG bro and Congrats little silver do so everyone looks like he's freshly promoted into silver one I think that's pretty fresh I think 300 MMR might be silver one so congrats to you Juggalo but yeah let's see if we can keep up the W so before we get into the next game guys I have a quick announcement we'll be having a 24 hour stream this Thursday January 16 should be one day after this video is released at 9 p.m. est for 24 hours straight the twitch channel link will be down below in the description that's also on the screen hope to see you guys there enjoy the rest of the video alright so we read this over now we're well into silver an hour three ninety four three two five or 357 these are all above silver players now so we're getting into sober rank already this is quick we could ready tell the speed has improved I could already tell just off that guy's touchdown you go just throw it on home she did that so look at this they already boom in the Baltimore so now we can kind of do more be more freedom to do more they're already playing faster so we got to play faster he's in touch right but again the same thing will apply I could just kind of wait hit it around one for free just bang it home thank you thank you so they just down to baiting dip in these early ranks you don't need to do anything special hit your bangers bait them in hitter to random it's all gonna be doing this game played around the corners the corners probably still worked pretty well as well Nobu she's gonna try to bang it on home alright we accidentally scored that honestly I didn't want to go in and want to go out and backward but that's fine we'll take it I guess I just don't want to score too many goals I want my tip my teammate to be able to play as well like I said I don't want to just unfairly carry every game I'm trying my best not to but a lot of times most Americans in these certain situations and I just boom it I'm not gonna go for this I'm just gonna wait for it to bounce down I'll play it off the corner now let's see what they do I see if they go up the wall yet they can't go up the wall quite yet so that's a good thing to know it off the corner for my teammate again he's pretty awkward team it should have been there but he's behind me for some reason I don't know how he got into the corner behind me put us off the backboard let's see what they do it's very awkward they're both gonna miss so my teammate can get this nice trying a shot I'm gonna wait here touch that there and I'll just tap it middle let's see what happens again alright a lot of panic they both went can I have this one play it around him it's over one you're gonna have that first I'll wait take out one of them team is gonna be on my left - I know that so I shall do use him okay you went back people don't position for passes obviously in these ranks I don't know why I'm trying to pass already we should probably wait a little longer before that nice hit off the wall that's my teammate gonna go for this I'll fake first suited does a bit of panic I can play this middle that was good of him not to panic but I think it also might be a lot of good game sense and a lack of awareness that I could shoot that ball my plays off the corner here even I could shoot a suti does David hasn't been in a very good position there's been a lot of scorable shots here you're gonna see the lack of reading the play yeah all that I'm good for that it's fine plays back I shouldn't be up the wall I don't know how to do that yet yeah it's 50 Amir I got for another 52 he does okay they both miss alright I was just trying to fit the visit them and they missed twice and then the third one actually eventually hit not supposed to be a fifty this is a fifty yeah nothing special I don't guys I haven't Airy old for a single ball yet got this whole series already have an aerial once yet outside of like me trolling and going for like a double tab once the games already like eleven zero it's only time I have I play this off the wall I shouldn't mine you went for it away so I'll kill me I can't go for the ball I'm not gonna to go for the ball yeah let me just bump the guy the only threat why not gonna carry on for this yet so let me t me go ok trying to air you I like it I'm gonna pretend like an aerial for sick 15 teammate should go for this I'm gonna wait middle first such a shot actually ok I waited now I can play off what happened play it around up now it's a pretty girl for my teammate if he's here and he is nice to them nice so again my teammate had a chance to past me he didn't use me but he used a shot and then I'm just gonna sit myself middle because regardless if he passes I can shoot if he shoots it and they get a bad touch I can play off of it I have full boost midfield I have all the advantage in that play there I can react better to their touch and they can react to me being there that's who he does actually really good shot ok you could already tell like the quality of play is getting so much better this is very interesting to see actually like this a lot I mean that was bad that was really bad aerial but it's fine because he tried to go for it now you didn't even see bronzes trying to go for the area to see much you're seeing the silvers trying to at least go for that which is good that's the only way you can get better is trying and that's why I think three plays is a super underrated skill when you're first start can't go for this on the wall I'm let it bounce down to me okay I don't know how to dribble yeah I don't know I'm dribbling but fine okay good shot to be there but again I did a little too much there I'm getting kind of a no no to myself that I'm doing more than I think I should be doing for this ring but I can't get myself to not do it it's a really hard in between I'm trying to reach you that's gonna be easier since we're gonna start playing better and better players but this is silver already then you could tell it's gotten a little bit better than bronze let me know what's over from them mr can't go for that cuz on the wall let me wait first touch here and if he doesn't touch him my teammate is a free to go anyway it's fine I'll pop this middle let's see what they do nice save stay on this ball again like a silver wouldn't have probably mechanics to be able to to do that as quickly as I did do it but the whole point is I didn't do anything special I just hit it off the wall once light touch light touch an angle like you don't need to do anything at all that's special it's very simple to play it these these early ranks like I said don't even play ranked that's how you played at least a good like 10 hours total of free play I would say don't even if you just got this game like yesterday for example don't play any ranked don't put in your right ear literally just stick to free play I'll tell you can get a grasp of how your you're drifting works and bind your controls are something that you find comfortable that's a very important thing as well didn't want to go for a crazy area there but there's something that maybe a silver could try to go for simple double jump nice finish from gesture 402 yeah just split time free play when I first got this game my internet was so bad that I couldn't even play right so I spent probably the my first hundred hours in free play and that was the most useful thing to me I ranked up so quick and I was doing things like nobody in the lower ranks was doing because I played so much free play to start it gave me such an advantage and that that's the biggest biggest takeaway that I can give you guys out of playing against bronzes of the current time and Silver's of the current time just play free play min it's all you need really just get it get a grasp of how to control your car and you're good to go you need a very basic understanding of just how to boom the ball and just had a pre position for their touches that's all you need and you can easily get yourself into lease platinum and then once you reach apply them I think you gotta start worrying about your mechanics a little bit more well we'll see when we get there because I think we're getting closer and closer to two golden now if not already in gold I'm not hundred percent sure we'll see once you play against a gold and we'll know they're MMR but we just got 31 more MMR we went from 690 to 721 like I said I want to I want to show you guys every single game that I play in this series that way you guys come along with me throughout the entire journey and you can kind of see what it's like playing each rank and how I'm not doing too much but I can still get around each of these ranks like you could tell I'm not I'm not doing anywhere near what normally you when I'm playing in pro players or other grand champs but it still it still works because this rank they just don't know how to how to position properly and that's a huge thing that's just this massive knowing had a position and where to be um but yeah our teammates still aren't ready for passes that's something that's kind of tough to deal with because you probably don't have anyone ready for passes until you're about camp one I'm gonna I'm gonna guess I don't think anyone's really pre positioning middle and diamond yet we'll see like I said guys I don't know yet I haven't played any of these ranks in a long time but from what I remember no one was even close to ready for passes until you were like close to grand champ back when I did Rhodri grand champ before so well we'll see how it goes but I'm having fun with the series so far it's very interesting seeing the difference between bronze and silver already I think we're still in the backend of silver if not the very early early parts of gold but we have four to ten matches done I'm gonna get matches five and six done next video thank you guys for all the support that you guys have been absolutely insane we're gaining like 2 to 3 K subs a day which is just ridiculous at this rate we'll reach a million subs by end of the year or a little bit before that about I think September if we continue this rate so thank you guys for all the brand-new subs I appreciate y'all thank you guys for the incredible support as always and I hope you guys are loving the series and if there's anything you want to see me change or do better or do differently let me know if there's any video ideas you guys would like to see me do down below also let me know there I always read the comments even though I can't get around to everything one of you guys yeah much love like home subscribe peace you
