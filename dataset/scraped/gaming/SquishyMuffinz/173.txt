yo what's up guys gonna be going for the number one spot today on the leaderboard playing with justin and musty and before we get into the video i just wanted to say there's 59.2 percent of you guys that watch my videos every single day that are not subscribed to their channel so if you want those people and you do happen to end up enjoying this video please consider hitting the subscribe button it's completely free and helps me out a bunch let's get into the games today though hopefully we can get some dubs hopefully we can get some good plays going yeah it's always going to be fun with dressing up let's get into it we're playing against different people we're playing faded kef and x i do recognize all these players they're all solid so you know you can expect a solid game out of this about right mid boost good touch from musty is not bad at all i can't really shoot off that so i can just wait trying to make them panic get the ball into a good position for musty musty to the right side maybe he doesn't have enough boost to get it to me but it's fine staying around midfield here with 100 that way if something does fit the out i could get a touch on it cover the dangerous mid position oh my gosh what a touchdown justin how did he win that how did he win the second ball as well like what i thought that was gonna be a super dangerous spot to be in and he actually got out of it good demo from us wait for his touch here one more maybe couldn't quite get it but it's fun better played in a safe way he's gonna be there for that i could just wait for the bounce good challenge for me i'm gonna go straight to justin though not a bad situation at all he's gonna be able to beat one i can kill one which leaves it in a 1v1 situation most likely should be fine if he hits that control for my team to get back played over one guy i have enough boost to play the second but it's fine it's gonna give time for my team to get back at least try to get behind on some pads here play from justin almost a shot touch from musty i pop this up for my team i thought someone would have been a little bit closer but it's fun yeah massive didn't have boost going back i think all good though that's something that you have to kind of make an assumption in that situation that your team's gonna be there which obviously might not be the right thing to do sometimes try to get some kills so my team can make a play going forward not a bad spot to get some demos in to be honest nice from justin good turn good beat as well pass over all of them very good slow shot from musty that's the right idea for sure there you have time to take a shot you know one guy is coming back but he's in an awkward position right so take your time get the backflip shot instead of going for just a quick shot that might go straight in now these goals in these last two games those last three games i should say haven't been the craziest they haven't been the best and this gameplay in general is obviously a little bit weird because it is ranked right that's how ranks can be just feels weird people go for stuff they don't normally go for but the main idea is you're always trying to play for your team in a 3v3 situation right it's the main thing you should always be trying to do always get balls around your opponents that are going to be better for your team always try to go for a demo or a 50 that's going to be better for your team don't play selfishly don't play for yourself because that's not how you're going to win games we're doing a good job of working together and going for challenges that benefit all of us right like for justin's touch here should have one more put over one almost got the fake trying to stay at the ball maybe i was able to stay with that maybe is it gonna go out of it but didn't work out i thought trusty on this one i tried to get the 50 mid there it didn't work out exactly how i wanted it to because they got a good block on it and no one was ready to follow up the immediate 50. i thought maybe if that ball 50's off the wall someone's ready to bang it forward didn't exactly pan out that way though a little bit unfortunately i'd say let's take one play it off the walls can be around two of them i go straight to justin adjusting to make a play middle musty's waiting middle here so i know something might potentially come with this i should wait in a position where i can kind of react to whatever it is it's a good flick from them probably should have just baited i wasn't fully in a safe position yet that's a good play from justin forward wait left side here if he wants to use me got bumped that's actually really good bump smart bump from them also should have good play remember from them actually really smart demo if his teammates had played that perfectly that's gonna be a goal for them right so that's actually really hopefully justin brought me back to i don't think he could have avoided it though he ended up just falling into that position let's go for a bump here force two to jump this is huge really good position for us to be in not what i wanted on the touch but it's fun muscle can keep it in it's all about just keeping your rotation at the same pace right you don't want to be resting faster than your teammates also might want to be rotating slower though you want to be in a position where you can kind of help them out no matter where you are wait back post here play it over to justin's side i might touch the mic that beats two of them i'm gonna be there for that though try to play it to musty's corner back there gonna give him space on the wall with the ball and he has boost as well shouldn't be bad for us at the very worst is what happened right there it's just a 50. i'll let's get play from them almost let me get the shot there somebody get popped to myself and almost got a shot out of it yeah i played from them gonna win the boost here i should just try to go again here it doesn't need to be anything crazy it just creates some pressure at least i can rotate out get this boost hopefully gotta put a little bit patient here [Music] which i played in a way that is follow-up able for my teammates off the wall is a good spot to do that there because it's gonna be awkward for them a little bit unfortunate just 50 straight back into our side muscle to get the touch you wanted as well so it makes it a little bit more awkward it should be fine here follow that up well close can't really do much here hopefully mostly wins this challenge that's huge my back wall in a position that if anything comes up here i'm there already pre-positioned up there right you're covering every angle in that situation it's a pretty good spot to be in justin should have this trying to wait back in the spot where i have a good boost going for a lot more demos now it seems which is fine i'm not really the next person up in this situation so i don't mind getting demoed in a lot of them my right side just wants to use me nice to play good work to end that game off of a solid goal a lot of these games are like very close they're very intense but everyone we're playing against is really high level obviously we're on a super high part of leaderboards so every game is going to be super sweaty right you have to expect the games to be sweaty when you're designing the leaderboards but yeah good wins again let's get into the next game in the last game of the video let's see if you can end on four dubs in a row here playing that first european team that we played last video they gave us two very sweaty games so we'll see if we can end on four wins in a row here unless you're already low boost that's usual off the kickoff there so you gotta be obviously playing in a very passive supportive position that's what justin was doing he wasn't pushing out middle because he knows how could musty possibly get this ball's middle from there he can't so he's playing behind him with full boost that way if that ball just rolls out to him he's there if he goes even further back than that i'm behind and he knows that you gotta be able to trust your teammate that's third man that's in support to be there when you need them to right so justin was doing that he's playing close in a position where even if the 50 goes really badly he knows it's fine i'll be back regardless hit around one can't get a block but it forces out the ball for my team so it's fine pop this up for musty he's gonna have that but it's okay i don't mind we go for a bump potentially really the catch from justin there was smart and we gotta go out of it so well done this is just getting goals out of thin air the half flip to catch that there was really good scale the left mid here right behind full boost that's gonna be up for this good read gotta place it behind them there we go good job from justin there again the common theme is just pooping on them pre-jumping everything playing really well as always musk is playing solid too gotta give him credit he's keeping up really well unless he's getting better and better every time i play with him it feels like he keeps on improving which is really good i'm gonna be there for this i'm gonna rotate behind justin i think it's better i think he wants me to go so i'll hit it around wait for musty i'll be behind me there we go i was better positioning because we had full boost in a position where even if that does go extremely wrong go straight back to justin regardless who's behind me there and if it goes well we get to go out of it so it's a win-win there is no losing there you win the ball or you you get a goal right you win the possession game no matter what channel should i see i'm already going to the wall here if it gets around me it's honestly fine i don't mind that at all it's a little bit awkward now that musty had a little touch on that i don't think justin's ready but one of them beat two of them off that the third guy is just waiting waiting patiently which is smart and normally what the third guy would do in a situation because his two teammates just got beat to the ball see a bump to go for or not i'd say that's a really good bump to go for just because force the situation to be really awkward right preposition for justice touch here on the right side unless he has an awkward spot now to be in yeah justin's not shouldn't get exactly where i thought it would so i ended up bouncing out very favorably for the opponent but that's not on justin that's on me to realize that the ball is probably not going to go into a good position and musty which is left in a really awkward spot off of that he has the turn it's fine good pressure from underneath this ball now better for musty i could turn on this one fine if he hits that again because like free safe for justin and on top of that he gets to follow it up wins another 50. and in the end we win that exchange right because i still have possession here going to get a block yeah he just got caught out that's an issue that a lot of people have i'd say even a lot of pro players i'll take a habit that's hard to break out of you expect your teammate to win the 50 right so you move out early and because of that it goes terribly wrong and you get nothing out of it justin's waiting right well let him go for this ball so yeah don't what i was trying to say is don't pre-position for 50 that you're not sure is going to be one because in a scenario like that it could go as terribly wrong as it did right he thought his teammate was going to win it and because he didn't all i had to do is just pre-flip and empty that because he expected his teammate twins not only did i win that 150 i pretty much won past two players because he pushed out don't join in on your teammate's mistake and you know start moving out too early let it just get by one player don't make it two by like pre-positioning expecting the best right it's the best way to explain that i'd say put round one to justin he's gonna touch it over one more that's gonna make it really awkward and wow that is an old goal and a half what the heck i play for myself to find justin there and good shot from justin to finish it off and what a normal goal that is holy all right good set of games again let's go take a look at the leaderboards where that leaves us off at that's going to be all you'll see out of this squadron on my channel you can watch some more of these games over on musty's channel um he's going to be uploading i think threes till i lose with us two
