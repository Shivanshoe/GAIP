be running some games today with my teammate G from NRG should be some good games let's get into it guys alright for the president planning its Biggs who's actually Moses sure a lot of you guys know him Moses is quite popular with Susan Rizzo I believe I'm gonna wait for a second touch playing Moses and 0 Mays foods a I'll actually thought it touched up who's a ps4 player I control this I got my that's fine he plays a lot of ones this guy's always played one he's actually around way back when me and Justin were still impious for these are ones player back then so it was a shot all along this guy's been playing for I recognize his name try to do something cheeky didn't quite work but for is that some boosting Gary got a free shot out of it so we'll take it I'll try to get this I think Garrett goes right side he goes left I think so I'm gonna try to get a left side look at that I lost it kind of expected against a player who's really good at once cuz they'll have a good kickoff not a bad thing to lose those kickoff in twos I feel like your teammate will be back and you can get a free possession out of it so it's not bad at all I thought this up once get it over the first guy second I get two that's fine because I wasted two of their boosts to their boots are almost fully used now so it's perfect really a touch back there from gay oh I miss my scoop my scooper chipping I go for me probably top corner oh I passed it to Gary I don't wanna go for another shot that's the better play just keep it in nice good job get there to get the goal pop it over the first use this time right got a nice little double tap top corner there yeah buying buying money right in the corner so we like to see really hard from to stop that let's get pretty jumped it to be honest only way you can really get around to step on that nice fella gonna get for this try to beat him those need to be a shot or anything it just to keep it in try to go for left mid boost here I missed it kind of crazy around 11,000 hours in this game and I still miss boosts that I've been there for 11,000 hours it's kind of funny where you think about it that's fine Shunta Batum in not in No hit the post is a good play not good enough because I miss let me go back quick I got the pads as well nice yeah I can get that Oh quick it's gonna be into it it's fine he jumped a lot later that thought he would to be honest I should return for the ball to be honest Billy the flakes so much I have to watch out for the bump attempt a for Moses kind of made the situation a lot more difficult to deal with the smart bump or a tenth of a bump of this be my life much harder on defense a there we go hey pass him get your quick pass transition tubule most kind of speedy speedy I gotta go for I'm gonna hit it it's fine we had a free ball if he does he's still gonna win that nice hit finish I was almost able to double that would have been a kind of nutty angle to be honest I was able to get it but it was tough definitely tough I'll see you guys for the massive massive support a bit short on the chain one it's kind of crazy we're only a couple thousand subs now off 800 K I'll be doing another controller giveaway over on Twitter or Instagram I haven't decided yet but huge thank you to you guys true for being insane as always I appreciate it show read holy that's all you guys tell me in the comments you've been here since like 2013 that's kind of crazy to think about as well thank you for the never any supports here so you guys are incredible I appreciate y'all more than you know honestly you guys haven't supported me crazily throughout the whole energy move as well I can't thank you guys enough for that they were mad even on the scoreboard right now this is a tough game as well so we're doing really well playing super solid gotta wait for the bouncy effort to bounce down I wanted to really force anything if control the ball put it around on the gear nice touch might be able to shoot close uh stuff you're gonna be on the wall saw wait gonna force the touch I'm gonna bait him again my bad I realized air was so close there's little fake jumps if you're right behind the ball like that I'm making make people you know make the challenge with a little bigger than they normally would which is what you want if you're playing passing on defense like that oh I must nail them Sullivan so speedy if I hit him down I don't say I'm gonna set up myself for missing that but it's a good first game it was super clean got ourselves some good goals here and there the passing plays as well good transitions downfield and almost both drop mm we see there's pretty nuts but yeah it's against the next games even keep it up like a leg up all right so last year played against turbo and funda all right to be a tough one most likely but let's see you can do not unwinnable block them that's from yeah thunders gonna have on the wall for sure good turn nobody's gonna be there better just go again the way I can get one more as well he'll be a block got a bit left i'll be back behind gay should be too bad good touch from turbo to follow up this wall say there was gonna be me such sweet it's fine a little bit unlucky no you got killed over the time killings a big miss from to about nice expecting to miss that you can go alone probably for a bit double action this way for this nice i just wait for his touch back it's on the back wall shall I give them back good shock and get see you kill the temple no Shah is trying to catch them out if he goes for pretty jump there's a good idea I know they're super good these days people tend to pre jump a lot a lot more to people used to you for sure got in good try isurugi riga patients I believe here it's a one-on-one I've seen gear score these good try don't touch it I'll go behind guarantee it's probably better for double there we go there's the placement been playing pretty good we have had a lot of opportunities and first half at the game can't complain surprise you what could definitely beat into that fight went over there good safe from Gary I'm sure this right away would have been ago for us he's gonna say that in hindsight I guess he doesn't expect people to do certain things and that's why it works so I'll wait for get to your behind got some time for him fastback a 200 IQ passed back they never expect it never been seen before well if I could got to kill on terror they would have been huge could probably got us a goal on us on the counter Oh kind of faked them you get it done to get a from turbo let's find that no danger in a touch bar down skis there we go did get his 5c totally scary to me this game thought you're gonna do good he offers just slightly behind me that's my fault I should have heated a little bit a little bit slower Oh that'll do look at 50 yeah I can have that I'll just go back I'll be safer so it's two of them you get back right do-nothing wants to go in for me man I'm curse the scheme all right the pass back I'm just gonna wait that's fine guy should have this over one nice picture from Garrett holding yeah I just fully trust him to get that touch you've been doing really good this Kim on defense uh no reason not to trust in there it's always super consistent on the back wall it's fine speed about the touch so Rosen abuse going back now shouldn't be any danger in this really all you really do is try to put this middle quick and I won't really do much because turbos no booster to follow it so should be game here we go all right GG's hope you guys enjoyed the game today I could look better than that one Begay Garrett carried me yeah Mia means backpack so I'll take it a dubs a dub and we hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night or ten minutes in your wash
