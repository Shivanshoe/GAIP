Road to grand champ randomizer edition in the previous when we finished out at champion - division sister almost up the champ 3 already which is nuts getting closer and closer to grand champ hopefully today we can get some more wins hopefully we can stay undefeated to keep on when shake alive but real quick let's get into our random car of the day we're gonna get octane or Dominus please paladin alright rules are rules I mean I'm not a fan of the car but I'm not gonna cheat rules a rule let's uh let's get into our settings if you guys have been watching this series you know that one of my viewers made this beautiful program to make this a whole lot easier all I got to do is press the randomizer button and it gives me my camera settings for the video so let's do it and we got 64 fov oh no dude no - whoo this is the one that we lose that thing this has got to be the video that we lose man this is gonna be so hard to use 64 fov 341 distance zero angle zero point two stiffness eight swivel speed 1.9 transition these are next gonna be breaking I'm gonna be super close to the car actually I don't know this is ever be able to balance each other out it's gonna be hard let's see let's get into it though let's figure out what our settings look like so these are the settings for today's video have them all input it let's see what it looks like in free play real quick oh no I'm not ready for this oh no actually you know what I will take these I could see my car not terrible it's bad it's definitely bad don't get me wrong but not terrible I think it's the angle that makes it's okay not completely unplayable to be honest so we'll get into the games hopefully we don't play anyone that's just absolutely god-tier so we have a chance but let's get into this and hopefully keep our streak alive let's go that was a finding the game for some reason you see so I had to he goes first so it's might be a little bit laggy because of that hopefully it's still watchable though it doesn't look too ugly aren't they gonna be too bad playing it's a Dominus player man these settings are terrible holy please don't be absolute God okay he looks pretty good I'm scared a lot of you I'm scared all right we gotta play smart we gotta just cap a lot of these mistakes I would have loved it that wooden well take everything we can get dude oh he spawns right there why oh no dude we should have with the ball I can't tell where the ball is dude these settings feel so trippy it's so trippy man so hard I believe in myself though all you need to do is believe don't go for the ball dude why leave me alone thought that was gonna be the one just take a swing away here oh you just go to the ball shine a swing for a power shot there [ __ ] went couldn't quite get the kill but got the bump at least oh yeah another boom we take those I didn't know I was bumping of the second time dude oh my gosh how he kind of just flipped away to be honest I barely bumped him but it was enough to mess him up with him let's get the booze quick all right we control this get the boost you got to back off now we have the control in the situation and you went quick cutting in the way ball overboost always a situation you never want to give for that beast and risk giving up a dumb goal obviously no beef stir forcing the jump which is good go for your shot now there we go good job to capitalize on that mistake we forced the mistake by flicking hi they're forcing the waist is Boost buddy just faking it to be honest I think you're a wig - ego could be a goal against this still in the corner there we definitely take that spawn no questions asked I'm gonna just fake challenges I shouldn't mind going balls on the floor in my hand if the balls on the floor it's like my green light to go for that ball so you can't do much with it at that point the dome goal there we go I swear that always happens I had a feeling you don't go a few more further killing me the ball is in front of you there so if you follow through with the demo it's mentally gonna hit the ball into something that is well it's kind of hard to get on that position to be honest let it go for a good 50 here one where I'm not a super dangerous position out of it it's fine we're still we're still another cave spot here on everyone so hard to have a good view of what's happening hey when you're that close to the ball - it feels like everything's like in a different spot that it actually is so hard to explain you guys just gotta try the setting except using have AG understanding of what I mean every time already I always spawns in the best spot if you spawn the other side they're probably to go out of that oh I missed oh no playing it back yeah by absolutely just 5 5 sub almost all times in this video definitely on the settings cuz I can't see [ __ ] it's so hard man oh gosh I'm playing this to the side again still at the biscuit roll I think I don't think he has much aired revolt oh good save 30 minutes I think he did missed again I'm 100% to that yes 100% we take those dude we need those all right I'm gonna fake you off again one more time if you read it I'm not gonna go for any more all right I shot that beat he might want to get bumped I didn't think I had enough time to go for the shot all I really need to do was hit it over him daddy Flynn he's gonna flip in at the ball there we go got a nice you got a nice bit of security at least a little bit of a buffer last 50 seconds not much of a buffer but it is a buffer hey missed you just left he gave up all right 21 points out of that he should've probably scored two of those couples that he missed every play someone who's hitting their shots gonna be a lot tougher to win but well we'll take that and probably take a division up as well yeah we got one up to d3 so definitely take that two more divisions till champ three not too bad at all maybe we'll hit it by into this video we got early for for there so probably like two more and yeah scan to the next one Steven keep it up and I have a feeling to play against an absolute legend this next game and it's gonna be super hard to win but we'll give it a roll see they keep up the win let's go are playing against someone named foreign tragedy he's a console player you know he's about to be absolutely nuts everyone's he's got C's 11 grand champs Eidolon it's been a grand champ before all right game ahead of us for sure he's already hitting this with the flicks she might first touch here I'm in control this ball maybe a shot could be fast enough there we go yeah right off the gate you hit us with a really solid flick so we gotta watch out for that for sure here's the ability to hit some some banger flicks a challenge can't get the shot straight out of it he messes up too so have to go back for the corner or mid big subscript for the corner as well so he can get either the mid or the corner there that's the whole point I'm gonna go some my corner probably or not so still in this rank I believe this guy's probably legitimate cc2 and once he's not going for booty stills is ready to be going for you can tell still a lack of like knowledge at the game like to that extent like not going for enough [ __ ] stills is a pretty pretty big giveaway you're not like super high level yet as in ones you want to have a boost control on almost all times you want to be in a position where like you have full control over the ball and you have full control over every boosted they'll have to go to next I'm gonna try to read the play like a little bit ahead of where it actually is that makes sense yeah this guy's got a super solid kick up as well this is hard man this is gonna be a struggle and a half I can already tell the thing is this series could legitimately go on forever like actually you can go on for a heifer to eat it depends on what settings we keep getting cuz like okay play about studies like this it's honestly so difficult I saw an idea in the comment section that like if I'm losing to a high ranked player on bad settings I could switch in the last like two minutes of the game or last two minutes every seconds I could switch to like normal settings and see if I could beat them but I don't know if I wanna do that cuz the whole point of the game is to like no point of this series is to you know try to beat these players on bad settings but it's so hard cuz this dude is like super sweaty man like you get to plays once all the time just based off the flicks and how he's reading every single fake you go I don't want to go for the Ofsted feel like I'll lose every time such a hard in between not I want to go against the whole idea of the series so we'll see if we can come back here this guy's saw it for sure it's gonna be very difficult it could definitely be the first L of this series it's just so tough man but we're not someone who gives up we can come back I believe let me guess he's spawning the perverse I didn't for once hope he messes it up she's played too passive Ben he's not gonna make the mistakes that we needed to make we got to create the mistakes three goals 3 goals we got to bring it back I believe man so I gotta half the game laughs anything could happen to half the game it's an eternity you got to go for this boost yeah I had a feeling out happy oh man of course you run it to the ones main bro the stick console ones me for gold I believe I believe I have not given up I'll never give up alright never mind this is it possible should I cheat sad cheating good normal camera settings I don't know I don't want to lose the streak bed I believe I believe I believe I can't cheat dude I can't do it I'm set out on a journey to win to reach grand champ with settings as bad as these and it's not impossible I can't be done I would put on this earth to prove it two minutes left four goals oh no dude this is impossible though this is actually impossible these settings make everything just impossible it's not doable dude okay I honestly like I love this series idea like I think it's a good idea but there's no way I'm beating high-level players and say hey with settings like the ones I have that was a champ three how we gonna be the champ three someone who was a great champion there's no way there's no way dude there's no way I waited a game ever does our first loss our first loss is so sad so so so sad alright guys we did finally lose our first game with the random camera settings I told you guys it was gonna happen once we get into the higher ranks it's way too hard to play against players who were just super experienced with settings where you have no idea what's happening on the field really you don't have good field of view of where the ball is where the ball is gonna go where they are where they're gonna go if they're gonna bump you where the balls going to go next like it's so hard to tell what settings like this and you can't really keep up with high level players honestly this is every settings are reported because you can't have settings that are as bad as this you're not gonna be able to keep up with high level players by any means we're probably not gonna be a great shape with random place to be on us that was a champ to be player we just played against but like if we had 110 lb for example you probably beat that guy but on 64 fov or low fov you just simply can't play the game so it just comes down to a luck factor or whether or not you get good settings and I've seen the comments you guys seem to not really like the games where my my camera is just super screwed up like super close and it gives you a headache and stuff like that it gives me a dang playing with it so I decided you know what let's just carry out the rest of this rather grand [ __ ] but won't be one let's reach grand champ and I'm gonna give you as many tips as possible between now and grand champ because I'll give you the most useful tips now obviously planning is like the lower ranked players which worry buddy past it would just be me playing like stupid and going for whatever I wanted to go for but now I can actually give you guys proper tips something more just care that the rest of the series as a randomizer addition but will get rid of the camera settings part of it because it's just like everybody lost that challenge you know I mean the whole point was trying to get the grand champ undefeated using random camera settings which is not gonna happen I see that now it's impossible I thought maybe there is a slight slight chance we can maybe pull it off if we're lucky but we got set is that a pretty bad against the rank that's already getting really solid at once oh it's uh it's a challenge it's probably not doable at least right now maybe I'll revisit in the future and give it another try but we failed it so we'll move on to continuing the randomizer addition to this road to grand champ but what does do the random car aspect of it because for the camera settings man like I said it's just way too hard it's way too hard to to get good settings and then even with the good settings there's gonna be some cameras saying that's hard as hell to use in that so we're gonna eliminate that aspect that we failed the challenge you know I was expecting to not do it anyway because getting grant [ __ ] but we won is probably the hardest game mode to get grant shape in to be honest so we're gonna need to have good settings I think so we're gonna switch to our normal settings I know I have seen a lot of you guys tell me that the gameplay gives you a massive headache when I'm using a loaf of V or like the high chains it just be that snappy back and forth so for the viewing aspect of it is not very good for the entertainment aspect obviously it's you know it's funny but at the same time it's kind of hard to watch I agree with you I wash back some of the some of the videos obviously when I'm editing them and it is hard as hell to watch the ones with the bad settings so we're done this for now we're done the camera setting aspect of it like I said but we'll move into just focusing on trying to get the wins and trying to give you guys as much info as possible while also using the random car setup so people think I'm just some new producers weird cars so yeah but yeah I'll try to give you guys a message as possible I won't try not to lose anymore probably 99% wind right now it's like ugly Oh a 98.1 dude we lost one game with 98.1 so set I was hoping to stay undefeated but like I said impossible tasks really so we'll continue this with the random cars for the rest of this but yeah up till champ to division 3 we use random setting that's pretty good not bad at all then we played against a champ three and that's the one that still the deal I would have got us into champ 3 if we beat that dude so would I got the champ through the random settings not bad at all like I said the future we could shutter a business the challenge trying to reach without losing a single game but I don't want a series of character line right now to be honest I want to give you guys a super super informative series on solo standard and improving it 3v3 so we'll do that after this series but let's check out this one series done and I'll give you guys as many tips as possible in this game and every game going forward I'll take a series so yeah let's get into it so the last game of the video but the first game that we're actually using normal settings of this whole series we got against cyborg who appears to be a champ to champ 3 okay Jame - I think I'm not sure to be honest I think chap 3 would be like 1200 I'm assuming so missing this guy's also my ring tries air dribble this I go for bulb Lily don't be go for bump Center like that far out I gotta get into the my sieve like any of you guys may tip as possible and how not like going for too many like goals that you guys won't be able to go for so hard to find the get in between this guy so that you could tell he's going for boost deals which obviously you should be going for in that position was a good low 50 there I didn't flip for anything which is the optimal low 50 cuz they're gonna go flying over your head you're not gonna waste your position you landed on the ground that's perfect yeah I was saying when you get hired hired ranks you definitely need to stop your opponent of deuce to force them into awkward spots you can't leave them boost and leave them space to you know free defend you got to make things hard for them - your dad's gonna pop it up is way first touch here you should be drilling that ball instead of throwing it back to me that'd be best-case scenario because now I got a free dribble again I get a pretty glow out of it my original flick wasn't the greatest I was just Ryung to see what he'd do but forced out our worst touch the end there good save it's got solid I shouldn't be gone for this corner because he can get it go out of that by the same time I took the risk didn't necessarily get me scored on so I'm good for now keeps all fake Chad you fake showers like three times in a row that's crazy and I have time to control as well so why am I in a panic I have no reason to same situation here try to stay on it therefore my corner I could try to just flick it away I still pop over him you can get back to it there we go yeah I hope you guys have no problem me switching back to normal settings like I said I know a lot of you guys did say that you liked the idea of this series but a lot of has also said that you didn't like what the settings would make you get headaches when watching so you know it's a good thing I guess not doing anymore I really want to want to do it to see if we can reach it without without losing like I said earlier so not to upset that we lost to be honest because probably a bit frustrating we're gonna get super close to the end and then lose with it and then just get stuck at the same rank forever cuz you can't like I would lose against this dude but the same settings I had for sure so there's a good idea - to call it yeah the next sort of good series I wander after this gonna be so centered and I can't wait for that one because honestly that one's gonna probably be my most informative series yet just because of how I'm gonna play it out I think I already told you guys I'm doing for that but the idea is that I'm gonna try to get two grand champ and so stated without scoring a single goal I'm just only trying to assist my teammates and that one I'm never gonna like do what I did with the camera settings like I'm not just gonna stop and try to start scoring the whole time the matter how long it takes I'm gonna try to get to two grand champion solo standard without scoring a single goal that's the whole idea to see that for this one yeah bridgely this series are just gonna be randomized car like the randomize car preset but then I thought I could make it even spicier with the render settings I didn't think so far ahead as to how hard it would be to play against players that actually are solid at the game and this guy's obviously grand champ is wool you ghetto not in the ones at least but definitely the game is the way he's playing he's good mechanics it's kind of a challenge on its own playing with these other cars like paladin stuff like that so for these I like to just stay in front stay with it puts him in an awkward spot if it chooses to challenge me I can go for something like that the Block in they get myself a free goal so it was just a matter of putting him in in awkward spots called me lucky I'm gonna give him the double story three prediction saves I mean if you talk about the pre jump before that's just experience I guess like I know where you're gonna hit the ball and he really has one option or was I just pretty jumped it go for a double tap here oh I'm waited a little bit a little bit too long for Bruce India in the hair I start weird adjusting back to normal settings now so weirdest thing how these settings feel weird to me now after using the other ones I'm gonna get squirted again dude I'm scared fake he's mad again at pre jump you got that but yeah hey I just left here I look at a fourth free Jeff I got an MBA you saw I wouldn't have won that game hundred percent with other camera settings so well definitely but up this thing with this Podesta series and only got like two more ranks to go Tony champ three and then grand champs go almost done anyway up the champ to divvy three after that one hope you guys enjoyed let me get that below if you're cool with me switching in the future like I said we'll come back to the random so anything maybe I'll even try to TV to you which would be which would be super hard but we'll see we'll figure it out in the future but for now we'll finish off the 1v1 seat with random car presets the only thing will make random for the next few videos and before you know it we'll be done this if we win every single game and then we'll get into the social standard series which I honestly I think that one's gonna be like I said my most informative series this channel every seat just because I was talking about positioning a lot and just different ways to set up your team for four goals and stuff like that I don't want to go like super super super trihard the entire time it's more so just to like send a set of my teammates to show you guys how you can be a good team player and set up your teammates because me my role on my team professionally most of time is to try to play it as a passenger you create plays and I've always had that role like throughout my entire career so I'm I'm pretty serious when it comes to that and in the pro setting and I can show you guys have that sitting to rank into your gameplay so yeah can't wait to get this series done so I can get into that one but hopefully I'll give you guys some good such for everyone and I hope he hasn't proven this for the next few ranks and like I said if we're playing like two to three games of video only be probably like three more videos before we're done this year's anyway so we almost made it all the way to green shambles right upsetting it's not too bad at all yeah I appreciate y'all for the support and I'll see you guys all in the next one hopefully we'll learn something new and yeah like
