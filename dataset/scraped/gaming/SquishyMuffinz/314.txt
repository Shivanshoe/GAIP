brand new video the support you guys have to show me is absolutely insane thank you so much for being the best community out there appreciate shell and I'll be guys enjoy the video what's up guys are back with some more Road to grand champ games that I can't score an obviously I only assist and in the previous when we finished off at diamond 2 division Warner ranked up the diamond 2 but we lost our first game in diamond two so hopefully today we could win both and start actually climbing up into the champ ranks let's go alright we got one of the guys from the previous video and again we got the lowest MMR player in the lobby so hopefully we could take the win but it's really tough on this other guys really good we'll see you see ya our teammates hit our shots here the shots that we give them may be hard from the shoot down I'm gonna leave in them yeah we're just not enough of a touch to mess them up there's abuse I'll just play it over 1 no Boosh bike ride place middle to me backflips you try I was a guy that was getting mad at me the other time for saving my was shot he's ongoing okay well I'm supposed to win these games so I'm actually supposed to read this about what how am I supposed to win there's no way that was an accident absolutely no way that was an accident I think he's mad 100% he's mad that's something I don't know what all right my teammates are both trolling it looks like I felt like in a case like this I should just score actually just win the game this is what's happening well I'll try to see what happens here see if my teammate does nice ok they're actually doing the ball now I like to see nice to touch but off the wall that's too close J right did he get the e touch she missed a mess it's fine oh yeah we're chilling interesting touches from that date all around so far off the backboard three wide open net nobody's miserable there we go all right he made up for the own Bowl gotta keep my head in the game here part two but you gotta try keep a head in the game I'd fight hard for these wins here I could beat him I think it's fun should be fun teammates have okay now it might not be fine because you panic super hard however get no one trust each other in these drinks my point I think about if as you just hit it to them my boy no there's no trust that's the biggest issue everyone trusted like 20% more smo to be really good actually i think that's probably a goal their Maori good let's block this I couldn't good luck teammate it's not hard at all but if they wait too long I am nice alright my team is behind me so I should wait but it should be my touch play off the wall run one find me to panic and the ball still on their side so my team could do something with this the room is fun good turn like to see off the [ __ ] it gets my team and goes back for it play off the wall forum alright already something a little simpler still still people aren't in good positions for those in there jumping great oculi at it but the good thing is they are still trying to go for the shots open there we go I did more those I think lay off the corner and just kill the guy middle unless he done just playing by don't know that means there's what he's got a hell of a toxic though kind of want to throw this because he's toxic to be honest teach him a lesson but just sick of the series will win hey people that like this bothers me Tim hasn't done much wrong I mean he should have on gold so anything I think he's more in the wrong play up beside okay we gotta play good defense at this point so for defensive three just shut them onto your voice as long as possible and it's made for you time to go for the ball so I should be up okay everyone it's me bummed me out oh my god any go for the [ __ ] surrogate that would be my ball to go for my teammate bump me almost made it really bad we're gonna play through side where they can't get it played out the corner I go for some sort of bumpy no one's even close so it's got a play somewhere nicely done alright we're good again it seems like a lot of the goals that people are even able to score this rink he's just the ball bouncing off the corner and they come in for a free shot when they're still grounded no one's really good at area lling and making the aerials go where they want this guy went for that a facet so I always nice shots meted I missed on purpose on purpose of course 100% on purpose I was throwing because use me toxic hundred percent I'm not bad trust me oh man alright we got that over with thank God we didn't lose somehow my man is ongoing me talks to this he'll wonder our teammate to lose it seems like you're kidding man this guy knows it's me I think with the beating up off that which is really Gary got back up - dammit - division - so when this next one get two in a row gonna be hard but we can do it it's good to Nura let's go alright guys after an extreme and long key time I had to end up searching on the European servers I mean finally found the game after like 30 minutes have you got some 1 km of more players in yeah and those team actually has way worse MMR players in us so let's see how this goes in theory we should win this what a fake but who knows even really just random at this point I'm sure they beat us up the back I missed everything is slightly like this only bad part about this - I don't have to queue these servers like super often because it does take away from the viewing experience over my teammates I'll just go again here I get double over the last guy should be open nicely done that's how I was talking about eyes again to the higher ranks together one can of Mars I'm assuming there champ players it champ ones possibly maybe diamond 3 I'm not sure to be honest with you but as we do get into the higher ranks they're gonna be ready for those those touches off the corner just chilling kind of messing around a bit if you took so long guys that I got like so tired between the first and second game here cuz it is late at night I got super tired I'm feeling it right now sleeping they split off the back or check up for some demos here kill the one should be empty net now there we go they're probably pretty annoyed with me how I'm playing cuz I'm just hitting the ball at the back and then going for kills but it is super useful when the whole challenge is to only have our teammates for takes the main defender out of the net it makes it so you guys get forced into a bad position just really good all-around I should pinch that with my my teammate I've been good put it around - lets really buy it my whole plan of attack is just to play it when I have space surrounding one or two players and just try to bump the other guy I hope my teammate can be there and it's been working pretty well my team is turning on this you realize it was a bad idea but halfway through I'm gonna leave it there could double him I leave it so I didn't wanna accidentally score there we go it was still enough to get by the entire team going high up like that and they might have even waited on my DoubleTap which is also an extra plus say they actually been a hesitation wait for the flick would've been really hard to say with the added leg seem it's up for that he's like doing an area like two feet off the ground pop it over this guy I don't want it to be in I want to be over him we accomplished that but our follow-up was a little far back I get there let's play let's stay across here that's what you should be pretty much so you can react see whatever happens I'm gonna fake on this one I play it across teammate should have this one just Boosh thing off the backboard I'll leave it there see if I follow up and come close your never think I got a goal out of turning like that like you're never really gonna be able to have enough power to make sure to part of that sit you must wait for the past week though if I gotta kill a bit perfect oh no I regular guy though just gonna go straight in I'll challenge us next that's really fun and they didn't make contact not a single one of them oh my god bumped one and now the last guy back as well yeah bumps are super useful especially nowadays people use them a lot more and threes it's just to like open up a gap in the rotation is pretty much it messes up a team pretty hard for that reason it's create so much space you would normally have without the bump my bad the second flip I didn't want to do that I'm trying to flip out of the way but I messed him up oh sorry teammate and really just turning this to the down bounce it's fine just again the way that slowed down the play going forward Tim it should have I'm trying to position to follow it up of course do you have to have a level of trust for them even though you don't want to like overly trust in certain situations you have to have a level of trust don't make their touches on the block Amir to get such middle my team I was still in that corner but it's good if I'm to keep that in I'm just waiting on this little awkward well then I'm backflip here just touch this down to me that's fine Tim I should have her free now nice my fake challenge there or me is simply just being in the area everything I panic a lot more than if I just went back so it's good to stay there for a second then just rotate out once you realize that they're giving us hints we've all closed then off the bag clothes good motors positioning like super-close middle as if everything's gonna just roll in front of the goal I think the hits I'm making off the backboard they're really good for high ranks like you will be there every single time at high ranks but they're not so good people aren't exactly ready for it and they don't know how to control their car per good to get around these shots but either way the cue times took forever to find this game but I'm happy that we were able to find it finish up the episode for today it seems like diamond 3 is a thousand mm are not champ 1 I thought champ one might have been a thousand but I'm wrong so we got up to 956 MMR we're 44 away from diamond three and one step closer to that big grand champ milestone but yeah hope you guys enjoyed the video guys I got super tired during this few times the only thing I worry about is when we get higher and higher rank the queue times get slower and slower and so standard it's probably the most Dead game out to be honest so that's why I'm looking forward to the next year's which would be the Tron hard road a grand champ in standard 33 not so low standard which is this place that's just you can queue up with people that so many difference if you guys are new to the game solo standard you can only put it alone sandir you can play with 18 I'll be doing the next little standard in that it'll be full try hard I can do whatever I want to do is just to win as quick as possible gets a grand champ and get as many cool goals as possible for you guys to enjoy but yeah hope you guys are looking forward to that series but we still got more of this year's to go and we're learning a lot of Bali's rings played to be honest and there's still a lack of mechanics lack of positioning or lack of decision-making that a lot of these players just have to work on slightly and they'll get to the next level on us it's like not a big big gap between these ranks it's just the little things that make a big difference so all these players they just watch back replays they can find a lot of the airs the big the big errors in their gameplay that can be patched up to make them a much better players so I recommend if you guys are watch this video right now and you want to get better watch back some replays of yourself see where you're going wrong as the mechanical mistakes is positional mistakes and try to really pinpoint where you're going wrong guys gonna be or this one hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night with what time it is when you're watching this thing you guys for all the support that they're getting closer and closer to one meal every single day I appreciate y'all now see you on the next piece you
