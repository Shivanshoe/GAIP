yo what's up guys so today i want to try something a little bit different and i wanted to challenge myself so for today we're going to be doing is this speed jump rings map which i haven't done for my channel yet and i want to do it with zero gravity on so i'm going to make this as hard as possible for myself zero gravity makes everything look flipped around in rocket league when you use it so everything's flipped around and you're a lot more floaty and your boost is a much bigger effect on where your car goes so it's a little bit harder to control and uh in general this course is hard to begin with i'm pretty sure so let's get into it it's gonna be my first time trying to do this ever so let's see what kind of time we get it might take an hour it might take 10 minutes it might take 20 minutes i don't know but we're gonna give it a try and we're gonna see what we can do all right so right now our gravity is on default if we put this to zero we start floating and that's why this is going to be interesting because we got to get through all these rings while upside down and floating everything's a little bit weird looking so that's going to be the the big challenge for today before we get into the course itself though i just want to say a huge thank you to everybody who's been supporting the channel dropping a new subscription every single day i appreciate y'all you guys have been absolutely insane make sure that if you're not subscribed this channel go down below right now press that big red button that we always know if i want to upload a brand new video and i appreciate that very much yeah let me know down below if you guys enjoyed this kind of video idea just kind of challenging myself and like i said the next video you'll see on this channel will be me reviewing you guys montages so look out for that in the next couple days thank you for everybody who submitted a montage i appreciate y'all yeah let's get into the course for today let's hopefully get through this pretty quickly i hope it doesn't take too long and uh also guys i did make a tick tock called the real squishy muffins that's me there's one called just squishy muffins i wanted to make one for myself that way you guys know it's me it's called the real squishy muffins linked down below in the description from now on in every single video but the one that's just named squishy muffins is not me someone stole that account was trying to pretend to be me for a while but yeah i made this account that way you guys know it's me so go follow me over there if you guys want to watch just daily clips uploaded by me so yeah it's into the course let's see if we can get through this pretty quick hopefully it doesn't take an hour this is just fun for some reason just floating in zero gravity eternally but let's go let's see how long it's gonna take i'm gonna guess we're gonna do this in let me guess like let's say 11 minutes i'm gonna guess 11 minutes it's gonna take us i think i've seen people do this course before and i think i saw like rizzo do this a while back it took them like 14 15 minutes i'm like that i think so let's see how long it'll take us to deal with this on it doesn't feel too hard so far honestly i'm able to do this pretty easily so far for some reason like i kind of like how it feels upside down it is definitely harder though it is definitely harder it's not going to look as clean as it would if i if it wasn't upside down obviously got to reset i think resetting is going to be the play for speed in those spots is when it gets awkward i think the thing that i've kind of figured out already is that if you don't boost it all you just stay in the same spot so if there's like a row of rings you don't need to boost much but you guys could try this yourself you just need backus mod if you install backus mod there's a setting within the free play section i believe and you can make it so there's inverted gravity you can also make it so it's slow-mo so yeah oh my god that's trippy okay that's trippy is hard to get used to land on the ramp that was a good recovery okay that's very difficult because it just looks so awkward actually made it oh my god we're feeling it no no which way the right way all right nothing too bad actually i think we're actually doing pretty good so far up okay this is awkward i can't see try to just feather a boost for these and they're close together if you go too fast i think you're gonna mess that up gotta go to this yellow one i think nice i hold my drift on those that i can just keep going with my momentum i'm actually doing really good i'm like surprising myself i didn't think we'd do this good with this yeah i had people recommending me this on on twitch the other day so i was like okay i'll make a video on it i'll try to see if i can do it because people are saying it's like impossible so we're trying it doesn't feel impossible it just feels difficult i think impossible is the wrong word but we'll call this the impossible challenge because people were saying it wasn't possible oh no okay that's very awkward you see how like i went down there ah it's so hard that's normally the right way to go in that situation but because everything's flipped it feels so weird this might mess with me a little bit when i go back to the normal game dude this is hard okay it's actually hard now i see i see the the difficult part of this i gotta focus we're actually doing it oh my god that's i had a flip still i said my flip from before okay i went too fast going too fast and hold on to my flip instead of using it early that way i can recover like i did today okay it's really awkward to use your flip though when everything's flipped like this because you can't tell where it's gonna bring you sometimes it looks so weird like it's actually kind of hurting my head a little bit i hope this isn't like a terrible viewing experience for you guys because of how weird it looks it's a fun challenge i like challenging myself like this because i don't know just interesting to see my experience in the game like how well i know the mechanics if it's like flipped upside down and more floaty if i can figure it out just fun fun to see or the timer at the top we're only three minutes and 40 seconds so far it's pretty good it feels good to be going for a while though i think we've done quite a bit this is awkward oh wow okay this is really hard this part where am i going okay i'm gonna go through the red oh my this is hard the better ones are difficult they're so small up the ramp should i slow down to ramp through all these now okay this is hard holy this is hard oh no okay we can get back down maybe i can't see okay nevermind we can't this might be the hardest part of the course so far for sure it is i think i can't see you gotta keep flicking on ball cam in those situations where you can't see in this course no the other ones are even smaller i gotta slow down more i think i already made it i'm trying to slow down my speed a bit here nice oh i messed up messed up that's hard dude this is hard okay you have to really take your time it feels like i think if you rush these is going to make it harder just wait for my car to slow down i like going faster on here though satisfying nice that's so fun for some reason just flying full speed like that that was good recovery have been a little cleaner oh no i fell okay that's fine it could have been cleaner anyway man your ups and downs get so mixed up the way you flip all depends on where your car is like facing so it's so weird like so weird to wrap your head around where you're facing sometimes in this oh i stay up no way did i can't see are we gonna stay up here no way no i made it all that way okay okay we got this we got this focus land here oh i hate the room okay six minutes oh no dude how much longer is this i want to be somewhat close to my prediction okay let's go back down okay i didn't pass it it's fine it's fine let's take our time let's play it smart here that's fine doesn't have to be perfect oh no dude wow this is weird i tried to just jump there and maybe flip because your wheels get off the ground instantly the red ones are really hard to get through i still might flip i think if we need it here why did i flip why did i flip there that was a good use of my flip but i couldn't recover in time okay let's take our time here let's just let our car float into one spot here and then we'll go take our time i think if i take this super slow we can get a really good time but we're trying to beat it that's the goal dude this is really difficult what am i missing there okay let's float dude i keep hitting the rim on this nice take our time here through the blue do the yellow take our time go down okay we made the checkpoint they're all little red ones now oh no this is hard okay i see the end i think the yellow thing up there wow that was disorienting okay we got it we got it why did i flip didn't realize i had one up the yellow oh okay okay we're at the end pretty much if i can get through here oh my god i thought i had a flip all right go through this go up the ramp wow i don't know where i am okay oh my wait you running out of time or something i don't know why just reset okay that is so hard okay this is probably like the most like confusing thing in terms of where you are because you just can't see anything i i got to take my time i think i think we got it we have a clean go right to the end there we go 909 we finished the course 909 that's not bad at all to be honest that's pretty quick we'll definitely take that the game is going to feel so weird to me now when i get back to free play let me show you guys the first moments in free play see if it's super weird it doesn't feel that weird i thought it would feel worse actually feels kind of easier to control for some reason the game feels kind of better why does the game feel easier it doesn't make any sense the game literally feels easier to play now is that a cheat code did i just figure out the cheat code all right guys gonna be for this one i hope you guys enjoyed the video i know it's a little bit different than what you used to seeing on the channel but i still hope that it was a lot of fun for you guys to watch it was really weird to play so i hope it wasn't really weird and like disorienting to watch as well i hope it didn't make any of you guys sick but uh yeah the game feels super crispy now for some reason after i did that so maybe that's cheat code maybe every time before i play an rlcs match from now on i'm going to play the the inverse gravity or the zero gravity uh but yeah have yourself on a flip through tonight guys make sure you do hit that subscribe button if you're not subscribed already follow me over on twitter twitch tick tock whatever it may be if you're not following yet support the boy i appreciate y'all thank you all for watching all the time you guys are the absolute goats i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace
