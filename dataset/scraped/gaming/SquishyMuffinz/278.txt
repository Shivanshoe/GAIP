subscribe button enjoy the video for today love you guys yo what is up guys gonna be queuing some Tuesday with my teammate from cloud nut and it's for me it should be some your games let's get straight into it let's see how it goes all right we got sub first match funding at CPS and Alpha cabbage' two very good players 2k MMR players so gonna be a sweaty one for sure for slightly missed emptiness closer I didn't know was empty to be fair when I first shot okay I got the clown bump to the guy sir it's pretty good should I get it over that guy couldn't quite poison to be up I take their boost see your toes here nice so I was trying to fit the tour should have this Tuesday's like very 50/50 based a lot of the time I feel like especially these days I feel like it's like super 50/50 based you can win your 50s you start keep possession you can make it follow up a lot of the time like that see all 50s the whole the whole situation just fifty fifties we kind of came out on top I guess cuz we got possession but at the same time they're one of most of those so we just got lucky but they didn't get the gold  off of it should be over 100 with the shot the delay nice super solid so far freshening what we need to pressure that has many balls that were too dangerous besides at one time I got a dribble bumped try stealing good shot of this close just and this mess I shouldn't think that from tour again to be honest but I was a pretty confident that I could get a shot of it fired the time - how's it gonna tempt on a save from alpha kept a I feel like if we put these guys both times in this video for both games that the second game is gonna be super close one of these games is gonna be like super sweaty they could definitely win either of these by the way like the highest level in twos its but somewhat random to be honest anyone could be anyone I feel mm like threes in a way like there's so much consistency in threes someone can like dominate easily in threes for a long period of time securing with a you know really good team but in in twos it's not like that at all you can have a really good set of players and twos and still lose very randomly to another good set of players she's never gonna be like a consistent winner I feel as you good luck from them I wasn't really hard shot to convert for alpha kept a light is a good finish good job to get the touch you needed to get at the back corner I'll leave her tour here they like to bump a lot and they have the chance to like they hit it around the corner and go for the bumps it's really good shot in tuesday's well works in threes too but and Tuesday viously there's less people too to try to bump that's 50 I should be back in time it's like our boost I was gotta watch for if he sweeps which he is good 50 for him got his boots which is huge I'm gonna make easier to keep pressure now because if we can get the ball past alpha cap he's gonna be in an awkward spot to help him out which we just did liked or stay on that yeah there we go and then all stems back from when I got that boost room I'm pretty sure you're still locals you never actually got a new boost that's what I was saying as soon as that ball gets past the only person who has boost gonna be pretty easy to get a goal try to shoot behind him he's always gonna think I'm gonna shoot far post say so I'll take my time use it wisely don't need to rush into that shot you be still tour she go for this to help me yes that's fine as well I'll just take this I don't wanna get that much he's chasing me yeah I heard him nice my team Eagle his shot yeah so I was gonna take that back slow but I heard him chasing me so I just kind of drove back I know he's not gonna challenge the ball there I'm gonna worry about one guy and another guy bumping me and torque and come back and help cause he probably has full vision of what's happening there also like try to think of what your opponents are seeing and what's your teammates are seeing because that helps you a lot in situations like that I know tour would had full vision of what's happening there so he would have known to help me out even if I go back there we go good leave from Torah as he a pest that's good time to flip you set off the backboard there cuz I had a lot of space of the ball I had a lot of extra boost as well so no reason not to try that and it's really hard to defend as well so I feel like we're gonna run into those guys again because they're super high over more players and it probably the higher some of our players on right now and they're around our drink so let's cue it's another one hopefully this time again hopefully would be another intense game see how it goes we got the same map twice we're playing in steals if team in and twin for the last game so let's see pop that up once so have a little bit of space here see what I can do oh not quiet almost got the angle would have been good shut up block that I guess I'll torch trying to pass it to me might as well give him an option on the past by going for it and you know worst-case scenario oh my god worst case scenario they get a 50 passes make a step recovery I had every angle block but they could score off of so it's not too bad try to go for go for mid right shot challenge gonna have a boom post playing passive here she's good gonna have a easy touch try to support them just behind here nice cut it close okay I don't want to rush this too hard I'm just gonna kind of fake him make him feel the ball the way same thing here that's good should await which I pass over to tour side that flowers boost is so funny sounding man voice on the Bang I guess it works out if you've gone for flip presets whenever I have the chance do it's got a dumb surprise it worked also huge thank you to all the support you guys showed me on my 10,000 hours video thank you so much I appreciate it sure hope you guys know that I know I say it constantly but just saying it doesn't show how much I appreciate it it's hard to explain how much I appreciate you guys you guys seriously I've allowed me to kind of live my dream everyday so thank you I'm not just saying that to say it like honestly crazy to me like to even think where we are where we're at in our channel and like is everything like it's crazy so thank you guys seriously I just wanted to take a second to say thank you for the huge support in the last video I also I hope all you guys just didn't see me miss that because I was focused on speaking and properly thanking here that's my excuse should I play off this don't come I don't know about for so many flippy sets this game too is just makes me want to flip reset for some reason should i past torment nice it's gonna be awkward for them that both kinda messed up that's fine i'll just waiting for her to miss see it sort us she does probably have another touch I wait for tor tor still rotating so trying to be out us is flick here we go stay behind that shattered it well no decent block could have been better cuz my recovery time is really bad off of it it's the only thing I don't like about that challenge gonna have a flick nitrous or I mean playing super solid that we've had a lot of pressure rotations I've been cleaning they've had many opportunities to do anything really I went down I was unlucky torque and get there if you miss like that on a stage but stay behind your teammate I probably have a free ball again so keep your rotations up and misses like that shouldn't even matter the end of the day trying to sound this high right away that's fine though cuz again free baudet or it's kind of just how to's works 50-50 go straight through the center like that normally your teammates gonna get the free ball unless you just badly positioned which trauma it's not gonna be badly positioned when it comes to those another post dude can't stop hitting the post yeah our rotations have been super fast though they haven't had many opportunities we've had so many shots he appeared to them they have two shots only only two we have 16 so you could tell there's so much pressure we've had you find selling on defense though for sure your my in this game with 20 shots obviously like it doesn't matter how many shots you have if they're bad shots so I keep it in the post thank you I have ten shots before those have been post probably could have been the goals so like I said it doesn't matter how many shots you have if they're all bad but we've had a lot of pressure they didn't have many opportunities to do anything and there we go another goal 19 shots and then give us the chance to get the 20 they ended up quitting but that's here to be today's video I hope you enjoyed that first game was super super sweaty and there's a lot of good goals in it much better than the second game for me I missed so many shots in this game that I probably should have scored but either way I'll be just enjoy the video thank you so much for all the support like
