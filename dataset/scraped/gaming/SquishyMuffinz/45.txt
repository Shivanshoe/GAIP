yo what's up guys gonna be queuing all three game modes for today when we playing threes twos or ones whatever we get we'll play what we've been doing for the last few videos it's been fun and it's kind of exciting not knowing what game mode i'm gonna get so let's get into it see if we can get some dubs let's see i guess alright we got three's game off the bat here we got t cause and vegas against chief beef uh deru and go see this goes recognize some of these some of these players it's gonna be a solid lobby say my boost here wait for the bounce as well if it's ever like an awkward bounce like that try to just keep your boost and stay in a position where you can react like the bat and the good because there's a way that that bounce can be really hard to read is also where the bounce is pretty simple so the longer you wait the like that answer will kind of show itself to you i think if you try to rush it most of the time it becomes very difficult i don't recommend rushing it's actually really close to being a good shot from him good pass my teammate is a good idea nice cut off this can be kind of a mess i mean there's a lot of missing going on here and the only reason why i was ready for like any of that is really just because i'm playing a little bit extra patience so i see him up this looks awkward so i'm just waiting until i have for sure confirmation that he missed right nice touch try to control this ball the trap in the corner turn back to net so i can react whatever else comes my way places open space to the left i know i have no one here so that's kind of my like green light move toward this area nice job good work that's actually a really good thing to like always look out for it as well right i see so much open space to my left that's the part of the field that i should be using it's not different i think a lot of people they'll try to force a play that just can't happen because there's too many defenders watching it so when you have the open space anywhere on the field try to look for it and that's really what's gonna grant you any kind of chance to get a goal is just using that open field on the the best way you can right whether it be doing a solo play whether it be using your teammate doesn't really matter just trying to use like whatever empty space you have to your advantage let's go over this maybe even bump them it's actually a good idea didn't get the demo unlucky but my car is glitching out everywhere get some pads here this is the best like pad route i always take in front of that and you can react to anything that's why i like taking it take my time as soon as it jumps i'm gonna start boosting more gotta go for a bump get a slot in the game like that as well over one i'm getting number one every time which is pretty big illustrations i just go for a bump here be annoying make some jump makes a panic a bit he put it to the right it could be really big so let's face it right for me if he wants to pass i try i was pre-driving just in case but didn't end up coming to me nice good job for my team i actually like to go explosion a lot super clean really good pass from uh from vegas there i like using that down like that corner in front of the net or just drop straight down it's overpowered if you're doing it off like a passing play and someone's just there for it really a touch to control check it one more maybe i could have actually just scored it but it's fine almost worked i didn't realize they'd miss i was me just kind of playing the fact that they should be there trying to react to the 50 of it it's a good demo good job actually wait to the left here if you want to use me he messed up a bit so i should back off there you go comes right back to me because of that actually the pages playing off the back wall it's going to be very hard for them to do anything teammates should have this you got faked by everyone that's exactly why you don't want to play too pushed up right you don't want to play too expecting everything to go perfectly because then you can't react when things don't go perfectly it's really good to have like a balance of bull actually a play there like if my teammate had put that a little bit more passive and just expected that there's a chance that they might all miss he would have been there for the shot right we ended up playing a little bit too pushed up made that not possible but anyway good first game really solid stuff my teammates played really well against the next one stephen keep it up get back by dubs for the day let's see how it goes all right well this time kenobi got my teammates from last game it's going to be a very very sweaty game my teammates played really well and kenobi's obviously kenobi solid player i know he's not a pro anymore he's not competing any longer but he still knows how to play threes when he needs to make panicked a bit it's fine we have more space than it looks like trying to play the low henry's always been very very good i think it's always something he's been extremely good at through his whole pro career just how he challenges the ball you won't really get past him off like uh him making a mistake on a challenge almost ever it's a good goal to have the fact that he does it so well he's always done it very well he may should be there should be a goal there we go it's always going to be a very tough uh situation to deal with exactly where the ball on the wall there that reads very hard for everybody um on the back wall anyone on the ground as well it's always going to be favoring my teammates i like doing that that's something that i've just learned over time ah not a great kickoff but we should get back oh that was very unfortunate can it landed on me i actually had a really good read there i'm gonna squirt off a bit good block as well now you can't get any more boost team making double maybe should be fine take this plate over two of them let him hit that's fine it's not gonna be back go straight to my teammate now he's a free dribble it's a flip push take my time go for a shot maybe again really good challenge from crow you can rely on him to do good there oh she could be bad actually pretty well played for my teammate i like that i don't know what i was talking about last game the pages in those situations is very important to have and he did a really good job of that he just waited right in this power people might be a little bit uncomfortable staying but he stayed in a really good spot and he was able to react to the bad and the good there it's a good shot to play from them not much you can do and actually get past it's pretty much all all vegas that play because he was able to get that password to the right smart most people would not pass that especially on rank the right play to make the for sure so i'll try to play a spot again reckon reactive like does get past that guy because there's a chance even though it's a small chance there's definitely a chance that that could have happened should just leave this for me now i don't like the deodorant over there but it's fine it just makes it really hard for me to get like a controlled play out of it the pass alone would have been enough you don't need to like go the extra step being an extra touch like that but it wasn't terrible didn't end up that bad for us to be honest oh might be really bad yeah not okay so like okay this is something that happens way too much and ranked especially people are controlling your corners like that but you kind of just stop and you don't have like proper control of the ball so if you get bumped in any way it just leads to a shot that's just unstable for the last guy back do you want to just not leave yourself in the situation like try not to put yourself in a spot where that can even happen right it's a really good play to me missed by a little bit but it's okay happens does definitely happen try to block here it's huge should be both wet all good all good maybe he can get back on your own goals it's actually funny i'm not gonna lie they both double commit they both panic and then they just don't go oh they pinched it full speed another double crochet okay this is going to be a task but it's a fun one it's a fun one to try to win this i don't know if we can do it being chased i put that actually very good did not go and it made their whole team go as well still not gonna be a goal i don't think but that's gonna be really hard to convert anything off of that good try though let my teammates hopefully go one of them hopefully not both but both again but it might be okay that's a good challenge for challenging well and then my team is not challenging at all so it's going to be very hard for us to actually get out of defense a lot of time challenging is the most important thing in threes it's literally the only thing that like separates like the best teams i think is how well they challenge or what they decide to actually go for so the fact that their their team's like challenging as well as they are makes it very difficult to leave the affiliation shot nice it was much better to leave that than to go for a double i know it's not gonna be anything out of my double but yeah like the big thing that separates any good team is just how they challenge what they choose to go for what they're faking what they're actually baiting for their teammates stuff like that and this other team's actually doing that pretty well like a random team whereas my team not so much we have a lot of double commits a lot of like stepping on each other's toes and not spacing out all that well so it makes it difficult to like progress downfield at all because of that it's okay though still a winnable game nice shot good job still a very winnable game three three minute left like all i guarantee you if there's a goal that goes in against us it's going to be because of a challenge it's going to be because of either a bad challenge or a miss almost every time that's what it is ranked or even in pro play so it ends up being you're going to leave that to smart and look like they put that situation out my teammates have time here which is good try you may should have this should go back paul good lear waiting for vegas touchy actually a really good challenge we can actually do something out of this maybe oh that makes it so much worse that you went and missed that oh good all good happens to the best i should have honestly just ignored that he was even there like if i just went quick and did what i was gonna do it worked really well but i saw my teammate going i tried to trust them it doesn't always work out can't do much all right this is um stressful game uh it shouldn't be this hard i'll be honest there's been a lot a lot of like us making mistakes making it harder for ourselves but he made it to overtime so i'd say that's a victory in itself shouldn't even be here bump them off it's pretty big go crazy fast due doodle that's gonna be a tough situation i'm just gonna go try to just block them i'm so worried okay we're good i hope nice the track record hasn't been good with my two teammates on on defense their chemistry together hasn't been all that great i'd say to me oh he's not back okay could have been terrible but it's fine i'll play to the right should have time won't be one as well i'll put it away that's okay so much time to dribble there like if it takes it's slower just like let's the bounce help him out always going to be a better outcome than what just happened but not bad should be pretty good for us though have control of this they bumped each other teams should go now instantly take advantage of that not fast as a touch on the wall let me go for a bump nice good try good try i don't know if it's worth him going for that because it just like commits two of us so hard but if he thought he could have scored it that's like all you can do is just trust their instinct in that moment two of them committed on that should be good actually oh it's awkward it's gonna be really bad for us actually all right we're good for a bit 1v1 now there's no boost though you can't actually do much it's fine just fake jumping i'm not actually trying to like [ __ ] him into that just more so just to make him hit the ball away if i can kill crow it's pretty big oh you might have pushed up too far which could be bad only backflipped no way oh man that was another really tough game i'll be honest this is a very very very very tough game all of the goals every one of the goals i got against is extremely avoidable but it's a great example of what not to do in three so i do want you guys to see it i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all you
