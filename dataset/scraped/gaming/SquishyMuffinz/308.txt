games were really bad I won't lie to you there was like no teamwork whatsoever and I just wasn't sure you're like where to be weird a position around my team so hopefully today's games go better if it wins both we get back up to where we were in the last video and finish off even that's the best-case scenario hopefully we get the redemption on our team and we didn't get them this dude's a grand champ you submitted an actual like proper high GC player so this is gonna make it really tough playing against them again hopefully one of our teammates are good I don't know to be honest but we'll see how it goes alright so this is gonna be a really tough game like a really really really tough game again we got the guy who's actually like a high like 1800 grand champ on the other team and we got cookies on my team I've never heard of so I really hope they're just absolute legends but I don't know I don't know what to expect at this boy this is just gonna be really tough hoping for the best here nice finish it off Josh let's go big plays alright good defense lockdown the defense we're good to go perfect start we need two wins today this is everything so we worked for huge pinch they're gonna get us fine I'll back off here let's play smart smart defense we're good to go it's all you gotta do you if I make some plays going forward when we can all right this is a tough one to read I don't like to wait for the bounce down and then go don't panic too early for those you don't really need to because they have to wait till it gets in front of your goal to shoot it anyway you got to think of it like that all right it's a big miss but it wasn't quite ready fine trying to plate middle of my team had actually failed it on the first one double O close gonna flick him he should go such an awkward spot enough about me to my challenges first trying to challenge that to keep it in she's falling back now nice challenge you do there's a tough tough game to Whitman and the guy on the other team was on our team last video didn't play like crazy good now another team he actually hit some banger so he definitely has the potential to play ball as well I'm gonna go for this I'll show something to you know that to be honest the way you jumped at it I'm gonna go back here I wouldn't go for the beast normally like hiring games I'm gonna trust my teammate pull off the touch go back now and I said with three minutes left to kill this game policing forever oh forget it there any of that so you outside I'm not gonna go for this koi yeah I'll let the touch it again cuz you get a penny for shot most likely a block home hit up the corner I didn't see my two mother I was just trying to beat that little guy lost the opponent only behind you one of my teammates should go I'm gonna shine the play in a spot where I can kind of react anything that happens hit the mid boost I'm back off now get behind them go for challenge Oh almost scored period IRA BEC nice run T not the best touch but he still could fall for a shot try just old my teammate like pops off you're one of them it's a nice little play going forward somehow no shoo shoo shoo oh yeah I was rough to watch it was like that's like just no trust at all day you get so alright the booster ations looking very grim all because that one did just let me control the ball I'm just trying to be an OK spot here it's reacting a happens with other teammate it's fine this is not good I should never leave him in but I just want to avoid all possible situations where my teens can get like somehow like want me to flake do something like that because there is no communication associated obviously somebody behind to me just to show them that should be his ball to go for it's funny at least forced a shot that's more than enough day I'm just been playing hardcore defense this game so you gotta do for the wins in this series I know my teammate start going nice you don't you just waited way too long to challenge that ball and it's a ball it's very risky that you don't want to leave that on Challenge uncontested hopefully good try you try to go I make a panic like this already can't really shoot dude I trusted that got hit the ball so hard it almost made me take too long to get it holy I'm holding on somehow eight saves Jesus this is what I need to do to win these games this is what actually has to be done throwing these games this is crazy this is crazy I didn't realize how hard social centers can be like I mean I know it's different because I obviously can't score but it's like god this is hard all right we got a division helpers just going into the next game hopefully we get on the dub see we can do please give us a Redemption guys please give us a redemption guy please give us the redemption guy no we get the worst the worst out of the two players I'm so sad I'm so so sad and I'm so sad their team is definitely better than our team I think we've seen the other dude play oh this is a tough one man there's a tough stuff here leaving it nice okay it's fine this is fun grab the mid boost I believe dude I believe we've got a guy champ one here you got it we win this for up to Division four again that we gotta swing one game out of the two in the next video the first one preferably they're up the champ - it's all we need you made there you got bumps fine this is very bad now nice touch shoot oh all right we're good we're good we're good I feeling that get vine all right backward team it should be there it's a Miss good she lets go do you Frieda's feeling me he's feeling it all right lock down the B face baby this is pretty much just how to pretty much this how to defend cuz this whole series how did I get a go on just defend it oh my god I would have saved it anyway it's fine we're good read sorry teammate I messed you up day brother all right decent touch plate it up there I'm gonna drop down I could turn on this keep it in nice I'll be back here miss touch Tina should go okay it's forcing for me it's fun good play to get play to make and for the back left boost let my teammate hit that good job not the best touch from him okay we're here we good I was a little sketchy looking in their face I'll let them touch this when I can be too dangerous up first hit around a nice and easy sit it aside just to keep it in the thing is close I'm on the team they know I can't score so they're not gonna be worried when I have to go for the Paul really that's the funny part about this because I had to tweet to get people on line in this mode I know it's me let's go do phrases feeling it he's feeling it I can't believe I'm actually gonna get this way we're gonna to back to back saver bringing the bag baby bringing it back I believe it's fine dude last video bad lucky anything happens I'm setting up for this I bumped him which is should be good enough for my team nice that's fine I have 20 boots back I had a vision you play it down to my teammate you should take that nice at the boost from them nice it down I can get this mid as well I should go Oh guys waiting that's fine I like the patient approach not bad yeah at all nice I was gonna wait here just a nice five o'clock next touch off the back team is gonna probably have the bump the other guy you try I'm gonna go back now I bumped a guy that was gonna be a little one that's actually able to defend that you guys gonna up the backboard it's a challenge here push the ball out for free banging on downfield leave a minute 30 to kill you take some pads play smart I think I'm gonna hold it leavin these is a very difficult skill to be honest with you it's hard it's hard not to over eat grass like a situation like this my team left me like I'm very bad situation just because they went for two really bad challenge that I couldn't really help out with you know like that first challenge is pretty bad didn't really get the ball forced into a bad situation so it's very easy in threes to just lose the lead quickly get over extension and leaving teammates and bad spots and stuff like that accidently scored but we're getting saved it for me I'm gonna fake challenge here again my team you have the free ball good fifty this is kind of bad to be honest because I have no beefs here yeah yeah yeah I had no boost and I was just in a spot where I know he's passing that but I literally I can't tell if he's gonna be able to shoot off of it ever just hit it around this videos went from very good to uh a little sketchy down the set of games but I believe I believe my team's gonna come through but they're gaining confidence for sure nah dude I swear oh my god no not like this I've just been boost arse out of my mind all right big boost nice fall into it come on team surely not like this right surely not like they stood oh it's the most frustrating thing ever I hate the ski mode I hate this game over the passion guys why did I why did I agree to this why did I agree this is tortured this is actually torture for my brain and I have to plan to use service because the ski mode so dead I see if that's the worst part - I literally have to play it on like everything being Phil hate even like turning feels like poo on this I hate this so much dude I hate that we lost a game that's the most frustrating thing in the world holy that's annoying but they definitely had the better team like my for based off what I saw in the previous games but we're back data division - we went absolutely nowhere last who mission went down in the last few videos this is terrible am i forever stuck at camp one dude this is what it feels like I'm just stuck here for everyday holy okay I believe the next video we're gonna get two wins we're getting out of here we're getting out of here we're getting two wins okay I I vowed to not lose a single game for like at least two more videos all right I'm gonna do everything I can I tried about the best play good defense man I really did I missed that one boost at one boost I got I tried to get it 40 make it my teammate got it first and then I just led to just chaos because I couldn't block that second shot man that's annoying I so annoying
