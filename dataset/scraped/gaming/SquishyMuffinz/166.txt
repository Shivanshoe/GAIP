the year enjoy yo guys so i played hoops in the last game so for today i decided why not let's play some drop shot i'm also gonna be testing out this uh brand new sense that i'm on i'm on 2.2 right now that's actually the highest i've ever been on hopefully we feel good on it i've been trying out slightly higher since recently anyway so it's not that crazy it's not that far off i think i was on like 1.8 recently so uh yeah let's see how it goes get into the games hopefully we catch some dubs let's go all right for the first game i'm playing with average baguette gamestopper and little big fink i've actually played game stopper before in drop shot i think i recognize that name i'm pretty sure it's him i'm thinking about there's probably the same the same people that grind it if i had to guess yeah drop shots a lot about just actually good practice for like the real game i think it's a lot about keeping possession beating your opponent like making good touches around your opponent it's actually a lot of practice for the little important things in threes i think being smart about how you defend um you know the next touch and being smart about how you shadow it's all what drop shot is you might think it's a lot of ball chasing and it might be every now and then but i really do think that it's a lot of uh just like knowing how to properly defend the shadow stuff i shouldn't let that bounce here that was a bad habit from the normal games that i play but outside of that one blunder it's been a good game so far we're doing pretty well you have a good amount of pressure i'd say my first touch here it makes you like you have to position well and you have to read the opponent really well to do well in this game mode you have to be able to do those things good touch from my teammate i went middle here he's gonna have one more most likely again positioning a good spot where i could fall off the next touch hopefully i had a flip there i was hoping and i was able to bang that one in but i must have just ran out all right i got killed that's fine though holy we have a lot of score already it's not like we've done well but i don't think we've been doing that good it's been pretty good so far these touch from my teammate tried this downfield this part my teammate can follow it up more damage could have went for the shop i think we can just wait for a better opportunity that'll hopefully come in a second getting some good reads though getting back to the play just in time in a lot of these unlucky that we got absolutely the shirt on that one though nice good play for my teammate good drop down we have a lot of um empty tiles though which is good they really get too much space damage on our side should be good for a bit hopefully my teammates look like they're pretty experienced drop shot players it's a good kick off yeah i really played this mode that much but if i had to pick one mode like my favorite extra mode it had to be this this is one of the oldest extra modes i'm pretty sure this isn't rumble i'm not sure if they release them at the same time i don't remember literally drop shot run at the same time but i know it's one of the oldest ones and um i've always liked this one the most personally i have quite a big hole there wait for the bounce try to get a quick read it good reach from him team i should have someone should be there most likely should be good play to open space another good thing that this teaches you playing it to open space playing it around your opponents in general into open space in 3v3 for example is a really good habit to get into especially into a spot where your team can follow it up first and not them i actually might play this more like just the idea of how you have to play to do good in this game mode is it's pretty good practice i think might be a cheat code like when you break it down it's everything you need in 3v3 and pro 3 these days feels like being the opponent having control of the ball pass into your team but in a smart way where the enemy's not going to get the ball first right he just do the right things tough thing to stop but we had a lot of damage anyway on their side so should be okay teammate unlucky on that slightly missed and then the last guy back covering that hole couldn't quite reach it because it was a good shot it was a banger of a shot to be fair teammates are both going we have some open space i'm going to look for an opportunity to air dribble this save my boost get it over him wow those bounces always catch me off guard though on this those are a little bit different than they should be good 50 good read from him i gotta wait for a second here all right i did not expect that 50 to go through but it's okay trying to get aggressive and bump it's fine teammates should have this hopefully we have to throw really hard here to lose this i think i think i can see it happening though we're missing some of the key balls definitely can't miss oh no okay yeah i definitely see some nerves coming through from my team a little bit but it's okay we're looking okay it does happen you know you know what they say the easy the easy hits and the easy empty nets are the hardest to hit that's the most facts thing you'll ever hear about rocket league there we go should be just enough get the ball out of the way of the opponent the cast from him i think he's just banging it downfield but we'll call it a pass we'll take it [Music] it should have all right i think i'm gonna play defense i think we'll play this smart we'll play defense for the last 20. we got just this hole to worry about and one in front of us so we sit right around here we should have everything covered should be okay for my team nice good bait from us not to get over aggressive put ourselves in a terrible spot they should be there i think oh my gosh okay that was very risky of him to control that ball instead of banging it away oh we should be okay here wait how did i get a flip wait what how did i get a flip there i was so high in the sky i felt like i was hacking i should not have had a foot unless my teammate or i somehow hit the bottom of my teammate's car i don't know i feel like i shouldn't have shouldn't have had a flip there again it's weird anyways into the next game good first one for sure i'm gonna drop them all heart good first game for sure let's get into the next one let's even get back to big dubs let's see how it goes all right for last game we're playing as the same two people and that one average baguette guy went off last game so we gotta be a little bit careful here i think we have one of the same teammates as well pretty sure unless like i was another team i don't remember game stopper i recognize his name but i'm not sure if he was on our team or their team good challenge should i go for this gonna be up ready that's fine notices takeoff is a little bit worse than you would have wanted you can kind of tell but i control this on the wall here i messed up a little bit my pre-flip instead of diagonal flipping i front flip so i couldn't continue air dribbling the ball after those are rare things to mess up when you mess those up like definitely makes a huge difference in high level when the margins are so small right so you want to try to avoid those mistakes as much as possible i'll try and do something like this stay on the ball i messed up that one time and they got that bit of damage from one mess up right so you gotta cut down those mistakes i don't know if it was that whole thing from that mistake but regardless i didn't get it out of my zone plenty to do better in that aspect good keeping for my teammate well done well played good challenge from i should drop down favorably i couldn't quite beat them teammates should be there i wasn't there it's fine there you regain got it out of our side try to play behind him there that's a good try wait for what he does probably a double tap here he didn't get it again play it back to the other corner using a no flip there not a bad idea only issue was there my teammates both weren't in that side right so i should have looked for my teammates instead so they could have followed it up and i would have been in a much better position demos in this game are really good too i just don't use them enough definitely gotta in general use demos more than i already do very hard thing to get into the game though like to actually properly apply demos maybe you'll get it fake the whole team there that was a good play close alright from him should have double committed with him i should have been a little bit more spaced out it's not gonna hit that probably looked really awkward for me you should see him it's an awkward spot try to position for the miss and if they have the hit then you can follow up with the next right i've got a position for both situations the miss and the potential hit being as far you can follow both oh so close one for the pinch off the wall can you go straight down maybe a block here hopefully oh my teammate saved it no it's fine we got it here to the wall round one hopefully around the other close good try good attempt to outplay on the wall there tough spot to do that in a lot of damage again we're in a pretty good spot here we have quite a bit of damage just beat him to this ball i don't need to go for the direct shot just putting this bar my teammates can follow it up and it's really awkward for them not bad save my boost here follow my teammates hit but oh my god that bounce is not normal that was just a normal ground bounce and it went that much to the side okay keep on double committing thinking my teammates not gonna go and the last second we both decided to go so solo queue mishap happens quite a bit but we'll take a game stopper slaughtered it slotted it found the opening hold on and it's quite late right now guys and i haven't been sleeping too great lately so sorry if i'm a little bit tired i'm trying to remain on a good upload schedule for you guys and upload at least three times a week minimum i'm gonna try my best too i look really laggy holy uh but try my best to but no guarantees it's tough i'm still playing obviously pro tournaments all the time i scream all the time and i'm still trying to throw streams here and there it's a lot of stuff to keep track of trying my best though keep going for you guys obviously and um yeah i hope you guys still are enjoying my videos even though i've been uploading for five years pretty much showing you my journey this whole time you guys that are still here i appreciate you guys i mean there's so many of you but it's crazy to me when i think about it how long i've been uploading you guys have like seen my whole journey as a player everything i've done to improve all the little things all the little ideas i've had over the years to try to get better you guys have seen it all two goats i hope you guys have improved along the way as well of course and had fun some some good laughs not much to crack jokes about when you're playing rocket league to be honest but there are some things like me missing empty nets quite funny to watch the guy that has 12 000 hours in the game spent you know five years of his life a quarter of his lifetime playing the game still misses empty nets it's a funny thing funny sight to see i think quite sad but everyone misses empty nets we're all human we are indeed all human bump for us let's round another guy you touch my teammate bob as well see we can do here let him touch this keep it in i really thought my team had to touch it i just got to block our our dangerous side here it should be there good follow play to open space again gonna get us some damage you can't reach it all right becomes a little bit dangerous when he misses that but that's a huge bump good job to make up for that that miss because it could have been really bad right i'm expecting that get that hit there and that guy got faked by him though which is the only good part about that and then a good bump to follow up so it all worked out in the end good games though hope you guys enjoyed
