yo what's up guys so i'm finally back from sweden i'm gonna be playing some 2v2 soloq right now i haven't played much twos i'm still 1753 right now so we're actually not even ssl so we'll be on our road to ssl try to grind this get back up there and uh yeah let's have some fun see how it goes all right the first game we got ourselves neo against next w and karma sweaty game straight off the bat here it's always weird coming back from playing in europe and playing uh a land straight back into ranked like this always feels so different they're weird to get used to again it's a good win only just trying to beat them to that ball really i don't have to shoot that you know something that's really hard for a lot of people to learn is just that the idea that you don't have to always shoot everything you have to always go for a goal at all times sometimes though you're just playing it around the opponent working to slowly like break them down is a lot better ah i went for the perfect shot but he wasn't back yet i just misreading the situation a little bit it'd be okay should be able to score us ended up working out they both committed for that kind of another example what i was talking about right he didn't have a shot on that but he still went for the shot and i got them scored on so a lot of times it's better just to hit it around hit it back to the corner try to keep possession you know break them down slowly i think that's definitely the better option most of the time then drive up quick to him they can hit it away so i should have this really weird touch but honestly it works i don't think they're expecting it wait behind me isn't your first a challenge you fine don't take my time here i'm just gonna make backball again oh let's go try my teammate would be back in the spot where he'd deal with anything that's low on the net because i couldn't really challenge unfortunately but in hindsight if i could run that situation back i would just dove on the wall probably i don't think i would have reached the ball anyway so it really comes down to how if my teammate's rotation was there and it probably wouldn't have made the cut anyway tried to flip reset almost worked out they're quick here any kind of block is good should be won't be one now it's really quick here that's fine i like the idea they're shooting a little bit high it's all good though so good shot attempts ah to take the boost my bureau try to beat him here shove time on the ball now it's like a challenge the patience gonna wait right side if he wants to use me shot it's actually just straight in really good job for him i shouldn't really have challenged honestly it was like kind of obvious where that was going to go that 50. like challenging that doesn't really gain me that much i try to go for the bump right idea oh my gosh what a challenge i should not have worked probably but we'll take it instantly goes he's pretty much last man there too so i think it probably catches them off guard most of time if you're laughing and you go for something quick like that it's gonna catch some off guard everyone expects you to play that more patiently most of the time that's the better play there we go good job to control that this is legit like my first game back when i'm home by the way like pretty much my first two's game so feels a little bit weird i'm not gonna lie when i'm coming from just playing threes last little bit and n a plays very different in ranked nice job good good shot there really good example just playing it around last defender making it really weird do we go lead though two minutes left let's lose the ball for sure because it's 2v2 we should be okay i'm gonna wait across it took all the boost as well so in a really bad spot again just trying to dominate the resources good block shot right behind you off the wall to myself maybe good demo actually works pretty well though because even though i get demo to still really get set up for my teammate regardless it's gonna be really awkward for the last guy back plays it around the first guy as well it's a good shot too nice all right good first game pretty solid can't complain with that at all all right let's get to the next let's even keep it up get back to back dubs on the day and start off our first games back from sweden right see how it goes all right we got a super hard game here we got jamaican coconut who i'm not gonna lie i have not ever played with or heard other playing against wonder mic and karma so yeah this is going to be hard but uh we'll see climbing in works nice challenge i'm gonna go quick here not much boost so i can just try to stay on this take the boost here from wonder oh no flip but my mouth up doesn't go he's in a really bad spot trying to take my time that's like the only way we can score off of that so i tried to my time get the perfect shot but flip just right now it'd be a good situation for me i'm gonna fake this oh if i got that boost i've been huge i thought all the way back now could have stayed for some pads but it's just a tough situation to do that very interesting challenges uh company working though on two other one tried to fake it slow down a little bit i want to commit as well the challenge unfortunately it's a hard situation to be in someone has the ball full control in the corner like that especially someone good like one of mike you have to play a little bit more patient though your instago in a situation like that you're gonna get uh be almost almost all the time i'd say but it's hard especially if you're not used to playing players that do stuff like that that last night positions definitely um tricky one to learn and the way these people play it in in twos is honestly very odd a lot of the time they're super aggro super super risky ends up working too a lot of the time it's a cool explosion you play again the corner just a bad challenge again from them and same situation pretty much the opposite way all comes down to how you challenge in the in the corner i think most time it's better just to stay on the ground and wait a lot of times it does work out better place off back wall so you can't really go now just to hit it high again most likely if i stay on this gotta watch the demo though yeah everyone likes to do that in the higher ranks these days so that was a good situation i was very really unlucky honestly because they bumped each other and then it bumped them back into play so that's a goal for us but that was a good situation for us what i was talking about i just waited on the ground and was shot i waited on the ground and um you know i was able to get a really easy clear out of that just by waiting i don't know why it's on caps take the boost here take the ball as well let him hit it that's not a big deal hits it again never really going to be a goal to that so one of the situations you can kind of just let them have the touch nice good challenge all done i was hoping he'd be able to be middle but is hard excuse me obviously it's going to be a goal but hard for him to know that i was going to go there perfectly it's fun not a big deal i might get beat to that i just got it clear try to stay back while here i want to flip away i think it's better to stay on the ground and stay on the spot that you know i can react to whatever goes wrong there as well again just being patient situations that look awkward if you play patient most of the time you don't give up your your position early you're gonna be in a good spot that's the way i think about it at least most of the time when you get scored on it's because you're committing as last man in like a really risky way here is our 1v2 for a long time which is not good obviously but teammate came back helped me out it's a good challenge although it's bad because i'm falling for a bit he has to go for me here it works i'm gonna get some pads gotta chill behind him like 40 boosts really good beats here i think this boosts huge i really have no way out after that and a bump was pretty big ah i don't know if i can get back that's unfortunate yeah again just playing patient in that situation is huge because they want you to die most of the time that's the thing yet that like you have to try to understand and like try to always think about when you're in a situation they want you to dive they want you to be the one to make the mistake right so right here same thing play patient i come out with the ball come up with another big hit as well gotta get back quick here my team has to play this smart now it's really on him good job open good work jamaican coconut goat well done well done all right good games for today any favor before you leave here uh that that seems like bait i don't know nah nah i'm not gonna do that it's too it's i don't know i don't know what he's trying to photoshop there so i'm not gonna do that uh but yeah i hope you guys uh enjoyed the video have
