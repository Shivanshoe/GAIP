well so we'll look through on twitter and on youtube for the video and i'll be shouting you guys out there so uh yeah definitely follow me on twitter if you haven't already and link me your montages you guys link me on youtube link me on twitter wherever it may be but make sure you add me on twitter if you're doing on twitter yeah let's get to the answer today hopefully we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right so the first game got ourselves cauli let's see how this goes i feel rusty in the on the ones right now i feel like i'm gonna play dumb but we'll see this guy's about to be an absolute legend he's gonna challenge good aggression from us good to save from him i'm gonna take my time here let the ball come to me i was playing that super aggro i was kind of surprised that he even tried to go for it but we'll take it so what i'm doing there just think behind the ball reversing just baiting him in so pretty much if i can make him go toward that ball aggressively with low boost and i get that around them it's going to be a goal every single time so it's a good thing to do if you know that you have the boost advantage if they have the boost though you're kind of just inviting them to win the challenge that's how i see it at least oh that's a little unlucky tried the bum bum bumping to come through though i'll try i'm trying to block this shot good vehicle nice demos are open once just drive into your opponent free goal i'm gonna cheat here did the fake kick off wait for the bounce all right i think he faked up too early yeah picked up a little bit too early so it was gonna be a fake and i know that as soon as his flip runs out he has no more threat in the air like if he's falling down there with no flip i have nothing to worry about the thing that makes a fake jump like that threatening is when you your opponent knows that you still have your flip that's why like a fake off flippy set is huge it's like a really good fake to do because it's scary it's dangerous trying to get the kill couldn't get it if i hit it high though he's gonna have a hard time getting a really good shot out of this so i could just wait i messed up yeah i was trying to get those i control myself i could just like pass to myself pretty much and dribble it out but not what i wanted i fake challenge a little bit too deep as well i think just made him be able to get a free shot of it take our time to the right here it's fine i didn't flip into the challenge at all so i get another shot angle i'm gonna get right away it'll be my ball just take the back boost something catch up to this it's fine it's sounding super aggressive every time i slow down he's kind of just diving in and losing the whole like defensive play straight away so if i just take my time i think he's going to keep on diving in really fast there we go he's playing just a little bit too risky just a tad bit too risky and i think the more i adapt to how he's playing the easier it'll be to get goals try to take this game off a little bit slower as well here i'm not going to boost for the rest of it i still have 30 and i can just go for the the goal straight up most likely there we go that's a nice little shot to the saving ones as well you do a speed flip for the first pad and then you save all your boost after that that's kind of what i've been doing in threes um that's not it obviously but i'm gonna fake this and go to the boost instead i'm not playing for a goal there on zero boost but i know that he is full it's a good challenge i know he's awkward on the wall there the fake the spicy fake i know i couldn't get a good shot so just left it put it off my own back wall you can't shoot directly off this i'm gonna get two pads maybe even three five time i do so i'll just fake challenge here get him to pop early and i'll go for the challenge good damn that's a goal not enough time the ball rolled down for him probably uh maybe if i pre-jump right that's unlucky let's get away from him he knew i had the prejudice i actually put that very patient considering the situation like i could have jumped away earlier because he could have had a free goal and a free shot way early put it as patient as i could until the very end there get them i'll take it back to my side eiffel boost i don't need to take time going for the boost have a better timing if i just go for the quick play here should be fine i can just block them nice soft touch to myself that's smart good demo again i'll take my time wait for the bounce i know you can't go obviously it's safe from him it's better to throw in some like delay like make a little you're out of boost and then go for energy but then just a straight up air dribble that sticks to your car these days people are just too good defending that okay honestly like i overthought that situation quite a bit i thought i didn't go for low 50 again but i could have pre-jumped that and saved it pretty easily it's a good flick for him but he's just taking like a long time to shoot on some of these plays so it does make you overthink a little bit because of it that was good that was a really perfect fake challenge to bait out the play there let me go for a demo maybe try to catch him off guard but it's fine and good fake challenge just going close like closing the distance between me me and the ball makes him have to panic a little bit if he goes for this that's honestly fine can't score off the situation quite yet so there's no threat i'm trying to shoot this one more touch on goal he has to jump here to the side it gives me the ball again that situation is not bad either i'm gonna hold on to 30 boost here play for the other boost i don't want to go for the goal straight off the bat it's a good touch because you can't shoot off this it's gonna be a wasted play nice i'm gonna go to the wall here nice good game play this song i'm gonna go for the the fancy goal though last second oh wait doable pain all right good first game let's get into the next one let's even get the back to back dubs it's probably gonna be him again we found this game instantly i'm trying to get back up to the top 20 and ones right now i think we're getting close so let's keep it up let's get into the next one all right guys someone keeps canceling on me i literally cannot find a game every time i better find a game someone just cancels them might be the same person we just played i'm not sure so let's get into the next one i'm just gonna play some twos for the last game let's get into it see if we can end on the dub in 2v2 see how it goes all right for this news game i'm testing out high stiffness it's been a little bit since i've used it but i remember i used to like it for me the biggest like advantage size of this has got to be the shooting the shooting feels oh not the best start not the best start but it's okay it's okay it does happen he was a cheater there so he should have just drove into the ball he knows he's lost back for bix i just never kick off but it's okay it's a simple mistake and it's one that we can just brush off five seconds into the game only a lot of time to come back gonna go for the boost here get the demo let him go for this himself better than me messing him up there we go covered both the high end low option teammate traded with the opponent so we should be fine for a sec here it's fun we're gonna go up the wall put it over one pretty much boost didn't come back unfortunately it's okay it's a good 50 though not bad are we behind you there's one more so i can just wait teammate seems to want to dribble this so i'll let him now becomes a little bit awkward because he messed up but it's okay just toss the high ball got the bump as well should be a shot at the very least a decent 50 51 of them it's gonna be there for that so i gotta wait made him wait on that go for a chip off back wall try to play it around them good play from him be patient on that maybe a shot here good try wait for the roll roll-up good patience they're just playing through patient on defense right now but we can get a goal here if we keep the pressure getting into the corner i know i can't shoot that so better to play it safe good fifties i think it gets grown eventually here i think if we just keep this up one of these shots gonna find the back of the net another high ball see he does here's a motorcycle just wait that's fine again i don't mind if he misses this or if he panics on this ball teammate's gonna get the next touch most likely oh he wants me to it's fun did my teammate get that nice they haven't had anything too threatening yet still okay that was extremely laggy so i i like had to go to the side a little bit to make sure i was reading that correctly i couldn't tell what was gonna come with that looked super weird for a second i'm pretty good though okay off because it goes straight to my teammate it's what you want in the situations not a terrible idea to go for a shower trying to catch them off guard could definitely work a situation like that oh teammate turn for mid boost okay i did not expect that or so i would not have done what i did there put that a little risky if i knew the situation fully trying to fake the low should have a shot here close room for the top bin snipe good 50 off the water my teammate here's a lot of time here you should control this ball nice are we behind me it's only about high stiffness giving this placebo that it feels more consistent that like everything feels more consistent like your touches and stuff i really think that's like all in your head should be fun oh let me get the beasts go alone here the two special twos player special launched one downfield you're backflipping it's just in there we go the high stiffness shot cross mapper i saw he's pushing a little bit too far out so i took advantage of it awkward but we can just wait on this played over one the pages from us we don't have the boost though it's super unlucky my team is still not back so we got to play smart on this next few balls nice play back all the way see if he does with that try to challenge teammate again turn okay so i'm like having a really tough time reading what he wants to do because every time i think i should go he's turning as well just one of those games good dunk should have time to shoot this there we go replacement so we like to see almost the back left try to get back left for him it's time to control now that should be eagle that's the the beauty of being able to lose the key off either way left or right if your teammate wants it uh you can get it to them you have a player like justin on my team for example if i lose a bag left to him he's gonna get a really good solo play going forward it's a good way to start off the the next playoff kick off right yeah good game for today guys hope you enjoyed like i said uh make sure you do upload your montage that you guys want me to
