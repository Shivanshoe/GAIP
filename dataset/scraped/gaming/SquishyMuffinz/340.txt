you before I get into the video guys I'd like to say thank you guys for all the support lately it's been absolutely insane we've gained like twenty five thousand subs over the last like ten days which is ridiculous I've never had that before in this channel so thank you guys for being a part of that you guys really want to see me reaching million subs it seems so if you like to help me continue along that journey if you're not currently subscribed go down below the video right now press that subscribe button and press the bell next to subscribe but now is notified when I upload a brand new video yeah you guys fall support let's get into the video yeah you know some guys came back with some more road to grand champ games we finished off at 721 MMR last time which is I believe it's still sober if not the beginning of a gold we'll find out in this video I think we might run into some goals you might be in the back end of silver right now so we'll see 721 MMR we're close to 1 km are ready we're not even halfway through the placement games yet so we're on track to get through this road pretty damn speedy not gonna lie yeah then you guys follow support on the previous ones I'm glad you guys have been liking them but let's get into some more for today and let's see if we can finally hit some aerials if we're allowed to hit some areas there were plenty people who can Tyrael that means we're not the kind of aerial as well so let's get into it alright so we're playing a 401 507 and 450 so I think these guys are also very mid silver right now so we're gonna probably play I'm guessing you're playing a gold play right into this video but I still don't really see any of these silver players going for your aerials at all that guy just won on the backboard like really high that's a good sign I'm gonna tap this on go okay these guys already have really good control their car I could tell I think my teammates might be one of those toxic keys I just took like a weak shot on purpose to see you in the big nice shot at me what I didn't mean to you oh they're good they're good okay they're good this is good this is good I like this that means I could do more okay we're rockin with you too much dough we're gonna let him hit it to us still wait for his touch teammate should have definitely left that ball it's all good gonna flick it early and we'll flick it again again that's a little much but we have space if you have space use it I would say if you're in this rank you know you're probably not gonna have dribbling skills like this but you know take a touch to the side try to go for a chip shot on goal or something I probably should have done that instead but that's just a muscle memory thing that I'm trying to turn off but it's very hard to turn off you guys don't understand how hard it is try my best oh here it's gonna be nice down once we get into like diamond cuz we could do a lot more how much I don't lose any games in this whole series by the way guys that's the goal but if we start losing I don't know if I should like kind of cheat and like go a full sweat mode just so we don't lose kind of much I don't know when we get to like champ ranks I probably to play normal to give you guys tips as we go we'll see we'll see how you hope you feel like you open this and I could beat him to it don't want to follow that again though nice I was shy popped it up they're gonna panic for this team I can turn it might be a free goal close try I'm gonna fake him so you're kind of panics I could just okay he may shift probably left that if your teammate is turning toward the ball like I am a straight straight on path to the ball there just let me have it that one it's all good I mean I get it we're still chilling out here and silver I get it people don't really know what I have teammates have time all right dude we're about to lose also imagine you wrote it to Smurf I kind of want to run into this where I'll be kind of funny we run into some Smurfs is like tryharding and then we could try hardback I can't wait dude get rich eat in here so I'm take a touch the side it's guys playing a full-time goalie let's just pop them so he does I'm gonna do some bad aerial here this is your they do panic ensued a little bit you need to sit aside is one more problem it's fine so you said let him give me the ball back at that point Bounty Killer still full control of the ball the 50 and teammate could take this I'll let him have it well that I'm have it okay so he cut me off what he should do it and then when he should have one he took a long time to actually go all right he missed a  so I'm gonna just take that for me now thank you sure he's okay this is like classic I miss these good old days right this guy's mad are you kidding me oh I can't as I love the way name's Kevin people work people are gonna just roast they won't be themselves you know I mean if they know that it's like a youtuber they're gonna pretend to be like they're not gonna be toxic alright it's still one one though all right yeah okay we're gonna try to get a goal back you just get one I faked that I'm gonna play it off the wall here see what you making do all right let's try easy just trying to shot fake them she does and we go for the second one I gotta buy two there to make them go for this Elise open it up middle it's fine hit off the wall and then if they miss this I'll have a free shot nice she does I gotta wait for the bump teammates really far back anyway I let him go all right I don't know why I marry link so high for that let's kind of just the muscle everything as well but I lose this game so we have to get one goalkeeper there we go just dripping this thing for their touch not the best session I mean there see this is hard when like you're tired I know I can't do the things that I want to do and I'm trying to like limit myself I don't want to like overextend and just score a free goal but at the same time I want to win so I was like I don't know Tina I'll let him have it okay you missed the kick I love this so funny because this guy missed three empty Nets this game but he was still trying to blame me even though I was like setting about forgetting for Shaun's know I'm a guy like that and honestly if you are someone who does do that what what do you really gain there what do you really gain from from like trash-talking your TV you're just gonna make them upset they're not gonna want to play with you did I mean it's like you don't get anything you're not gonna make them play better bye bye trash-talking you know it's not here I love having the chaton for this stuff I want to see the size let's see we're gonna stay we're gonna stay for the spice here I'm gonna drop a leaf I eat him what to do 43 points out of that cheese I was big points 764 all right we're 764 now that was the silver 3 on our team so we're definitely into gold right now I'm done to me but thank you we're 764 now so we're easily into gold might even be getting close to plat I'm not sure what the MMR is between each rank I think I might be like 300 200 mm are between us rank but yeah that's pretty pretty game you ever played a gold there are Gold's yeah let's get into the next all right so the MMR slowly and slowly getting higher and higher we're playing to five sixes in another team in a 520 on our team can't go on the wall for this so you guys are all gold we're playing golds now so the first episode was brought in second with silver and third has been golds so we're we're gradually gradually climbing should toss this one up the great everyone's getting better at challenging to you I'm not gonna Ariel for this quite yet I'll just toss it on goal see what they do see like they're getting they're getting better with their car control I'm being able to boom the ball you could tell good bump that's good job you go for that Oh big miss nice touch my teammate I'm gonna wait all right I'm just gonna pop this off the back let's see who does I think the guy and that's gonna miss my prediction I didn't miss okay getting workers to say I liked it I did a simple double jump I didn't even boost their hope my bad teammate sorry brother trying to get in the way of that team it shouldn't hit that off the wall you want to kind of try to control those balls that are in the corner like that because if you hit off the what are you doing you just send it your failure team right nice block try to yeah okay fellows play down I'll just go for a just a pop up here the city this how it controls that alright so the same the same kind of stress still works restoring a high hard shot on target so it still works I'm not sure if that's Spanish it looks Spanish why does that look Spanish definitely not English was a good touch for them I don't know that guy said unfortunately mildew up there for this middle C nice ok so everyone's getting way better like you could tell in comparison to bronzer this is a huge upgrade this guy's kind of reeling honest touches so I'm gonna try to kind of Ariel in mine as well looks like a half Ariel you start to get a little less grounded now that's a good touch in a kind of Ariel for it touch there and I hit off the wall now teammate can maybe try to go for that nice yeah I'll hit this across my seen it as well that's fine - Misha get I could take a boost you don't want to cut from your teammate here let them try and then if you get too beat like I have a free ball none to deal with nice bumps you had about me to you there my teammate in Turkey that's team is gonna touch again so I'm gonna try to keep an eye on everyone really cuz I know everyone likes to cake sure they're off in this rink so just be aware who's gonna go for what my child lets come to me hit off the wall once it's fine I don't want to go for something to to nuts in terms of dribbling I'm just trying to bake them in okay guys ready up some in a way as a good touch like this guy's pretty solid of this touches you can already tell I'm gonna say my 30 boost here grab theirs nice I'm gonna back flip this shut I bump this guy he jumped a little slow to that so I couldn't get the bump but it was a right idea suited us here nice try for my teammate press writes him yourself play off the back sounds gonna panic most likely yeah and then I could just slow down nice touch you're gonna have it on the wall oh sorry teammate my bed my bed everybody was that close trying to get the Beast see what they do I'm something about for them not wait right here if they hit it back to me per sheets which they did so I'll just play it back off the backboard again he's might just hit the straight back to me whole dashes Internet oh that's internet dude I don't have that happened he must have pinched it edited pitch the last thing I thought was gonna happen my team it wasn't there I went straight back to me a little bit unlucky that guy's name is unlucky look at that okay what up a net I'm gonna fake him first to make him get this play up the wall that's nothing want to go for 20 aerials here okay they're trying to go in the wall already so you didn't see anyone going for the wall and bronze take a lot people just don't know that you can go on the wall yeah so you don't really see people trying to do it I was a good 5050 for my teammate let's eat up a bit here you should almost always be cheating as well but not too close cuz maybe she too close and the ball was above your head you can get back to it so I had that too faster than I can't get that teeny one as well I should have waited lost my foot as well brother it's fine wait for his touches were they gonna really gonna do with the equals probably nothing not playing high ranks right now they're not gonna bang these shots give me a probably shouldn't win for that considering I'm still right next to the world but it's fine I'll let him go again he's already landed there why not let's see what they do I'm just gonna win on defense here let's see it off the wall I'm away for a shot let's see if they got the the bang ish not quite pass to my team all that he's closed you I didn't want to just shoot off that I want to see if he can get a an aerial shot out of that all right good game there we got 40 more points and we still we still have yet to lose you got 40 points out of that game when there be nicely into 800mm or now one hundred and four MMR so we might be into play I'm not hundred percent sure but we're playing gold players pretty consistently now which is pretty nice so I think in the next video a price are playing platinum players and yeah that'll be a pretty pretty smooth pretty smooth gradual increase in rank inch video first video played bronze second silver third gold fourth will probably be Platinum's at least in the second and we'll start playing Platts I think and there's already two gold tubes in that Lobby so yeah we'll probably playing pots already and by the end of our placements I think we'll be into diamond so yeah pretty good stuff hope you guys enjoyed like I've mentioned in the previous videos thank you guys for all the support it's being absolutely insane
