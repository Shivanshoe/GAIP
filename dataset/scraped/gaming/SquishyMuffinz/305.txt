and then we got an extra win that secured us champ - getting us into division 2 so hopefully today we got two more wins get-ups champ - div 4 and get down much closer up the champ 3 and even closer to grand champs so let's get into it let's even get some dough for today let's go oh no dude oh no dude Riggins Juche or Josh and pika and we have merciless tiger that we played before well one of the guys on our team we have no idea we've never played in but I know merciless tiger seemed to be pretty solid when we played them last time so see sliding McGee seems to be making mistakes josh is on the batmobile now merciless oh god all right we're all making mistakes in here so far hope you lose after me all right see I got over - that's huge clothes could try in the shot I like that idea I play this left side city does I have a idea Tim I should have this I'm going to trust him play this left side again there's space there I know there is - can't really do a whole lot with that I was nice like him to get beat a ball but it's fun oh this might not be fine now Gary good good patient write to me I don't wanna be the one that says middle because I know I can't score play left side I seem to go straight middle I did solid though he's not gonna miss those gonna have that nice from a teammate that's fine wasn't the greatest touch but it still dealt with the danger pretty well I'm not gonna miss those off the corner anymore really got to do more to how to play them now this ranked players are playing you should go for this ball alright ever seen it go I can't do anything should I leave it let's play defense hardcore defense ah dude he's the hard one in terms of the matchup it feels tough this feels tough but the good thing is absolute worst-case scenario if we lose this we should have a better matchup in the next yeah I'm gonna say yes so we know is that I can't score this actually might help me a little bit it's possible to win this though I haven't given up yet it's just definitely to be a tough one good song because these guys are definitely solid clothes try to make it as easy as possible to shoot put up to the wall gonna be their teammate trust them Oh are we good double no we needed that go in let's go everything's not hire a telescope we absolutely needed that so bad that's the shot that goes in oh my god how's the mid left all right we have a chance of this nah I definitely did pledge there's a little bit more solid because the pika dude like I had nobody's grand champ so I know he's a lot tougher to play against so shut up nice around me it's fun I got the boost and you messed him up which is good I'll talk about this he may be able to shoot it he'd be like closer but I was tough for him to be ready for to be fair I'm gonna challenge us cuz even though it gets over me hopefully my teammates will get surely not they surely not dude this is why I don't wanna be first challenge this is why I don't want to be the first challenge this so I kind of fight as far back as possible because I just don't trust I don't trust it aha huh I did everything I could be okay touch a teammate okay dude young god wait young hold tightly on balls he did [Music] get it first for what or last then I went in so technically was an old bull okay that ball is all the way our side teammate please brother I just can't do it dude I can't do it I can't do it it's just this is just impossible it really is impossible you can only account for so much missing you can't you kiddo love you so much oh man please give yourself in your game we need everything we can get I'm gonna play this middle teammate come on brother mm got score those it's close too close so it's okay so I'll get definitely close all right come on go for the ball let's go teammates we got it we got it come on after back to the do a little bit panic teammate come in it's fine oh boy I can't shoot this though right there right there teammates I believe keep it up I believe teammates more right there oh that was things that one stings oh not much more have done if I'm fully honest fully honest with you not much market I'm not going to be too upset about that as tough very very tough to win almost impossible but it's fine I'm go out to the next one once the next one Good Vibrations only let's get on to the next and hopefully get a dub back to where they were and start this all right guys we desperately desperately need Redemption after what we just went through so please there's some new players in this lobby do me a favor and score every possible chance that you have just one just one be three for me please right there bang always faking okay this has good we're gonna win this thing this guy's smart are definitely better than both the other team last night again nope if I ever say stuff like that no offense to the guys like in the previous game at all literally at all it's just that their ever more like in this game mode it doesn't necessarily reflect their skill like the dude they're playing right now is probably not actually champ to player or the guys on our team probably not actually like a champ - he's probably better than that yeah I mean it's just because so standard not everyone has like their proper rank yet so it is a little messed up the lobby's ill get sometimes this win would be really good though if you want to get the series done I'm not a quitter I don't want to quit on it the random camera settings that challenge is actually genuinely impossible this challenge it's not impossible it's just very difficult just because it is random we're gonna get your team and wasn't not they'll be able to you know score the chances that you won't be able to score cuz you can't score straight down literally wide open brother let's go dude he's actually there for that he scores that's what I like to see my team in at 8 points but he doesn't need to do anything it's all good it's not about the points you get to be in the position you need to be in if there's no balls that you have to go for for an entire game don't go for any balls it's simple as that that's 50 got the bish me but it's finite 55 so he should be behind me nicely done nice you're gonna have it touch just fun go for kill you huge demo let go - spirit huh we could definitely still lose this lead so I got to be a little more careful than how I've been being yeah as simple as that I just I leave defense for a second and definitely definitely the loser will lead how'd it be more careful hopefully we get some buffer goals here and get one more goal be nice definitely visible nice touch he should be a little closer you played it around to like middle I did it back as quick as possible just in case I'll get bombed I almost messed them up middle again wide open shot but good try it was it was tough an angle just coming in on but definitely horrible fast left oh you're wide open again your job well done well done alright this is what we like to see guys this is what we like to see we could definitely take the dub here and let's get back to earth to start of the video I feel like no progress is made when you know you lose one you win one which sucks because you just go absolutely nowhere after two games but it's fine better than losing two gonna go for the vault I would like to get that people touch my head back here the decent that's right see now go straight back though I'll be back to the Beast you should leave this for me play off the back trying not to double tap that but this is so terrible now only downside to that again I easily swore that if I could shoot I just double it pretty easily but good block there to me a little bit weaker than I thought it would be but it's gonna be a hard read for me to miss nice place off the corner or off the walls fun to mints are both dead anyway so there's no follow-up regardless doesn't really matter nice it's gonna be there for that I played above them team it should come in a cha go for a kill you ox I'm gonna go back well my team install the wall so I want to aggress as well with that fake challenge just you get the ball bag take it back for patrol this way what oh it's a European server okay never mind that ball literally went through my car oh my wait excuse me I appreciate how the other guy had it I was in goal all right fifty-five seconds one goal buffer I'm chillin it so far back for the remainder of this game huge dude let's go all right I like to see this guy's kind of toxic will lied to you it's a European way though the European right boy asks for every time a European servers there's one quick chat spammer minimal go for this beat them off the backboard should be open if someone's there it's not there for ya I'm gonna go straight back then we blocked up the angle at least so if it was on target and had it covered got a bump on one out of a bunt - oh it's going Twitter go are we good we're shilling I didn't know how to knock the score that so I'll just try my absolute best oh no dude I'm getting too risky I'm just I move it up too far and then that stuff happens cuz my TV goes it trusts other teammate habit why so they didn't trust the toys no dude please okay holy my heart this is too much to you this is too much for me back up back up - pretty much where we started off the video I'm pretty sure let me just check please sure around the same we're one mm are less than we started the video offense oh that's great absolutely but yeah hope you guys enjoyed we're back up the champ - Dave - off of that that's not it's not terrible but it's not great either we still got quite a ways to go we got probably like five to ten more episodes depending on how much we lose hopefully we don't lose that much more but you know we can only control so much obviously we're not playing perfectly but it's kind of hard when we have so much muscle memory you like based in on just trying to choose many shots as possible on target and then eventually let them make mistakes I can't do that I can't play that play start this trick play off just beating the opponent like around the walls and stuff it's just hard in general that's why it's just a little bit uncomfortable for me but either way we got back up to a chance to give - which is a very big achievement in my opinion in this challenge it's a tough thing to reach I won't lie to you so Santa is a very random mode so being able to reach this without scoring a single goal is a pretty tough thing but I hope you guys enjoyed having some wonderful day tour never timing is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe so you guys all in the next one I love you peace you
