i'm not sure how to say that i'm gonna call him nitu but he's an artist's x major elite it's pretty crazy it's a it's pretty hard to make i think he's from south america based on the ping 160 i think it's south america i don't think that would be europe i don't know though but it's gonna be a solid game for sure both players are good but the bump that's huge because that guy can't go for that bump on gimmick right there it kind of forces uh his whole play earlier than he wanted it to let him hit that my nose just got so itchy thank gosh man this is never happening in lcs where my nose just gets itchy i feel like i'd be so sad rather save the ball and my nose just gets itchy good shot from gimmick well done i don't know what he did but he's a magician what can't he do 1v1 actually i killed time for him to get back head over one let him hit that should be okay as long as gimmick wins this ball but you can rely on him too he's quite the speedy player nicely done and he gets the pass middle as well very well done i should use my stick to look left so the shot didn't look so sketch because i try to go super quick to that for no reason and score at the earliest possible moment when i add a little bit more time again that's something that like if you're in comms it's gonna be a lot easier to to know right if no one's up for that obviously they'll just say you have time and then you could take your time on the shot let us bump here nice kind of kind of rude the double demo there but happens happens you gotta do what you gotta do you know this game mode does entail a lot of demoing i mean i think we all know that when we're signing up for it and unfortunately i think they're tilted uh i don't know what's been going on with these games lately this is the state of our yeah i don't know you want ff all right well i guess they're over it already sadly so i don't really know what to do i guess we can just cut to the next game because this one uh seems to be chocked unless hold on no it's shocked yeah let's get the next game all right so hopefully this game's a little bit better and they played for a little bit longer i don't know what happened last game but we'll play three games for today i'll play with martha's because that other one ended way too early that works so well man one thing i learned from europe like complaining that ranked in europe during those two weeks was they love shooting low like that and it works so well because everyone pre-jumps the perfect shot and it's actually smart it's like the bad shot is better than the good shot these days because the good shot gets saved every time oops yeah i'm not done he he actually made a big mistake like on his wood reset the way he landed i thought he's gonna be able to have a flip but i tried to block the actual flipper set path and because he messed up worked better like i said same concept messing up works better than not messing up these days the bad shot's a lot better than the good shot you'll see that a lot of ways you watch pro games you're wondering like how did that just become a goal more often or not it's because it was like a big whiff or like a big mistake and like no one read that the mistake could happen like that should be getting spawn close i didn't see the second guy there so i'm trying to block the first and second guy kind of caught me off guard spine force one of those waste all of his boosts pretty good like gimmick go nice all right airflow boost is actually really useful i'll probably be too much the simple would have worked better there for sure like just a simple play trying to hit a clip let's find any time on this better bump them give me a good demo actually it's huge i don't think i can get back unlucky a lot of time though it's fine this game's been kind of stale i feel like nothing's really happening a lot of just weird stuff going on to be honest but dudes can feel like that i don't know i feel like even like when i watch like the old two tournaments back like the lands and stuff i feel like it's really like the random stuff that you have to just adapt to i remember like when we won one universe open gimmick and i i don't know how many of you guys would have watched that back then but it's just so much random stuff going on there's a lot of whiffs a lot of weird stuff bumps two is just i feel like the extra space just leads some more randomness that's just like literally what i feel you would think it'd be the opposite like threes would be more more random because there's more people it's more chaotic you think but something about it to me feels like threes is way more structured and this is more just take turns soloing and trying to go for a bump every now and then and passing gets kind of um what's the word don't know i don't know how to explain it but passing is just bad like you just get super hard punished for passing most of the time also i'm recording this at 4am by the way guys i'm super super tired right now going to sleep in a minute i'm also not playing very good because of it but it's okay it's grind time let him hit it one more time it's fun leave that for gimmick now i'm gonna wait for his next touch spiders one more right here uh my time a little bit better is actually gonna be a goal shoot after that it's actually a good pass right behind let me go for a bump here i'm gonna go for a ball i want to try to see if i can get in his way but end up hitting the ball into me somehow it's a challenge not going to be a goal yet force them a little bit wide i should have just went i don't know why i thought he would just keep faking it i thought he would got scared by the fact that i could have went and then headed to the corner around me and that would be able to go again but i thought too hard about it it was a lot simpler that's fake played a round one maybe bump as well it'd be fine i should be able to get back oh my that works really well actually nice i hate the point system in this game i don't have more points to give it right now i feel like you should lose points for making mistakes i've made a lot of mistakes this game should not have more points than gimmick it's a bad bad game for me but it's okay we'll regain play on more hopefully do better let's get into it see how it goes all right 20 last game to end it off a common dapper very good final game here gonna be fun good demo let me go for another demo here why not i thought that would end the challenge there i'm surprised he didn't i could have definitely scored that that's fun i might have to save never know he's a once player he's seen that shot probably thousands of times good challenge he's gonna leave gimmick ball for a while which is good i couldn't see anything ah that bump would have been so massive on calm let's try to go for a bump on him it's really awkward though let him hit that and panic a bit limit that as well might just be straight in it's just unfortunate what can you do kind of what i was talking about in the past games i feel like that stuff just never happens in threes a 50 that go straight in like that super rare yeah through this game half may do anything with that ball where i was so i should have just left it probably that's again also why i like threes more because if there's like a ball like that it's really awkward to do anything with you leave it your teammate's there you can do like something crazy with it still in this mode it's kind of just you got to accept that you can't do anything with it and leave it just back off completely oh i will take that honestly i i didn't think i'd end up in a goal there but i will definitely take it these games are just further proving my point about twos but this stuff is truly just random i really think you could put like like whatever four pros in the lobby and just try to predict the matchups and you'll never get it right i don't think you'll ever get it right these games always feel so random wow thought it would at least care that i could have jumped and hit it around them but just playing the fake which is smart they're both awkward that's doubled absolutely not touch though nice good patience i was actually a really good spot to put myself in i kind of waited in the the best spot for wherever his touch would go and the balls above him you gotta try to picture their situation where the ball cam's at right and balls are just sitting above the upper there it's always gonna be super awkward for him to do anything with he's gonna think i'm coming in hot too probably most of the time it's a bad touch should be good for gimmick all right that could have been bad if it just fit this internet that would have sucked let's save i missed it's fine though let him hit that should be okay i think good fake actually really smart there much space he gave himself just like faking one time and he killed time for me to get the boost i don't know if he wanted to boost himself he might have but nice i like these touches from gimmick actually they're really smart because in threes completely fine to shoot that and twos not smart at all to shoot that so it's really good of him to the effect there that's what i love about three two i feel like you have constant chances because of that but in twos you have to pick and choose your chances really well nice again that's like a really good example of what gimmick is doing well right there i just did it as well i had time if i shoot this quick or try to take a bad shot it's really bad it makes like disrupting a net i stay in front worst case scenario gets 50 left or right i'm not playing good today but there's definitely little things that i'm still doing that are good like decision-wise and that's what you got to take from days that you're playing a little bit bad that's why i like showing days like this right i feel a little bit off because obviously i'm really really tired right now but yeah take the good from your games as well and days like today so good things that you're doing you just gotta look hard it's fine he's taking all the boosts not a big deal nice good games for today a lot of fun huge thank you to gimmick for playing and yeah thank you so much guys for watching i appreciate y'all having so wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and see it on the next one love you peace you
