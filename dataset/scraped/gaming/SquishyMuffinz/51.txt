yo what's up guys so a few videos ago we actually ended up asking johnny to 1v1 us and it was a lot of fun you guys really did seem to enjoy it and he had asked me for a rematch so we're doing a rematch for today should be fun let's get into it give me another best of three let's see how it goes i'm gonna take the blue team i'm gonna remind them it's the best of three all right we actually just won the the rss regional today which is super good we won the first regional of the the winter split it's a really important thing for us to win i have a big advantage points wise take my time here there we go let me good play probably for the right moment to actually take the shot on johnny there because he's really good at just like shadowing the play like that and if you make a mistake early on and give him something a little bit too early then he's gonna take advantage of it for sure you don't want to throw away the ball at midfield and give him a chance to get out with possession right and you're going to be fully committed at that point let me try to fake you off here yeah i ended up beating faze the new phase team which is um aj first killer in typical uh in the top three match and then the winner doll we ended up playing ssg in the finals but uh yeah that's two with daniel their new player typical had left for phase and they would play sip with daniel so he played all the new like so many new rosters we played gimmicks new team as well it's safe from us should have time to score this stuff went for the flippy set but that was a really good block from us we took advantage of him getting a little bit too underneath the ball was kind of obvious where he was going to go with it so kind of using his car's body language to my advantage there this is going to be a hard situation to stop probably you get a demo this one's on a good side for that actually it's a good challenge there i can still stand the ball off that probably the challenge from johnny should have this can actually shoot off of it but it was a good try i'll take these pads let's play it around though i don't get back to that so i don't want to like  him in on that not a good idea i'm gonna take my time there just in case because i don't want to like full rush and there's a chance that you know i end up just missing it's better to play it smarter there take my back boost here so you go backward the ground now all right good conversions we're doing well we're actually taking advantage of him making mistakes on these like slow air dribbles we're playing them really smart we're not diving too early i think it's a little bit unfair because i played rlcs today against the best teams in the world the best teams in na and obviously we ended up winning so i've had a lot of uh a lot of practice today obviously johnny hasn't played didn't play rs yesterday his team just missed out on the qualifier by a little bit but regardless he's still an incredible player and an insane 1v1 player as well the way he he likes to control the field is really good i'm doing a really good job at pretty much everything right now though i'm not making too many mistakes making it really hard for him to get in positions to actually score on me but he has two and a half minutes left so a lot of time to make a play and it is the best of three as well if you lose this game obviously he has another game to bring it back anyway i was about to push forward there might be a goal a good block he went all the way back so i don't have time here let's get a challenge that's a good job from johnny i thought me not thinking anything would fake him but i should have went for like a bounce dribble instead it's fine we're just heading up for the the brazil right see if we can get it he's probably gonna be more aggressive here he needs to just go try to create something good of him to go for a bump there i'll take a bounce dribble instead of what we did last time nice good to go low there take advantage of that situation actually it works for me i think still gonna be awkward but yeah it was better than what would have happened if you just shot it and scored obviously right i had a little bit of a chance to maybe bring it back get around it gonna put a lot of pressure on them and i can go for a bump here get possession back a fake jump here make him think i'm going i live unfortunately you almost scored off of that which is insane nice you gotta take my time there that's really a play actually go for the doink and then get a bump it's huge i'm trying to get a single jump kick off here so i can maybe follow it up and make that to the next you guys really seem to like this kind of video though like i said i'm down to do this other pros you got to give me examples of pros you'd like to see me do this with i'm fine with literally anyone though i don't mind i have a lot of fun doing these kind of videos i enjoy ones a lot especially against players that i know how they play and i can try to adapt to them and uh the better the challenge uh the more i enjoy it obviously johnny's a very very very good player and we have very close matches for some reason when we record though like when i'm recording these it's not as close as usual but there's always next game i think he'll he'll do better next match really clean first game though got a really solid lead here eight goals 30 seconds left i think we could say this one's in the bag but i just want to take this time to say a huge thank you to you guys for all the support on the channel as always i hope you guys enjoyed that watch tutorial i know tutorials in general don't get as much love as it used to for youtube on rocklin but i still would like to give you guys the option to to learn those things using my methods i still think it's a good thing to put out there for you guys even though i know tutorials definitely don't have the same level of popularity as they did a long time ago i don't mind making those videos for you they're fun to make for me as well but i really like the gameplay videos obviously you guys know it's my favorite uh kind of video to make these kind of videos especially the 1v1 ones where i'm actually playing with the another pro or just you know trying to learn someone's playstyle i love trying to adapt to playstyles stuff like that it's really fun for me good first game very solid one more win and we win this series a little mini best of three here if we lose we have one more chance will you start let's say from johnny there's his defense man so good very rare that his defense is not insane like it's super rare he's always always perfect on the goal line i swear oh which is the best time to challenge a lot of players like that these days you got to really switch it up yeah throwing some demos here and there might not be the most enjoyable way to score you know thrown in some demos but every top team now every single top team in the world those in those demos are very important the bumps and the demos you need them really good save i shouldn't have went for another touch there it was never really going to be good for me just to take a shot off of that i don't think he meant to double jump the way he did there i think he wanted that flip maybe his controller messed up i don't know very odd i'm gonna hit one nice i was kind of just keeping my eyes locked on johnny the whole time so literally i messed up the air drill but as soon as i went up i was kind of giving myself an opportunity to see where he was at i know i was never going up with the intention of continuing to air drop the whole time it's not really the smartest play from there i could save again this close no flip there interesting gonna be enough to to get a goal though i'm very surprised i didn't get a flip though made him wait made him have to respect the fact that i probably should have had a flip there it's normally enough in the situations put it around i can win this boost as well it's pretty important play to the mid boost i should come back in a second there it is i was waiting for trying to jump like a bump him but it works he knew there's no way he could say that at that point at the path of the the ball blocked i played around them yeah demo who should come back as well i was gonna play i was actually really smart i tried to sit in front of me there because you knew my like the path to net was blocked he had it blocked was a smart play but i can go obviously to the left or right of him we ended up doing that well go for a pinch to kind of delay him make him have to back off see he does here tried to fake me actually smart [Music] the second one was a little obvious but the first one was definitely good and he's coming in for like the attempt to like delay the shot there so i don't mind hitting it hard at him he's not gonna get a good like return touch back at me how do you go for a fake good save his defense you just you can never count on his defense it's actually insane check out the wall here again he just reads it every time it's a good touch he's gonna delay him and i get the ball back so i always try to play and once i try to play for like possession at all times it's a really good fake he has to go for a quick challenge there because again i have so much time so either he waits on the ground i get an urgent bump or he challenges where he did and you know there's a chance i can fake them so i think it's better to keep that close and they gotta go for an outplay and they get dunked right [Music] he's gonna wait he has control but it's fun cut off the wall path your bumps let's save this coal line defense always good always insane he's gonna destroy me here on the flippery set the fake i love how he just fakes it there pop one time you just like can't okay near the goal line against him i feel like it's super hard to just that's the most confusing thing i've ever seen it's super hard to just like catch him off guard by doing something he won't expect but like there's nothing you could do that you just won't expect from the goal i'm gonna try some weird thing again right here we go ground pop again okay i'm gonna go for another weird play a soft shot another shot that's what i mean i don't know how i have eight goals on him right now can i score this nice did we get 10 again can we do it 13 seconds i missed [Music] one more goal homer go doable keep it up he's not gonna keep it up all right that's fine we'll take it good games for today thank you johnny for playing and uh yeah it was actually a lot of fun we'll play somebody else for the next time we do this but let me know down below who you guys want to see and whoever i see the most i'll definitely try to get them from hope you guys enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you guys are watching this like comment subscribe but i see us on the next movie peace you
