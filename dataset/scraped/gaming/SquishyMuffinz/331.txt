let's reach one meal before the end of the year Thursday's show enjoy the video yo what's up guys in the last video we finished off at 1486 MMR which means if it went both games today will reach grand champ which should in theory and the road to grand champ but I want to record one more video after this if we reach you today that will showcase just what low grand looks like for you guys I'll play two games at like 1500 MMR just to show you guys what it's like in love grand champ and that would be the end of this series and then I'll move on to the next one which I'm super hype about but I'll get onto that once we're done this one but yeah let's get straight into the game for today and let's see what we can do let's go so - like a mid-range champ threes and our teammates almost load grand champ is $14.99 so I should be able to use them for some passes here I'll see already it is for 4 passes it's trough the wall like that yeah I'm gonna fake shout - Nolan last back here so I'm trying to give him a little bit of a scare forced him to give me the ball there for free like you did fortunately give us my teammate I'll be the left side he wants to use me it's fine mother to hit this away can you miss pass to the left to my teammate you could try in the shot maybe one more I was really like again I don't wanna challenge you I'm gonna fake challenge I did both with my timoshev for free I try to just play this down tough shot to take got to get killed a good look for kills on the way out and you're not doing anything useful most of the time in that position a little bit awkward I mean this is a pretty big defensive area that's a good touch also kind of bad because in to go to the corner but here you should have jumped like that ball is still bouncing if you just sit on the floor it's gonna come straight to you right I didn't call it early enough that's just my fault I might hit this one time just over that guy so you're my teammate can do one thing my team is doing a lot didn't mean a lot of what we teach right now so he's gonna four balls that you probably should be going forward because they're closer like that right there the opponent shouldn't have went for that because I'm already on the wall following that ball you should be waiting on me there for sure yeah my teammate went for two balls that you probably should have waited on just because they're a lot closer and if you get to be to a ball like that he's gonna land all the way on their side I'll let him take that he's aligned all the way in their side and I'm gonna have to deal with the warm b2 for a couple seconds which can definitely be tough which I look for my teammate middle here he's probably gonna be middle just some normal banger of a cash middle I'm trying to stay with this ball should I force him to come to me here nice to me gets it for free now close so he was forced to be baited in there I was gonna play slowing that down before oh my goodness I can't believe I just I just witnessed that that could've shot but I don't know why I didn't to be hunted I was trying to seal out the back again I could have just shot that I normally would have just shot that I don't know why I did it to be honest but that was mind-blowing that they both missed an empty now after killing me there I shouldn't think I killed last back that was a big mistake but good shot for my teammate to be there I think you went for a back boost they did and it just bounced off well for him and he should have went back to goal because again that's a very savable shot if you just go back shelf carefully I mean sure it deals with that yeah I don't want to just immediately shoot off a lot of these balls I feel like I was doing a little bit too much the previous episodes I feel bad but it's partially muscle memory and it's kind of hard I'm following it again see I just waited there and that that shot it was pretty much not dangerous at all just because quite a patient now that I let him hit it toward me stead of panicking for it - 2 D does with that that's over to my teammate nice nice hits job I love this picture of Jim I still have a cheese by my name in my picture but it's ok I'll Damon's idiot men not the best kick off there but good recovery for my teammate to save that I'm gonna wait for a bumpy ride to go off the top so bumpy like that I stay on the left side for past opportunity we're for the solo play that's fun to you gets the job done I just said middle and case of the Miss I know somebody can get her over this last guy to be propped at hi I think he was trying to shoot but you know some of the best passes are the missed shots I'm gonna stay in front of this ball timid should wait on the 50 there I should really go in with me I'm already in front of it cuz that 50 is most likely gonna spill right out to him so I'm trying to get the ball for free there pretty much made him force away team is going for an area that you shouldn't be going for because now look where you landed all the way over there and I would ever free shopping I'm gonna wait they're both kind of panicking a little bit you should be trying to control ball like that especially when they're 5-1 down you don't really want to be panicking too much in a situation like that yeah I was something demos at that point so no my teammate is full control of the ball it was good of him to slow down on that and I hit it away he's a good dribbler as well forget it around the guy that I couldn't kill that's so lady I'm gonna take the bish here hit it back don't be afraid to hit the ball back as well I feel like a lot of people are afraid to pass back but you shouldn't be icing back she's really good opens up a lot of space for your team I'm gonna fake this again let him hit it over to me out and though she likes to panic a lot like he's going super quick two lousy balls they should be more patient on so I'm kind of letting him make bad touches here thought I'd kill him help my teammate out I made him stop which is good I gave my teammate the green like a challenge shall I get it middle to make it take I get behind them city does give me a fifty probably another 50 okay couldn't quite reach one more goal I believe I'm popping it up I'm going again on the way get in there Oh imagine this pinch it straight in well play it off like I've got 14 points from that so that brings us to exactly fifteen hundred MMR I don't think that ranks us up there yeah it's fifteen fifteen yeah okay so we need 15 more MMR exactly so if you would the next one then we secured ourselves GC so let's get into it and let's see if we can catch the Dove that we going for this whole time because we haven't lost a game yet so I want to check after this exactly how many games it took if we reach it how many games it took to reach grant shape without losing we're playing to 1500s so they're just about to be grand champ and our teammate is a grand champ low grand champ I'm gonna fake this take this you got a number one but over two Oh I was kind of nice but halfway through it I kind of didn't want to score God decided that did I don't know I was weird then I miss him they own gold kind of hard at the fence something like that but someone should have been on the backboard if you're on the backboard for a situation like that you could say that easily it's a big tip if someone's going for a slow double tap like that just position backward like don't jumper like I jumped super earlier there and it just it just gave me so many options look at early he jumps here I could jump up and be into this and get a shot and he's I could be able to react and goal for that so I'm backward you got to play it more patient that situation like that my team is going so wait he'll take the booster so I should try to interfere for my teammate to make a try on my controls little wall here pinching didn't have any boots so I just want to throw it to them and see what they do oh okay my position here was bad there to be honest I didn't think he'd shoot because I'm in a position where I could Challenger pretty easily so I'm for the fake challenge attempt committee moves in there half of that point and then they just shot it over me I really didn't expect him to do I thought he would think I was doing something different he's right straight for the shot which works over the bump serious the 4-sided is boosts and his touches I popped it up for my teammate deke backflip I heard him jump but sadly not to go for it so that's the low grand champ and he's still struggling with those kind of wall reads so a lot of a lot of these players are still not comfortable in terms of getting this reason awkward spots from the balls above them they're just not comfortable so still that skill of being able to bang the ball high like this I guarantee they're both gonna miss at least both panic what da hell so my team misses before on a ball that was slower than that but I popped it off the backboard and he's up for that in time to shoot like actually a really good shot I don't know it just seems very consistent that's probably the biggest issue that you'll find is just the inconsistency it's really just being stuff to back again to see what they did dear see he misses that one it was a little harder to be fair to him the patient's I like that he waited on that I didn't panic probably didn't think I had a flip still to be honest about like they didn't panic regardless sudhi does here so just getting this way being annoying I think I can go against all the weight first touch or fifty they just sit aside I want to go for that white yet to be honest I didn't use any of my boost we're trying to see if I can fake them without having to waste my position okay I don't wait well you know danger in that unless I I'm making a dangerous situation by challenging bad it's over one over to pop the middle for my teammate all I do is pop it up once light little touch over the last as soon as I saw you challenge nothing too crazy the simplest stuff is the stuff that's the most effective in this game I swear be able to hold on to your boosts make them think you're outta boosts and just get a really good shot of a situation that they're not expecting is super underrated school B honestly man being this close to grant Shep now it just feels like a lot of mistakes I'm seen can be so easily fixed with just free play like just a lot of free play and you'll fix a lot of this stuff a lot of it seems mechanical you can picture decision making anytime but the mechanics is something you have to work on gradually just to get it over him think of try to just play out the wall can't get around it in time try the dunk there and wait for his touch now play off of it real quick probably up faster than him I heard he was tapping his boots and you didn't it fascinated so that ball so he's never gonna beat me and that's traditionally up to panic I gotta hit it around ups and know ease up with me good dunk I'm gonna fake challenger didn't panic at all I like that oh I'm gonna join this comeback comeback easy to come to us nothing you missed surely he comes to us surely he scores I always join you in those and grant blobbies I'll be streaming and like the entire lobby we'll just turn to one big just centipede of course like two people will do that I'll join in and another person will join an entire to be two lobbies just joined in doing that kind of happened in three see you ever just stops playing it's the best but obviously funny it's a grand champ and someone's locking someone locks your car you have to you have to stay locked so you just never any it's a grand shape if you don't follow that one people I was gonna deal with it alright not the best not the best but I mean the game is over to be fair he just in a position himself in a spot where you know you could also get that flick I mean what's the balls on the ground there you can only hit it on the ground so you only hit like a grounded shots you have to be ready for that no I was gonna backward dribble dude I'm one of the spices here a second goal we got the 16 points this is the game the game you've been waiting for all this time let's see it the spicy animation there it is let's go let's go we got a grand champ off of that big promotion alrighty not too bad at all let's take a look at how many games it took to get us a great champ but that's gonna be the last game of this video but let's just take a look real quick how many games it took I'm gonna guess 38 or 39 let's see many yes no job to my heart real quick why would they want to sign on my gym account leave my alternate account all right whatever let's take a look at the list a snap all right so I didn't think this to end this early to be honest 33 games everybody a grand champ winning every single game that's pretty good like that didn't take long at all and like I said we weren't trying to just completely just Stalin everyone we're trying to play to the rank and give you guys the many tips as possible so we didn't get it insane amount of goals per game like for to be to four goals a game isn't crazy at all one assist isn't that crazy either obviously I could get that many assists in the lower ranks just because people aren't looking for passes and often times you're not ready for each other's hits so a lot of the plays are solo plays but yeah all around the board man 33 games didn't take long at all to see at the green shape and I think we we learnt a lot in terms of playing all the ranks and there's a lot of big things to take away from it but honestly free play alone can get you all the way up to champ I promise you guys that if you grind free play it can get you all the way at the chin focus on the specific things that you need to work on and that alone like if you just focus on each thing that you're lacking the most you'll get better so much quickly and I promise you mechanics alone can carry you to low grant I promise but beyond that point you really do need to learn how to position and a lot of the tips that I gave you guys throughout this series will help you with that as well positioning for your teammates passes positioning for the opponent's touch we're going to go next shot a free position in that area overall just just trying to combine all the tips that I give you guys throughout the series regardless of the rank like it applies to higher ranks as well just a higher level with more pace so everything I said throughout this series could be applied to any rank I promise that banging the ball and goal that that tip below and that still works in grin she have you bang enough shots on goal it's gonna eventually go in people will miss there'll be an awkward ball if they want people to get like run their boost down keep banging shots that's a strategy we'll still use so everything that I said throughout the series is usable at every single rank but I promise guys free play alone will help you so much so so so so so much so definitely get around to that if you want to improve replays the way to go I think personally you'll get to Green Team super quick and like I said you could focus on your your thought process and your decision-making after that and yeah obviously as as you're going as you're playing in ranked games with the mechanics you've learned for free play you should be thinking about you know your decision-making and stuff like that but once you get stuck once you really get stuck you know it's not your mechanics that are at fault you know at that point it's your decision-making that's how much easier thing to fix then your mechanics I think at least so anyway I hope you guys enjoyed like I said the series isn't done quite yet I want to play two or three more games in a lo grand champ for the next video just to see what it's like over there but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for all the support on this entire series it's been a lot of fun I really do I really do like making this a show you guys I had a lot of fun with it it was cool seeing the different ranks and running into you guys and even though a lot you guys didn't know was me the majority at the time noticing what it's like playing toxic players at lower ranks it's uh it's very interesting it's a very new experience to me because ever since I've been a pro you can really run into people being toxic to you very often right so having a alternate account on a different name and seeing people be toxic this is just it's just a new experience and it's very interesting to me yeah I think after this series is done the next year is gonna be a lot of fun so when you get around to recording the next one there's two games and low branch and two or three games little grand champ to see we could take away from that that'll be the end of the road Cyprian champ for this series and then I'm gonna make a road trip grand champ in one big one which would be a special series where I will be trying to go for more stylish stuff but there is a huge twist to it it's all many of us for now like I said big announcement coming when the series is done but yeah this is gonna be the second last episode of this road to grand champ the next one is the last one hundred percent because we've already reached it but yeah guys well we work toward we reached it and you got some definitely reached it too just putting the work that's all you need but yeah I love you guys and if you're not subscribed please go down right now press that
