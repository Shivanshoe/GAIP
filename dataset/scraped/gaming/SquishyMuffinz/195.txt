yo what's up guys back with some more hoops today with justin hopefully we can get some more back-to-back dubs here we've been grinding almost getting up to that beautiful supersonic legend rank getting closer and closer i think we're grand champ two now i want to say justin i think is grand champ three he's been playing this quite a lot more than me in the past as well so i think his high i think his rank in general was higher than mine going into this uh this new season then we need to challenge that too quick i probably could have just waited i need to challenge it at all honestly but let me go for the ceiling pinch close it's a good idea right behind you let him just flick this hopefully it's not bad at all try this way for the bounce i almost played it over two it's a good idea irrigable super difficult shot to stop for them and actually really good job with that so really good job from them chances are going in off a dunk in this because the the nets are pretty much on the ground it's pretty low it's a pretty low chance that that's going to go in let's get a shot from justin again i'm still let him go for soil stuff over and over again passing it probably is kind of a p in this but i think solo plays are definitely the strat if you're trying to just win every single game and i'll go for like super sick like passing play clips i definitely think that soul plays probably the strap should have down in the back wall took the boost that should be fun should i pinch it for him nice pinch actually worked really well he's pre-jumped super early i forgot i'm supposed to go for that i kind of just autopiloted but it's fun should have it forward maybe oh it's unlucky he got bumped too i think this is mine right i always forget because i feel like i'm ahead of head of the boost here cozy from last last video the troll returns he's streaming right now so he's extra extra trolly try to grab their boost i'm stealing it [Laughter] i think there was a way to steal that without saving it to be honest but we scored off a bit all right great past them you just stop playing shut up on afk dude wait behind me can't follow it up so i'm just gonna have it justin go should i have one more maybe one more touch i assume it couldn't get us unlucky bounce off the just looks funny i don't know why this car just floating there we're both trolling each other now oh okay i didn't see if i didn't get that dunk there i might have been bad but dunk justin left for the booster i'm not gonna say anything though i won't be toxic back even though he's joking around being toxic i won't be toxic back fight hate with with love right that's what someone said surely somewhere i'm demoing this guy should be fine damn good block these are really good those stops i don't get it nice that's actually super op it feels like if someone just like plays backwall and waits i feel like those passes are super op you could just like absolutely blast it at the backboard but it almost always leads to a goal it feels like the first time back wall knows how to how to redirect obviously damn he's getting bumped in the same way the bombs do seem like super p though you like toss a lobber on on goal and you just bump them like a really solid way to score on this double or just a goal nice gotta solo plays for me i feel like air dribbles in general are just way too lp in this they just feel super easy to get goals out of if you can do it properly might just be straight in unlucky nice dunk toss it off the wall it's going to bounce back oh i try to keep fine for just in case i get the dunk low percentage chance but it's one of those things that if you hit it it looks nice but it was almost cracked if i got the perfect pinch past him closing the pre-jump should be okay for a sec i can't get that actually that was actually really good shot i thought maybe he would have shot it too high because his area was weird at first but covered really well out of it play back to justin it's actually better to lose that probably i can try to purposely lose like threes try to follow it up myself close let's go for the beast why not what's the worst that can happen oh my god what a say but these guys are crazy there's no boost for sure because i just took it it was definitely not a bad boost deal before because we knew for sure we had at least a good 10 seconds of just like they're not gonna have boost if they go back might be a goal it's super tough to stop ah so close those are so fun to do in this mode too if you get it powerful enough i pass the justin side oh okay that was actually nice that was kind of nice i pre-jumped super early jumped to the ceiling got a flip off the ceiling that's something pre-flipped over to me and then i read it off the backboard and that's super clean looks really nice also guys if you're wondering what i'm scratching i have bad eczema i believe is how you say it i'm not sure exactly how to say it but it's right in the middle of my arm like right where my arm bends i have really bad eczema and uh i'm not sure if that's how i say to be honest but it's like dry skin and it's super itchy like extremely itchy like it's a really bad case of it and um yeah that's what i've been itching quite a bit but yeah sloth is super sonic legend right now so we played against the hoop super song legends the first one i've ever played definitely plays this game a lot so let's get into the next one let's even get back to back dubs we'll probably be the last hoops video for a little bit unless you guys want to see me just push through the supersonic legend i can try to record some more but uh probably will be the last one for a little bit let's get to the next one let's even get some more wins hopefully justin justin's a little bit less toxic in the next one he's hurting my feelings man i'm gonna go cry after this but uh yeah see in the next one let's get some dubs see how it goes all right for last game playing it's cmyk and easy running into cmyk quite a bit in all these games he must be absolutely grinding the hoops right now i got kind of faked by that he's gonna pop it up let him touch that let's find if he hits this as well to be honest good luck from us i'm not gonna go for it yet shot from justin we're gonna have him back well that's fine not gonna be a goal to that so i'll just let him touch nice let's go for a shot quick there we go gonna be a little bit too fast very tough to read i know he wasn't on the back wall so if i just bang that really fast off the back wall he's gonna have a hard time saving that yeah i apologize for that scratching noise that you're probably gonna hear for a few videos because i've had this for a while now and it's getting a little bit worse it's pretty uncomfortable at a time but you don't need my sob story i'll get over it nice i'll do a play around both good air drill should be justin's ball because of the pad is what i'm learning but he likes to not go for this team just to get the free save she didn't even get a save for that one for some reason try to play it over one i kind of like betamin maybe the double nice was honestly there just in case i could steal it i was honestly if i tried to turn toward goldie not a bad kickoff goes to his side hit control can i get a pinch mid baby close ah that's bad i didn't mean the 50 that way should be okay though you can't shoot off the bell don't touch put it around one let him touch that again it should be over to justin didn't spawn around there i'm not sure where his boots went did he just get it maybe could have been what just happened not a bad touch decent save again pass adjusting maybe double nice good job i wasn't sure if i can get it to be honest it's a good double though we're getting more and more comfortable with the mode i feel the more and more i play it it is fun for sure i see a lot of you guys asked me to play drop shot in the comments i did look at the comments of the last few videos so definitely uh will be something i'm trying to get around to i would like to play with people though i don't want to play that alone so it's definitely not as fun alone i'll try to play with some people i can't get a shot of that yet i'll just wait played over one he's gonna have that on back wall over to justin's side anyway it shouldn't be bad at all i probably shouldn't have pre-jumped i was pretty jumping like the perfect pass super high it's pretty unlikely that pass is going to go right to me but it's worth the attempted clip is that a boost so unfortunately doesn't take 100 are you lost shut up the troll dude all i do is get bullied bro i wake up i get bullied oh that's a goal as well i can't do anything about it is it type again calling it oh i didn't that call bad call cheating i'm not gonna go the big fake why don't i get a save for that i'm only doing that for the save points i'm going for their boost actually just go for mid i'm gonna bounce up wait for him to touch this one back wall both back wall got pooped on someone's air dribbling up slow like that one tip that i can give you guys i know in the lower ranks people don't have extremely good control but if someone's air dribbling slowly don't jump extremely fast at it try to match the pace of the air dribble that'll help you a lot with that they both jumped extremely fast at a very slow dribble and all it's going to do is give the person air dribbling all the power because he can slow down and turn that whichever way he wants to while you're just going super fast in the direction of the ball so it's not a very good idea or good thing to do i don't think from my experience what i've learned is that matching the the pacing of situations is much better on those urges should be savable can be a slow shot no matter what didn't have any option to get that in quickly that's going to be a goal though unfortunately i want to know how to do that bump kick off i wonder like you bump your teammate into and they get like super fast looks super open on how to do it i want to hit one pre-jump clip just one actually i think i hit one in the last video what i actually saved that no shot wait you could save it you can save it should be able to wait you hit the rim i bought the exact same thing ah no speed on it i just 50 to the block why do i like i always hit the post i don't get it i just have like a post magnet on my car i think i'll let him touch that one more wait i wasn't ready for that oh we actually got one more i did not think we'd get that all right games again we got another two wins it should potentially be another division up it is we're almost granted three off that justin's probably almost super center legend off that's yeah let me know if you guys want to see me get supersonic legends mode i'll be down to do it um i won't show you every single game but i'll show you almost every single game but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a full day or night little times you're watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all next time i love you peace you
