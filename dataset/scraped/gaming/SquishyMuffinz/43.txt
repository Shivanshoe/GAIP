yo what's up guys gonna be queueing some threes for today with johnny and gimmick the homies hopefully we can have some good games for today gimmicks actually currently number one so we're keen with the number one player on the planet right now hopefully we don't let them down we get them some dubs for today should be some good games let's get into it let's see how it goes all right the first game we got alpha dirto and foxy have not played threes with the squad in a while but it's always a good time when we do so looking forward to it nice pass from johnny he's gonna try to keep it in got bumped into that little unfortunate so my touch wasn't exactly what i wanted but it's fine i'm gonna leave it for gimmick take this boost remember it's gonna deny boost from your opponent even if it means taking it from your team sometimes it's a risk you have to take johnny kind of cut me off a bit but it's not a bad thing if i just don't commit with him but it definitely been a better ball for me to have but it's not a big deal at all i'm gonna fake this take my time in the corner here played around one 52 go for one more here off the wall it's gonna be weird for him the very least donnie should have this though he's a lot of time nice for the bounce here trying to beat him just playing for the win there on the ball nice touch it should be a shot actually i'd be careful here cannot full commit to this should be fine i have time on the ball hit around one which is good if gimmick wins this ball it's huge if not it's fine as well so it goes back to our team so either way we sell possession out of that put everyone let him touch this as well it's really not a big deal i'm just playing not to get beat here it's the main thing i took them out of play with that plus should be a shot good try actually really good 50. i don't even know how you got to put down that nice challenge here's one more that's huge actually bonnie should take he's not here so i'll just try to go for it to me maybe somebody would fake him and they can like it's kind of like a dummy play in soccer should be fun actually really smart ass but he didn't pass anybody just shot it i thought my team would be back well i'm not gonna lie and then once i saw that he wasn't i knew it was gonna be a really bad situation for us i think johnny had boost wasn't in like a good position for it still have a lot of time left and we've had way more opportunities than them feels like still down lucky on that we didn't have someone there in the most important situation so far my first double thing is straight to me most likely i should have free touch nice let's got another demo on one i actually could save for them i don't know how they saved i'm not gonna lie i thought i had that should be good for us though give me play right i've known mid with me but honestly like it's hard for them to expect that to go mid so i don't i don't mind again them being a little bit more patient on that because it's just a 50. it's not like i have a clean beat on anyone if i can get that clean mid then i won't obviously want something to be there but if not then i do not blame them at all take both boosts here from this guy make him rotate all the way back and maybe take another corner he was gonna make extra time on the ball get a demo which is huge past right it's a really good shot it's all done good pressure in general you had to pass right and past the left option you went for the pass left and that's good because it forces him to hit off the wall force him to try to beat the pass right i guess at least beat the guy who's going to receive it he did that but eventually just gave it right to me behind gimmick here nice sugar one more time head over to should be a goal nice good play good soft touch baited both in as well maybe i had no more boost it's like a really important thing to do if you have like a storage room like that try to like give the impression that you have no boost after just like no more play on the ball and usually they'll they'll make a mistake like that nice [Music] really good pressure in general forcing them out into bad situations that's a really good shot it's a tough angle to hit a good job though i'm gonna slow cheat here cheating in threes you want to make sure you're around right here don't push up too much further than that that way you can react whatever happens and then you can choose which boost to go off of off that situation let them touch this it's not a big deal you should have pretty easily still focus here as well i need to follow this up myself so me just being there again baits out that third man they thought two of them actually and that player is really good good block there well my teammates went but i think you can still get back to hopefully more time nice could be for johnny and then a free net hopefully nice good job really good counter really clean stuff in general said ratio all right good first game is keep it up against the next one got another huge dub there very very good win keep gimmick in first place against the next one seem to keep it up get back to back dubs see how it goes all right for the last game we got dirt though queenster and crunk so this goes one soft touch try to play it's myself here low 50. maybe go again here just for my team just to make it easier the more times you can go without like rotating all the way back it's better if you can just stop them from dribbling stop three different players on the team from dribbling waste all their resources or your team's behind you just getting ready perfect be as ball chassis as you want if you're doing stuff like that it's actually really good i shouldn't sweat it no boost in it i didn't know it but i didn't trust myself actually good i didn't die and then i died after i wasn't saying i was pretty lucky that i didn't die either uh unfortunate that boost would have been pretty useful i'll be back here it's full down here you can help out get off the wall let's play in a weird spot for him i know i can't do much the amount of boosts i have so and if i take that any slower i'm gonna get bumped so better should do what i did oh me and johnny on the same wavelength block two at least i'd say that's good progress i feel johnny can get by one more it's pretty huge wait for touch might work maybe i not my flip anymore i was trying to flip to myself but i didn't have it anymore sadly let me go for a bump here the last man it's actually very big except johnny's touching straight to the ceiling so we can't get like any kind of progress downfield off of it but them on that guy is always huge you can kill the guy behind the one you baited for your team pop actually good for us messed up a little bit you're gonna have a chance here gonna bait go for a bump and bumping this guy would have been pretty huge that's pretty big and that game couldn't have any any pressure him at all pretty much i think i actually got bumped good window double commitment isn't terrible for us it doesn't hurt us that bad there should be a goal actually yeah pretty good situation to control don't look away from our team but took our time in the right spot and came out of it with the goal ourselves so that's good isn't the best race for us should be okay still gonna wait back well i think it's the right play i'm gonna fake this for johnny i'm gonna go for a bum bunny's last back for a while now i'm glad he missed those almost scary you back full boost like give me go for me just to make him flick it doesn't matter what he does this johnny got bumps could be a goal i saved i don't even know how he saved that to be honest good job from gimmick covering me you know i was gonna get bumped i just went for it smart ever going to be a dangerous play for them though that shot they just went for how could i trust you ceiling now for my team hopefully you leave it for gimmick smart i'll be across it's like a way to cross full boots here because there's a chance this comes to me pretty good chance actually be all of them we're like behind i can go for this hit corner just to make it really weird for him that's the panty they think someone's up probably could waste a lot of resources and johnny can keep it back in shouldn't be terrible for us unless he redirects it perfectly but i didn't really have faith in him doing that nearly dunked him 40 seconds left it would go lead here it's mainly just like not making a big mistake and johnny almost done for the same ball but take a slow approach there and play it back to gimmick now we don't need to necessarily get a goal there and i know that's like all of our our players just got committed on that play so i'd rather do what i did then let me go for a shot and get completely dunked when there's a chance that could have happened it's like a shake here too going in quick take my time get pinched under him and bottom corner but yeah it's gonna be all for today hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this thank you so much for all the supporting channel as always appreciate y'all and
