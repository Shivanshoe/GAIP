yo what's up guys so for today's video i'm gonna be playing all three game modes i promise you guys i'd get back into a normal ranked video because i've been doing a lot of the extra mode stuff so we'll be playing um 1v1 2v2 or 303 whatever we end up getting i'm not sure obviously it's going to be completely random but we'll be queuing that and um we are still trying to go for uh number one in all three leaderboards currently 36 and ones 34 in twos and 19th in three so we're doing pretty well and all three uh all three games considering i haven't been playing ranked a crazy amount it's pretty solid let's get through the games of course today but before we do that quick message from today's sponsor as a professional rocket league player i have many people compliment me on my ball

right we got a crazy first match here completely solo queue but it ended up getting cancelled unfortunately but other than me forking typical against uh pika tater in jk foshizo so maybe let me try to throw out some invites maybe they'll uh maybe they'll they'll want to queue up because we're all just solo queuing anyway let's see if this works [Music] thank you so 4k ended up joining but the typical did not so that's fine we'll end up just queueing threes let's just do a q3s i think that'll be the best time let's get into it steven get some dubs see how it goes [Music] all right first game we got ourselves bob against jk foshizu pika and peter [Music] it is very late at night right now guys and again i'm very tired i've been recording these videos at not the greatest of times gotta be fixing that recording schedule i'm not gonna lie i want to be a little bit more energetic for you guys a little bit more just not sleepy is all i'm really hoping for because i could tell like listening back to the videos last few nights that i've been uh pretty tired when recording [Music] touch from bob it's actually really good touching i like that he just drives into it so it keeps his position it's really underrated thing that you can do middle here would be good give me some options at least gotta go for the last second big flippy set fast middle good try maybe bob can go for this good one which is pretty big it's gonna be no mid option now around two of them whatever you can do to make their life awkward like that is is perfect if you can make a little touch like that it's going to bounce awkwardly for him and then go for it again and beat the other guy absolutely perfect and the fact that i was able to land and get it on the last guy even better and good job from bob to be there but you want to aim to make as many of those little touches as possible just be as much of a nuisance as you can be hit it around one at least make it weird for him then go for a bump on one more get a sleeve now the demo eliminates one of their options in the middle right now that he hits his ball i know there's no one there cuz i killed that guy good touch over him passes left that's where solo play but he probably will score it so it's fine trying to 50 close to the goal line just in case they wouldn't have a follow-up maybe and then my team would have a huge advantage there unlucky all good all good i bumped into my teammate on the way back and porky just got baited up that's a good uh touch from the attacker there just hit it around them that's why it pays to play as patient as possible on defense because situation like that right for kind of challenge showed his hand really early made their life really really simple honestly on offense didn't have to do anything any kind of 50 works there i can't get a shot because he's blocking us a good uh defensive effort from him for sure can we do anything with that ball it's fine good help from him becca still awkward situation i don't think a double commit is terrible there i mean obviously it'll be better if we didn't but it's not something that immediately results in a goal so i don't think it's all that bad it's gonna block if he wins this challenge is huge if not it's pretty bad for us but see how to fake the low i like to play a lot for me but maybe i could have up for a double it's kind of like a hindsight thing because in my head that play would have worked that little fake play right there but in hindsight after seeing what happened you know i think the double tap would have worked even better because they didn't defend very well fast forward bob with the touch good defense from tater close trying to get back in the spot where i can at least be in a position to save anything that comes my way should i pass the four key here pre-jump so it's not going to be any good touch there again just playing a little bit more patient passive situations i'm going to give you a thousand more options after the fact something very small but all of the best players in the game um will always play those situations extremely patient because the smarter thing to do it's a better thing to do and you can do that at lower ranks as well you don't have to be the best in the game or on extremely good teams to to do that well in my opinion good touch one more hit here would be huge couldn't quite so i just gotta play patient now again because of that you see i was able to win that the next challenge unfortunately bob didn't take the best go with that so i was risky for a second that's a really good touch i'll be waiting middle if you pass this mid potential for a goal if not should be fine i'm lost back for a while here and i'm getting bumped awkward situation he made almost own gold but we're recovering we're recovering all good late at night we're all tired real sleepy not the greatest touch again it's all all good we'll find a way we'll find our way through and you kind of fit these huge here when we're out i wasn't ready oh good it was a good play though i dropped at the very least get out of the dangerous situation they were in back there let him hit that somehow that that went terribly wrong but i'm just going with the flow of the scheme to be honest i've been more surprised than anything at the outcome of a lot of these situations but see what happens i'm honestly like excited to see how this game ends i think it's not going to be the greatest of goals but we'll see pastor himself off the back oh it's going to wait now back off would be fun and shoot that on that block i can't tell if you had it so i was gonna go for him but that's fine i didn't actually fully commit make him throw that away it's really a fake challenge i say control the game something that no one's really doing so far in this lobby everyone's kind of just throwing it away right away so let's slow down for a second see what comes of it i'm kind of worried about that touch i'll get there game's kind of stressing me out i'm not gonna lie it should be okay if i have someone behind me nice this is honestly a really simple mode i think people just they don't use each other enough and they don't take advantage of the fact that you have two people on your team enough right and that and that's something that it's so easy to overlook but it's one of the biggest things that'll help you improve in threes so i think try to really understand that you have those extra two people and that you can use them to your advantage right i think even the other team right now this game is not doing that at all but the biggest thing is when someone makes a challenge on my team there's no follow-up and that's why why you're seeing a lot of those times where we have to give up pressure because we don't have anyone there and then that challenge from bob again is a good example of something that you're leaving your other teammates in a bad spot if you don't win that challenge so you got to also figure out what's good and what's not good to go for in those situations so here no one should challenge this should be just patient wait back for the touch to come try to make a play off of it and now we should have a really good situation out of it because of that pass this left nice there we go so again just taking advantage of the space we have the situation at hand trying not to throw away a position when we don't have to and out of that we get a really good play good back and forth passing play good job from porky to again excuse me in that play because i'm there i'm a resource you should use your teammates at all times in threes whether it be just something as little as fake challenging for them trying to win a 50 their way whatever it may be so he played really well that game a lot of really random stuff went on but we ended up coming out with the dub and usually enough when you end up playing simple like that and you end up playing solid you'll end up coming through yeah so yeah let's get into the last game of the video see if we can get back to big dubs let's see how it goes all right for last thing we got ourselves spuda against solid lobby here this boot is a solid player to have good shot for parking well done for the good mechanics that they come into play when you have those situations that pop up like that you have time you have boosts you have no one challenging you that's when these days most people are going to get a pretty good shot out of that before you did a good job with that so just wait here there's no reason to challenge this so it goes to the wall as soon as it's on the wall that's my my go-to to challenge that ball and it's actually going to be useful because then my team should have a good follow-up right but whoever's on the back wall here let's see the mistake the speed is on the back wall odyssey if he just keeps waiting backwall he'll be able to react to whatever happens there fork is i don't think fork is at fault in my opinion because he's waiting on spoon the whole time so that situation shouldn't all be dangerous in my opinion if it's dealt with properly the people that are on back hole and whoever else is back just deals with it properly there should be no danger um that's a really small mistake though but that that's like i always mention this in videos i think the backboard is just overpowered this is the best way to put it it's simply overpowered when it comes to how much you can defend with simply just sitting on the backboard it stops pretty much every every single possibility of a solo play you can stop everything by just sitting there get off the wall touch can be really hard for them to do much about it put it around them to the side see what's buddha does here good fake and good demo posts let's get touched around there we go that was a really good really good shot i don't really get safe from him let's see what he does with that it's gonna be awkward i know that i can reposition left side and then play this mid there we go [Music] that's really a big thing to get in the habit of doing as well if you make a big hit like that and you know they have to jump for it try to like read which side you think it's gonna go and pre-position that way like they just did on the wall right there right so i have no choice but to hit that that way and they know that so then p pre-positioning on the wall is massive because it's kind of like cross replacement in a game like cs or valerian whatever you you want to use it as an example but you're trying to leave it in a spot where you have to do as little reaction a little as little adjustment as possible right you don't have to really aim that much if your cross replacement is good you're kind of already there you just left like kind of the same idea so i'd like to think about it i'm i know this ball can only go left here right off of that bounce so i'm going to stay on the left side there's no reason for me to be on the right side another really good example of that i'd say you should always kind of be thinking with your positioning i thought it was going to be able to go again so i was kind of just trying to jump to the control touch it's fine put this high across you can have some time on the ball it's close look a good try i try to get some sort of 50 mid but it's going to be hard for anyone to read it but yeah rocky is kind of a game of like reading is very important but at the same time it's more about just what you choose to challenge so i think trying to match those two skills as early as possible especially the reading one like that right here it's a good example i literally was able to make that play off of just understanding where i think the ball could go next where's the ball most likely to go and the simplest way to put it it seems so simple when you put it like this but if they're on the right side of the bulb more often or not it's going to go to the opposite side so you can see right there it's a good example if i'm on the opposite team here look where my car is i'm on the far left part of the ball the ball can only go to the right so why is there whole team pushing up on the same side as me when i only have one option right that's the biggest thing that's the biggest thing that i think it's so simple to understand but people don't do it quite enough is just find a position in a good spot like that ah that's a good bump org is afk messaging me oh good yeah we almost got out of that if you didn't have the bump on me that little tiny nudge oh they got out of it but if you pay attention to how many little situations come off of literally just reading the play wall it makes up pretty much every high level player that that's what makes them good is their ability to just read where the ball is going to go next no it's not even about like even that right there that's not even a bad situation for me not to go for the ball i'm just flicking it i'm making him flick it for whoever's behind me so you'll see i'm literally just so patient any situations because i know at the end of the day these balls aren't going to be in like super dangerous spots i'm going to be able to challenge them i know someone's behind me so it looks like i'm not panicking at all in spots that most people are probably panicking but really i just know i understand like where the danger is in these situations so that's something that just obviously has come to me because i played a lot but it's something that you guys can also learn yourself really early on i think spirit thought i was going but he was closer to the ball so i figured he would but yeah that's something you guys can learn literally any rank and i think that'll help you insanely i think like every ranked beneath probably grand champ if you guys have good shooting and i get ability to just read where the ball is going to go based off your opponent's touches that alone it will be so easy for you to rank up you'll probably get ssl before you know it i'm not gonna lie if you just know to hit the ball hard on net get really good touches and just read the play you don't need anything more than that you don't need flippy sets you don't need anything literally play it off the corner look up two of the panicked off of one little touch like that like this sidewall let him touch this pop it up you only hit it that side so i'll just wait across playing through this power but they can't get the greatest clear right that's a big thing as well you want to put them to this power they can't get a very clear on defense also a skill it's really tough to learn and i think that's something that you have no choice but to learn when you're playing professionally because if you put the spot the the ball in bad spots and give them easy clears you're gonna get counter-attacked on over and over again something that i had no choice but to be really good at as well but there's a lot of countless things that you guys can work on when it comes to just like just playing the game in general off the ball stuff it's not even it's not even about how you hit the ball most of the time like off ball stuff alone will make you a much better player so definitely watch back to replay see if you guys are doing the things i'm talking about let me know down in the comments if any of the tips i mentioned this video help you guys but appreciate y'all i love you i hope you guys have a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and share on the next one i love y'all peace [Music] do [Music]
