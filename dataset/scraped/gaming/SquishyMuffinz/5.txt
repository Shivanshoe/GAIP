yo what's up guys so it's a new season and that means we got ourselves our rewards for the season which i think was a pretty cool decal let me show you guys i'll probably do for the video for today actually it's pretty nice these are all the rewards oh this one is glitched alrighty that's pretty that's pretty cool ellen glitch this one um i haven't looked at these yet i didn't know that these are all glitched um but okay we'll use the we'll use what is one of the glitch ones let's use the grand champ one why not oh wow that is loud i'm on the epic games version okay wow okay i'm an epic games version of the game right now i don't know if you guys can hear that but when i get achievements it's the loudest thing ever for no reason and the reason why i'm on that is because the update broke the game and the steam version is uh very laggy right now it's very stuttery so that's just unfortunate but anyway uh we got ourselves a new rocket pass which i'll show you guys very quickly there are a few items in here that i think are are actually really nice i'll show you guys which ones i think those are but overall it's pretty good rocket pass compared to the other ones recently it's pretty good i think the last few have been kind of disappointing but this one's actually seeming to be pretty solid this car actually it looks sick it might have potential the back of it i don't know if it'll look that good in game but the front looks cool i like the way it looks a lot um this decal i think is the first one with like potential to actually be good i'll definitely get all these and uh show you guys whenever i get them there's another one that i really like coming up soon i think actually this one i think this one has a lot of potential to be cool might look good in game it's not bad as well trying to see there was one more that i really liked pretty sure this one i think i liked a lot i think there's one more this one this one has a lot of potential to be good as well look nice and game i think look cool um [Music] this gold explosion in the trailer i don't know if you guys saw it trailer but the trailer made it look really nice in game i think it's kind of underwhelming but the idea is cool yeah rocket pass not bad at all if you guys want to i can't believe i'm using the speak out i'm going to do my placement games though i'm going to cue all three actually no i'm just going to cue i wish i could once but today let's play someone's game just see how it goes i've got a very hard match off the bat dapper is probably one of the players that played the most in ones in my career i haven't played ones in a long time i know he still plays him so probably be very solid but me and dapper probably played i don't even know thousands of games against each other something crazy i played dapper all the way since 2015 and ones over and over again we played so many games against each other i apologize for that sound if that's going through the video i'm not sure but something i have to deal with right now because my uh actual game keeps on freezing going for the shot here it's a good shot nothing i could really do there he just won the kick off well he's always been extremely good at those uh those flicks like that posted in that you give him the space there he's gonna score it kickoff's definitely better than mine been playing more ones than me for sure feels like he has the the new kickoff down i took a wall to myself get some space here it's gonna fake the whole way good work i got a free goal he has to be worried about the flip there there's too many options i have so i think just faking his best bet it's a good kick off actually really good for me and he got the boost so it worked out perfectly for him oh wow i don't think he meant to to miss the ball there but i ended up working as a fake if he had hit it it would have just went right into me yeah he tried to cut it around me that's funny he tried to cut it to the side where i jumped but he just missed he missed time the bounce worked out better for him a good save yeah takeoffs are putting them in a much better situation than mine are i haven't really been able to make a play out of my office that's the downside when you don't play mode for a while you definitely miss out on the the metas like learning what people are doing on kickoffs and stuff like that i played high i could be able to jump for this so i have a free shot here there we go that's okay if you're off the biggest problem it's not a big deal gotta find ways to adapt to it it's a good kickoff should be a goal try to take that one slower and save some more boost make a play off of it i can't believe i'm using this glitchy squishy a lot of time left though a lot can still happen like i said my chaos haven't been doing that great for me so a lot can still go wrong in this game if he just keeps doing that he can get like 10 goals on me so i gotta step it up on my kickoffs do something a little bit different it's a little bit better i'm gonna fake jump here i can panic a bit grab his boots it's actually really good position for me to be in now nice good shot as well played there's going to be a lot of adapting to chaos me and dapper had this one ones game on ps4 we always traded games but we had this one once game on ps4 that were we were both scoring like so many kickoff goals and i think it ended up being like 12 to 11 and i wanted over time or something wow what am i watching what am i watching every time he like messes up it's working for him though the slightest mistakes are actually ended up in his favor very interesting good challenge if it goes down it's good it went kind of out which is bad for me played up the wall in a spot where he has to make a solo play out of this it's actually really good for him let's save use as much of the net as i have there to save that which is the smartest thing to do basically in that situation you know you're gonna get a good shot especially if you're playing a good player like this so you gotta make sure you use the space that you have in that i did that well there should i get a flip early and let's threaten it so i got air dribble fake it there we go it's the right play to make there that's the most dangerous thing you can do with the ball i swear you get a flip early they know you have an infinite amount of possibility to flip that ball pretty much like you could do anything with that it's very difficult for the person back well he's done so many kickoff goals this game he's got a really good kickoff mikey off he's knock it against what he's doing try to single jump maybe worked a little better but my flip didn't work still has an advantage here put it softly to my own corner so you can't actually shoot off that uh i almost got the goal good idea these are the ones games i feel a little bit depressing to be honest because it feels like i have um you know i played well throughout this game but i can i can do a lot of work to get two goals and you can just get to key offs really quick on me my kickoff is getting hard countered against what he's doing pretty much so i'm trying to switch it up every kick off let's get patience on the goal line let him touch this should be a shock for me around them a good 50. we should come back in a second he goes for a shot it's fun it's actually could be bad for me a pinch i have control here on the wall i'm gonna flip early again and just threaten it the whole time never actually do anything that's the most broken thing you can do and once i feel like just gonna flip early and threaten to play the whole time yeah good first game i'm gonna cue twos for my next one i think because i want to have some variety in my first placement game video of the season so that was my first game one out of ten matches played i'm gonna play my next game in twos but very good uh first match there against dapper usually um for 1v1 i'm already in ssl most of the time for the other modes uh you end up placing i think the highest in place is like grand champ 2 something like that that's normally people place into um but for ones i usually i'm probably already ssl and once uh my hidden elo's just not showing it obviously but very good first match very tough challenging first match my first game of the day too so very good one to win there and dapper's kickoffs were very strong very hard to like counter and find a counter for and i think we did a good job to uh to work around some of those things yeah i'm also using 105 buckle b right now which is like very different you won't really see that too often um which is why my game might look a little bit like might look a little bit different but these are settings that i've been experimenting with and playing very well with i think so i'm gonna try them for a little bit longer no reason not to and uh yeah against the next game try to play some more good matches for you guys all right for the first game we got goaded against derrick and schmove all ssls from last season i know a lot of pros have been complaining already about the placements i've heard even garrett was saw me today after scrims his placements have been uh very hard to play alone so i probably shouldn't be solo queuing but it'll be a fun time regardless i know what i'm signing up for can be a mess but we'll see i'm gonna have fun with it golden says he's a big fan nice to play with you goated good try on the kickoff let's see what happened here yeah that's i mean it's a little bit of a problem when you're cheating okay so kickoff wasn't favorable for our side of the cheat which just happened sometimes but what i'm seeing i tend to do this i'll creep up like my flip i'll shoot up like to the the first patch i'll show you guys quick trip to here and then i kind of creep up and see what happened and then i decided to keep moving forward if you creep up too far forward you're just going to give away a free goal a lot of time i guess what happened there someone didn't get a demo on them i'm gonna pass back good touch wait for schmooze touch here i thought my team is gonna go but now it's a little bit awkward it's round one play into a weird spot on the wall i'm not gonna take this boost necklace of it maybe get a bum should be okay plus my teammate can get a touch at least here actually not the best for us but that's good still works trying to play it up the wall would have been better than hitting it forward because we had actual play off of it we're both wearing on the we're on the same page for it but okay i'm going to give him a part all righty try to get the ball in a better spot for his sheet as well that's good he actually didn't cheat at all he went back left boos it's another thing that could definitely go wrong into is if you don't cheat and the ball just dies and they cheat it's just a free goal for them ah not the flick i wanted it's a good try you make him beat him maybe shot down for a double i'm going to try to keep up here can i have one patch out it's fine if he flicks his way my teammate should be back and she'll leave it for him i had a lot of trust in him there two times i think so i play to make i don't think there's many uh situations where he's missing those all right i gotta wait for him to try to come back here i'm gonna fake first this could be bad i have to be careful of the bum i thought i was buying for some reason so i try to flip forward one more hit up the time he making touch nice play one over take my time here nice it's a good play all right we've got two and a half minutes left half the game anything can still happen here trying to focus on my kickoff making sure it's good and get behind me if it's awkward i like to just rotate like far behind he may should have had it for sure but that's okay if it's awkward like this like i'm on i'm under the ball i can't be useful i'm gonna rotate behind teammates should be able to just jump i'm not sure what happened and why he didn't go to be honest it should be very easy for him but it should be easy for him to get it there and then i can just defend whatever comes next pretty easily i'm gonna just fake there we go good play there taking my time trying to look a little menacing choosing my uh little towels from there the car is like body language what i should do off the ball can't really do much on this and just wait it's fine i can't do anything but flip nice display back now i could just pressure him to go across or go high here and that's all i have to do that's good can't make any kind of play that'll go and turn it off this it should be fine for a teammate just hit it out once we'll let him touch this but i'm a past middle here nice good job i'm good you go actually feels nice even though it's broken it's funny actually feels good i'm going to control this it's close good attempt i'm going to touch a high here i can't shoot it but my main goal is to keep it in to spot that it's not going to be horrible for them that'll block them as well just good try to pinch this baby off the wall try to get back quick here and save i'm gonna save my boost all hundred just in case not sure what i'm gonna have to defend here wasn't too hard i'm gonna fake this probably in a panic oh sorry teammate i'm gonna go back i played soft for myself to get a follow-up with the boost but it's fine to beat him to that maybe i have one more as well plus it's going to be a goal yeah ximena is fully trusting that i hit the double didn't think i was gonna be missing it but you still want to be covering the best case and worst case scenario in a situation like that like i'm never i never want to be too optimistic especially in like pro games because even though everyone's good you know everyone should be capable of hitting everything every single time it's never the case there's always going to be mistakes though so you never want to join in the mistake and you know push up a little too far expecting something to happen then it doesn't right try to cover both options try to be there for the good and the bad i'm going to fake this i'm not going to be able to get a good touch i can wait can you make him pop it i'll let him hit it on the wall all right that's so loud jeez all right good game today i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night whatever time it takes to watch this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one when we played our next placement game that played only one game on each so yeah see you guys you
