yo what's up guys for today's video i'm gonna play um whatever we end up getting pretty much from the cute ones twos and threes i haven't played like any once a season at all i played one game at the beginning of the season when i streamed and i haven't played any threes i played mainly just twos every now and then i really got ssl on twos but outside of that i haven't played much the other mode so let's get into whatever we get we'll play let's see how it goes all right we got a threes game off the bat which i was actually hoping for i haven't played threes in a while so i was actually hoping this would happen good we're actually like seventeen hundred and threes right now we're pretty low i basically just got like place and then i stopped playing these games so let's see how this goes played around one good control third man is instagos we should use space for a pass forward and pass back one of them should go okay a little bit of a double commit kind of because baltics wasn't sure if robobuddy was going or not so yeah didn't turn out too bad could have been a goal for them for sure a little bit of hesitation that's a lot of like what gets you scored on the threes i feel like is hesitation or just like bad coordination with your teammates like no one's midfield for me there for example and like throwing away the ball free like stuff like that in pro games would definitely get you punished way harder than it would in these matches but just an example you kind of want to have someone there at all times someone that's going to pressure each part of the field have someone ready for wherever the ball can spill out to pretty much the teammate should be there and i have the mid here and i can shoot that's a good example i was trying to show you guys he makes the one dealing with whatever goes to the wall here and i'm doing whatever spells out mid and even though i am third man and i am pushed up pretty far i know i'm gonna win that ball every time i have the advantage i'm playing for the reaction of you know whatever ends up happening that corner whereas the guy in net he has to kind of react to whatever happens in general but i'm only trying to cover one part of the field right it's a lot easier to attack that way should have actually passed it to my teammate i didn't see his middle there i was good from him position that early give me that option i'm not gonna go i jumped before i decided to back off last second because he's already up gonna beat me to it but i want quite a bit there big margin it's fine if he doubles that now it could be bad that should should be okay if i can get back while here anything that he hits i can deal with if he doesn't hit it take a ground let's get control of the ball here played over one more it's gonna kill a lot of time my teammates should have been able to get a boost at least get into a good position they both were able to i think well done just trying to drive up create pressure but also not fully commit myself let's see done wait ground here team it has anything high should be fine again going backward here you can cover anything get it away timmy can't turn quick enough so it might actually be bad still it's a big miss but should be okay open the other guy that could have turned there so it kind of helped a bit what about this guy if he turns middle shouldn't be able to shoot this at least yeah i shouldn't even have like worried about that touch going anywhere toward the net because it looked like he had a really bad angle on it a lot of threes really is just reading where you think the ball is gonna go and like just what's happening around you essentially everyone on their team just died i'll just play it over him keep my position on the wall still we get it forward one time pretty good gotta play the the second beat there i don't think it was too risky wait for the right touch again trying to read where the ball is going to end up maybe a block at least force them around me teammates should win that good job i have to rotate elliott back here maybe she's gone but it's fine i'll still be in a really good position to follow this up did you get 50. play double to myself i actually got to flip off that but i couldn't use it anyway so turn out the corner piece here because most likely this ball is going to come this way so i could just hold this drop my teammate let him follow this up again cover whatever my teammates aren't covering try to be in a good spot here this spills out toward that i'll be here for it and try to bump me two best one for that's probably a goal but you would save let's see if you dive on that boat good pace trim video for a bump there back wall if my teammate didn't bum me i still would've had a really good control but i still shouldn't have turned there it's on me i thought i thought he was gonna hit that for sure so i was turning on me like that that's fine one at four to hit over everybody go for a bump at the last man here because my teammate can win this ball it's gonna be pretty big again this should be one more hit forward i just play it around one put it across of course two them into like a really awkward state and this guy's just hitting it away making it to me wall now got a pass back middle nicely done really good again it's like all just moving around the field together and trying to find that one little space of open opportunity to get a shot or a pass off middle like that it's really good work around the opponent like that fake your team is dead so i know i don't have help for a bit so my goal is to fake as much as possible so my team can spawn behind me like you did doesn't matter if i die or get beat there as long as i delay enough time and they'll just insta-child because if i insta-challenge there it's really bad get behind should be okay pre-touch away i still have a full boost behind here so if he gets beat i can follow it up play it around one killed one as well which is huge take two pads and i can even turn if i want to i'm gonna go back now you might have had a really good pinch it's a good shot close one more goal maybe potentially nice clean all right the first game though three is actually a lot of fun i'm not gonna lie i feel like solo king threes is way better than soul cutting twos in my opinion it just like really depends on like how your teammates are trying to play because i do get some threes games sometimes where everyone's just very like selfish feeling like very soloy or doing everything for themselves those games uh tend to be a little bit more difficult to enjoy but it was actually fun it's a good first game let's get the next one oh yeah back to back three or three games try to show you guys more examples of what i mean by just trying to cover the space that your teammates aren't covering it's very like simple concept but it's so much harder to do than it seems already like starting off in a good way with that team has gone away back so again my like goal is to cover midfield and also this next touch if i can that's fine if i force them right there it should be enough but you could still have two forces for our teammate and their teammate can just go anyway get behind him here get off the back wall shouldn't go for that good job playing patient on that's what he should be doing there good enough time for me to get back as well it's really good wait safe third here try to wait for my opportunity to actually be able to challenge that i got two out of the play for that and the third guy has to rush his touch never going to be anything crazy unless my teammates both kind of panic here which they kind of did but it's never really gonna be anything too bad even even in that scenario off the wall someone should follow oh he can't actually should be fine backwall there take some pads you're gonna leave our back boost up even though he might grab that it's gonna at least make him rotate back a little bit slower which actually ended up working out pretty well for him i'm not gonna lie because the ball bond they're coming to him but let me go up the wall here pass down mid should be a free shot try how'd they get enough boost to actually get faster that ball it was a right idea take a loaf it to the right here stay on the ground and see my boost as well you may should have this over to my side it wasn't exactly a pass to me and he also just left which makes it a little awkward but it's okay nice one more over to my teammate should be a free shot nice good positioning pretty well done from math there you have my teammate to leave that as well and i'll just hit it to the corner for no reason really good beat around the one perfect pass perfect shot as well to be there another good example though just covering the field making sure we have someone orders empty space at all times that way there is really no empty space we're going to be able to keep pressure very easily let us play this around one we almost got the dunk i wanted there pretty close got the boost which is actually really huge there i can get a bump on one of them didn't mean this guy has no help now if i get a bump on him again would be huge i wasn't able to but it's still a good little sequence for us i'd say put it around one and look how much like just that one little touch delayed their push so much made it so much harder for them almost perfect shot my teammate all right let me take a time on this roll this back for ourselves played over one here i don't have any more boots like this fake i'm gonna go again and at least forces a free touch for my team now nice there we go really good job whoa i never realized that girl explosion did that that was really good awkward situation where the last man back rolled it back to our own back well played it over two guys and then made the third guy have to get the really awkward touch that he did there because we faked having more boost faked having more threat than we really did really good 50. for the bounce here i tried the place up perfectly and we almost did wait down left you should pass this this is like the best case scenario for path actually fun like myself off the back wall really good try on the double could have probably had it but it's honestly a really really good attempt either way i try again just to make a lot of threatening touches there good bump on one as well you may got a huge beat third man has to play passive on this uh it's gonna be really tough for him yeah so if our third arthur must have missed a boost or something i just landed okay it landed like pretty far that's fine couldn't go straight away but more often or not in threes if you realize you're stuck last man for a while and you're like 1v2 only three situation i always shot at instago and it feels like it works even against pros they almost never expect it for something they always think you're going to play it the most passive safest way possible most time when you when you do end up doing that you get punished for it it was a good shot back there it's a good save for them as well to match it wait middle first pop again just covering like the space that my teammates aren't covering here right i have a third man over me it's his ball i think he creeped up a little bit too far so he messed up a little bit it's still fine he would have been able to get a much better touch if he didn't still working out there and i can still get to go out of this most likely nice really good examples though just trying to position in ways where it feels comfortable right and also that's gonna make sure your rotations are always clean when you do that as well kind of helps with everything that makes it so you're not like disjointed in your rotation as well huge bump gives a free ball ends up working perfectly just a fake even though i wanted to get the shot there it fixed him super hard and i was actually really close to getting the goal out of this like as close as it gets so i put like a millisecond earlier as we go all right again today i hope you guys enjoyed having yourself wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
