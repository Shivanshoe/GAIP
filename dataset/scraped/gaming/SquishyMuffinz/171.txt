you never miss an upload hope you guys enjoyed today's video don't forget to subscribe you know what's up guys going to be playing three today with karma from charlotte phoenix and forkey should be some good ones let's get into it let's try to get back up to the number three spot which i think we're really close to let's take a look for 2017 oh my gosh it's been a little bit since i looked here uh we're about 30 points out the number one spot now so we can grab back up there it's doable it's doable we gotta insecure though it's gonna be a sweaty game we got cha oh g and uh t curl here so we'll see see what can be done but it's off to the right side of four key give him a chance to double tap this potentially not a bad challenge from us i could take the boost now i'm not the one up next into play so i can just hold on to my boost here try to be useful for the next touch i'm gonna have that most likely so i'll go back wall easy touch to the side some challenges for my team might as well make myself useful i landed midfield anyway should be four keys ball to boom i'll play tcraw is kind of awkward here so i can play off of him at least force him to make a touch around me here i'd say that's a win as long as it gives my teammate a free ball right then i'm gonna hit here as well it's fun put through this the wall is fine karma's a little bit close she couldn't get a good follow-up on it it's not bad here for porky go up for this because i heard him jump i want to go for it obviously i don't want to be double committing joining in on my teammates mistake in that situation better to play that out slow and smart pass over to four key might be shootable didn't jump how you wanted to you could tell made this shot a lot more awkward than it needed to be just getting chased and gold but that's okay there's no immediate danger off the demo so it's fine i don't mind that i'll take one for the team try to just keep it in not a bad shot either was potentially a threatening shot if they weren't ready for it foreign to this i'm gonna make it awkward for him at the very least play it off to the back wall try to bump him now gonna make him getting it out of his half a lot more difficult and his teammate's gonna need to help him out right so bumping that situation is really smart for that reason well done from forking good bump that created a lot of pressure as well right because his teammates probably thought he was gonna be able to carry that out by himself from the back wall and because he wasn't able to i made them all have to panic it required two guys instead of one to get that ball out helps a ton but for the bounce here i'm low boost but i can at least challenge and again make the life a little bit more difficult before i go back best case scenario everybody got my ball to go for fork you stopped for a second i figured he was trying to tell me he was done with the play there if he ended up turning again you might not have seen me so i don't blame him sometimes that happens especially when you're not calming with the the players you're playing with orcas should go for this i can wait back while this gets behind him there you go if you flick that over four key i would have had the the free touch to control i'm getting chased still something that everybody on the the sonic's roster and almost all that all system rosters like to do now is just chase you from behind it's a little bit annoying but something that i've definitely gotten very used to that's why it doesn't bother me anymore but when it first happened a lot it definitely was like frustrating to play maybe not enjoy ranked that much but then it started becoming a thing in pro play and people started playing that same annoying play style and you have to just get used to it at some point right so yes i am human too and that stuff can get frustrating when it feels like you're just you're dead the whole game but uh something that you have to get used to and i'm sure in lower ranks people will be like that happens in my my gold games all the time my diamond games all the time right something that you know you have to get uc i'm sure a lot of you guys are already used to that in your ranks you have to be a high ranking demo to lot trying to shot from us try to place it behind him make it awkward for him well saved from him good fault from karma we'll place into the bottom corner of the net she's not going to miss those i get the boost here it's the main goal 150 as well which is even better probably shouldn't have went for the shot i was trying to absolutely snipe it no no no problem that was kind of my fault as well didn't know when he was up first i saw him the whole time i started maybe forking my miss and i have a free shot here nice number one i can follow karma's next touch here play this mid i thought porky would have been there kind of just blindly passed it bad idea in hindsight because if you don't know you shouldn't probably be passing that situation i was very used to someone being a little bit close to mid there that's still on me for just assuming right no boost here so i was trying to any kind of touch middle trying to make it really weird and pass it mid but i couldn't quite almost accidentally shot that honestly good block from us got above the ball just enough that we can get a good block on that he's going to be there porky should have this to the wall at the very least well done don't have any boost here karma missed so it's gonna be a little bit awkward for a second play it to karma he's leaving it for me so i can just take the solo now pass mid we try good play from karma not a bad touch by any means good block from us very good blocking four kills very smart middle now if he wants can't follow it up back in at least pressure right make them give us the ball same here can't fall back on at least pressure and i have a free ball i can pass over to the wall my team and she's gonna have one more to me most likely i get this off the wall for four key again just not not as close as i think he is but it's not a bad play regardless right because it's still gonna make them panic because you have to imagine that situation from the opponent's pov i can almost promise you if they're underneath the ball all they see is the ball and everything above it you're not going to see anybody coming in on the ball so they're going to automatically assume that ball is high in the air in front of my net someone's going to be up for this so they didn't panic most of the time right um so yeah it's definitely not a bad play even if your teammate doesn't go for it i just keep expecting to be a little bit closer than he is which is still on me for assuming that right but uh let's get into the last game of the video so you can get two back-to-back wins here that's a good way and it was good points for us as well and uh we'll check where we are in leaderboards after the last game let's get into it all right wait all that time for two out of three of the same players and i think it took long because there's a new player in here i think they split up their party of three that's why i took a little bit longer way back post here that's actually really good shot not much i could do about that the spot i was in i should have stayed on the wall i guess but it's hard to expect a shot like that and it'd be uncontested for that long right it's more kind of just me hoping for the best in that situation and i wasn't that hard to stop if i was just positioned in a good spot right thing about threes a lot of it is just positioning and you know no matter how good the shot is if you are positioned better you're going to be able to get free goals and free saves out of stuff like that i was able to save that in a good way potentially we have a counter attack right little things like that change so much in a 3-3 environment nice challenge fork is going to weight on this which is smart i'll be level if he wants to use me can't do much of this but just backflip hopefully that alone creates enough pressure for us wait for the touchscreen from four key that's all played follow the sub get a pinch actually straight in maybe a shot maybe go out of it there we go my pinch actually went straight enough to bounce i think my quick calculations of it were correct it does seem that way so i panicked to it um but yeah we'll definitely take that i mean i was going for something that would make it awkward for them it definitely did that and he didn't get the touchscreen wandered he got us a free goal right both goals so far were purely oh no positional mistake i'm trying to leave that for forky and they try to leave it for me as both of us just trying to like be respectful that each other going for the ball which is not bad um but in a way it's almost better we double commit there then both of us leave it because i could have scored off of it right kind of a bad habit of mine i would say is being too selfless when it comes to teammates trying to go for the ball i let them have it more than not all right and i can just ball chase most of the time and probably have a better angle on the ball sounds bad but i'm i'm generally trying to like get better at ball chasing more i'm just way too oh you're going for the ball okay you can you can have it better just taking it for myself right i've always been that way though i always try to be more of a team player than anything you guys are watching for a long time i'm sure a lot of you guys already know that but for the newer people that would my play style especially in 3v3 2v2 you can't do it as much obviously but in 3v3 i always have played play for my team's the best way to win not all scenarios though some scenarios it's definitely good to to be selfish you gotta have a balance right try to pass it down to my teammate that's a good bump from karma i think he missed regardless but it's still a good bump up on one there didn't get the boost makes a little bit more difficult but good play from karma either way stay behind here i'll turn the mid here with 40 boost now i can at least challenge this make our of them they get to play going forward get this boost shut a bump i'm gonna open up a little bit more space middle here i don't have to panic or anything for this ball now let's make it weird for them i'm gonna take this mid left boost because fork is probably gonna get a touch in this ball he's getting bumps so he couldn't still a good play though he left did he play the patient not bad at all left working out this rotate behind him let him know that it's his ball just stay behind karma here again in a spot where i could try to react to i thought she was going to go for some reason but just a weird like perception i was going toward the ball wow that was a good goal the air dribble bump there is very smart she had time and air drill bump effectively makes us like a 1v1 because in this situation whoever like is first to challenge that ball the whole team expects at least a 50 out of that right even if there's three guys back they're gonna expect the 50 out of that so if they all expect a 50 and that guy just gets demoed the ball's already passed there's there's no way they can react right that's really really well played it effectively made three people back until 1v1 it's a decent trade a kill for a killer is not bad as long as it's not in your zone i think it's not bad everything oh my that's unlucky what the heck he got bumped into that the only way i'd say go for kill is bad is if you know leaves your team in a really bad spot that you died but if not then it's not a bad thing at all i would say i'll just take that slow on the aerial that way if they panic i get a free goal and i can recover pretty easily you always want to try to have at least 30 boost left when trying to like recover on the way back i think that's a good like rule of thumb to always keep track of is if you go for an aerial play always have 30 when you land so i have 40 here that way if i need to go for the ball i can if i can go for another big boost i have boost to get there quicker it's kind of hard to remember to do that though the demo a lot from behind but like i said something i'm very very used to everyone's just bumping now try to take that ball of courty also tried so i ended up not being able to control it at all but it's okay about a fake challenge here for my team gonna make them panic if anything and then if they don't do anything i can just backflip there i like to think of rocket league it's gonna sound weird probably like like a bunch of if statements like if they do this then you do this if they do this then you do there's always like a reaction to what they do like for example in that play there if i fake challenge that and it gets behind me i just go back and my teammate gets a free ball if they just let it roll you know i just backflip into it so it all depends on what they're doing you're always reacting to their action that's always what rocket league is pretty much just a bunch of reactions to their actions and trying to pre-position in spots where the reaction is going to be much easier you know to actually pull off but yeah fun games regardless i'm gonna say ggs um and i'm gonna head off myself and let's go look at the leaderboards real quick we're back at the number five spot we're top five yet again get justin and i are all three in a row here looks pretty clean we gotta get back up to the one two and three spot though we had uh o'callaghan and hobbit both grinding dnaps as well getting above us by a little bit but we can get it back but yeah good games today guys i hope you enjoyed
