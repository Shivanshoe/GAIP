every single day and it's all thanks to you guys so if you're one of the 48 percent of people still watching my videos who are not subscribed please go down below the video right now press that subscribe button and press the bell as well she always notified when I upload a brand new video and then once you've done that let me know down below so I can see how many of you brand new beautiful people have joined this community appreciation she'll join a video you know what's up guys the last video you finished off at champion 1 division 2 so super solid all-around thousand 8 mm are already it's only been a couple of videos we're just breezing through this road to cred shape with the random settings and hopefully we don't lose anyone today or the next few videos are being continued our undefeated streak to the end of this road to Grand chip and then we'll do one more after this probably in solo standard yeah super solid so far make a point to explain let's get into our random car of the date and we're gonna be using the gizmo with the wizard hat and a smiley face yeah the smiley face it said all right so not bad not bad I actually like the game I'm pretty sure is the octane hitbox even though it looks a lot taller than it I'm not hundred percent sure on that but I think it is not in a box now but let's get our random settings for today and let's go into free play and put it me alright so as you guys know one of my amazing viewers made me this beautiful beautiful program or all I got to do is press the randomizer button and it gives me all my randomized camera settings straight away I don't have to go on google and do the random number generator thing and then go back and forth so this makes the beginning of the videos way quicker and yeah let's figure out what our set is gonna be for today so we got a hundred F of V not bad 282 this is not bad at all so these are actually nice setting I don't know if a V 280 distance 100 high one angle so it's negative 160 stiffness 1.3 and 9 swivels that's 1.4 doesn't matter too much for swivels and then chance that should be the one point to do these are actually these are actually really good settings I actually like these I think these are gonna be good because the two 8100 height is actually really good duo of settings and fo B is actually nice as well so let's get into it this is a huge upgrade from last video settings last video settings are so difficult to use these are actually gonna be easy on the eyes that thing there's gonna be really nice to use I think we can actually play really well with these to be honest so we got swivel speed at 1.4 and in the last settings 1.2 I didn't change at all so let's check it out and free play rule so check it out in free play real quick and there you go these are the settings these are not bad at all dude these are the super nice I think we can get a lot of good goals with these we're gonna need to get crazy goals we're just trying to win every single game obviously and give you guys many tips as possible but like these are clean these are really nice settings I actually like how this turned out a lot so yeah we'll get to the game for today and hopefully we'll continue our win streak I think we have a really good chance to do and so with these saying these are really nice let's get into it as you're playing against zero results 965 and more I believe that's still diamond 3 I'm not mistaken but if you win this he's probably gonna get into champ 1 off of it there we go good start I like to hold on to a little bit of boost off kickoff so I can go for stuff like that I also try to grab the pad leading up to the shot if you can't helps a lot an extra 12 boost goes a long way you baited him in all the way Terry booster I really like dribbling with this car by the way you're for a double slow down a bit almost placed it behind then I was a good half flip recovery so he's got good mechanics he could tell it's probably someone who doesn't play crazy amount on ones but he's got good mechanics doesn't get challenged from us but yeah these settings are super solid like they don't feel like crazy far off the usual so should have a good time this video should the struggle super hard trying to use these I don't think it's go for a double flipped reset oh I missed it slightly I rolled a little bit too early there yeah he's good enough to finish off and punish you on those so definitely playing better and better players I think you could tell it's gradually gotten better and better which I hope that's how it works shows that the ranking system working how it should be for ones is that that exception of a game mode where you will play players at low ranks that are just better than their rank just stay with this ball here we go the thing I will say about the lower fov is you always feel stiffer always always always okay how'd you make sure the right stiffness because it does feel stiff that's because we have 60 statements and low for V so you don't really want to use super I see this with lower fov always feels weird it's save just know where this guys actually like diamond 3 there now think is a Smurfs but there's nobody actually damnit 3 his mechanic she good double tap there we go that is feel nice not trying to upset anyone with the series just for fun I feel bad for those guys mad by the way he said that he just got lucky to be honest because I could have had settings that were just completely terrible impossible to play with I got these Oh Mike ha ha ha that is actually insane what the hell I just like this should've left he'd nothing to say the flip reset just like got blasted even faster because even felt me it was amazing all right good first game let's get to the next one see we can keep it up but I'm sure we'll get some sort of division up off of that we did up to Division three so we're getting closer closer to champ two already and probably to play two more games so we might get a chance to after this videos over so let's keep it up see you can get more win Sisco all right planning it's a 1074 MMR play yeah all right the highest he played so far he's even got a grand champ title in trouble to be fair but still a grand champ title good save actually I was gonna get the double there I'm gonna cut this it's like super patient defense here so you could tell his understanding of the game is is really good already not panic on any of this stuff we waited super long got a free go out of it all right we're gonna have a matchup here we have to take more serious than the others I feel like you have all four food to fakie car shut here for the flip reset get save as you saw so I'm gonna go for the my old stratton ones just kind of boost starving keep taking power shots after power shot hope for the best see if that works i'm studing they're still super hard to use though in terms of getting good touches like off the walls and stuff yeah this guy's obviously not like just a cheap player you tell us-- really solid let's go for more more of a serious approach just take the ball slower and stuff and we see you like to play patiently he likes to just wait for your your play on goal here so I wanna go for more like a durable bumps and more just dribble bumps in general I think that'll work you didn't mess up there that I could tell ya in defense trying to bump me I respect it I'm gonna go for the boost type this up once go back to the ground yeah actually challenge over there but I know it's gonna be a win for me the angle I had was much better than his he was coming from kind of like a panky angle I don't know definitely tougher to win from his side than it was true me there I was blocking the entirety of of my side of the field to feel like whereas he had the whole like left side open kinda hard to explain what I mean by that but let me play it for like a very long time when it comes to like understanding how fat you fit these work you can see like the openings where the balls gonna end up after your most of the time try to get a flick out of the Hat but I missed also fake them yes if I'm making a video how people know that let's assume that I could hit a shop today okay I don't wanna be that guy I'll then I'm hit this again I'm gonna kill opens up a lot of space for me and I have all this time trying to set up for an irritable bump here alright I guess to fake them out thought was gonna do something different I was gonna go for the eligible but had any one for the ball I think I had the bump on there I save yeah he's really consistent with those it's crazy because already in in the champ ranks we're playing players that feel like they're more consistent with their mechanics and the players in twos we were reaching the load grand champ why do you sir if he said I'm surprised I would think people in the lower ranks would have got more upset but it seems like people in this rank and this guy's probably grandshaykh other modes or load grand champ at least our people who seem that getting more upset about it surprising yeah this guy like I said a mechanic's or soda for sure I'm not sure like he is lacking like certain things obviously but his is it's urgent making out challenges and stuff is really solid for the rank he's at right now for sure he definitely isn't this ranking ones I don't think he'd have a hard time get out of this rank try to control this now far away is we have all this space or love come to me like the fake challenge a lot tried to see you I try to get more of idea what he does that's not that's not the ball that you wanted like immediately challenged after a fake challenge like that I'm gonna set it song cuz the whole point of fake challenging is trying to get them to give you the ball and I didn't fully give him weight possession there so him like jumping for a weird flipper set toward the wall like that if I go quick and it's good for his shot to go against him immediately so you want to kind of pick and choose your face challenges in better positions so he does he's probably a fake challenge the first one here see if I throw away the ball he didn't settle for the bump instead I got too close to this goal to the part where I knew he's not gonna fake challenge when it's that close fake challenge is that close set a goal normally gets you scored on Chris we're just gonna flick it then he gets scared and flicky and then it's too too close to your net to be able to react and get back to it let the killer I'll see let's face again see we can do oh my gosh that's the second double flip reset the series No oh my god I was actually the same what the hell you could buy the c4 so bad why is he so rad dude that was actually the same though actually super clean double what's he gonna do here ooh close unlucky didn't get the correct bounce for him there how'd it go for the little floaty bump I'm pretty jump for me I see it does like your name I'm gonna go back down and balls you that oh never fly what the hell oh they're free jobs I figured he'd actually have it aired Rawabi and then he messed up his touch right you kind of just fell down too much didn't get out of it hey Pat stop he bounced up off the ground asked for a once GC I got some ass for the bed man happens bro we really do be getting called a spicy ones I hear I have troll a little bit yeah ever since he's got a little upset the trolling a little bit obviously I'm taking four serious we had the game secured such a care I remember back when I was like getting better at the game and I run it's like like back and I was like really low right I was like improving a lot of things like working on a lot of things and I was running into like Smurfs I actually loved running two Smurfs who were just like do the coolest [ __ ] like he would just double tap on you every time I actually didn't care losing rank because I was like this is sick I want to be able to do it one day yeah I mean like I don't know you could look at that two ways you can get pissed off or you could just like kind of just enjoy watching what they're doing and they'd say the replay kind of look at what they're doing to improve that's what I did like I ran into I forgot who it was but he was like a low you like a low level pro back in back in the day and he was on an alt account but his name was still the same thing yeah as like his name and then in brackets old or something and he was hidden double tabs like every single time and this was like probably 2015 like right when the game came out probably a month after the game came out and I just saw that and I was like damn I say the replays I watch it back and I try to learn so much off of that and I feel like I did little bit to be honest just saving the replay and watching how you control this car as a massive help star you look at the two ways obviously there's reason to get upset even lose your rank but I don't know whatever I don't mean to upset you brother Lewis but uh have a good day man yeah we got ourselves the division up to div for day and we play one more game to see beating snag ourselves see - so let's see how that goes all right for last game between 1100 players so this is a champ Warner ready he's got a season 12 grand champ tag it's a bit tough and we can't even see what he's gonna type to us if you want to type anything because he's on PlayStation I believe that's a bad first touch like I said I have no control off the walls whatsoever with low ffe like going for double dutch is so difficult and they said oh no why so only thing it feels hard everything else feels okay maybe good sell it's got a speedy gotta go out of it though good old the fake strat get control and get a just banger immediately back I'll tell you faked on this one to see those works probably gonna read it so it's slow kinda let's say I don't want to flip it there cuz I think I wouldn't miss to be honest I can't cheat immediately off that there's any girl for the boosts so I can just try to take a shot on goal there she does also really bad fifty-first you could probably shoot off that to be honest give me that back notice go down here I tried to bump him but did nothing MP soccerpro he's feeling a deed I know something about these settings like they shouldn't be hard to play with but they're still hard to play with it's hard to explain this feels weird when you used to like super high fov I think it is that mixed with the stiffness obviously yeah there's no doubt in my mind this guy's normally great champ in other modes 100% at least Locrian ship but I believe we can get the win still I have faith always there's gonna be a hard man to finish the series without losing I mean we can even lose this game it's gonna be really hard and we're not even up to chip to yet we just need to play more brainy I just can't see us beating like the higher like the higher rank players with really test settings man I was it challenge I should be able to get back stay on this for me to back off so I stay on this ball actually wet for that guess guys super Agra like surprisingly a go going again actually save that you're gonna again okay then he doesn't stop Gopal that's his playstyle try to be as eager as possible bang alright never gonna fake yet I think he's gonna fake you're not thinking that I'm going to you or he's not can here mom thought I had the double mind game going on but I didn't better kill just get up in the top some space so you can view another flick maybe just no flick alright so you have control your this let him come to us so you can do save again but it's not quite enough cuz didn't get to the corner that's the the hard part about playing against that style where you just getting a shot at over and over again if you get a bad touch that's not enough over to the corners they're gonna have a free free rebound and they go out of it gotta make sure every save is to a corner it really likes to stay on the balls which is good yeah like you shouldn't be challenging straightaway for that I have full control of the ball there and if I see you turn I'm gonna flick by the way if he turns toward me fake challenges then turns away he gets a free ball here but instead I know he's playing aggressive so I know he's just gonna go straight for the ball there see how you react to that should I grab some peds here I'm gonna get out of position I'm making him put the ball on a bad spot for him so I'd have to do anything kind of just gave me a cold air that's that's really a way to play against playstyle like this is just way too aggressive let them beat themselves pretty much see double flip reset mine you just chose you start going he's crazy he doesn't stop then he go again [ __ ] away for he didn't for once actually the one time he didn't astray there we go yeah good mechanic so definitely tell he's got at least low GC mechanics so I might even be a smurf to be honest you feel like he's a decent ones player to be honest with you this has that like onesie playstyle tool kill I don't need to go for a goal here even though I could have them come to me kill some time off the clock I know you can't do anything with that ball if anything she's gonna bounce off the wall and go back to where the side so I'm living in just a weird spot until he makes a mistake here so if I stay right here if you drive into this ball to hit off me it should be fine there we go it's a perfect space you were they trying to challenge you and I have the advantage and win the challenge for sure but yeah there we go we got 34 points out of that and we ended up pretty much the same anymore he was at so it's champion - division - I'm assuming let's see champ - division - yep all right pretty solid and we got 90 points to go until we're champ 3 and then we're that much closer to - GC man that's that's not so everybody almost do with this entire series which is crazy so yeah pretty solid set of camera settings for this video I'm happy with those to help us get the win if you had harder camera settings to use I don't know if we're gonna beat this dude because you're solid yeah well played to ever ever play this video but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed and we'll be back with the next one hopefully with some more wins hopefully we can keep the streak alive yeah I appreciate all the support you guys have been insane as always and yeah like comment subscribe and I see you on the next you
