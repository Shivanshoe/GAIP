yo what's up guys so since i recorded the last video i actually ended up finishing my play since i got grand champ two after my placements i'm pretty sure and uh we've done really well we've won i think almost all of our games maybe lost one game i'm not 100 sure but done really well and we're already getting close to ssl and two which is good and for today we'll be playing some twos or threes games i'm not going to community ones not really in the mood for once we still have only put two games that i showed you guys in the videos um but we'll be playing twos and threes and yeah let's get into this even get some dubs see how it goes all right the first time we got antagonist 205 against adam fupp and nity let's say this goes let's put through my teammate should i take my time on this here top touch to myself get a 50. i think to 205 probably should rotate all the way back there instead of turning it just cuts off our other teammate makes it harder on him but not terrible doesn't end up too bad little double quests like that aren't the biggest deal it's more if you do double like that and then it just goes straight to the other team that's when it gets dangerous those are ones you got to be careful for i'm going to pop it see my team wants to go kind of locked it for himself i didn't want to go first of solo play there i don't think it was the right play to make and that saves me some boost as well i'm probably not gonna get by all three players or solo play there it doesn't really matter how good it is first guy's just gonna challenge i have to beat that guy and get the ball for free so i think it's almost better lofted for your teammate get a soft touch unfortunately i missed that boosts on me so i got some pads though i think people play a little bit too fast a lot of times in uh rank threes the game moves a lot slower than people think a lot of the time if you see how slow i just moved right there i created a lot of opportunity just because i was in a position where i could react to multiple things my teammate uh was in an awkward spot i was able to recognize that make up for it get into position to pass and make a good pass right but if you're moving too fast you might miss that opportunity it's about keeping your momentum keeping your speed but also you know trying to use your team at the same time it's really a mixture of those things try not to go too fast so again i can react to a random own goal that comes to my net and it's just like no way you can expect that but if you're playing slow and you're in the right position there's nothing that you can't really be ready for timmy misses this i'm still in a good position if he hits it i'm in a good position to follow it still so you want to kind of be in a spot where you're covering both best case and worst case scenario and saving your boost right not the greatest touch but they're going to be too far back to get a good follow-up right away not be able to be into this ball but i can at least bait his touch probably gonna flick it right right about here and i could just hit it across i defended that as well as like two people could defend that so oh that's really okay really scary situation didn't need to be so scary but i think a little bit of a mix up on the goal line they weren't sure who wanted to go next it's gonna single jump 50. and again look how many little challenges i'm winning just by myself that would take two or three people if you're just going full speed constantly right you gotta you gotta choose when it's worth to actually go fast for the ball do you miss your pass low maybe to me if not i'll rotate middle try to be here i couldn't really get a shot on it i went too far to the left i couldn't re-correct in time i should have this oh unfortunate is he seeing that makes sense should have been a pretty easy tape to just pop over him but pcc instantly becomes a much more difficult task i'm just gonna fake the whole time try to take my time here get a 50 it goes high bump the last guy if i can it makes it really hard for them to defend this next play teammate only needs to get like any kind of touch toward that it's going to be hard for them so i get soft touch to myself here money point teammates rotate back so i got to stall time for that so quick hit toward the back wall actually wouldn't be useful kind of beat the opponent to that if i get a touchdown that's good might be bad here here's my backpack which i like you can cover most options with that not the greatest touch but those away from danger for a second take my time here and try to fake them a little bit gotta touch i can't really react to should have the advantage here just get one touch over this guy take the boost and create some pressure run through for some demos this guy turns here he has turned away from the ball which kind of helps us a bit wait for a touch team should have this back wall pressing the next touch out again can be risky if my teammate makes a mistake there and now it brings both of us into that mistake but you have to have trust sometimes or else no play would ever really form trying to beat him here again just painting the touch go for a bum i'm gonna click here trying to beat him there we go i'm not really even trying to like hope that goes in i assume that if i beat him there it probably gets saved but my whole role there is just try to beat that guy help my teammate get boost helps them get back around in the play and it helps them be more valuable after the fact so going for just a straight up shot that's low is not going to work so just anything above him works there again trying to play in his power i'm reacting to multiple scenarios at once got around the whole team pretty much got out of defense so we need to do play safe here save my boost match my teammate wait on the wall he probably has a read here i'm gonna trust him okay he's not gonna go now i don't see that i could just drive into this ball actually creates a lot of pressure just driving into that and i'm quick enough to rotate around my recovery time is really really low to get back try to rotate wide for this teammate should have touched back to me i'm gonna fake the big hit here it's going to make adam back off a little bit i can get one big flick now let him touch this give me should have touched him fake his big hit rotate far behind and wide that way if my teammate makes a bad touch can make up for it waiting for what they have here again even like these bad hits for my teammates i'm ready for them because of where i'm positioning every time past this middle for antagonist would have been better ball for antagonists for sure but anyway not a bad game that's well done did what we had to do well against the next one stephen keep it up get the some good these games in for the first game of the season we'll see how it goes all right for the last game we got reverb and who else not letting in do we have a third oh did we just start this game with oh stop being toxic okay well i hope uh this guy is not like a toxic player and it's just like a weird ironic name i hope not i've had that happen before take my time here i'm gonna fake this i had to put my team to touch it if i go for a bump again if i got that bump this is the goal i don't like to jump for the bumps too often though especially in that situation because a lot of times i jump they don't jump when i like you know vice versa i end up picking the wrong thing half the time just don't get very lucky with uh those situations i feel like but if i jump that would have just been a goal but i assume in my head they're gonna see me going for a bump and then jump so if i stand the ground it's the best case scenario but oh my god that's actually crazy can't tell if he has this stay there just in case good to play the miss goodreads from him gotta play for the mid boost here actually a good paw from him biller should beat him by a good margin though let him hit this little wall paper flip reset here good job i still have some boost to stay upfield my team's actually in a bad spot to challenge this good goodbye i'm gonna fake this i'm gonna make the guy behind me panic a little bit same thing here team on the back wall should have good job i wasn't sure if it was back yet so i want just in case i still have 50 boost this could be bad though thought i saved my flip there so if you go back wall you can again just react to pretty much anything reverb is moving a little bit too fast it's the one like bit of criticism i'll give him shout out to that like this this bit of defense has been a little bit difficult but you have to to pick your times uh you know to speed up and what you're actually choosing to go for i think it's gonna just be a goal for them ended up missing but yeah i feel like you have to choose what's worth it to actually challenge when you're stuck on defense for this long and if you watch all the pros that are very smart on good teams you know that those players are going to be dealing with like suffocation situations where they don't have much boost very well because they're moving moving slow and they're challenging stuff that is valuable to challenge stuff that's going to give their team a free ball that's the only stuff you'll see a pro challenge if it's valuable in a way that it gives their team a free ball after actually really a fake that's well done but in the other team they don't have anyone really challenging this filo should trust that row will be behind them because he doesn't challenge it makes his life a lot harder it makes pretty much both of them equal one player and that's the last thing you want to do you want you want your defense to be layered and you want to be something that's hard for uh you know the opponent to actually get through you want it to be something that they have to do a lot of work to get through not just one little play and it gets by two of you right so just challenge this then they have the shop perfectly for it to be a goal now and i don't think that's gonna happen my teammates have a lot of time to react to it so if i challenge me a midfield like that it forces the ball away back to my back well i think that's the best case scenario just gonna stay close this fake the bounce teammate should be back actually does become really bad because he misses but it should be very that should be like very easy for us to get control of the situation after yeah it's just a bad madness but it's okay there's a lot of time to get a soft touch to the corner he's a lot of time to do anything with that ball pretty much if you're moving forward in the solo play and you get dispossessed actually not a bad thing you should have two teammates behind you if you're first man moving forward in a solo play it really shouldn't matter at all if anything i would say majority pros actually try to bait losing the challenge on a solo play 90 of the time and that's because if you watch what happens in a situation if i have a soul play here even just gets past me watch where it goes goes to the right my teammate should win this ball right that's why it doesn't really matter if you get beat if you have someone behind you it's more on your teammates to be positioned correctly if you're a second man now it's a different story you're trying to play for you know like like right there i made a mistake i went for a perfect touch and i missed it so it actually led to my team being in a bad spot because of that if i was first man it literally wouldn't matter at all first man you're free to make uh any kind of play you want pretty much you're trying you're trying to put them in a position where they're throwing the ball away right third man you're trying to play as safe as possible for your team you're trying to delay time for them to get back and second man you're just trying to play with your third man make sure that your first man has time to rotate that's pretty much all you're doing in all three roles that's right there second match baited that okay again it can be hard okay this is why i can be hard on your solo queuing because our third man in this game for example every time someone's third so i think it's been reverb a lot of the time he's been um having a tendency of staying up a little bit too long but when he goes for a play oh i should have been saved as well when he goes for a play staying up in their half for a little bit too long like a few seconds too long so when that happens it forces the second man to have to play a lot saver for a lot longer than necessary and that also puts a lot of strain on the third man so that's why threes is all about everyone working together it's like all about being a cohesive unit everyone being on the same page that's why solo queue is very difficult and i think people complain most about solo q3s and say it's awful whatever but the reason why is exactly that people don't play the roles exactly how they should be played but again it's very hard to teach those things and the only reason why pros even know those things and how it should be played is because they've been playing professionally for years i've been playing this game professionally for for so long it's only reason why i understand what those roles should be doing and even then i i sometimes i just don't care what's happening in a ranked game and i i don't like pay enough attention so you can't really um be too critical of those things a lot of the time i think a lot of people watching pros will watch them and be like why are they driving up to the ball why are they letting the opponent hit it over them stuff like that but it's actually like very very like deep like little little decisions like that are actually very very deep things i think you're trying to bait it for a teammate then move toward the left like create a play like you're creating a counter off of them having the ball already you're trying to formulate a counter off of them having full possession of a play which is something that you know you're watching and you don't see what's happening but for example someone has a dribble i'll go up i'll bait it he'll flick it to my teammates behind me my teammate will hit it to the left to me i now have full control on the wall and i can make a play over one pass middle go for air drill bump whatever i want to do right but it gives me a lot of options because i just drove up and baited it but you know a lot of people don't see that i think like oh you got flicked or you got beat to that it's not a bad thing to get beat to things if you're first man if you have a teammate behind you you're actually just passing to your teammate you're essentially just making them pass it to your teammate that's all it is um but yeah that's a i don't know it's more of a more advanced thing i guess to understand and it looks weird again when you're watching all kinds of different pros doing it but it is a smarter thing to do and it might look like a low rank thing but if you do it that's why you can watch pros sorry i'm rambling a bit that's why you can watch pros playing low ranks like i played my brother's friends my brother and his friends that are all around like champ one champ two maybe into grand champ i will be able to 1v5 then based off just baiting the ball driving up fake challenging they they panic every single time it just happens every single time and you can get full control throw in some fake there's so many things you can do there's so many levels and there's a reason why pros can dominate versus multiple of a lower rank because they just understand the game at a deeper level right but a lot of you guys watching might be those champ one players champ two players like why are they just driving up to the ball that there's a big reason behind everything a professional player does in this game it's very difficult to uh to explain every single thing but there's a lot to it there's a lot of little things that go on a lot of little things pros might not even be aware of that they're doing that's just you know developed habits over time that seems to be the best case scenario for most situations and it's just um it's a very complicated game to be honest it's very complex and i think that's why i enjoy it it's why i've learned so much over the years about it and that's why i like playing every day still so yeah hope you guys enjoyed having someone to put day or night for the time of years watching this like
