yo what's up guys gonna be playing some hoops today with justin i did play hoops in a recent video i'm pretty sure and out of all the extra game modes i've played so far it's by far my favorite i really do enjoy it i think the idea of it's really good i just don't like the maps a little bit tiny that's the only thing i don't like about it but we're playing with justin for today who i would say is the best player in the world when it comes to hoops obviously he's not a pro player in hoops but obviously him being as good as he is at the actual game you know he's gonna be damn good at hoops as well i'm gonna play with them in the previous hoops video as well so it's gonna be fun let's get into it let's see if we can get some dubs and uh before we get into it follow him on twitter at its underscore justin the link will be down below in the description you're trying to reach 100k on twitter before the end of the year so i'll go follow them there as a uh thank you for helping me you know run some twos games for some videos also make sure you do drop a big subscription to this channel because obviously we're on our on our way to two million subscribers is the next huge milestone that we can reach so help me on the way there i appreciate y'all i think thank you to everybody who's subscribing every single day and liking every single video commenting on every single video i appreciate y'all see if this video can get 20 000 likes is that possible i don't know we'll see but uh yeah let me know what you think about the videos get into it champion three division two right now we're almost super sonic legend i don't think we'll reach this video but we'll get pretty damn close let's get into it see if we can get some dubs see how it goes all right for the first game playing against minch and therm see let's go justin goes for this one my first touch here i can't reach this so i'll just wait try to control it for myself 50 off the wall good read from justin nice touch i'm gonna take my time here pop it up once see what he does hit us off the back wall again just a 50 is fine go straight back to justin anyway let him go for this again trying the shot trying to keep pressure grabber back corner boost here i feel like hoops like we're playing much higher ranked players not obviously in this people that play this quite a bit but i feel like a lot of it really is just like solo plays and air dribbles stuff like that yeah it's definitely the most effective way to score in this from uh my experience so far let us control this middle good pinch nice good shot from justin good work that's a good example of what i'm talking about just a nice little slope like that pretty op i don't think justin goes for the ball on these i think gets a free save instead like i said he plays quite a bit of hoops doesn't play it all the time but i know he plays quite a bit of it so he knows pretty well how to catch some dubs in this game mode try to just beat one maybe dunk the other one close and got the corner booster hold on to my boost so i can be useful that's fine not a bad idea to fake there can't get a easy shot out of that both playing patient on the back wall just in case right behind justin is going to be next up defend that should be a goal for us there we go good work from us there good patience just baited them in good play from us there this is my ball to go for the challenge you fall from justin try to play to him again i don't have any boost that's pretty much all i can do in a situation with the back boost here not going to be in quite yet unless that bounces really well from usually no immediate danger i like to hold on to my boost here make myself useful if he gets a big hit nice from justin still have a lot of boosts probably gonna have this though or the fake close misread it i should have held my flip i think it would have been better the better play there saving everything these guys are crazy should miss put it up to justin he's gonna be there for that i'll let justin go take the back corner hold on to the boost again same ideas before he's gonna have control here right off the corner actually not a bad idea for a pinch there's a chance to go straight in to slow like a very low chance but definitely a chance it's possible decent pinch across again let me go all the way back here doesn't play the situation's like very passive in a way that like no matter what they do you can pretty much get back to it still have boost for the next play it's a very smart way to put out those situations i just sneezed so if you guys hear like a muted bit of sound if you guys i see a lot of you guys wondering like what those muted bits are in my videos sometimes if i sneeze or i cough or like there's a background noise i like to just mute it that way you guys don't hear it it's not one but one big loud noise in your ear that's a lot of uh what that is when there is that muted section of audio you guys are ever wondering so i do see that comment sometimes what happens at audio at a certain time and it's just me trying to get rid of the very loud sound for you guys that's all it is really i'll tell you more here take the boost that was a good you play for now on the bump take my time here close just destroyed justin i'll try to get the bump on this guy to help him out should be fine though let him touch that as well there's no danger yet should be okay decent double from room doesn't really get much like ground going forward but not a bad double at all right past the justin good job i saw him jump early so i just hit it into him quick it's a good play very clean game a lot of good goals a lot of good plays touch this again i didn't mean to pinch that to be honest but i'll take it all right he's truly to me oh i didn't flirt high enough no the second touch i didn't mean to do it that hard one more for the boys no ho ho we pinched it i can't believe it i can't believe it it kicked me out of the party i gotta invite him back all right good first game let's get into the next one steven get the back-to-back dubs see how it goes all right for last game playing is chickens and envy good kick off from justin to start he's gonna have a touch already should be fine for justin she had a challenge for him i have a lot of boosts here still just waiting in a good position after he's irritable here it'd be fun it's also shot on go see this you have to save jessica follow nice all right it's already too awkward for him i'll just wait in a position that if he does get the save there obviously i can follow it up maybe get a shot of it as well good 50. good try on the 50 and the dunk almost to go from justin as well so i may play this back to him i don't know if i can but hopefully this is okay should be fine can you go for the 50. don't touch that middle it's not really bad for us to be at that middle so i don't mind it at all if we go straight to just in that scenario anyway i wouldn't only predict that if it was like a normal game but i just don't know how to read these uh the bounces on the smaller stadium perfectly over two of them should be in as well there we go good touch to ourselves dude that's a good pop didn't throw it away kept it close to myself i can get a nice little double tap off of it get 50 from us take the corner here let's try i should've known so quick to that i should've taken a better angle at it first patience from justin i couldn't reach it it was one of those things that's like probably so close on the server me touching it but didn't quite get there i don't think justin expected the the straight up shot out of that it's a good play from them a block from us still 40 boosts here it's pretty good position to be in good kill nice touch from justin gonna wait back here full boost doesn't should go for this i'm guessing nice good b from us that works gonna get a shot of shots i went for the the ceiling double ended up missing maybe i would have blocked him if he got the hit there not sure i ended up putting on the back it's mod like pov replays i feel like i might be better for viewing experience having that on so i'm gonna leave that on from now on i think it might be better to learn from as well honestly because you can see exactly what happened in certain situations no i gave him the little nudge a little nudge forward i made him supersonic instantly i don't think the guy behind expected that the 200 iq team bump shutter this block good 50 from justin pass across to him ah miss reddit that's okay can't follow this one up it's gonna be justin to save this probably actually it's fine bruce will come back maybe one more here no that'd have been a nutty double if i hit that down i should take it more slow i think if i could have the only thing i could have done there to make it easier to save behind your full boost later over one go for the shot there we go they pass from justin nice all right good two games pretty solid stuff all around can't really complain about that a lot of good goals a lot of good plays a lot of fast high level speedy plays throughout both those games so if you guys enjoyed that have yourself a wonderful day or
