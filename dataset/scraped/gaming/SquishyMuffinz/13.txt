yo what's up you guys three queueing threes twos and ones whatever we get we'll play let's get into it see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right the first thing we got omar and drew against myself and scribbles scrabbles gribbles i'm not sure the z there i got the boost it's actually big that's not my flipped cancer that's what i wanted it is all good my nose is so itchy first time to have itchy nose past middle get fake 1v1 for a long time now see he does with it i'll get to the ceiling here nice that works i'll definitely take that these all my boots went to the ceiling touched myself actually good shot waited to the very last moment to shoot it they ended up ongoing it's too awkward on the goal line for too long played around one looking for the other guy i'm gonna fake jump here make a panic a bit and i still have my full boost i fake them i try to jump too high on these these attempts so i don't waste too much boost dude it does nice to me how to cover there's no point i mean also like full committing for it seemed like you had it down you can just jump for me here a little bit awkward got the boost as well and made him hit anyway i'm gonna just jump for this now why not almost a shot was a good attempt good turn here as soon as he had the pinch decided to cancel just stay on this we could attempt this should have wasn't the best touch to the corner is there able to get an easy follow-up like that but didn't turn out too bad and you got a really bad first touch here so he has no play on this ball i don't have to panic or anything put it over one it should just be a goal i can just air dribble it in really good play there take our time with that split them in keep it close enough where we have the advantage the whole time and then it's very simple go after playing really well you're really good here try to get back left my teammates they need boosts usually that means they want the back left pass i'll kick off i messed up here i still say this somehow i don't i don't know how to be honest i missed a boost twice i played this back to myself that's actually really good i don't know i don't know i'm recovering out of like the weirdest situation my teammate just got bombed but i was last like for a while there we recovered twice and swatted i should not have been able to get out of to be honest surprising myself a little bit this game that's unfortunate and then they got two pretty bad goals to get it back but that's two so it happens back off and just their cheat was much more aggressive on it it's not a good kill for us because i get the ball but just go aggro for it you make sure to shoot taking a slow approach it works too good job i think he had a i think he had a goal fiends a shot but it works maybe he didn't trust he can get the perfect shot in time struggles are doing good though gives me a lot of space to have a shot there i think the best bet if you have space on a shot aim low and as fast as possible you can just pick the spot they're not in and you hit it as fast as possible they're not going to save it that's what i like to do on empty nets or like not emptyness but a shot where it's uncontested and they're just in there trying to defend it slow and fast always uh best thing to do i think pick three pads on the way back here i'm gonna go for the back boost and then just wait for a shot it's not going to be that good the strawberry really is perfect i think it's something that a lot of people have to understand especially lower ranks almost every period even high rank though the shop being absolutely perfect is very very very unlikely from what i've noticed so you can just play patient a lot of times get a free ball off of it like you've been there look at these situations my teammate were just in two spots where they had a free shot technically and both of the shots were were not threatening at all you just could wait on the ground then it went over i'm not gonna go here's no point he's going for a bump on me and just threw the ball away again just free ball didn't have to do anything for it i could just fake him here try to snipe it bottom corner there we go perfect it's really smart play there we go got it really forfeit that's really well played my whole game is a little minor hiccup middle of the game they got two goals back like one little bump from them and then they got a capital they had two goals back off that and that's like twos can change really quickly in that aspect but yeah good game regardless a lot of good plays going on let's get to the next one so you can keep it up and get back back dubs let's see how it goes playing all three modes by the way oh all right it's actually gonna be a good game we got spider in a once game for last match i did say i wanted to do a once game for you guys so to be good it's been a while since i played one of these he's a very solid player so we'll see not sure what to expect here i'm gonna go for this probably if i had to beat him it's not going to be in but still good play the patience from him spider was an x pro used to be on what is now oxygen oh he's a good player it's gonna be a sweaty game for sure a lot of ones in my opinion is just depending well when they have their opportunities so that they get stuck in your net and also when you have your opportunity not over committing that's the big thing about once you have try to master those two things it always works a little fake i just did always i went quiet for a second i was focused but if you pretend like you're gonna go for the boost like here instead of hit the wall because i'm gonna go for the boost he has to respect the fact that i'm close to that ball the whole time he's not gonna dive in on that so i know i have the advantage there even though it looks like a sketchy situation nice really good start three goals is nothing though in this mode i got three goals in 40 seconds so you can do the exact same back to me your cop is looking good there right now i'm gonna fake this one i'm gonna go ground really hopefully it's not in really good safe from him though ah bad bounce for me unlucky honestly there's a there's a pretty high chance that rolls up and i'm safe but bounced out for him good save though from him maybe it would have been better played to just hit the other corner boost play the possession and then go for a shot when i have a better chance to kind of what i'm doing here play to the mid beast i know he has full boost so i'm going to flip early try to threaten the fact that i have this flip i still have 40 boost but i'm gonna go for his corner oh if i won the back we should have been huge i still have the gold uh but really good play to stay on that be annoying so we got it looks like we still got it and one's at least i've put this one in so long i think i have three placements done this whole season i'm still playing how i want to play in this mode which is good go to the corner to myself gonna fake him he's gonna have a touch here oh he got the boost huge win from him i should stay on the ball again maybe really job put down the space wall honestly been a little bit awkward last little bit here but good fake challenge to get the ball off of them trying to keep it in spots where you can't just like pull them into a challenge then we got a good flick i'm gonna fake jump here make a panic i should have this keep it close enough i still have control of the play you can't really do much here and if you choose to full commit to that can be pretty bad for him that's a really good challenge for him it's gonna be a goal good job a lot of like super close quarters challenges going on there those situations you have to play patient in like every challenge situation like you have to make sure you're not going for anything that's gonna take longer than like a second to recover off of and i went for one challenge that was bad and it leads to what just happened expectations exactly what i was talking about just defend well i get a free goal he's a good player spiders are very good player he's still around like the semi-pro pro level for sure so this is someone that knows how to do stuff with the ball you know how to be mechanical and it applies plays a lot of ones as well so tough matchup i messed up i didn't think i didn't think you had boost to get a good enough flick on that but it was hard honestly kickoff is still the biggest thing in once if you can get control out of the kickoff you already have a massive advantage his last two kickoffs have been really good for him trying to stay on it to be annoying it's fine if he killed honestly good patience on that i know i had the advantage pretty hard there still got to bump him back well pick the mid boost from him and that'd be pretty huge let's stay on this now he doesn't know i have boost i think so i turn on this take another shot another shot there we go i didn't know i had boost to make a play off of it so figured i should surprise him go for a quick turn on the shot it's going to make him have to panic i know he's a little boost so his save is going to be bad every single time there i think for the boost instead of the instant goal maybe get some pressure off the bat here i'm gonna fake so let's control this i don't think he got that back but you say he didn't so he's still a boost so we're trying to make him flick here should be able to get the corners you get mid but i have control the ball which is more important i think whoa what a challenge it's gonna be a goal really good bounce for him too that was a very very like a risky challenge for him i'm not gonna lie i like to stop focusing for a half second so i didn't see him go up the wall i honestly didn't think he would a very risky challenge could have very well got him scored on but it worked out in his favor gotta save my flip the whole time i started my flip i just didn't want to use it i feel like anything i flipped into there would have gotten me scored on so choosing my battles in the area it's more about threatening that you have a play than actually making the play every time i think at once even in threes it's kind of the same idea i'm gonna try to fake this probably gonna read it but so i just gotta defend this well look for the boost go for the mid i'll go for a ceiling shot maybe like here we have control in this whole situation so i don't have to shoot right away i can fake a lot of different options not like going for silly shots and ones i think it's really valuable that reason oh we just gave up all right played really well though it's good stuff your games today hope you guys enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or night whatever time to do is watch this like comment
