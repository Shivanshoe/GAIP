yo what's up guys so i promise you guys i'd do a wall dash tutorial and i'm not sure if i'm going to do the best job of explaining this because it is kind of a difficult thing to explain and it's something you definitely have to um just get a feel for but pretty much the whole idea this video will just be trying to explain the wall dash and the things i've learned about it and the best ways to do it and the ways that are probably most useful and competitive as well there's a lot you could do with wall dashes which we'll talk about later on um but it's something that you want to not overuse as well i'm not going to talk too long about it before we start but it's something that you don't want to overuse because you could definitely get carried away things to remember if you're going for a wall dash you're avoiding all the pads in the middle of the field you have all those pads in the middle and you have obviously the boost on the outside right here and if you're on the wall you're avoiding all of that so you're kind of going out of your way so this is something that you want to use if um say for example you went for a an aerial here try to hit it around an opponent and you land here this is not a bad idea to go for a wall dash here on the way back um because you're not like necessarily going out of your way to go to the wall so i would recommend if you're rotating back like this uh from this side for example if you're about to rotate back i would definitely recommend just taking these on the way back rather than you know if you're rotating back rather than going all the way wide around the boost and then doing this all right it's not really useful so so first thing i wanted to start off with uh talking about but it's something that i had um originally seen someone do quite a while back and i tried to work on it i originally saw this and i decided to add to it um but it's not like i don't know it both work and they're both for different situations in my opinion so the single ones are good because you can gain a little bit of speed without using any boost and get into a better position but the big ones are really good if you have no boost and you're trying to catch up to a play that's like super far forward so i'll go over both of those and how you do both right now so the first one you should learn and you need to learn the first one before you can learn the second one which is a lot faster um and this one's good too because you can use it as a fake you can even like so like if the ball is like right here for example just floating you like swing into it you're gonna jump and it makes a jump noise they might get panicked from that and they might actually make a mistake off of it and you're still on the ground well the wall which had kind of another form of the ground in this game but um there's a lot of good things to it a lot you can do with this first one so all it is is you want to pull down then pull up and as you pull up toward the wall that you're on you're going to double jump tap x really quick so point down and then i'm pointing up that's all i'm doing if you watch my stick on the left side of your screen bottom left all i'm doing is this little motion right here just practice this and then just practice putting your your jumps in between that so you have to be pretty fast at pressing x here that's like a pretty big uh deal when it comes to this so that's the first thing you should learn is this just try to mess with that and the slower you go guys if you're going super slow it's gonna be really hard to to get it going every time you see i'm falling off the wall that's just an example you want to have a little bit of speed um so that's the first thing i want to show you guys which is that that's like a really good baseline to know how to do that and uh you can do a lot of things with that obviously and if you have the ball near you on the wall it's like a really good thing to to do to catch up to it i'll show you an example really quick i'll try to if it was a little far away from you see i'm getting ahead of it off those and i have a shot out of it it's a good example but that's something that you should definitely practice at the start before you even try to do the fast one now the fast one is you start with one of these and then you're gonna be holding your drift button after so just practice doing that start with one and hold your drift button after and you also should know how to jitter click so if you watch how quick i'm having my ex here like even my voice is shaking that's how fast i press max when i'm doing this so you have to know how to do that and hold your drift button that's all you're doing on the wall and then hold toward the wall you're on so if i'm on the right wall i'd be holding right here with my stick if you look where my stick's at it's around top right ish i would say if you're on the left wall i'm on the right wall again i'm on the left wall it would be top left this should be the same thing but opposite just flipped so i'm that was me just flipping into the wall and doing it from there you can do a lot of things with this obviously uh you could drive up and just do it um you could flip onto the wall and do it there's a lot of things you could do with it but we're trying to learn how to start it from anywhere on the wall so i just started from the middle of the wall right so i start with doing one of the ones that you learned at the start and then i hold my drift button after as soon as i complete one of them i hold my drift button and i try to just carry on into multiple by holding the same direction that i did for one and just spamming my x such a hard thing to like wrap your head around doing because it just feels awkward at first but as soon as you land one you just keep spamming in the same direction i'm trying to do it slowly right now that's why i'm messing up sometimes but there's an example of it again um but you can start that at any part of the wall you can go super high up and start it the one thing that people do that makes like this really hard this is the most common mistake you'll see when someone's trying to wall dash spam or like do it like super fast is that right there so they don't click x quick enough or it'll look like something like this then my car is like twisting to the left the left side there this would also be a mistake so all that is the thing i'm doing wrong there's not holding my drift so that causes my car to just spin on its own pretty much so drift is what keeps your car forward doing this and then you can actually stay on the wall and be able to recover out of it so that's the biggest thing that you want to try not to do is when you start this don't just not hold drift your car's going to spin around you're going to lose speed you're actually going slower than if you had just flipped and let your car take yourself back so that's something that you have to like really think about when you're trying to do this mechanic i think it's something that is super like not talked about enough that this is useful but only in very specific situations and i i have scored some goals out of this by the way guys i might look at my replays after this try to show you but even in pro games i've scored some goals like because i've gotten speed off of like the sidewall for example let's get quicker on to the half because if i have no booster i'll try to do one with no boost you can see how much speed i gain hold on that's a bad one but no boost is like a lot harder because you have to latch into the wall really early it's a good example you can see how much speed i gained from it but i was gonna say you have to really see your options like is it really worth it for me to stay on the wall this long and not collect these uh big boost pads or these pads right here whatever mode you're playing it's gonna be way more valuable to have the boost control on the map than to get a little bit more speed to go for the ball and maybe get one hit like if you have a good amount of speed here and get one hit is that really as useful as if you rotate it in a more efficient way you have this boost and you're waiting here to get a much better hit or a much better like multiple touch play like in the scenario where you go faster you get one touch in the scenario where you have this boost you only can get one touch around keep control flick back ball maybe land back wall maybe hit one more for your teammate there's so many options right but if you just use all if you don't get any boost and you have zero boost going down the field like this and you get one touch on the ball that's it that's your play your play is done so it's a lot that you have to think about when you're trying to actually implement this mechanic and i think that the single one is really good because you gain enough speed to the point where it's useful and like now i'm already full speed on the wall right i don't need to do much else than that but if you are spam dashing on the wall it actually is a little bit faster than if you're just going normal speed on the ground i have tested that i have actually checked if that's true and it is so there's good and bad to both but i think you have to learn when to use it and want to implement it in your games and especially if you're a lower rank i wouldn't recommend trying to put this in your in your gameplay like super early i think you should try to master it first and go from there because it's something that has a lot of potential but you have to really really know when to implement it and that's just the best way to put it really i hope i somewhat explained this well to you guys i remember i did a tutorial on this way back and all i did was show you guys the the jump version of the spam like this i'm even better at it now but that was what i showed you guys when i first learned it but now learning how to do it anywhere on the wall is obviously much more useful something that i've really practiced over the last few months and i've learned my own way to do it and i think it's really good where i'm at now in it i think i could use it whenever i need if i needed to in a game which is what i always want with new mechanics as soon as i see a new mechanic that i think could be useful i try to practice it in a way that i can utilize it whenever i need in a pro game right so as soon as i know the best way to do it i try to make a tutorial for you guys try to be as useful as possible in that aspect but i think i'm gonna really quickly try to find a replay of when i use this against like a pro team i think i actually did this in a european scrim at lan so i'm gonna try to look for that real quick okay so this is an example of um this is atlan this was at uh sweden with uh scrim versus vitality as you can see kit of alpha ferry um and this is a good example of the slower version of the wave dash is the more controlled one this is the one that i'd recommend you do more often because you're less likely to mess it up and if you can master it it's very useful as you'll see right here i'll land on the wall here i see justin's about to get a good clear so i turned to the wall instantly and this wouldn't make sense for me to turn to the ground and take all these pads and like get out of position right so immediately i turn to the wall and i stay on it and you see me doing the individual dashes i drive into it i hit it one more time around the last opponent and i bump him as well that's a free goal for garrett you look at garrett's pov here what it looks like it's one two three four five six seven nice touches around the opponent there we go very nice good example of that and maybe you'll even see one of their perspectives here maybe fairy what i look like so i'm getting a lot of speed on that i'm actually not wasting any boost i got by both of them super easily because i had that extra little bit of speed try to find one more replay example all right so this is another example and this is actually again the the slower one but it's just fast enough to the point where it's useful this is a good example of uh why this first one that i taught you guys is like super super useful because if you do it fast enough you could you could still gain enough speed to the point where it's almost like you're spamming it but you're not and it's super consistent too so you look at um i think it's the ends pov here just watch me on the wall how fast it looks like i'm coming downfield [Music] and you can't even see me coming we won the game after that um so yeah that's just two really good examples of you know while dashes and pro games and how it can be useful that's not even me spam dashing i have some spam dash examples but i don't think i've scored many off of it this is actually one i was playing ranked and musty was like right behind me and i did this and he was like freaking out i'll find it it's right here he was literally sitting right behind me and he was like what the hell was that this is a flip into a uh a wall dash well that's just a good example of how i'd use it to get back and it looks pretty insane yeah and we get the save out of it but yeah that's all i want to show you guys for today hope you guys enjoyed the video hope you guys like those examples that i showed you i just literally looked really quickly on my replays i didn't have those pre-saved for this video it's just an idea i can go back and show you guys um but yeah i've actually scored a lot of goals off of wall dashing and stuff a lot of stuff i haven't even saved that was just stuff from pro screens those are the first times i actually use it to score in game that's why i saved it um yeah there's a lot of different ways you can utilize it there's a lot of good fakes you can do on the wall with it a lot of good stuff in general hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all you
