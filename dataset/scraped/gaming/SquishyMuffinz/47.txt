yo what's up guys so the brand new energy away decal just came into the shop so if you guys want to get your hands on this it's super clean it's honestly one of the best looking decals in the game i really like the the home one but just like the white being the primary color looks so much nicer on this in my opinion so i think i like that one more than the home one but both are super clean i love both decals this one though feels super nice what can you ask for working as for the super white nice primary and the black finish super clean but yeah if you guys want your hands on that's now in the

kiss off the bat but i'm gonna be testing out this decal hopefully it feels good i tried it earlier in free play and i felt saucy that's actually the first game i'm using it in the actual game oh johnny's hidden around me all good remember justin's touch 350. close i'll be back ball here anything you can hit here probably just go back well if you missed it that's fine too pass to me should be in there we go nice little counter attack unfilled is clean those are really the most like overpowered situations to be in when you're counter-attacking like that just have someone like lose the challenge someone behind it and the lost challenge actually works out as a win because it goes straight to your teammate and then you have a pass that comes out of it like that win-win situation normally leads to a goal as well even in pro play situation happens more than anything probably for goals nice good read just sit across there only place the ball can really go is just straight across so i know johnny's gonna be trying to force it that way yeah this preset's really nice i like the i was using pink tunica's with like the patchy preset that i used to use i just put this decal over it i think it looks clean right behind you nice challenge should i play this middle maybe i can just go for a shot or double off of that let's try to read it it's a good idea i should have passed honestly but i know what i had the goal isn't a bad play either wait for a shot here nice pass back maybe it's fine i'm just gonna wait middle just wants to use me i want to go for like a controlled touch there like and try to land back wall but two of them were there then i kind of panicked a bit i'm not gonna lie thought to be closer for it also i didn't mention it i didn't realize they're keying on ranked so they're playing casual but justin is like i think he's the highest casual mmr in the world or second highest or something but his games are still really solid they're all like ssl players you can see they're all sells so it's still not easy games by any means but they're trying to do like there's like this new grimes event or something and johnny and justin are trying to do the challenges for it and they have to be done in casual i think either way it's fun though chilling with the boys right middle here should have one more touch nice [Music] try to take their back we just chill here for a pass maybe for johnny he beats him to justin [Music] nice good play great ball movement it's really a touch from justin it makes really hard on the defender i know i'm going to have the advantage there the ball's going to be above that guy's head very hard for him to know where it's going or to see what's coming here that's another big thing he doesn't know how close i am there's a lot of advantages i have in the situation good shot nicely done a little flick there oh yeah we got the rlcs titles as well just using right now one of our titles we got wait i touched it i didn't save it somehow ended up being orange trail what very interesting it could be a goal plus put out the wall for johnny i said save probably had it honestly i'm not a booster i look like what i had it most likely by the end of that yeah this game's been um quite the blowout so far how do you get that pink ssl title that's cool [Music] i don't think i'd ever use that over like anything else i have but it's definitely cool looking one should be a goal first i keep on saving it every time i say that getting a touch on it just waiting for a chance to go for the ball everyone's hitting it for like no reason at the time done she go middle maybe off the wall for justin you doubling that oh my god i actually read it good read should we end this brazilian should we go for one more i don't know i think we should take the brazil yeah he's faking it he wants to brazil oh no no we've lost to brazil last second all right good first game let's get the next one stephen keep it up get back to back excuse this decal is so sick i actually love it all right let's get to the next one all right we don't have a third player as of right now but hopefully one will join oh one has already joined it's good he joined in the left again very confusing start to the game yeah we got something special beast kickoff is crazy though you should clean up for the potential option it's almost crazy johnny beat him maybe nice nicely done i bought my teammates like stuck in net so i didn't want to just bang it but they do still have a bot oh as soon as i say that they no longer do right left wants to pass potentially if not that is also fine i will simply watch the ball and go into the net i think getting in the habit of like just spacing wall and positioning like in spots where you're giving your teammate an option is also a very good skill to just learn and practice although i didn't do anything in that play had he missed or had he actually decided to pass that i'd have been there for it that's not would have been a goal either way so it's good to get yourself in a good position like that early let me go up the wall play one more mid interesting it goes for the pass again i guess didn't tell if it was a mistake or not but wait for the 50. fun good read just fighting back well essentially we have a 2v3 until we get it past them we'll see probably get a good enough one that's easy to score we gotta get around all these guys first which is uh easier said than done close best i could have done with the whole team coming at me but it was not a bad idea not a bad try [Music] nice way for you to sit to the right here the only place you can hit is right so i'm trying to pre-position that spot nice good job [Music] very clean all johnny has to do again is just like position there be on the right spot for it and it's just gonna be a free goal that was almost crazy if that was more mid and not so much back it would have been insane my boost levels have dwindled but is it okay i'll wait on mid boost now i actually can't because we got killed but maybe we can get back so one more across to johnny should beat them all doesn't touch maybe close oh that's a good bump unfortunate it was a good fake though on the first guy that's smart only way we could have actually got past them is that bump on the third man maybe clean absolutely perfect gameplay my nicely done we didn't get the brazil again but still good work might be a goal maybe it's close one more movie coast to coast on porch nicely tried good game though it was fun this decal is really fun to play with actually like it a lot i'm gonna use it super often as well as the the other energy one i like that one too but this one definitely takes the cake from android a lot yeah hope you guys enjoyed to have yourself one of the day or night whatever time it is watching this like comment subscribe and see it on the next [Music] you
