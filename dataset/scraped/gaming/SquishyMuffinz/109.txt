yo what's up you guys going to be playing some 2v2 games for today with one of my chips let's get straight into it see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right first game we got ourselves havoc and college i think he's how you say that yeah probably i actually don't recognize these guys but they're probably good because they found this game pretty much instantly i would say from him i should take it maybe one touch before committing to the shot there would have made it a little bit more threatening i think but like right here like this one touch and i'm taking a shot see how it makes it a lot more difficult they have to wait last second to make that save right that's what i should have done another time but it's good that he made that adjustment early on and we actually did it the next the next play we did what we talked about so that's all you got to do like when you're playing games try to look for the little things that you think you could be doing better and try to make those adjustments right away as soon as you can right to get a pass across there to find one to mic obviously want to use your teammate when you can in this game mode it's a good thing to you know look for the right times to pass you don't want to overpass obviously in two's a lot more risk the passing than in like threes for example but it's definitely something that you should look to do every now and then because it can create some really good opportunities sit back here in full blue stay in a spot where i can react with this guest over his head right this somehow gets like really bad for us in terms of like the challenge that comes through like i still react to it so that's the position you want to keep yourself in if you're second man or you would be technically last man and twos in that situation so like right here i want to stay like far back so if he passes back i have a lot of options oh because i think i would have got it over the last guy but one didn't expect me to go there i'm gonna float here fine pop it to the left for wonder try pop again for him good little pass play nicely done nice to be able to use your teammate like that again because they're always going to be expecting to touch toward their net right but if you hit that backward they're never going to expect the extra pass back like that it's nice to use your teammate in those situations i'm gonna fake jump here that plays down left i went for the the snipe couldn't quite but i created another decent touch for one of their fallout it's fine play this right side now look at this double tap opportunity now because of all this space to be able to finish it off there you go that's the beauty again of using those touches toward your team like you're creating so many more opportunities than if you just play that forward or try to play solo play there those are the things that it's really hard to practice that stuff and twos and that's why i think three is just a better game mode because it's a team game you have to learn how to use your team that's something that a lot of people even really really good players don't know how to do perfectly yet one knows how to do it perfectly obviously but no one even attempts to use your team in 2v2 and that's a big mistake that i think people make and in general should try to cut out you don't have to be selfish all the time it's okay to be selfish sometimes but you could use your teammates when you can it's a very important skill to practice and understand put us to the side here i have no play on goals so there's no point i'm just playing into him letting him win that 50 right one that should be back for this i'll just drive into that much pressure i'm pretty i'm not even going to flip here i had a lot of pressure there you're just driving into the box i make them have to hit that ball back to my team and simply just driving it to the ball look how simple you can play even the highest level and it still creates a lot of pressure i'm not even gonna do anything here i'm just gonna flip i'll show you guys what i mean because in theory if i just sit here look how much they have to do i just got two of them out of the play i think nothing again i'm just gonna stay in one spot stay on the ground not do anything same thing drive challenge bumped into him team's still gonna win the ball here he has no choice but to throw this away and we end up getting the ball back so you don't really have to do anything half the time i'm not gonna lie i think people kind of overestimate how much you really need to do to be to be useful when it comes to offense a lot of times you're just trying to get them to debate their utility in terms of like their boost the resources you know i mean you're just baiting out what they have what they can do and if you just drive with the ball sometimes you're forcing two of them to challenge the first guy gets a bad challenge on you goes off the wall you still have control of that ball they have to get the ball off here i'm gonna be wasting two people just to get the ball away from you yeah really clean game so far you really don't have to over analyze that aspect of it like how much you need to do with the box a lot of the time simpler is better even on defense i'm pretty much afk there i'm still that entire time up until when he finally shoots the ball right there yeah really good air dribble there there we go good first game all right clean stuff against the next one let's even keep it up get back to bag dubs but you guys can see just how important using your team is and also looking for times to use solo plays because at the end there i used the solo play and got by the whole the whole field and the whole team right just by using a solo play so you got to be able to pick and choose which times to use both and obviously being mechanically skilled and practicing mechanics is important so you can do bolts whenever you like but i think even at lower ranks simplify it by trying to make sure your touches go to your your teammates trying to put your challenges and good positions for your team even don't be afraid to lose challenges if your teammates behind you because that's technically winning the challenge because if if you get the ball next you get possession next you're technically winning that challenge it's okay to quote unquote lose the challenge behind you because it goes to your team anyway and that's something that a lot of high level pro teams do as well but before we get into the next game i'm going to show you guys two insane clips that i hit back to back and i won't go into another day i'll show you guys that real quick insane triple flip you're setting here and a really good musty as well awful resets i'll show you guys these clips real quick before we get into the next game all right for last game we got ourselves knight and matt so two very very good players from south america recognize both these guys both insane players for sure wait for the touch here it's gonna be awkward he has to bang this back you guys hit it across can't really be there on the wall it's gonna play it himself fight to myself to the corner here and his forcing touches to the side is really good as well in a situation it's killed one so it creates a 1v1 now place off to myself played around one hopefully really good block one that has to play shot here well done took that quarter boost just in case he wanted to steal it right because i don't know if the opponent wants that one that's one that's going to take just to keep that that boost control of the map take this myself pick the the high touch yes sir we joined the last second so i like doing that a lot pop it up pick the high touch get the reset instead creates a lot of opportunities again make them both jump into both panic right whereas if i play that double tap they probably just hit ground it's quite easy for them to stop and there's gonna be one going back wall there probably as well on the double tap so i like to play that a lot safer i take this myself here save my boost now so i've used quite a bit to go for this and i'll let one to take it away i'm not gonna go for this actually now i have a chance to and there we go so it was actually dangerous to go for the first one so i backed out and that made him panic because he thought i would go but he would have beat me by a mile so if he had jumped for an eye jump for it he would beat me there so i took the safe approach waited for it actually waited for when it's actually going to be a goal for sure take advantage of it really it's safe for one though get my timer i'm gonna create some angles look at the angle i've created here now i can actually pass off this create even better replay so bringing that to the side swinging wide look how much i've opened up right i can take a shot i can pass i can do whatever i want so i just played at middle gave one to even more options on that and they're both flat-footed because of it really good way to do that fake this one here make them back off give me some respect me some space pass over to wonder now should be a shot post's gonna fake here again try to make a panic so you see how they turn away when i go like that a little bit of respect that they show something that uh definitely really important to to get a grasp of those fake challenges when when to commit when not to commit very very uh hard skill to learn to be honest but a very important one to learn as well we'll play one more game because that was a really quick four figures it's really good players and really quick forfeit so i'll play one more let's get into it let's even keep it up finish off with the bang let's see how it goes all right for the actual last game we got peak and wavy it's on the left side here normally most pros do left side goes i'll try to get this right side for one though if you get it right side like that i'll kick off pretty much the aim opposite side of the ball bump the last guy back give me empty net there we go so i'm trying to get that back right all i'm gonna do is go to the left side of the ball and kick off so i'm going to get this to the left side oh he wants to fake actually okay so i'm going to fake play this back middle instead of going for the shot maybe he's done that because it's twos quite unlucky to be honest very unlucky i'd say because he went for the shot it was a really good shot to be honest it was in but he got the slightest touch skin perfectly off back wall obviously there's a lot of ways that i can go much better for us so a little bit unfortunate but not a bad idea in general take the mid boost the kill on both of them should be open there we go we got to get that steel you got to get the steel on there nice little double demo there all right so i'm gonna try to get his right side i'll show you guys what i mean i'm gonna go more on the left side of the ball here that's what i do in my pro play quite a bit on my actual team i try to play for justin for example and you can get a solo play off of it something that might get you know overlooked by most viewers you don't see the little things like that on kickoff trying to control which way it goes is a very big part of the kickoff in general a little bit too hard good pass a little bit too hard shot there i had the option of won the mic on the right and i think that's why i wanted to go for the shot even more because i know that he knows i like passing most people know i like passing so sometimes it's good to switch it up instead of going for the obvious pass take a shot those are the moments when it's really good too actually really close fake this one stay on the floor make a pain look how much resources are using here i'm not doing anything really i'm just staying grounded and we still win this ball we still have control here i want i can make a play out of this i'm gonna play patient try to play patient and you actually got like a really good flick there you got the best flick possible actually it's really good to do those 45 degree flicks where you tilt like that play right side for one day again like it's mid boost yeah really good flick from him back there played a well to be patient as last man there you don't want to dive on that it's very risky to do so um but he just did a really good like to be honest one touch try to flick around one maybe pop the other guy it's fine if he gets it over me as long as he doesn't get a perfect double which is pretty rare dealing for rwanda gonna be almost impossible for the defender to get that by using your team again these situations so important not going for the selfish shot you don't want to do that try to get us to the left side more i like getting that back left like that because you always secure the back boost once i got you missed the boost that's very unfortunate so that's actually a really good thing to do though but one that missed the boost right there and then you backed up for it and then gets demo so unfortunate but if you got the boost normally you'd have the ball full control and you can get the other boost as well and then they're forced to chase us and we normally have a really big advantage in that play really good read there all right challenge both of them start the ball one day as a free ball now i'm just going to float force him over me should be fine bring him back that's how rotation should work first guy challenging day should have that uh that guy forced the ball over nice well done should i get his right side for one die again so again just aiming more left side of the ball you can always go toward the right side if i do that control where it ends up going give someone again with very good mechanics that free solo play that's what you want to do try to give your team as many opportunities as possible by doing that right don't have to even flip on that just play patient it's fine take my time here again all you could do is play that across right then play it into us panic a little bit it's fine if he hits this again it's not going to create any opportunity take my time let her roll down all i could do is drive into that one that will be back forces him out which is really good it's fine again we're forcing their challenges to be bad here so we should win this engagement for the most part because all their challenges haven't really been anything of use like this touch to the wall isn't doing anything for them the fact that he bumps me there doesn't really do much for him again if i can get him to command this without having to do anything so i could just drive into this and he commits it's actually really good for us see that right there making him flip i would say that's a win in the situation because now look where he is right pulls himself so far to defense he's not even back here one of those no boost i'm gonna fake this one i could panic fake it again make him panic don't even have to go for these balls no reason to like back ball here nice and patience play it right maybe i'm going to pick this one better watch his flicks guys get fixed but i see one that coming to help me out so that's why playing a patient like that's really good as well that playing that patient is really good though because he came to help me out he did really get to recovery on the wall there but the way that one that went for the demo to help me out there is a smart and that's why it's going to play patients last man especially in twos just take a shot catch him off guard well done get touched from one today again try to get this right side anymore left on the wall doesn't matter how far back it goes really as long as one that can get that back boost there's nothing that you can't actually scoop up i think it might flip unfortunately one that was a little bit he was a little bit aggressively pushed up there but he probably thought i got my flip and if i got my flip it would have been a goal most likely or at least a much more um follow-up situation but he should not be that pushed up obviously you want to play to be able to cover both options and i don't want to overcommit for this play here i'ma pass to wanda i like that he doesn't go for a shot even though he probably could have scored i like that he's trying to play for the dove there play off of our our lead obviously so many boosts here and one seems to be wanting to go first okay now he's behind me so i just bait out the flick for him to be easy save let's go for one more goal off the back wall one more one more keep it up i wasn't sure if one that had one more touch or not we can get one more i believe i don't want to give up a goal as well though no i hit it over him bad pass not bad one more for the boys yes sir really good pass from one that's actually perfect really well done all right good game today guys hope you enjoyed three back to back to back dubs one
