making this dream a possibility I appreciate you you know if you guys enjoy it today's video viewing some 1v1 games for today we're at 14:40 MMR right now we are gonna be using fennec I think I want to main Finnick I'm very in between a better and I'm not sure yet but I think I what I mean I feel really good on and like how the car feels in general so yeah let's entry games today hopefully you get some dubs and here's a look at the potential fennec main gameplay and we got a game instantly so it's gonna be someone good against AJ so he's a all assist player for pk there's a lot of 1v1 so gonna definitely be interesting game say the least we'll see nice to challenge pretty much everything over and over again be super aggressive and bump a lot so we know what to look out for we played them quite a bit in the past night and ones but in threes is the same kind of play style on ones should be bump just start played off his uh his touches pretty well on his aggression he likes to stay super close even with no boost so you gotta look out for that try to fake this kind of mess up the fake but it's fine oh good shot see if you can do off this there we go you got a good one back he's very good in this aerial game so gotta watch out on the walls the variables so preset stuff like that sounds very usable in once they have no one else there to challenge and help you out good demo should be free there we go so yeah you don't wanna give him too much space on the walls same thing with all one's players though you don't want to give them a lot of space because obviously very very good very well-rounded in their game they will score off a lot of the space you do you give them anything you do give them really try to turn leave the boost what city does of that it's fine I start my position everybody cinnamon a boost and a good spot stuff keep on and keep fresh a very good to keep rush here and messes them a little bit yes [Music] that's fun we're shuttering pretty well there's only have many options kind of force to go back you I missed a boost what are we good to get it I could have shot a little lot closer that's fun the demo just walk it in you probably caught him off-guard Emily good idea to go for it though let me go for your back beach gotta wash the area play loves going for them yeah I thought our challenge early it's gonna be a go gonna have an irritable bump or something so kind of have to kind of force to stay on the ground I hope it messes up or go for a challenge and hope it goes my way kind of annoying part about one than that that regard [Music] yeah yeah to gold out of the one go my kickoff was bad you got full possession off of it it's not with you what you want out of a one kickoff possessions everything now that I have it I should be able to make something happen you another bump there we go possession is everything off kickoff and once you're a good player you know scarf it most of the time I want to say about 80 to 90 percent of the time year's possession here so I could see him scoring off of this just really tough position if for me to be in he's a lot of options even if he doesn't scored you can kind of stay on the ball and you know be a nuisance but a fake um good demo you stay with this here Bruce will come back in a sec so I get his wait it's fun so gonna have possession off that which is good lesyk kills me only way we don't nice might be able to score there we go it's not a vader Damon to be over aggressive please playing Waldo is playing fast forcing me at the bad spots you could definitely still win this game comes down to kickoffs I think you're gonna get these possessions off you go I hate because he's ten million options really something he's just really good at this slippery says it's not as effective in threes because it's like they look a challenge super early in threes I make it so that's not even an option but ones yet that possession I'll kick off and get a goal if you're good enough at it job done this game as well I'm gonna challenge it really I want to give him that space but you didn't have a space again so put it all my CD does I'll improve it if I got the kill they kind of forced it back off that's fine I like Eva on the ground on the Seekers way is it to defend them when he's hitting he ate the stuff he does in the airs like possible to defend honestly in once so I don't mind him on the ground definitely much more dangerous with these air dribbles and flipy sets and such this is really good shy and China getting away because much time as possible off the clock there we go I'm did you save it yeah should be the game unless I choke super hard to be the RIT for yeah DG is a really really concert once player he puts a lot of 1b1 so that's a tough matchup to win for sure but yeah we caught the dog when i cue it up again CB running to him again should be another really good game as president run to AJ again we got whizzed the sky boys a lot of 1c I played him recently like she already saw it I think the game I won against some last time he played was by one goal and you got a lot of kick off goals from what I remember so I definitely got a fix my kick off this game to make sure it's not the super sweaty mr. worth giving up key off goals honestly or just possession aki offers look how much boost and space he has to do whatever he wants to hit the ball you all because they kick off that entire 30 seconds is because he won't kick off that's just how huge big off is it won't be one so if you have a to go you already have an advantage as is it's not everything still got to know how to you know play with the ball outside of that but definitely a huge thing I won't kick off and because of that I was able to get a kill pretty cool all goes together so again one kickoff one the boost battle probably won a goal as well see he's nuts for saving that didn't think it was even possible my stuff so I've obviously my better playing along but you know what I mean honestly so surprised that he saved it obviously partially lucky he's able to get back to that save oh yeah I'm gonna get around this one I like doing that if if I fake that there and he hits it where he did how does pretend like me to head to the corner let him bait himself into the base and he gives up a goal it's been all kicked off this game actually every single goal is making ethical or some form of it pretty exciting pretty exciting gameplay is no booze I'm obviously privy stays in this ball if you touch trying to smell some pressure brush eating quick there we go make I'm worried about the shot how to sit aside that's for you goal what is this game and this is how the game that we played last time when it's just so back and forth but it's all really kickoff related man it really is I don't really have a kickoff tutorial my kickoffs honestly not that great I don't know if I should even bother making one but if you guys do you want me to make one let me know down below and I'll try to make one the best I can but then again I don't have like a crazy kick off myself I just know someone how not to lose it terribly so if I lose it looks like that most of the time there are times where I do lose it badly decent clear all rights going for the back piece I have time to be admitted probably an interval or something here you think about this in once if he does mess this up normally it's a free counter maybe a goal but that one's wide you didn't get that boost I don't know why I was actually good for me good touch room I don't know you got back oh I thought my flip still Abed don't fry heard we try to flip or even saw on the controller we camp but I definitely still had it bumped me wait I said absolutely nothing he was just going crazy on the wall I was just staring at my I just stopped anything shot above me that's funny I'd have to do anything just don't panic in a situation like that and get her free goal run for the shots I to say that they're still 40 boost I'll try to challenge instant shoot cut did he was such an awkward spot there to shoot quick so I went quick to it like a dummy I didn't need to kind of just panicking I did what he did in the law school I gave him a free one I could have recovered better and probably saved it but it's fine I'll leave you let him go for the boost trying to fake the flick but you didn't get baited at all clothes almost got back how's it going baby - off the bump try to get back yeah he's playing super aggressive now going for a lot of bumps as well but we're making mistakes or making it possible to get scored on could be definitely playing better here got away from make a lot of interesting plays when you have time on the ball on offense you got the wall I could try to follow this take the first ad affinity right away so it's good gonna stay on this it's fine I still have possession in the situation has to kind of push me plate to open space city does fine we still have decent amount of boost in situation it's just a little bit awkward because he has advantage here I'd say playoff my miss touch there we go I was so focused on the wall alright one minute left to go lead just need some good kickoff it's pretty good kickoff but he's gonna have possession this is a little bit scary I'm gonna fake shots Trish or just started bump them I guess that works I miss the night gotta be a goal I'm gonna go [Music] try to keep the ball with me this is good all right guy for sin to back off took my timing I have to do anything really kind of keep making him come to me I messed up touch I dribble at the wall backward bad messing with a little too much let's go slow far I shouldn't come back city was shooting off him every time I'm throwing try to get his head but he just doesn't care she really did something care I'm gonna lose off this now he's gonna play the safe route I'm gonna definitely lose this game I could tell wait we're losing this guys I made too many stupid mistake I know how I'm surviving five boost five boosting a dream you take it to this corner probably all right this is good we could win right here we've done this before dad yay all right we made that a million times harder than it to be to be honest I was kind of messing around way too much and I gave it to any opportunity to score stuff I'm making just stupid mistakes here and there but he played well don't get me wrong I played super aggressive and he really found ways to get goals I did give him opportunities but he found the ways to make them goal so well done from him two good games I'll rally one both and I know I definitely will be better in the second for sure first one I think I play pretty well around I just made a couple mistakes here and there but ya got two dubs two very good opponents as well so can't complain hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful date or neighborhood of timers you know watching this like comment subscribe to see you guys all in the
