hundred thousand subscribers now which is just nuts to think about thank you for making that a possibility and hope you guys enjoy today's video love y'all yo guys could be playing to three games today with Garrett and gimmick should be some good my let's get into it see how it goes alright we got a pretty sweaty game here we got Tanner and drops who were two of the best South American players I believe in them gyros and our LCS player so full all just Lobby definitely gonna be a sweaty one but not unwinnable that's for sure let's see see what can be done here probably should have been their job didn't take his time and Garrett's going back so I was challenged would've been perfect dog day gosh I have back like Derek at the 50s which I could show this let's get that just from GERD holy wood a shot yes if you play from gimmick to be there I was always good if you have no beer just take it slow up the corner take your time and get a good flick out worst-case scenario they're like running to your challenge and that's easy 50/50 is there really much of a downside to it I was gonna kill they're from Jarrah John's I was looking for the demo it's very useful useful thing for a team that someone who's very like actively looking for demos I set it round nice it's the left side here and then the wall I'll just play back board now anything I goes hi I should have anyone who's in Gold's gonna know that most of the time because they'll see me coming back to net nice from Garrett dunks should I wait right side here if you could somehow get something gonna have but again that's fine I don't need to push for that leave myself as an option middle but as soon as there's no option I could just leave decent 50 good try to keep it in there from Garrett so we gonna block that way they can't get any kind of shot under that press out the pass completely gimmick even pass to me now to get it oh my god what the heck that was so stupid I almost got the skimmer all right here they control that it's around two shudders go for that party I need to rush as much as I did that's fine I'm just gonna force him to make it touch again and go back now almost over to save my job there pretty well cuz I'll talk to my team to get back and I did get over one so if I can get over to there that's even better but even then my whole point there is to kill time and just not get scored on so long as to do that that's a that's a win there I'd say I play this on my bed bug ear was gonna be there in time I shouldn't know when again probably but it was hard to tell gotta watch the backboard touchy I had everything blocked again have the initial shot and then a summer wedding angle for the follow-up touch which is a perfect setup on defense I'd say it helped each other out nice same situation and one blocking one angle that's a pros are very good as just having that setup kind of down packing their head but somebody that's not that hard to get ahold of it just takes time it's a lot of like it's not even muscle memory because it's like traditional but what time you'll kind of have an idea that's all good I'll tell you the only thing different there ever was back could have tried to kill more time instead of going for the challenge immediately because no one's behind yet it's hard to know and so like when we're not palming I wouldn't say so low-key but we're not calming it's hard to know cuz when your calms you can tell when you're behind you know there's never that you're guessing factor of it but like this you kind of have to guess a little bit nice yeah good block gonna be there for that I like give me good is behind me better hang on the ball [Music] sit behind you give me first challenge there we go we go all the way back good luck to my teammates oh dude am I gonna get some weird skimmer on that price you want for the Kilda even better that's game anyway they can't win GG's all around probably run to them again because of the highest-ranked people on for sure right now yeah not a bad game at all a super super sweaty is a really good opponent really good matchup Skinner next one see we keep it up and get to back-to-back wins but I gotta get alright for last game plenty it's the same two dudes drops in tanda who like I said to very solid South America players and then we wonder Mike who is a RL RS player actually getting a tryout in my spot my old spot on gaming Couture monstrosity they're gonna try him out at least not necessarily pick them up but they're definitely gonna try them out good touch the control good 50 to finish it off well then let's gonna block there as well to create the chance but good control from gimmick not to just banging it away always gonna get at that thinking this time getting a good dribble and then a he's probably one of the the best I like slowing it down and getting a dribble put like that going forward it's funny because he's like not a ones player at all he doesn't play any ones but he's so good at just dribbling the ball and being smart on dribbles like that hit it around him good give me some sake prize I guess gonna leave there we go how's he a play shun a block if anything let me be too worried about the direct shot as long as we can block the hit going over that's gonna be what's more dangerous for my team oh hi I killed it's a good attempt that I faked the first aerial and they gotta get past the gimmick and you make almost got the shot he was looking for the old left eye boosting it's so surprising Oh could've actually been their goal it wasn't a bad idea nice get pinched as well or get a tenth I should say that was gonna go flying oh the pass is actually ready have been nuts [Music] little way for a gimmick nice touch maybe a pinch oh you're back it's gonna have a hit around me but it's fun I could try to kill one maybe if not take goose it's good as well I think you me should have this I'll try to help him there just in case I want to be there to block that shot worst-case scenario I didn't see him underneath it's fine they're kind of rush to hit you didn't need to get bumped from there but no one to follow that's the problem with those plays they're really good cuz you can create a empty head obviously but no one's there to follow immediately they're kind of a waste in a way it's fine headed around one gonna be a floaty ball as well so kill time for me to spawn and get back give me seen a dribble like I said very good at the second time when you had it oh they're giving so much space in that that middling there like so much passing space surprising boy forgets boomer here cross it's fine so to block it we're left side here he wants to use me let me keep it in fun get a Garrett to back off honestly I don't think that was an accidental backfield I think he was honestly realizing that he would have been beat I just went back to the smarter play I went too quick to that so fake I like he really did shoot straight i Garrett just not bad good try gonna go all the way back here give me chef block yeah I can go for this I would be behind him I won the pinch it with gimmick go for the team pinch me behind Garrett here we don't need a goal here I'll be six rep three so oh yeah I do is kind of just chill on my pre jump yeah click him to end it off on got another Doug two very tough games two very sweaty games pretty much all our LCS lobbies oh yeah good two games uh we guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful date or night with over ten minutes when you're watching this like come subscribe and I see you guys on the next one I love you
