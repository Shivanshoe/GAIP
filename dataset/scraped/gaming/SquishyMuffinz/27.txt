yo what's up guys gonna be playing twos with the actual goat himself ryze from team queso should be some good game let's get it to us even get some doves see how it goes all right we got aegis and fly cool first match here rice was kind enough to play on n a surveys for this uh should be fun good pass start it off played over one over two it's not gonna be close enough for the shot yet but he could probably hit it off back ball here put it around him again play middle if he wants to pass nice good pressure really flows like super easy i was playing solo queue you go from solo queue to playing with someone like ryze who understands that hit the ball run the opponent understands how to pass stuff like that the different world the way the game feels actually becomes enjoyable i play ranked i slip reset i'm not gonna go for this yeah because he's waiting under it better to play patiently there let's play it off the wall and i can leave nice challenge oh it's not actually bad messed up a little bit i was able to recover we're both in the same spot honestly like one of those awkward situations on defense but we got a vista nice turn on the wall by playing back should be fine i get the boost as well if he hits the right wall plays this soft to himself just smart plays it around one might even be emptying that as well it's gonna wait here he's backwards he has a lot of advantage just gonna pop it over him that ryze get a free double now nice really well done super super clean plays there good job of him to wait where he did very good off the back wall it's the smartest spot to put the ball there any like anywhere else there isn't going to be as valuable i think the back wall touches in this situation is really smart almost always turns out to be something good giving it close good play there no challenge quick here another challenge should be good click the mid boost wait right if he wants to use me let him hit this i'm gonna pop that there huge wind there i don't think i have the boost to score this i'll try still try to be annoying he buffs good job from riser being a menace hits it mid goes for a bump right away kills the first bumps a second makes it super easy for me if i pass this left off this it'll be fine i shouldn't back right away it might actually be bad for us now but i can try to pressure this at least in the corner i think i'm hitting it away perfect the left here if he wants to use me nice good pass good usage of our space there that's well done you got to hit it over him as well instead of just going straight for a neck because he would have had the shot block good uh presence of mind there to do that four goes up half the game left looks like one of them is already a little bit upset i would be too i mean not much you can do honestly really tough set of opponents obviously in twos and it's a very um tilting game mode when things aren't you know necessarily going your way so i don't really blame him hopefully he comes back though i think he's just trying to get together gotta forfeit it's really fun though playing with rice very good very good tried something crazy a little pancake not sure what's going on with their team there might just skip to the end of whenever this is that way you guys don't have to watch this so i'll see you guys at oh never mind it's over all right let's get into the next game steven keep it up get back to back that's good good first match though let's see if we can uh keep going into the next all right we've got chronic and evan here buddy game promise good player not sure who evan is someone with their name changed but can be far from an easy match i want to turn on this but it's mainly just to show presents and not actually to commit just gonna challenge this my teammate at least force him to the wall and it makes his life a little bit easier let's it done smart pass back keep control it's a good idea i don't actually go for this it's gonna waste a lot of boost probably not gonna even make it closer aside here unless he dribbles this which will force him wide anyway same thing ryze is doing the exact same thing there now we have an empty net if you can convert that off the wall should be a goal nice really good play good fake as well the reason why i figured there is because i know if i go quick through this rise is still recovering so i faked this keep the ball close to me that would give him time to rotate back around and actually get back into play if i go too quick they're just gonna be hit off the wall they get a free dribble off of not actually gonna be anything too useful for us i say done i'm gonna leave the corner be swarm should have got it i think he did do it away try to bump the other guy pop it back just to keep it in the corner keep it into a spot that's really awkward for them oh it's unfortunate no no that's not bad i tried to get a quick challenge i wouldn't expect and rise as we're sitting back same side i should have seen him there i did see him i should know him for it i don't see this unlucky there around them we didn't bump into each other but i could have definitely played it safer i'd say it's mostly on me there the only thing i was doing wrong in that situation was like rotating same side but it's not even a bad thing you can't be like too picky about that i feel like the battery but wasn't a good pop that i wanted there should be fast enough maybe let's save one off the ceiling here he loves to just hit off the back wall i noticed you in general loves doing that it seems like a little back wall and put you touches the wall prefer a bumpy the patience from rise to smart play let him hit this not gonna do anything with this really even if you get it over him it's a free touch for me i was not going to be in right away but really hard for me because my amount of boost took my time on that wait back while still you know ground now that i know he's controlling you can actually help though that's a really good really good save gotta pass down the line nice you play to control that first touch is everything there i know i have time i know that ryan's going for the bump on the other guy there so it's all really about taking my time on that getting a good control touch that i can get a threading shot out of let him hit this here put a pass back middle and i can bump this guy as well it's a 1v1 for a while i'm gonna wait on the left if he wants to use me it doesn't have to but i don't know just to give him an option i know it looks so funny playing patient here i know he's behind me now i can actually go for this it could be hard for for eyes to deal with patience knows there's really no threat there that's smart close couldn't quite reach it it was a good try though good patience there get around two let me get for a shot as well good job as well played it's really hard to get out of the situation like rocks are very good once players get a bumping there i know he's gonna go for a bump he's a lot of time and i have no help for a while because ryze was stuck up field really good play to get around that good demo i can bait this for your eyes here it doesn't matter if it gets over me it's more just making a pop it can't help him for the second one though unlucky look at the boost from him pretty massive i'll play it around both maybe go one more off the corner should be able to keep this in now i notice he loves to like hit the 52nd he loves to be second to the ball every time on the 50. just smart i didn't even hear anything at work job little fake just showing presents again it's so valuable in so many situations all right good second game against one works the first one was super early forfeit let's see if we can get three dubs in a row always fun games those riders a lot of fun for today's video hope you guys are enjoying let's get the next one i got seven and fly cool fight cool is i think the person in the first match that got a little bit upset stop playing so hopefully place through this one pass back there i'm gonna go first here but answer the challenge not gonna let him get too much face forward again i'll be first challenged rises behind me we're just about keeping the ball in like really awkward positions for them try not to give them space in those spots to get out take the pads on the way back here last second i like turned away from that to try to keep control i don't know how to score this there's a way trying to get like a flip out of it very difficult though nice well done also like the slow floaty lip resets and stuff all of team casa does that a lot it's very good very smart amount of time ends up killing is really good then hit off the wall right should be able to be fine here because they're both low boost this push isn't going to be too threatening i could be behind him if he gets beat by pass left here i think i saw him for a second then he left but it's smarter not to stay i feel too long in twos for those tried to pass back i should have wanted to swim for a shot i try to like roll it back to rise but isn't the best idea gonna block him again i keep looking for like a pass back but it's just like bad timing time is a little bit off killed the mid guy though so i don't really have any threat here oh i shot a backflip for your eyes but mess it up a little bit i'll try it left you if he wants to patch like some kind of like counter attack player to this not a trap on defense so one pass would be good here i play one touch toward net nice just gonna stall for me which is good let him hit that should be fun and there's no threat like in that situation i know there's nothing that that's gonna come of that touch from him that's bad for us i think it comes back to our team every single time there gets into a position that's like always gonna be valuable to us what just happened my i left the party and joined rejoined the party i rise them for their corner boost as well there better win both 50s on them if i did get it passed both of them as a goal for sure kind of wishful thinking in a way unfortunately i didn't think they could stay on it by the time you get the boost i play for him that's just an awkward uh situation lunch in general the ball goes behind you like that it's always tough the mistake was made even before leaving the ball because i turned too early far left here if you want to use me i get the opposite boost here might be a goal shut up they messed up yeah why i did there also i think it's a good way to make if you have no boost so you just drive into it most of the time that ball's gonna go neutral or back to your team i think anything that goes behind you like that is way more valuable than if it goes forward into the corner because um most of the time they'll be able to just control especially the high ranks it's a huge beat there i'm gonna go from the boost to side of the corner i think gonna have a clean beat over me if i pass on to rise let off back wall maybe shot again did the back wall sprout is op i feel like you just don't go for a shot if someone's back just go for it backwards every time so much better let him hit this one time i can't really help him out here you should be able to get it there wait for the bounce it's a good b it's gonna take the mid boost just smart i'm just gonna drive into us i think it's the best way to make in the situations because flipping just gets you stuck for too long at least i can recover pretty quickly get back i just hit it around in here again trying to keep it in anybody i can keep it in even if i'm low boost and it's not going to be the best 50 or just a matter of like keeping the pressure going i'm gonna pre-jump this forcing to hit it to rise if i can kill skyler back it's massive push that's all a lot of time there not like at least five seconds doing that bump the other guy should be at 1v1 now rides pretty good in these situations good cut off from fly 20 seconds now i just got a challenge for some left that's fine now it's ryze's job as soon as i force him away from that there i noticed not my play anymore to make on the ball i just saved my boost same thing here force him to pop it i think it's kind of awkward because he got demoed be fine though that's a good pop might actually be cool because i messed up literally pop though he kept it close it's really hard to do that's right how hard it is to do that a lot of fun i hope you guys enjoyed rising the same player i think one of the best players in the world right now especially the way they play at the major is super good unfortunately played in lower round one i think we're two of the best teams in attorney playing that early on a little bit unfortunate but it is what it is hopefully next major be better off and a lot of fun though in general if you guys enjoyed this video try to play some more with them maybe for future videos happy stuff wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys watch
