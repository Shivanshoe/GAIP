you happen to not be subscribed please do check underneath the video right now and press the sub button if you're not enjoy the video guys what's up guys today we're going to be playing some more 2v2 games i decided to add back the controller overlay on the bottom left a lot of you guys are asking me to add it back so i did i'm not sure when i took it out to be honest but it's back there now so hopefully you guys enjoyed that but let's get into the games for today hopefully we can get some dubs let's see if we can get some good goals as well let's see how it goes all right for the first game we got ourselves sharif against sm brooks and drew's clues let's see let's go it's gonna be sweaty that i found this game pretty much instantly so that means everyone in the lobby's super high mmr so we'll see see how it goes trying to confuse them a little bit the dribble go back and forth make sure he's not sure when i'm actually going to take my shot make it as weird as possible i could have flicked it better at the end but i saw the opening still i knew it was going to be a goal either way it was a good play though good usage over time that was mainly on the guy on blue team who went for that that ceiling shot and made his recovery time super long and it made it almost impossible for his teammate to save that 1v1 you don't want to leave your teammate back for that long in a 2v2 game alone right you want to be able to always help your teammate out like right here i'm trying to install time for my teammate even if it gets past me it's okay cause i know he's behind me i'll leave your teammate in a spot where he's 1v2 for a long time or won't be one for a long time right good play from him should try to take this boost should be a goal though for them good demo we missed what the heck they actually missed that shot should be sharifs gonna fake this how do you go for the bump actually they get the bump that's pretty huge he's gonna be there though also try to pressure him get the boost it's a pretty big boost grab that's gonna be a cool there we go it's a good boost still there because you know he's flicking that ball to the corner to get away from us we don't have to waste our position and challenge that he has no way out but to the wall and as soon as he does make that flick if we grab the boost he has no way to actually challenge us again and it's down to his teammate to stay in goal and he didn't back there good start for sure try to get this mid boost here he's gonna be upsell weight if your opponent's up already a good rule of thumb would be to just play a patient you don't want to go if they're ready up because most likely gonna beat that ball more likely than not very few times where your opponent will be up before you and you still end up beating up to the ball the only times where that's probably true is if you're on the wall and they're airline from the ground in general like driving up the wall while boosting as much faster than flying through the ball that's why you'll probably lose those duels much more in the air take left mid here good kill and kick off that actually gives us quite a bit of pressure short off the bat this guy has to try to defend 1v2 for a little bit they're getting pumped out and everything could touch around one try to go for the shot close might still be a goal there we go if this keeps up they might forfeit we'll see you're trying the shot there though could have definitely had the angle i think if i take an extra second could have time to line it up try to just stall them here keep it in the corner the corner is your your safe zone you always want the ball to be in i wish i hit the ball to the corners on on defense get past middle oh couldn't quite get the shot i had to get above the ball way more than i was a little bit unfortunate but it's okay we're trying to play good air dribble so i control this myself i can he's gonna have that so i'm just gonna go to the ground oh i got the stall to actually been clean hoping for the demo there couldn't quite get out go for the back boost nice try to follow us up good kill now we have so much time look how far that opponent is a lot of space here try to use it and fake the first give my teammate a free ball good play to take it slow get fake as well 1v1 now it took a little bit too long there so the guy had time to recover and get back behind and help his teammate i feel like as soon as you get by the first guy you should try to rush to play a little bit because it is going to be a one-on-one for a while that's gonna be your best chance of scoring very unlikely you have to fake you're gonna be able to fake a guy twice in one play right good challenge from his teammate to help him out there make that much easier to deal with try to challenge out the first touch like i said in the last game we go challenging those right off the first touch as quick as you can is really good gives them no space right they have no time to actually pull anything off if you just stop them right at the source you don't want to give them time to get full control over that ball right if they're in an awkward situation you should try to go straight away cut down any chances i'm actually doing anything with the ball shutter weight behind you same goes for like air dribbles you don't want to give them time to get complete controllable it's a good pop try to get this back take control which i'll go back to the ground here and fake this which i'll leave that there actually a really good read from him try to make that as weird as possible and he still got to it so well done for him i didn't realize he was going for it i thought he'd go back down to the ground trying to play it down to him also focus on the ball honestly nice good play me go for the double close i tried to read them that's a good try it's gonna have one more touch out here that's gonna be the big one we have to defend there we go there we go solid game played really well a few little mistakes here there missed one open net that we probably could have gotten more above a little bit more time than we thought could have been blocked potentially if we did get it on target but still a little mistakes like that you want to try to cut out as much as you possibly can be a good first game drop a thousand points let's get into the next one though so you can keep it up and get some back to back dubs see how it goes all right last game we got a sweaty one playing at typical and inspa we got sharif again on our team the do back-to-back games with sharif for today try this challenge this is fine you got the mid boost kill step would be pretty nice does that have a free ball here though nice to always touch to himself pretty much every single time every play is to himself something you gotta look out for when you're playing him in twos obviously so it controls the ball with you well try not giving space here make it wait for them so i'll slow down that play going forward gotta watch out for the shot all right teammate went again wasn't exactly expecting it but it should be fun we got out a little bit of panic there all right that works got it under him somehow we'll definitely take that fake to hi ended up working out a lot of weirdness on defense there but we'll uh we'll definitely take whatever that was yeah sip's always really high in leaderboards so i'm sure he's also still super high in leaderboards it's not going to be uh easy game whatsoever like i've been saying but it'll be good it'll be really good points for us if you win this obviously because he's probably top top five top ten he always grinds ranked super hard so we'll see i should have went earlier here we had less control of the ball but that point is too late gotta stick to what's happened there's no going back just gotta try to defend the shot gotta just play this high i don't want to fly too hard off the back wall honestly i want it to be slow as long as it gets by one player i'm happy with that no flip unfortunately that might have actually been a goal if i got the flip there probably gonna pass this to sip that's a huge beat plus we're both trying to block each other i think ended up working out though we both jumped quick to it to try to like get the read on each other's hit and we both missed it happens quite a bit i little play we got the forfeit out of within a minute and a half what all right well i will take that 100 i'll take that because that was a as you can see super sonic legend twos which is pretty high or more i'm not quite there yet but it's big points let's check out where he's on a little board real quick it's actually not that high it's only 33rd right now so wasn't crazy crazy high points but still pretty good game to win obviously let's get into one more for today because that one was way too quick against one more see if we can finish it with a dope let's see how it goes all right the last game playing it's turbo and john and we have sharif on our team all right another sweaty game one for the placement no ice unfortunately at the moment ice is lacking try gonna bump trip out here hopefully my teammate can get this i'm hoping to touch from us he's going to be really awkward last back now good challenge from him really well done there's a lot of time on the ball now another full boost back here i couldn't quite get back to that unfortunately hoping my team make a challenge on the back wall so i waited like an extra second for that and then once i noticed he wasn't challenging i went but then turns out that we both went for the same ball so pretty counterproductive should have just went shut off the bat one of us needed to have the initiative to just go obviously but none of us did there we go nice slippery set into a bump good job and take our time there i'll call kick off i'll try to get over to the right side seems like my teammate's cheating so i won't lose it too hard and i'll just score i'll definitely take that i was trying to make sure the ball goes to the right by going more to the left of the ball and the opponent just missed looked a little bit too weird couldn't quite readjust and we gotta go out of it i'm just messed up my flip too to be honest almost at the same thing but they gotta go back regardless not much i could do about that one unfortunately kickoff just went well for them all tied up though we go for right mid my game feels weird right now that feels like really choppy for some reason a lot of fps drops and stuff unfortunately that's okay probably come through with the dub i missed that corner boost actually worked out teammate got it all right turbo goes instantly for that so we'll just wait trying to go again it's fine though i don't mind if it's to my teammate gives him a free dribble all right might be internet we're okay a little bit risky you never want to hit it across your net like that but i guess it didn't didn't get escort on there so it's okay impatience for my teammate got the kill on turbo here too which is pretty big he's a lot of space now and he's a pretty good dribbler so he should be able to do something with it hopefully for the bounce down he's gonna have a dribble here just gonna leave get some pads you can go alone here it's gonna be a 1v1 with turbo doesn't have any help try to take time here just control this ball stall as much time as possible there we go my teammate got the ball back it's the whole point of that play there is the stall time and we did it well triple bumped me off the boost grab good play from him all i could do is wait now it's gonna be a goal unfortunately i'm left in a pretty bad situation there not much i can do to guide it unfortunately i've had any boost would have been fine but unfortunately we just got bumped away from it and we used our boost to get to that boost but we'll take it this has been the weirdest game ever there's been three kiosk goals two for us one for them and uh yeah we're back even i just over half the game played very weird game teammate likes to dribble a lot seems so much like just let him do that over and over again the rest of the game oh i think i would have the shot maybe even a goal day if you didn't get to that touch i play it to the corner i don't want to go for the shot there trying to put in this bar my teammate can follow it up my full boost here which is pretty good good position to be in i'll try one more touch there we go good play around turbo there gotta go for some more solo plays ourselves here we have time to teammate should have this hopefully nice way back full boost trip is going for the bump there we go good patience now it's just turbo back for a while he's gonna have a boom good block from us teammates should be there i see done it's gonna fake i don't wanna go too quick to that i'd rather him just panic and waste the play it's gonna be awkward spot to get out of but should be okay should be open there we go they play from us there good job to save our flip it's a nice finish for my teammate that delay of saving our flip there was huge just baited that guy all the way in up to an empty net a shot hopefully good delay i'm just going to fake you there's two of them out of the play one touch turbos go all the way back now because i have to read the play should have time on the ball now there we go good play again good solo plays using a time one not much turbo could have done there there we go ggs good games for today hope you guys
