yo what's up guys gonna be queueing all three game modes whatever we get we'll play for today let's get into it see if we get some dubs see how it goes all right first game we got ourselves a threes match we got hazard and taco stash against duckworth scribbles and vince this goes i don't know if it's the same vince from way back those events used to play in rcs a long time ago i don't know if it's the same guy or not it might be i might change his name he used to have an eye in it there let's hit it around them playing the spot they can't really react and then wait right wall here what's like that sort of balls and end up humans can't follow but it's fine if they play this a little bit passive as long as they don't double coming too hard on this one's one for a while say taco stash has in store leave it for my teammate i'm not going to shoot it from where it was and i heard my teammate jump so i figured maybe i could try to help him i wasn't going to try that let's start could be bad  stash in a bad spot here leave it for actually get patience but then you messed up a little bit but it's fine didn't get the boost here but it's okay i could put it into open space at least force the touch and then try to get for a bump maybe drop taco stash let's get away back all here it's the best spot to be in situation wrecked pretty much anything and you can stay on the ball like i just did right there which is really good there's both options let's open space using our boost well when we get it which is good always really important got to bait that out as well i'm gonna go back wall here you can say pretty much anything in that situation you just go back oh that's how i like doing that i feel like it covers every option not really risking anything you do that touch from them they should have pretty easily think that i'm missing so let's target now i like that name i don't know why aqua stash it's clean double demo from them you're up for this actually probably good for us but i can't tell who is hitting on their team so you can go for a shot straight up i play to the wall i think they're backwards here i think it's actually a good play to make it most likely if they come back gonna be looking for that and they can't actually get it now tiger stash is going it's fine actually pretty good touch there should be a little boost as well my teammate can hit this i said done i went mid here taco stash can pull something off play back to him say middle just keep some boost midpass would have been really good there i could just pop that it's actually not a bad play to me lets me get the boosts fine oh my good job i thought it was gonna be wide for sure but it was actually really hard this challenge here from the second man actually left their third in a really bad spot he had no boost had to jump to try to at least get the touch on that because the guy back one can get a shot for sure if not there's also a pass option down mid is also the bump option i got just alone for a very long time mainly because the second man did that pass over mid probably get in the way what's really matter if i get b it's more just making sure he doesn't have a free touching that ball ah that's hard not a boost i had hard to get to that from taco stash there i think i'm waiting ground there's no one in our corner for a long time right so you just wait around wait for the bounce for the controller trying to get a hit that's ever going to go up middle right also much easier said than done because you know sometimes you feel like you have to get a touch when you don't have to well done from taco sometimes you feel like you have to get touched when you really don't have to sometimes so just try to like assess where they're at if they're really far don't panic don't go for like a rush touch because most of the time you don't need to let's see if i can show you guys examples of that but [Music] it's a lot of time you'll have more space than you think you do and you don't really have to rush a lot of things like right here i could just play back wall most time there's gonna be no there's no danger here really just chill no reason to jump a lot of the time you gotta think about where everyone else is look how far their mid guy is no no threat really again right better be aware of their positioning that's gonna help you a lot it's gonna give you clues on where they're gonna hit the ball next you just look at their positioning and that's when there kind of becomes levels to everything because then there's some good players that like to use the positioning of their teammates to fake a potential pass and not actually do it it's another good thing that you can do it's gonna be can't go again i take the mid boost at least maybe go for a bump pick both boosts let's taco pop it ended up missing but it's fine both teammates went ends up working out pretty well here played around one actually perfect perfect soft touch really really good first touch and shoot off that was a little bit behind me but it's a really good idea for the pass gonna fake this i mean it should go nice i have 20 boosts but i'm just forcing them highs i think it's a pretty good thing there to do any kind of little touch like that it's so good it literally just makes it sore for me to do anything good job should be fine 20 boosts here i just played back hole teammate one so i'm just going to cancel and there we go jump a little bit like some of the game was sketch the way it was played out but it's honestly not bad and solo q3 is not going to be perfect ever but either way get first gamers against the next one let's even keep it up get back to back dubs see how it goes all right for the last game we got d-hacks against period and j chan i don't i don't know if i should call him dot i'll call him dot easier national teammate job just keep that in smart the pressure like that so surprised like i just cut his teammate off but actually working kind of i'm just trying to stay in front of the ball be annoying just leave that there i don't think it's worth that two minutes ago for that now i'm in like a 1v2 for a long time but ended up working it's a good pass i was all done that was the only way we could actually converted that in time for it to go before the guy gets back i can't get around that ball and get enough power on it so it's smarter to pass like that job for my teammate to be ready for it but yeah assessing like what you should go for in offense is such a hard thing to get better at something i think a lot of people don't even really think about in general so i feel like when there is an offensive opportunity like things you should ask yourself are just like are they going to beat me to this i'm going to be able to even go for this if they can then i probably shouldn't go until i know it's like for sure something that i can win the ball on like do not go for something pretty much if it can result in like a 50 that you can't control or you're just gonna get a heartbeat to it like something like this there's no point of me going to like they're literally going to be closer to that ball every single time as soon as i know i can win the challenge that's when i'll go stuff like that like what i just did is just to get away from my teammate always better to get in the way of a challenge like that or like a dribble than to just leave it i don't think i can shoot this it's fine don't mind that i should have and i saw my position as well good dunk should be a goal a lot of time good job so the time you see me to drive with someone too in that position the whole goal of that is just to make them force the ball away to my teammate but also essentially it's a pass back by the same time i keep my positioning because i never actually flipped into the ball i never like full committed to the ball another very important skill to learn as early as you possibly can let's save no boost here i guess i'll turn on this though try to be annoying being annoying they're almost just led to a up goal i'm just gonna keep on being annoying just like turn as much as i can go back now i missed the mid boost which might make this annoying my teammate gets stuck but i missed it for the the back boost it's like going to be a goal i think my team got a really good bump there i would have got back to the shot regardless it just definitely wouldn't have been a goal for us so much of like high level rock league also i'm trying a new thing and choose where i don't go for the kickoff in the corner but i didn't call for my teammate um because i feel like most time i go for take off i just get scored on like the cheater doesn't win the the next battle so i like to just do that lately but i should have called it take my flip should be good for my teammate i remember what i was saying before oh yeah a lot of twos and like high level play in general is just risk assessment like on defense and on offense what you should jump for especially when it comes to like pro play that's a lot of just making sure you're not jumping for bad balls or balls gonna get you scored on on defense as well job from him not to actually commit on that ball even though it was definitely a dangerous situation just playing it over him i turned again here it's fine trying to go for a bump a lot this guy this would be huge if i get this but it's up to my teammate to win this challenge now and if it's over i'm here nice good pass from my teammate that's a good bump thought i was saying that bump would have been massive if i got it ended up working i decided i wanted very tough shot to get actually at the end but close it out well done all right good games today hope you guys enjoyed having some wonderful day or night but
