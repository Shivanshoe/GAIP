before we get into the video for today guys there's still a big chunk of you guys that are not subscribed to the channel that watch my videos every single day 59.2 to be exact so if you're one of those people when you do enjoy my content please make sure you hit that subscribe button it's completely free helps me out a lot and you'll always be notified when i upload a brand new video hope you guys enjoy yo what's up guys so i've really made a video like this in a long time it's kind of a tutorial video but not really i mean it's about double touches and how to do them easily a lot of you guys ask me questions about double touches saying that you don't understand how to read the backboard when it hits the backboard you don't understand why the ball goes a certain way and i'll try to explain that to you guys in this video um there's a lot of little things that i did when i tried learning double taps that helped me a lot obviously way back when i learned it in 2015 2016 there wasn't really a lot of people doing it in 2015 2016 back when i learned it there was a very select few maybe a couple hundred people that could pull it off so when i first learned it there was a lot of little things that i tried to do that helped me learn it so i'll try to give you guys a little bit of my mindset on double taps and how i learned to do them properly but yeah i'll be trying to go over the majority of the situations within this video so started off we're in a training pack right now called devo i believe which is what the oce region used to call double taps back in season three i believe it was because devo had won the season three rlcs world championship off a double tap i think it was in the final game he hit a double tap something like that i don't know if there's in the final game or in the final series something like that though but but double taps at the time were pretty hard to come by in rcs so that's why he was one of the main players that would do them quite often that's why i kind of got named after him in the oce region back then uh but yeah i'm gonna be going over this training pack called devo and uh pretty much to start it off obviously you have to be able to aerial right if you don't know how to aerial you're not going to be able to hit a double touch so the first thing you should be learning before you even learn double touches is how to aerial and i have videos on my channel about how to fast aerial which is pretty much what i did right there which is double jumping like this this is a fast area this is a slow aerial you don't want to do this double jump and then boost because if i try to do this to hit this ball look at how hard it's going to be to actually double tap this i can still do it but it's a lot more difficult of an angle right and it's a lot more feathering my boost and trying to read a very tough bounce because i double jumped and then boosted that's right when you learn how to do the fast area to reach the ball look much quicker you reach it right so that's what you should be practicing before you even try think about double touches is how to fast arrow and get to the ball properly that's the first thing you should really be focusing on is that fast area so if one of the people that have already learned that the rest of the video is going to be really good for you guys to learn from so for double taps one of the first things i did that helped me massively in learning how to do them consistently is as soon as you make contact with the ball in the air try to stop boosting and see where the ball is going to end up don't boost all the way through it at the very beginning because it's going to be hard for you to get a good read on the ball even me right now if i boost the entire time i go for double taps and be very hard to hit so i'm going to try to double tap right now boosting the entire time and then i'll try one where i stop boosting the moment i hit the ball and you'll see how much easier it is to actually read where the ball doesn't come off all right so this will be full boosting the whole time much more difficult to hit and i can't actually get a good reader now i can't readjust my car it's very hard to actually get a good angle on this ball when you're full boost in the entire time you'll never see anyone hold boost the entire time to go for a double tap because look how difficult it is to actually hit it right i did hit it right there but it's very tough and you have to have a perfect first touch so now if i stop boosting the second i hit the ball which is what i normally do now i have time to read it feather my boots and i can actually aim the shot on goal you see how much easier it is when i separate myself from the ball and the wall and i get to just take a second to read where the ball is going to go and as soon as i see where the ball is going to end up i can continue boosting this is really good because it saves your boost so you're going to be using your boost to get that obviously but as soon as you make contact you wait and then you can finish it off and wait for the bounce to come back to you now this is a very good way to learn how to be consistent with double taps you're not boosting too much through it you're learning how to read the walls and it's just going to help you out a lot so i think this is a huge tip and feathering your boots once you get close to the ball to try to get a good touch on it is very important as well so you'll see right here i'm about to hit the bar stop for a little bit i feather i gotta get read on it and then i go for the last touch wait a second get a good read then go for the last touch so separating yourself from the ball for just that extra second is going to help you out a lot and if you're going for a double tap like this anyway you can't score this if someone's on the back all right sometimes on the back while you hit that there it's cleared for the left wall most likely so this is a situation where no one's on back bowl obviously so taking time on the double tap isn't bad and it's also a good thing because you can actually aim it so i can aim this over to the right side by taking my time if i want to and i have time i can aim this over to the left side of the net and there's just so much more you can do with it when you separate yourself from the from the ball it helps a lot with awkward down bounces when you take a second after you touch you to see where it's going and then you can continue boosting after the fact so yeah the first big thing that i wanted to say is just stop boosting after you get your first touch on the ball next is just making sure you you're feathering your boost after you get that first touch don't completely stop boosting stop using it at the moment you hit the ball but then feather after the fact that's gonna help you make those minor adjustments you need while still staying far enough from the ball that you can get a good touch on it right so you see how i'm just feathering my boost after that first touch instead of holding it because i'm still separating myself from the ball and i can read it pretty easily like that it makes you have those fine adjustments you can get into position you need to while also still holding on to a lot of your boost now i think the big mistake a lot of people make with double taps is say i'm coming from this angle and i hit the ball for the wall on the right side like this reading it like that is the hard part so i'm gonna try to read it badly again thinking it there and then reading it where i think it's gonna go it goes so much more further to the right when you hit it from the left there is spin on the ball that you have to account for that's something that a lot of people don't realize i was trying to read those badly on purpose to show you guys what i mean so if i hit this ball really fast on the left side of the ball and it's the back wall it's always going to bounce out to the right side if i hit the ball on the right side it's always going to bounce out to the left side that's just how the game works so i hit the ball to the wall here and then you go a little bit more to the right of where you hit it because that's what's going to end up and there you go if you hit the ball on the left side try to position a little bit more to the right side of the ball get the ball on the right side try to position a little bit more left side and depends on the speed of the ball and stuff like that and the angle which is coming at the wall but that's pretty much the main thing you should be looking for here on the left side i'm gonna position more to the right side that's gonna be a free goal every single time if you could do it right so again i'm gonna show you guys i'm gonna go hit on the left side of the ball stop boosting as soon as i hit it feather to the right there we go hitting on the left side it's gonna go to the right gotta reposition there there we go just repeat over and over again if it hits the down bounce perfect it's a good read as well to practice but it'll apply it everything will be the same you're going to be feathering as soon as you hit the ball float for a second wait and there you go once you feel like you have that down once you know how to get a good read on the ball going a little bit more to the right and stuff like that then you want to practicing on the other side obviously so i think there's another double tap on the other side here sorry this is the left side a bit here on the ball so we come out to the left there we go so you have to account for the spin a little bit i think a lot of people don't really account for the spin of the ball and that's something that really does hurt a lot of people when it comes to double taps this is a good training pack to practice because just double tap after double tap right with different scenarios and i think that in general if you guys can just practice mechanic over and over again and get good at it this is something that will get you through a lot of ranks right the hard part about this is you need to have a good pass obviously for a lot of these if you're lower rank you're not gonna have a pass it's as good as the ones in this pack but in general learning this mechanic is actually very important i think double touch is even at the highest level right now or one of the most important things to be able to pull off every single time going faster this ball is always going to be way harder than just waiting and you know playing the the safe consisting game play off the back hole wait for the bounce back to you and then just feather your boost and get it in there right doesn't matter if you use arrow right or default arrow for these obviously the same thing for both it's just a matter of being consistent and approaching the ball the same way every single time just a default arrow as soon as i hit the ball i stop separate myself fly toward it this is a good one to practice separating yourself from the ball because it's coming at you in a weird way so you'll float toward this tap it off the wall try to read the bounce down right but you can't read that balance if you're going too fast in the ball there's just no way you can read a bounce like that if you're going too fast so if you boost back when you're about to hit the ball like i just did right there actually helps you a lot you can separate yourself from the ball and get those awkward angles that are really close to the back wall if i go too quick of this ball look what happens how can i double this how can i possibly double this ball if i'm going really quick with this right that's the closest i can probably get to doubling it i mean i hit one out of like every probably 15 or 20 doing this but it's gonna be so much harder than if i just take my time try to actually get a a good read on it maybe if i go for a flippy set up this is only way i can actually go fast and get back to it but even then it's really tough right i like to slow down for a reset on this separate myself from the ball and then i have a good shot right so it's the same thing that applies i do this a lot and i think a lot of pro players do this a lot when it comes to double taps a lot about just separating yourself from where the bounce is gonna be and just giving yourself that space to read what's gonna happen right if you're too close to the wall you're too close to the ball when it's making its bounce it's gonna be hard for you to actually get a read on it like that right so i like to always separate myself as much as possible there we go it gives you that extra amount of time as well to pick your spot where you want to shoot on that right so i like about it a lot yeah that's pretty much it for all i wanted to cover in this video to be honest same will apply for every single double tap no matter the situation fly to it fast stop when you get the first touch wait for the bounce try to get the reed yeah i hope this kind of broke down how i approach double touches in general it's going to be something that you have to get a feel for on your own and figure out you know how you want to do it and what feels most comfortable to you obviously like i said in every situation it's gonna be the same kind of three steps and you're gonna be kind of stopping a little bit as you hit the ball just to see where it's gonna end up and there will be some times where you know the situation requires you to boost a little bit after you hit the ball so right here i kind of need to boost a bit but then i can stop boosting and it's a matter of just getting a feel for the game and you know how all the bounces work and stuff like that because right there that's exactly what i was talking about i hit the ball on the left side it's always going to bounce out to the right and i knew that so i already flipped more to the right than you would probably expect me to and uh yeah that's pretty much it guys all i wanted to cover for today just double tap so i see that question more than any other question in terms of mechanics i think it's one of the first mechanics a lot of people learn out of the higher level ones so i hope that helped you guys out a lot make sure you're feathering your boost obviously and just stopping at the ball separate yourself if you do practice those things step by step and you do consistently work on it you'll 100 get better at it in no time i promise you guys double taps is one of those things you need to grind once you have an understanding of it you can hit it almost every single time so yeah let me know what you guys think down in the comments let me know this video helped you out give me some requests if you guys have some requests on what you want to learn about and uh yeah appreciate you guys hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times when you guys are watching this like comment and
