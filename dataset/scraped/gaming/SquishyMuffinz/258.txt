hundred thousand subscribers now which is just nuts to think about thank you for making that a possibility and hope you guys enjoy today's video love y'all yo guys give me money for 3 today with fire and get make should be some good games gonna be chill with the boys and I'll be using my brain new goldfish never got from the shop to the day which in my opinion is the best coolest person they put out to date it is so so nice it sucks up all the cars across the matter matter where you are it sucks you toward the net if you're super close you actually get stuck completely into the hole but it's the first ever gold solution that does this kind of thing so super dope in my opinion and honestly the default one looks better than any other colored one for the black was pretty clean as well let's get straight to the games I'll show you guys how good it looks see how it goes all right let's give Josh's Squasher and titanium just start it up this solid Lobby they're all high in my place finger back off that not much I can do is probably fire at the ball they're on full bases off ice block gonna blast a shot so he does give me some to be in the corner touch I still want to be too close so I should have been probably you know where he's fighting to beat me already gimmick oh this boss a shot and see if they'd be worth the try I mean there's a chance at the past that back to give me it could be a goal there's also chance to get a bad touch off the challenge back there my shot so not a bad idea regardless slide off the wall for a gym hit finish hold on I want to rush that to quicks I know no one's gonna be middle yet so you gotta try to create a place so enough for your teammates to get back to a new gimmick would be ready if I hit off the wall there and it was good of him to turn good finish behind fire here let's fire out that probably I'm my ball boy first touch to the right you missed the aquifer them you're coming in but I forget my turn here I just keep it in nothing nothing crazy give me small high in the air so I'll let him go first you get behind those behind a better position than me I get in the way they set it up over the guy challenging probably got beat but give me [ __ ] up a touch that's more than good enough to to get in the way that play put off the fire side nice play forgive me you should have beat him to it it didn't honestly do enough because it didn't stop him from making it such or didn't block his head so didn't do as much as I would've liked you there with that challenge but if anything at least slowed them down it's kind of a plus but I really our way back here let's take the shot off the touch there you go there you go explosive just sucks you in matter where you are if you're super close to get sucked completely in there kind of like further back you just get pulled toward the net that's why it sounds weird getting sucked toward I don't know either stop saying that insect I passed the gym yeah yeah I hailed like super weird for that cuz I didn't get the first touch I wanted but it works kind of messed them up I guess games going cut down three goals two minutes in secured the mid boost as well could be from gimmick all you have to do and then I easy easy for you go for fire to get me stole the classic yeah good first game is super clean all around a lot of goals really quickly not too bad not too bad at all the next one they'll see it and keep it up they go they go I probably end up doing three games this video so this is the second one out of three just because that first one and they're really really quickly unless this goes until I Cal long overtime I doubt it nice from fire I'm gonna is next touch here don't follow the mid-post shall I get this off their back well if I could knock on the be perfect if not a stop stop forcing a hit to the wall and this would be easier for my team to get a touch so let's find either way really Oh such a slow shot I should have waited expect a little bit too much of him I guess not about 50 at all I just spilled into unlucky spot Vicky off from gym they kind of dismissed but I'll wait for his touch here got some fire ice speed I'll stay mid here if he wants to use me talking to girl fat a little bit too awkward although not one more probably shouldn't have been Oh nice blog you're telling a to actually wait wait this is a video yeah that's fun but forget that passed over to fire I could shoot maybe unlucky bounce again just try to pressure that ball even though I can't exactly when the challenge is still makes it super hard on the opponent so no reason not to be shot of pressure [Music] over one try to get it off the back for teammate but it was tough for sure doesn't even be able to react to that should have played a little differently if passed from Jim well done really good fifty and a good three foot passes well shall I get back to this after the bounce flit around them make it awkward at least the four fire the challenge for Jim at least make him pop it or something that's all I gotta do they really yes I messed up my flick try to take my time probably that was the right play to make there I just messed up the flick a little bit [Music] Plus got the kill yeah way too hard to shoot that even though was a good get touched forward from Jamaica's wait to ours gonna get around his shooting time so my lady's at a corner great pressure in some way and got to go out a bit not bad at all take mid boost here it makes probably gonna have so I'll just leave it fight better that lot of control in the corner keep my boost and their waste my boost to get over there he's already closed it so I think of those situations that's real ice is always flicking to the corner such a good idea it creates a lot of pressure me does that I wait forward you know my teammate get easier ball for him that's touch gotta play it off the back keep pressure and also loves my teammates to get back as well couldn't get a good shot under that so no point of shooting something weak they're gonna get it free it to the corner then get possession not a bit I might as well try to go for a double and keep pressure that my teammates get back at boost you know there's really no downside of doing that the devil from gimmick lookin fling on the Dom GT never really tried that car out never give it a chance probably [ __ ] off into the third game see if we can get the three back to back to back forfeits I'm sure there will be a lot tougher them I just have a feeling they'll step it up into next though alright the last game the video we actually got a super sweater we got percy fire raptor beast of bone 'i'm here so all super solid players won their LCS the first ii dude yellow to being an RL RS definitely sweaty lobby for sure let's see see what we can do all right fire sets it off the big demo gimmick with the finish i'll play well played it's a pretty clean games though I'm playing playing pretty well either team I feel like I'm doing that much individually I'm not even playing that great visually honestly by the team were playing really well they did faster you get really well done you know Becky got some peds ok gimmicks work I don't have to do anything I don't have to do anything I give his watch and it just goes in opened over him give me spots enough that he's playing really well so I just had a little stuffy by the way guys allergies been acting up lately so close and go back here clothes from fire you got to keep it in take mid right here okay I'm gonna go back now do forgive gotta watch shot though nice from gimmick going back with really quick there try to block here ain't too much else before some wide and this will make the shot worse it's fun they can actually shoot off that he's got a play off the wall oh we're so gonna dunk that better I think I might flip the what I had a fall up on that media touch should've been perfect it read from fire take that from didn't you realize it is coming in nice I play across the fire bus get attempt on the play good touch back oh my gosh nope wrong on the phone it's all good you learn done that it's kind of unlucky oh wait left side here we're just gonna wait there we go how does that work i deftly gimmick and as soon as you I saw him like going more forward with that I stopped boosting held my boost just in case something happened I took my 50 when I could finish from gym been really well they're playing speedy oh I didn't hit it out I'm I'm dumb I got poop down I just play forward well right well for him he'd be over me that's fine that force the worst touch out of them and I can get a kill here just good didn't get me should have anything that there we go alright that's gonna be the video I'll probably play somewhere with these guys though but that's three games three four [ __ ] you played really well pretty solid all around gets a lot of pressure I have to do much but in a team dynamic you don't really need to do much you need to do what needs to be done and we're playing around each other really well yeah I'll be guys enjoy yourself wonderful day or night with tempers in Washington's like comment subscribe to
