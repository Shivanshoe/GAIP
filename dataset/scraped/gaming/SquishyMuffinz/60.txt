yo what's up guys for today's video i'm gonna be trying out the brand new ford mustang car that was released there's two that released there's uh this one and the shelby version so for today i'm gonna be making a video on this one and for the next video we'll do one on this i think i've done one on the formula one right i feel like i have i definitely have um so we'll definitely just do this one for today and then the next one we'll work on is uh the shelby version of it which actually looks like the dominant hitbox this one looks like more of the octane hitbox so looking forward to trying this one out should be fun let's get into some 2v2 games with this and hopefully it feels good let's see how it goes all right the first game we got ourselves s against vegas and fire d i don't know if it's fired or fire d but i'm gonna call him fired i think it's cooler wait for vegas's touch one high touch is gonna be weird for him let's get hit off the back wall actually wasn't the best touch but they're gonna both follow it up that works it's like it's a really good saving it's get example two back there why you shouldn't be moving too far forward like too fast because my teammate made kind of a mistouch but ended up popping it up for me in a good way if i was in the right position right so because i was waiting it left me at a pretty good spot to follow that up even though it probably wasn't what he wanted on the pop there car feels nice so far that actually feels a lot like the octane so it's pretty easy to just get used to it also i really like the wheels i don't know if you guys can see it but they have like brake pads on them i think some like little red part of it that's not on a normal wheel but i think you can only use it with this version of the car i think a shot oh my that's crazy [Music] how do i get this right side my first touch [Music] let him go alone i don't want to get in his way nice it wasn't should be at the demo so i was kind of just waiting real quick for this if he beats me it should be fine gotta be careful now because i'm falling for a while didn't move it up a little bit too far but he did a good job to get back no booster about to stay in front low 50 is good here single jump good work i can get this boost now all good we bumped each other it should be fine though you can't really get a fast shot of this the very most should be easy save played it to him well as well and it's going crazy he's trying to do a musty only issue is this can happen right it's a 1v1 for a bit now ended up missing the only problem with those mechanics that leave you just falling into their half for a while you got to be careful you don't want to leave your teammate at 1v1 or 1v2 for too long especially in twos it's very hard to get out of situations three is you normally have help a little bit quicker and twos you're gonna be alone for a lot longer let them hit that choosing what you're going for is like really important situations as well i really don't have any point to challenge that if you touch him play to the wall over him should be a goal nice good job really good job there to slow down let it go for the double after we picked the first guy he dropped my teammate to be there car feels really good though i'm not gonna lie feels a lot like the octane i feel like i'm already really comfortable in this car which is really rare for a brand new car it's definitely one of my higher rated uh first impressions for sure i really like it all right so good too we kept our flip we would have saved it played to my teammate hopefully it should be empty as well he just shoots nice oh good job i'm gonna try something here and be cheeky let him hit it to me much to myself look at 50 it should be free ball and it gets us right too it's even better you did exactly that and circle beautiful what more can you ask for exactly what i was hoping he would uh he would do there he actually did i'd say patiently situations it's pretty awkward honestly it could be bad but all you could do is hope for the best stay patient again on the back wall here hope that their play is just not perfect and it's not going to be most of the time i messed up though oh it's just going to vehicle my bad i tried to like wave dash and get like a really quick clear that but i rushed it i didn't need to rush it and then my teammate got bumped just so unfortunate i did not get bumped those still fine that's a good uh adaptation from them it's my fault though good bum oh wow okay then he's starting to hit it again the bump was really good but the second touch i wasn't expecting nice good job give me something good though he's really solid that's a really good wall dash i should remake the wall dash tutorial by the way guys i found out like a lot of really consistent ways to to hit it better than i made in the last wall dash tutorial that i made so should maybe remake one i'll try to give you guys a better tutorial for that yeah good first game against the next even keep it up all right we got red snow this time against vegas and fired again for last game we don't have s anymore but i believe in red snow is going to be solid i hope you touch forward yeah this car feels actually really nice i can see this like kind of being used like a fennec low-key people might not give it a chance because it looks a little bit goofy bennick like like the fennec looks cleaner like easier to use in a way because it looks cleaner but this car feels a lot like the fennek and octane stay patient here let him hit itself the wall trying to flip it's fine it should be okay at least the patience there you guys should have this one more touch actually really hit but i can't really go for it yet like i was already up for it okay one hit awkward for him just gonna be your goal hopefully there we go again looking for those like scenarios where you can put the ball in a weird spot for the last guy back that's what you should always be trying to do right it didn't look that tough but the way it bounces actually really hard for him the speed he was coming at the ball with trying to adjust to how that bounce is going is actually really difficult i'm actually really liking the way this car feels though like super surprised i'm not just saying that to you like what oh the wall that's just bang like how am i getting around that and scoring from there damn i have almost 500 points in a minute [Music] and the mustang logo is on the bottom cool all right do you realize that let him hit that once i think that's like the most underrated skill ever when you just let them hit it into you waiting a good spot to react to it i'm gonna fake the challenge let him shoot it another example of it right there can't really do much but just let him hit it ends up working better than me trying to rush a play attract my teammate on the shot it's hard though nice again just a little bit of patience paying off i played over them couldn't quiet but i should get the mid-right boost it should be okay drop my teammate that's actually really good positioning to you when you just sit here like when you just kind of camp this midfield line you can react to anything so this ball's coming here i can go quick back to it i can go again if i want to now all because you're just camping the midfield line you can react to the left or right very easily right if you're too pushed up beyond that or even too far back you're kind of in no man's land right you can't really react to any situation you want to put yourself in this part you can react to the good and the bad and that mid line kind of does that for you nice this car feels good man i told you i'm not even just saying that this car actually feels nice almost a thousand points half the game in that's crazy that just doesn't happen could this be it okay this car feels crazy it's literally just the car they left they four literally exactly halfway through the game a thousand points ground double so many good goals super clean stuff i think we end the video there that's perfect great display of what this car can do love it all right i hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this look at that it's crazy 1000 points in 2 minutes 30 seconds and they forfeit it's a speed round right there all right hope you guys enjoyed like i said love you guys see you on the next one peace oh [Music]
