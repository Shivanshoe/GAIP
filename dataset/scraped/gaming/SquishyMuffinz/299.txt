video for today and hopefully we get this series over woodsy Yoda's up guys in the last video we finished off in the neverending cycle of winning one and losing one yet again we're stuck on the brink of grandshaykh man we should have had that game like there's so many chances my team they should have finished but it's fine we could do this I believe this is part of why this challenge is so damn difficult once you get to the very end man are mmm are so hot it's gonna give us a Lorimar player it's gonna be really hard to win these games but I believe we can get two in a row we got a play well we got a play style we got a great opportunity it's let's get into it let's get two wins let's go all right we need two wins and this is looking terrible already I don't know who either of my teammates are and I know that every one of the team is good so this would be a tough one actually I think spud was the guy that was playing a super sketchy last game another those two guys are solid so this is gonna be a very very tough game but I don't know if there's gonna be an easy way to complete this series at this point I'll lie to you I think there is an easy way out maybe I gotta go for more bumps in a situation like last game the last video I did where it was like super intense OT try to get four bumps to clear at the last guy so it's an empty net but even then they're missing the target so I don't know I don't think about it mattered surround me my other teammate went and I'm bump that's probably a ghoul wait you can't target this time where is that all the last game dude we would have been over with the series if you just hit one of those laughs key so sad now we got a clutch up somehow two games in a row here oh no all right skid actually just might my faith and my teammates right now has been bad because these last two games to get the grand champ I've been just super they're gonna be super unfair in terms of MMR the games gonna expect me to carry the problem is I literally can't carry because I can't sort so there's only so much I can really do I'll further by the last guy I'll t miss just playing back someone's gotta gear for this ball I really hope this guy has it he doesn't some huh okay you gotta run one but that guy still has nice ice is good open pretty much saw you talking so good unlucky that was unlucky you tried unlucky again I'm lucky to point out I'll finish that I believe okay that's to go he made up for it that's huge at least at least it is good score man I'm asking you it's like nothing could go in all right we need this win absolutely need this the good thing is the last two videos we still have gained I think two points a video because we're we're winning games that we're not really supposed to be winning because of the MMR difference so even if we do go one win one loss again in this video we're still gaining points but if we can get two in a row that'd be beautiful but we need this one this one's gonna be a hard one to pull out a lot of time left so I'll shut us down this that's fine I think for a bit nice such a couple a smart on defense and this point tears are trying to make some plays which is good it's good to see make some air dribbles going forward and stuff you know to who nice save that was just bumping me and okay how was this was a win with that dude on my team yeah like he doesn't hit the ball like men obscenity um I don't think is actually this right it's not a problem he's not he's not bad just don't think he's right I'm I'm trying to be really just like the guys are playing against we're all like super solid they're hitting the ball pretty well well he's gonna lose T in this game it's gonna help us a bit here it's nothing to I think is think better now that I did last game but he's still making mistakes nice see again the same guy that I think that was the same guy that had back on my team man no it wasn't anyone there's a snub guy how's he get finished so my teammates are actually shooting the ball really well this is good to get to see I'm according to someone directly after losing the last guys so my sound irritated is because I am because I literally like this series is annoying now it was fun for a bit when like I was gonna evilly anymore like even MMR matches but now because these games are getting a lot of hand it's not been this fun when it's just like hoping your teammates can hit them peanuts let's go okay our teams are actually good though this game like they're solid I haven't had advantage even tapes let you see his name I have no idea his name I haven't had a baton on my team before but he's playing solid he's clutching up when he needs to be scored all three passes that I've given well sure we give him more than three but score three of them at least so I should get fake I don't think you just trying to fake that all right I think that guy's tilted angle so that's it's good to see means the wind is pretty much secured not good to see in terms of you shouldn't really have the mentality but means the wind is pretty much secured at that point oh yeah again we start off with the same trend we won the first game can we win the most important second game that would finally get us into GC can we do it that is the main question here it would be quite nice yeah that guy's literally completely giving up 20 seconds left we'll get ourselves probably 15 points from this we're at 1267 MMR so we get back up Tovar over 12 ad I'm in a really good spot all right glad that's over with my teammates actually performed really well comparison to the last thing and there's a massive upgrade now can we do it two times in a row that's what's been the hard part we got 14 points from that will be up to 12 81 I believe so that's pretty solid all around we got back up the division for now this is the game that matters most yet again hopefully third time's the charm two videos in a row we've been on the brink of grand champ we've won and then lost one being to a pro one being overtime that we should have probably wondering so many opportunities but hopefully this is the the golden game right here the game that that finishes it all off let's get into it so I guess all right what could be the very last game no way dude we're up against another like semi-pro player playing pro first I'm playing a semi-pro I'm so sad please let my teammates be notes all I can do is hope and pray all I can really do is hope pray at this point not looking crazy promising for yet but hoping for the best that's gonna be the Geiger to worry about its don't want to get too worried about really is the Omar deed it's actually really a solid player striking for my teammate when again it's fun again nicely let's go let's go come on four minutes I believe holy that was huge - huge this is gonna be such a hard game to win because that dude the Omar guy and their team is really good and the other two guys are actually solid so I really hope we could take this man this would be so nice to win off the back please miss masterji - get back quick you gotta watch out for this dude right there you go - whoo no I can't I can't die I can't leave my teammates back in a spot where they won't be able to go for the bowl yeah I had to be able to be the last line of defense at all times in this series these matches this is so stressful man so my teammates to pop off somehow but that dudes gonna make this so hard I got alone you got enough skill to make this very difficult for us come on dude go for the ball babe I thought it's gonna be possible my other teammate hasn't hit the ball once and he's 1250 he's 1250 anymore so he's supposed to be really good but other two mates seem to be way better than him at 901 so this is gonna be interesting how the rest of this game carries out I have faith but on defense right now my teammates are doing not much to help out it's just been pretty bad game so far I'm good to be till I guess it's fine I believe in my team on I don't believe my team okay we good that's the last person I want to be shooting in that situation why do we keep running into someone who just gonna carry the other team megacity it's not possible for us to win unless speaking counter carry and these in these games I feel like oh no way no we see trust routine it was so good and they just saved it why I understand that is up it's fine I miss the ball lucky any kind of tilt the dude I can't I can't win the second game so much stress for anything should be over him I faked it pass at least go for a kill I see off every ball it's fun Hospital nice dude okay come on holy this is so it's just so like I don't know the word man I just want to get this done - please please let's win this game man I don't know how to play this out do you just play defense like what do we do I don't know I don't know how we can win this game I thought that teams better but I know this is a winnable game hang out for that I don't leave it oh we missed oh if you didn't back foot that's probably go put up the backward nice Aussie read I can you get that nice go for a bomb I can't do anything no like this dude hopefully stays on that nice one more finish oh no my guys going for a bumper ski nice case guys good I keep hearing him the ball matches you guys been actually how many quick clutch open - no please I need one of them just finish off the easy there's so many easy chances that are coming through so just got to finish those nice do it nice I know please go fine open Oh unlucky okay number time again man please please let this be the one team I could have won it already first but can't along to that now I like daddy'd nice yes trying I dribble I was just good so I bumped this guy I can't no oh my gosh dude I hope they mess up really hard so mouth oh no this is bad go for the ball nice no do you help again no no I hate this I hate everything about this situation I'm back ma'am shake why am i shaking I just want to get this done please take it oh no dude don't tell me don't tell me we lose again overtime please [ __ ] gosh I think I might have to call this series dude this is bad for my health honestly this is so bad for my health that was really a straight down bounce my teammate backflip Tony and that's the game we win that game oh this feels so impossible you guys don't understand this feels impossible dude I'll give it one more try I think I'll give it one more try if I'm stuck here again I'm gonna just end it and get the grand champ this is so painful it is the hardest thing I've ever had to do in this game I swear it is just uncontrollably painful how hard this is the play but anyway I hope you guys enjoyed I percent one foot there in heaven time is near watching it's like comments Java so you guys all in the next one but hopefully we can get this Tampere chip to pop up in our faces the man is just freshman you all right good night I need some time to break and hopefully we'll come back and get some dubs
