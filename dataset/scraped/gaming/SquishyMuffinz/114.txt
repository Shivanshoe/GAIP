yo what's up guys so the titles from arl says x finally came in and as you can see we got the rlcsx champion title looks so clean one of the cleanest titles i've ever seen in this game to be honest short to the point looks super nice the x in there just looks so clean i don't know what it is about everything about it i love it it looks so clean so happy to finally be able to use this title and game all the hard work the whole year paid off because you know how much i love these titles so yeah i hope uh i hope i can win many more in the future obviously with this squad and have a lot more titles to be able to use coming uh into the future years but uh yeah let's get into the game for today gonna be playing some twos with gimmick from version one it should be from the games let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right the first game we got ourselves lavirus and zoomer pwr keep in mind guys we're queuing these games at 8 a.m right now so see how this goes look at that save really out the way on backwater that's the best way to defend something like that like a quick touch like i just made gonna be really hard for the last guy back to save this i'm just let's go panic a bit wait for the ball to bounce here yeah good 50. then a panic again it should be fine might not be fine it would have been okay it would have been okay that's un uncured uncharacteristic as miss jessie i think i actually could have taken both boots but it didn't i'll definitely take that i should have passed that more over to gimmick so you can follow dribble it's gonna wait let him panic a bit i couldn't really go quick would have brought us both out of the out of the play i didn't want to commit two of us on that just like that i kind of baited gimmick out by passing that but i don't like doing that and the really obvious passes i don't like passing them because most time you're actually putting your teammate in a worse situation when you do that you two of them off that gotta pass the middle behind now this is a good pass there this is a good try see what we can do here i'll try on the shot take my time here i'm just going to pop this up high see what he does take his boost as well past middle push he's gonna shoot there we go he went off the top of the roof so i knew that if we shot that low fast a good amount of power it was gonna be a go every time it's fine i don't mind that block i'm not going to follow i can always press my boost just going to wait give me something i have a free ball here a lot of times let him use it he's doing absolutely nothing he's thinking about a little full boost here and forget about gonna fake here let him both panic he makes going back so i should be first of challenges i'm gonna go back home again it's best spot to defend something like this is back wall you just can cover every option pretty much it's so unfortunate that's actually so funny that was a good spot to defend that's unfortunate yeah it's fine i'm in this part of the american house uh it's so funny popping up once last middle taking a time on the corner which is smart both goals are so are too funny both in really bad spots to deal with this and they're well waited put it around one you should turn on this hopefully nice good patience good job everybody mid there we could definitely still win this the goals the ghosts haven't been anything too crazy on on there and we're not playing bad yeah the back wall on defense guys is one of the most like overpowered things i think it'll always be very overpowered it's very strong use weight back wall you can cover so many options try to pass down i wanted to play in front of him but he was an awkward spot to be honest so anything that he could pull up is fine there good junction gaming we'll leave that back boost he wants to actually take it now that he didn't get it nice soft touches good fake again there from gimmick pick him again pass right side now pop it over one did you have a touchdown i got the mid-right boost they're still getting pressure pretty hard here even though you got that boost swing right there should be okay i can play this back to gimmick i'll just turn again try to pop it over one it's a good idea take the mid-right boost we still have all the pressure though we're the advantage in every one of these touches and they're low boost so we just played this back into our own half we still have the ball here play over one that's my gimmick i tried to play a double to myself it was a right idea slightly off unfortunate i should have played a little bit slower it would have been it would have been a good play either i go really fast try to bang it off the ceiling in order a little bit slower and go for the double nice that was a good play to slow down there and get the double it's really a key option give me we made that really hard for the defender to read and we took it below what we needed to there the right time you try to wait for shoddy alright we got out that challenge again here's a flip oh he's going crazy for the second flip i like the idea i trolled i trolled that's not bad i tried to get i try to get a touch where i can beat him in like keep it close to myself and make him jump again i kept it a little bit too far for me to be able to get a good follow-up touche nice good job i wasn't sure gimmick on the picture or not so i kind of just waited and tried to take a shot off for the roll that's the right idea though 19 seconds left the goals have been bad i'll be honest the goals have been bad it's been what you'd expect what you would expect of an 8 a.m game but we could definitely win this so we'll see we can close it out here good bang i was just nt that's unfortunate there's a good shot from doing okay off here hopefully stay stand up myself oh i got bumped off a bit it's unfortunate it's really unfortunate if you didn't touch me just a little bit right there then i would have been uh a goal for sure no i missed that was so good too man two chances back to back both so good unfortunate but it happens brought the last guy back oh my god what is this game i'm getting faked by everyone i'm just bumping him all right let's let's get out of here let's get out of here let's end this no no guys guys i love this i love this this is so true i love it this is what i play ranked am for these games right here all right it's a game this is a game there's nothing you can do never mind surely surely one of these ends it all all right i trust gimmick just gimmick with this all right i'm not going to troll anymore i'm not going to anymore i was i was missing for content i was missing for content oh oh my god that was insane that was worth it it made the whole game worth it i'm not gonna lie but that was insane that made everything worth it all right all right there you go that was the best thing you'll ever see on this channel i miss the most troll two of the goal i gotta got two insane goals at the end of that that was the most strong game i have ever seen let's get the next one that was beautiful that was that was beautiful let's get into the next one all right for the last game hopefully it's a little bit clean here we got a little bit and uh why this time we'll see save my boost here block from gimmick good show let him pop that he has one more touch i can wait it's a good save let's save it from gimmick i just played it patient got a bump there which is fine i gotta take the back boost now just sitting in front of that ball is good even if i got bump games behind me there's really no danger in that let's get blocked from him if i forgot my flip i would be able to get her over him so i was hoping for him trying to bump him give me because i'll throw a goal if he has a bump there really the challenge ones i need to make there i like this it's a very weird weird gameplay but i like it i'm gonna wait here should be there first again just in front of it uh unfortunate let me go on the shot off of the pincher the right right idea try to lose a 50 back to him which is smart and honestly that even going for the pitcher is fine for gimmick and in threes especially it's actually really a player to make there's a chance that that goes straight in obviously it creates a lot of pressure it's gonna weight back wall here if you shoot the low i should be able to still get there hit it over one second one going now start to follow it up and gimmick let him panic a bit here do not throw us away again he's no boost so bumps one which is good i won the boost as well which is pretty good there you can't follow it again but i could challenge actually i'll wait for his challenge here a little bit unfortunate that he was able to keep full control off the flick it's a really good counter though took my time well i had one really close to me behind and i couldn't go for the straight away pass because the unicorn's in a great spot to shoot right away i took my time waiting for him to be in a better position and we're able to come right off of it the patience again that's why back wall is so important there because you just sit there and you cover so many different options by just sitting there again back wall he's not back wall there it's a goal i just double tap for three unfortunate i got bumped just a little bit couldn't quite get back played round one bumped him off the boost as well didn't get the demo unfortunately hoping for the demo that should be fine we all the way back here if i land on the wall one more mid this is a good pass honestly it was scorable but it's very hard for gaming to be ready for me to get that touch like that let him touch that big jump is fine there should be okay there's no shot on that i don't know give one the boos i think he did looks like he did he did big boost win 1v1 now he had a really good opportunity for himself play to myself on the wall here there we go good play took my time had a lot of space a lot of time on the ball i waited till he jumped as soon as he jumped i sped up the ball last second and that's always going to be a good play to make very hard for the defender to do anything if they're grounded again that's where back wall comes in that goal is extremely useful in a spot like that every time because if they're just afk back wall like just sitting there they don't have to move at all they're just sitting back well i can't go anywhere above them they can go up or down very easily and they also save all their boost that's unfortunate it might be a goal let's say you can make that's why back wall is so good you can cover so much more my time again trying to get over him and i have that little gap again of him not being able to challenge because he's on the ground that's the difference between like the pro level players that are very very good like very very high level pro players on the best teams in the world because they'll always have someone backwall so you can't do that in 3v3 2v2 you'll see a lot more than you'll ever see it in in threes for that exact reason people challenge a lot better in threes and pro lobbies especially those are very good very high rank but that's a mistake you'll never see in very very high level pro lobbies hit around two which is good there i can go back now trying the shot i'm gonna fake this in the way now like gimmick follow that hopefully be behind him here he doesn't have much moves i can tell by the way he's moving working on very little boost he jumped very early here actually opportunity for me take advantage of his panic again the situation try to take advantage of him jumping late it was a good idea bump the last guy back should be a goal well done good job take advantage of it still another weird game to be honest 8 seconds left it should be able to hold on but another weird game and we're able to come out on top of the weirdness all you have to do is fake this i can throw it away fake again can't do anything the ball is coming to me i have the advantage there i have full possession and there we go good two games today guys i hope you enjoyed they're weird they're weird i'll be honest with you i i i don't know what happened the first game is my first game on all day i don't really have an excuse i just didn't didn't hit my shots when i had the chance at 8 am and uh this is what you can expect at 8 am ring so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time doesn't guys are watching this like comment and
