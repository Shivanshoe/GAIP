yo what's up guys so i was solo queueing some 2 games earlier today and i ran into alpha and ferry peak from vitality they were the winners from europe of rlcsx we won over in north america so it's fun to actually be able to play them for the first time in a long time because i haven't played them since the land has happened and it's been over two years since the land has happened so it's been a while it's been uh very very long time it feels like since i've been able to play these guys and fairy peaks ping on uh north american servers by the way is actually pretty good 84 ping from eu dna is really good um kokita is a west player i'm pretty sure and he has 72 being almost the same as ferry so anyway i decided i haven't done a replay review in a while so let's go over this 2v2 rank we play against two of the best european players of two of two of the three players that won the championship so let's see um a little bit more into how this game went i've been trying to play a certain type of way a little bit more different than more reserve when it comes to my 2v2 games um so you'll see that throughout this game ran the plane but we started off with a quick goal and that was a really good uh pass for my teammate to be honest barry's in a really bad spot here whenever the ball's coming off the back wall like this it's always worse for the defender than it is for the attacker uh alpha doesn't get the best touch and fairy's just stuck in a bad spot teammate rushes right away and there's no way outfit could be me to that ball after the effect an output perspective this is the big mistake here is he doesn't take his time on this he can't see anything to his right and this is why columns is so important i don't know if elf in favor of comms i'm not sure about that but this is why like in 3v3 and pro play comps are so important because you don't see what's on the right side of this ball right he has no idea if we're literally already up for this we could be right here and that's a goal right right here that's already a goal he has no idea if we're there or further back and i just fake the pressure i faked the presents here so he has to hear my boost he has to hear something close by and as soon as i do that he hits it away and then i end up being able to wrap around and get the shot out of it so um that's something that like i'd say that ties in with just baiting so that's just a bait in my opinion biting out the ball betting out a bad touch let me get a goal out of that um but i played these guys only one time they didn't run into me anymore after this game so i wasn't able to get more games but i wanted to like hopefully get two or three and try to maybe get a couple replays out of it because i wasn't recording at the time but one replay would do all right and this is a mistake from them but this is a good good way to use our time here so we have full boost and this is a a really good way to secure that every time you have a chance on the ball you'll be able to do a lot with it make sure that as soon as you get this mid boost you'll see this it's glitched right now but you can see when i get this big boost right here i automatically just hold on to it i don't try to waste it at all my teammate gets a crazy flick by the way it goes to the moon um but i don't waste a single bit of boost here fairy hits this ball to the wall and now i know he's landing behind me and all i see left on the screen is alpha me alpha and the ball so i have time i drive up get one touch swing wide and just bang the shot that's a good use of my time and i know i'm gonna be able to do a lot with this ball because i saved 100 boost i can get the absolute perfect shot top of the net because of that so look at all 54's pv look how tough this is for him to actually deal with right one touch he has full boost as well so he's doing the exact same thing that i just told you guys to do is another very very good pro player gets that back boost doesn't use any of it at all literally just waits because that's going to give him his best chance to save anything i should've known him and in theory he can't save anything i shoot him here take one touch swing wide and bang it just too fast for him to even react even if he could have the boost for it he can't reach it because of how fast it is right he has to literally pre-jump this to have a chance at it just a well-placed shot it's a really good start it's a good usage of your time and that's something that you have to do and choose a lot you're struggling ranking up you're probably not using your time wisely you're probably banging the ball away pretty uselessly and it still happens even in pro play like even at the highest level i think it still happens i i disagree with this touch from alpha in my opinion um but i just agree with a lot of touches that have in general like this isn't gonna do much because barry had just went for boost right there's no way he's gonna be back in time to get a good shot on this circuit fair he's coming from this angle is never really gonna be a good shot so give it a blocker pretty easily in general i think there's a lot of just wasted possession from everyone i don't think there's a single player that plays every possession perfectly this is a really good pitch from alpha he's really good with those ended up being high but good block from teammate i got dammit he actually didn't see what happened in the game let's take a look at my teammates pov really good block from him one touch dodge is the demo which is good oh it takes his time it's like a delayed musty so alpha's pov again very tough spot to be in he's honestly left in a lot of bad spots so far in the first minute of this game a lot of really tough spots to get out of but europe what i noticed well just from this 2v2 game they played very different na in a lot of ways i mean i i don't think this was their their best gameplay their best possible performance but i only played them one time um but what i do notice is like they love to boom the ball they love to play fast and they don't like to fake like a crazy amount andy loves to fake a lot they try to get possession of the ball before making a play eu likes to try to make the play and be super aggressive with it it seems like but you see how like right here i'm playing this patiently i wait for his touch i literally just wait here for a second for a touch as soon as i see where it goes i take my time i swing wide even though that net was open that's what messes up ferry here this that's open and i could go for a shot right here and honestly it's probably a goal but there is a chance that i missed this right so i think the safer play is to do what i did here i took an extra second i let fairy flip back and now he's in a little bit more of a panic position he has to make the choice do i rush him do i bait this do i full-on just wait back and try to save whatever he has for me he does a mixture of three of those things pretty much um he's trying to go like he stops right away tries to go for the bait it looks like he debates whether or not he should go back he kind of does all three of those things right it's a really tough spot to be in and that's what i mean like taking an extra second there really makes his life a lot more difficult he has to flip back quick for this right because there's that chance that i can get that straight up shot taking the extra second and then there's the wind up and the bang and again he has the boost to save it same situations before it has to be saved but the shot's really well placed and it's always going to be a really tough thing for them to get out of in that situation but in general that's a big thing that i think everyone can do if you're at a lower rank is just take your time with your your plays right there's no reason for me to rush this play slam it up the corner wall even just to go for the empty net and rush it and get a bad shot right there is a chance i can get this shot it's a pretty good chance i get the shot to be honest but i'm also unsure of her failures and how close he is to actually getting back onto the screen how fast he's going how much boosts he has stuff like that and i know i'm low on boost and i know that if i make a mistake here and i give them a free possession both of these players are more than good enough to make a play coming back my way and uh they're very deadly in that aspect for sure let's kick off he made it into that's why i'm looking for him there just trying to make sure he'd at least been behind me i saw him jump so i didn't commit to it they say i full boost here and again i'm literally just waiting for the outcomes i'm not trying to push up too far i feel like a big problem a lot of people have is like they overextend a lot as well i try to push up way too far before they know the outcome of the situation it's fine to go for that i'm trying to get like a patrol around him on the ground staying on the back wall here i thought there you go this is a good fight from ferry so again same situation guys exactly what i said earlier this is a tip that every pro ends up doing saving full boost he has full boost here and literally he's not using any of it until he has to and as soon as he boosts a little bit that makes both of us panic because that's a scorable opportunity we have to try to block it we both try to block it it fakes both of us but there's nothing that really comes with it because we block the angle right if they get the shot let me block it and if they don't go for it and we're still not in terrible situations to be honest block the whole net there it's pretty much fine so fairy pov hits it off the wall anything that he can shoot here i have i'm right under it getting some pads here is the smart thing to do when you're off the ball and now i have a chance go for that big boost single jump over the first offender right for ferry flicked it over to second very good job from him that's a very small detail but this is something that's huge so i can very easily like 1v2 them two times over here so i jump over alpha it's a first outplay touch and then shut away here i flick it over fairy and then he goes for the the bump on me makes me land on him so he turns out volcan to make sure he gets it and if he didn't do that i would be able to beat alpha and actually get this goal so that's a little small detail that actually makes a huge difference up for the solo play very deadly any scenarios tries to get the flipper set doesn't actually get it the unlucky again get this boost and i'll use any of it you'll see how patient i am in the situation now let me just wait i'm ready afk it looks like i'm afk but i'm playing the most patient way that i can again not using any boost at all we're jumping this now very dangerous situation and again alpha's very very good in these situations right you see how comet looks from his perspective and how i'm defending that i'm just floating trying to cover any angle nice good patience again just saving my boost it may look like slow gameplay but the thing is it's the best way to play out these situations right i'm saving my boost there's no threat in any situations playing it out of harm's way most of the time and now i can just play patiently back wall again full boost anything that comes my way i'm ready to deal with i try for my teammate playing patiently here and now i can stall this is a situation that i like to stall on a lot because look where coquita is my teammate i'm last back here if i go for some sort of shot it goes bad it's probably go to the ceiling or it's gonna go to their corner and either way alpha or ferry cleans it up and gets a really hard hit back our way so instead i go for a soft touch to the ceiling just to myself and then a little follow-up and then another follow-up i'm gonna go down to the ground here try to pass this back out so they keep possession that whole way and you can see from their perspective there's really not much they can do here so fair would be the next man up on this play he booms it away to himself i get the slow down touch i fake a little bit one more touch one more touch to the wall fake the hard hit play it back middle really good challenge for my teammate press down the whole play and again the pass here is pretty obvious i see it happening i don't know how much boost so i just pressure him again so i just drive up i make him hear me and he has to get the ball up so he jumps early there that's why it looks like he messed it up but i was there to pressure him and i was there to make him worried about me just insta-challenging that you're trying to hit it around somebody again little small details make a huge difference in this lobby and little things that you might not notice if they're not pointed out very good job to control this again look at the time they gave me right if i keep my eyes locked on these players i have no worry here as soon as i see fairy flip away there's no one that can even go for this ball for the next five to six seconds no one at all so if i just take my time here you need to flick this to the left so i end up doing and again very such isn't gonna be perfect if you do that it's a very tough masterpiece you can see how tough it is to read from this perspective and the best case scenario here okay my worry was you see alpha's creeping up i thought he was gonna challenge this so i i flicked it he fake challenged me right there that was a big challenge debate for a fairy which is smart so right play and then he went middle which is actually really good but his whole setup from there was smart um the only thing is the way i clicked it made it really hard to get any kind of good touch that's why i like doing it toward the wall like that it's a lot harder to read but yeah the perfect world alpha challenges this and that means that fairy's not able to challenge because i get this flick over alpha ferry is now not able to challenge the second man most likely because he's not going to want to double commit with with alpha and be all the way pushed up forward like that so that's the best case scenario there uh didn't end up happening they actually played that very well that fake challenge into a pass across even though the past is very hard to get like i said um it was pretty close to working out dude alpha one for you you went for something insane again but look at alpha that's a huge thing i want to keep pointing out for you guys you get this mid boost here he saves it and he just baits this and then he goes middle right away hits us to the ceiling pitches that with the ceiling and then goes for the shot honestly very very good try pass out to my teammate uh lucky so i'm empty now here but i did try to just give him the assist or give myself this sorry try to pass it off to him i tried to read his touch it would have been crazy i tried to pre-jump his touch middle but i think he tried to pass to me as well yeah he tried he tried to try i respect it good recovery here though off the bum yeah obviously i could have discovered that i have a little bit of a comfortable leader now so you can mess around a tad bit but like i said these guys are two of the best players in the world you don't want to mess around too hard or you're probably gonna end up losing as you can see from my gameplay i'm taking the game pretty serious i'm trying to focus on my my decision making no matter how little oh good good idea good idea for sure you can see how tough this is for fairy as well i beat alpha with this first touch and now prairie can't really challenge at all through any of this if i get the perfect flick on this if it goes a little bit faster it's going to be impossible for you to save with the boost that he has big boost still the alpha again one of the best players when it comes to the boost management so it makes him really good in my opinion very good mechanically but the big thing that allows to do mechanical is this right here gets the boost doesn't use any of it it's a very good habit to have it's the best habit to have what the you see i'm doing this game i'm doing it a lot as well it's fine to bring that away i bet you fairies pretty low on boost here he's on zero so again something so simple is just a shot i'm sorry reposition it so much but there's so many little details about this game that i don't want you guys to overlook a lot more than just hitting the ball right rocket league's a lot more than just hitting the ball a lot more than with me ci i think especially the highest level i think there's so many little decisions so many small touches small like even decisions off the ball like fake challenges stuff like that so many little things make such a big difference this high touch eventually probably leads to a little bit of good pressure for us so see how much of a bad spot fairies left and off that and as soon as i can't go for this bar as well here i stopped boosting it's a big thing that i see a lot of people doing they get bumped and they try to keep following this even though alpha for sure has a better position so i stopped right away i know he's gonna beat me and then i use that extra boost to get back even quicker and get some pads instead of going out of the way for the back boost really good single jump 50 here all right this is going to be just straight in so it's a good pitch from alpha honestly a little bit of a mistake for my teammate shouldn't really be a goal yeah that's a good pinch for sure but uh you'll see my teammate's positioning is was kind of off here so he's stopping right here and the problem with this is i mean what he's expecting is to go up the wall most likely but if he just waits on the ground pretty much anywhere if he just took an extra second which is what i would like to do here is just take an extra second if your last man wrap around this way just stay here you pretty much cover everything there's no way like you're gonna get anything from this angle there's no way this ball's to pitch from there into here and even if it hits off the wall over there which you'll see it does look how easy that is to stop right you started just a double jump upward so if you position yourself here no matter what if the ball is opposite of you you'll be in a much better spot same thing if the opposite side positioned around here back post you could say pretty much anything double jump up here you could jump up here your momentum is a lot easier to gain when you're back closer but he puts himself in a pretty awkward spot and he's not able to to get back to it but it was a good pitch and it's something that i could definitely catch you off guard you don't expect that to go straight in right a little bit unfortunate that it bounces straight enough that i think we're nearing the end of the game here though a lot of really good decisions from from both sides to be honest throughout this game that was just lucky to be honest i'm not gonna it's a really good uh kickoff again we're playing against one of the best homeowner players in the world or like at least i don't know if he still plays 1v1 but um beating kickoff like that is pretty hard it's pretty hard to to beat someone that hard on kickoff unless you're trying to like lose it back right and you messed up a little bit i can't tell uh let me look at this kickoff quick yeah literally he was going for background so that makes sense and um you gotta be careful their kickoffs on the best pokemon players they're really really good and they always end up flying out in a bad spot for you so it's good that we're able to win it like this and then i try to just pre-flip to block this extra touch here and i think fairy gets faked by that i didn't try to fake him here you'll see what happens yeah he thinks this is being touched right here he tries to dunk me that would have been perfect if i did make contact on that ball but ends up working as a fake and my teammate can simply walk it in and that's going to be gg then they're believing the game so that's how the game ended off though i think it was a lot of fun playing those guys i actually hope that uh i can run into the more i know i don't qna servers all that often so as i'm saying it's pretty rare pretty rare occurrence and i know you guys like the eu versus na stuff on this channel because uh when i did energy scrims like my team scrims versus bds and bs is the best team in eu um you guys really did enjoy it and i got like 600 700 000 views you guys really did enjoy that content so um if there's any time i could do eu vs n a videos you versus any content and try to analyze how they're playing um i'm definitely gonna do that but in general they're very solid as i expect them to be and i think these are players that will thrive on lan as as does myself i guess like i i really i really do think i play a lot better online but i think the way that they play is so good for for land play it's very consistent it's very solid um there's definitely some mistakes this game that don't normally happen but in general the way they play is very smart it's very solid it's very fast it's calculated as well but it's a little bit different than n a for sure the na style is a little bit different right now and i think it all comes down to how teams work uh teams all work differently they're like different machines the best way to explain it every single machine working a little bit different every single machine having a different strategy to an extent um but there's always some similarities you can pick from each team but either way hope you guys enjoyed like i said uh let me know if you want to see me maybe do some privates with certain players and 2b2s maybe some private one we want to get some certain eu players i don't know we'll see i can i could probably ask some people to run some old ones or something um but yeah i appreciate y'all thank you for those subs support as always i love everything can't thank you guys enough seriously i'll see you guys all in the next one peace the
