yo what's up guys so for today's video it's going to be a little bit different i'm not going to be playing ranks but instead i'm going to be playing a workshop map that i just saw on the workshop it's right here i'm going to be running this map and hopefully i can i could do a pretty good job at it because i haven't done a dribble map or even like a rings map in a long time on this channel so

it's going to be hard easy to be a long short i'm honestly not sure i don't know how long how far forward this goes i can't really tell but i'm assuming that's the end right there so if they end up getting there eventually so let's see how this goes i don't want to waste my time too much already 20 seconds in so let's see gotta hop over these i have never been good at these yeah i always do that maybe i could just go above it is that cheating i mean if it works it works what do i do here wait oh it's a tp i don't know why i thought i had to jump through that okay this is gonna be annoying i had a backflip perfectly that's not too bad i'm trying to catch the ball at the end of the tunnel that's not a problem before it falls off okay so i just got a parkour through this i'm guessing oh way to go we have to go quick wait not that quick i was going too fast okay so there's a tp thing right there it's wondering if you have to jump that gap [Music] drop the ball in here where does it come out wave now what has to get it through that no way dude this is this already seemed like it's gonna be hard i'm on level four did i get it please go in ah i gotta slow down a lot here i think no dude this is already an annoying level for me all right that's fine should be able to get this this part i i'm not gonna do the walls i don't know why just going over it again surely no guys looking rough no i'm panicking now i'm panicking all right we're good we're good drop it in there i just gotta hit this i hit the shot imagine it's a net imagine it's a net and i missed why is it so high man it's so high up there and it has to go fast enough to hit the other thing too all right we got this we got this that's it all right we did it we did it you just drive into this probably all right i think on the the tile stuff i don't even need to dribble here probably but let's try oh this would be okay yeah i don't think you're meant to dribble that corner i think you'd like you could literally just drive next to the ball on it but it's still going to be hard press on the ball first all right take our time here time time is the key to this can't rush off the map it's scary dude you look down just nothingness all right we're good we got it what is this oh it's another one of those parkour ones i like to go down all right restart i'm just trying to rush it man i don't know how quick i gotta go okay i don't have to double jump off that i didn't get a single i went too quick guys i'm making this so hard on myself i feel like i could do this so much slower but i want to make it seem epic i feel like if i do it like a little bit slower than this it'd be still doable dude why am i going so fast maybe maybe you could just jump off that this way yeah dude when is the ball okay i'm gonna slow down at the end the ball just does not come down there but it works it's almost that he wins the race all right we're gonna get in the hole i missed these are hard man oh now what i gotta get in another one no way oh i did it wait i actually did that really quick yeah i feel like that should should have taken me a lot longer so that's good oh okay i'm gonna try to dribble this no i shouldn't i feel like that's just irritable that's for sure yeah no way i'm dribbling that i'm here dribbling this musty i would do something with it there we go all right let's see what i got what i gotta do here pops out the triangle i just airling for this that's not too bad wait do i just shoot this in there or do i air dribble this wow i think i think i have to just hit it in because if i air dribble to it it's kind of hard to start but it's also yeah it's also not possible i don't think because i'm going to go past the the tp oh i got it i thought i didn't get it i was about to say what is this i gotta catch it or something air dribble it midway through something i'm double tapping for some reason what i gotta do here is it literally just getting it over over this wait that's the end why did i go so far i was trying to get it up there why did i go so far where i had it no way dude why is it throwing me off so hard this is good i got flippy set the ending oh i got it that's it wait that was quick i'm actually proud of myself i feel like i haven't done a dribble map like that in a while and a lot of the stuff you're using that you honestly don't use that much in game so i'm surprised that i was able to do that that quickly 45 deaths and around eight minutes that's pretty good not gonna lie i'm done right i don't have to hit this in there something dude this throws me off so hard because the the ball can't keep switching like that it's so hard to even float in the same spot because it just turns wow okay never mind i thought i had to hit it into that for it to really end but this is the end it's kind of cool they left like this room for you to play with have some fun oh but i can exit oh yeah that's the map guys i i hope you enjoy it i mean it's pretty fun i'm not sure this is bi i'm going to check real quick just to give you guys um um you know the map name if you want to use it yourself but it's actually fun if you guys want to see more workshop maps let me know down below which workshop you'd like to see me do i thought i'd have a much harder time with that so i'm proud of myself the map was submitted by highs and it's called intermediate brackets or not dribble map so if you guys want to try it out that's the name uh shout out to heise for a really good map there's a clean map and uh honestly like i said they're much better than i thought i'd do i was trolling a little bit on some parts not gonna lie but it is my first playthrough of it so i'm not too not too upset with that that's the this is the most recent map that i downloaded it's on the very very bottom here so yeah hope you guys enjoyed like i said have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love you peace you
