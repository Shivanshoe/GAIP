before we get into bitter guys as you know we're on the road to 1 million subscribers if we're getting near 750,000 subs which is ridiculous to think about we're almost only a quarter a million away from 1 mil it's just ridiculous so thank you so much for making that possible you guys can help me get even further along the road to 1 mil by pressing that subscribe button if you're one of the people who watch my videos distantly and you're not subbed that's one of the ways you can help massively every single sub makes a huge difference and thank you so much for everyone who's been subbing and all of you that have been here for a long time during the video guys yo wazzup guys so pretty much i'll explain today's video really quick because it's a little bit different than we're used to seeing I have done videos like this in the past but not so often so it might be a very new to some of you guys so pretty much how it works is this there's a big discord server with all the artists players in it and pretty much they can queue up in this server and if you can get 6 people in the queue then we'll have enough people to do 6 man's and how that works is it randomly picks two teams of three and we just play pro lobbies and it's just like screaming the same way we would do with our professional teams except for doing it with other pro players so pretty much in this game or in this series we got ourselves Chicago and gimmick on our team which is randomly picked against Ajax from United Gary G from energy and riddles from Pittsburgh nice and Chicago of course on our team is from g2 eSports so all pro players and it's all randomly picked and it was a really good set of games and let me know if you guys would like to see more of these kind of series being uploaded to my channel and like you'll see there's coms everyone on my team is calming the whole time so a lot of you guys asked me to do videos with pros and cons so this is the best way to do that because they're actually willing to do that no one's gonna play in comms and rank so this is the best alternative so yeah I'm gonna leave you guys here enjoy the video and yeah there's a bunch of good goals coming your way sure right ha so I'll go I'm coming back now Oh matrix step foot on my bagel coffee wall see it's all I got I'm nice back wheel back oh my god I thought I would jump in he would like be over me Just Not Rated okay all right this doing it one bag you yeah just forward come on by me Oh carrot zero puppet good yes my food at their left side yeah yeah I'll try Oh beat me about them I for killin it come on backboard how much it is he's gonna be there yeah Oh bless you you know we're there no there I just ran into his demo no back right oh this [ __ ] please I got a damn idea middle rated you I'll take ya he's waiting for me yes I can't just a [ __ ] okay Oh oh my god I'm pretty up it got it and fifty this one crossing I'll try can't I got the boost I'll try I got no powers up you jump backward locks well you beat I think she actually waited yeah buds come on he's there can't I have zero he's touching really okay you know it's middle okay come up right yeah he's not up how do you show again yeah can't quarter fun things beauty and that's y'all turn little [ __ ] that mister I didn't start it that's unfair just air it up a bit nice ice oh shut up okay like Anika okay do it up I have to wait the what shut I got anything laughter [ __ ] I miss you yeah I'm trying to you both thank forward I just try to get okay I'm waiting very very dude I'm waiting there Bobo oh I'm net full you hear out oh yeah that was correct I think I keep that up so I'm done and I got away from me - you touch it was like pure classics flakes all the way down for you really right going you got Oh shuttle back yet so I'm getting their corner good luck no I killed us I'm gonna spawn a little wing no yeah yeah yeah I'm bid so going yeah jump oh man for shot unless you don't play the left in the corner back let's let's do one riddled Oh get in what no father I should have flicked it early I was in the best party I got ya I'm left run I've done back back market right thing I snow it up no no no what up oh I got it now yeah over [ __ ] yeah I'll be back okay I [ __ ] dead careful I'm not a schmuck trying to children oh I'm sitting at my table here's again weighted I'll go on that you got it fifty yeah okay I need my bank mrs.
