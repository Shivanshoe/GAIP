you know what is the guys gonna be playing some bumpy ones for today and before we get into the games that I'd like to quickly say thank you guys for the incredible amounts of support on every platform but over here on YouTube right like five hundred and sixty thousand something like that's only ridiculous thank you guys for everybody who says every single day thank you so much if you're watching right now on you're not sub you know just click the subscribe button why not alright for the first year plating is dapper is gonna be itself asking deaf are still the one skill dude so let's see she goes the og mashup we used to play each other all the time and back on ps4 it we'd play each other literally like every day I swear you're just really good dribbles so makes it so hard to play get over room there we go the hard part there was getting an overtime to new you challenge it really doesn't want to give me space in a position like that so I saw him turning try to flick it over them and then getting me at the end they're just kind of tough but def knows I faked those a lot so it's only time I'm gonna do it I'm only do it once just to get the ball for free here putting here for this ball shoot he does here I'm not gonna flip she pretty long bish [ __ ] I can do here tell your for the bump somebody didn't get it I thought I'd made contact with them to be honest hit it back that's what other bump me so I slowed down their 150 pretty well he probably scored as well there we go yeah I'll stop adapt like easily top five anyone we wanted easily I still put him up there even that doesn't play as much as they used to you could take on anyone that's in the current top five I'd say probably beat them man just really really good at this [ __ ] game oh he's insane it's always always fun playing them cuz bang this suit it does couldn't quite reach it really good start what effect this one last time if you reads it we should probably will that's why I figured I want to do it again they're just gonna know there's no point it's gonna be over by a bit you might panic though guys gonna grab mid boost maybe even my back boost yeah I should be in a job to counter off of that we're waiting on the replay though I was thinking about doing maybe I wrote a grand champ only one so let me know if that something you guys would like to see down below I have no problem at all if you guys do want to see that I would talk through every single game my thought process and how you guys can improve if you're in the rank that I'm playing against let me know if that's something you guys want to see it probably won't be one hour to two but that's completely up to you guys as well so let me know down in the comments what we wanted to be to you and if you'd like to see it I'm there promenade that's one of the first things I did on this channel every was a road to grand champ so I've no problem bringing it back I was one of the first people for I think I was actually the first ever brought two grand champ on on rocket League eto I started that back in 2015 2016 is my first and I didn't see anybody else doing at that time no one really did you too but the time so I think I one of the first I'd love to bring it back that was a really got my channel started back then I saw that I was decent I go for a still shot here should have waited a little longer it's not gonna result in a counter-attack like this so you don't really want to go for those too often I was gonna save my 12-ish though so it's kind of tough especially against a DAP you don't want to keep his face they're gonna bump me yeah good touch as well I was really good from him I was good all around play I knew he's gonna bump me but you gotta hope he doesn't get that second touch and you got the second touch perfectly so well played gotta be careful though he's gonna come back off kickoffs man if you've always been really good like he winds up like this every time say it's a free go out of them you never really have a super comfortable lead against something as I guess these every time and telling you you got to hold on to boost I'll kick off when you're playing someone like that there we go I don't feel another work just finish it off nice and easy we'll probably play that big game which is good it'll be two really high-level games for this video oh let them bump we have the bump again oh I got the 50 in the boost I get everything in that play I'm gonna go back with this that's fine I got all the beasts see like a bumper me enough one more why not makeup day one for the bump and then cancel out of it what's up let's say you I was a really recovery from debt a shot holy ice flakes you scary men always have been look at this looking at some Lars Stern on net it makes him have to jump which gives me back control of the ball so point why I do that kind of fake jump here sat on to me I like it let me gonna play pop it up make the hard for me to get around this ball and get a shot gives me enough time you have some boost good bump again trying to force me into weird spots right now but he's gonna get to just slightly slightly be faster than where I was forgot the bump on him it's a goal for me there it's not a bad yet to go forward I think I just slightly slightly overdressed now I'm kind of in his head on kickoffs he thinks I'm gonna fake it every time I'm not shouldn't work for this shot the so bad to me to go against he almost missed that could have been a goal for us was is just like a game up margins been slightly missed a shot like I shouldn't you don't wait for that shot I should I stick into the corner I guess see me losing this game all right should be able to score this all right there we go so that made a mistake I made a mistake before that we gave each other goals in that situation so this is what it is good game though that's a very very tough match to win so I'm happy with down with your shirt um yeah hopefully we get him again and it'll be two really high-level games I think that was that was like 16 points he must be high up on a leader where I'm gonna take a look I should put us into the top hundred honestly yourself in one week didn't Deborah Deborah is 9 man but he must wait I got 16 points off of him so he must have at least been tough AHA damn bro he's top 5 that's a root I knew I knew he was playing was like a lot right now but I ain't think I'd run into him so that's pretty good top 5 on a leaderboard right now not too bad at all so that's a big dub for sure and we're still like 40 points off of the top corner spot but that's that's a really good win if you play them again that'd be nice we'd probably knock about a top ten just from one one video if we put him again and beat him yeah pretty pretty solid stuff beating the top 5 once but like I said that's always only been that got it once man so that's always a really tough tough opponent to match up against but yeah I'm looking forward to the potential of maybe a road to grand champs series I don't know if I'll do it into either one so that's that's the main thing I'm thinking about and I don't know how to handle like the lower ranked situations like I've been playing against a plat I don't want to just go for double taps every time so I'll score them like most of the time and then they can't even put the game really so I don't know how to go about that maybe I would try to limit my my skill sit down to what a plant can do and try to use the thinking or the mindset of a pro player that way I'm not doing anything too fancy I'm just trying to be in the right positions that you should be in if you're in plat because you honestly don't need to do too much like you don't need to do anything special in the lower ranks you kind of just need to be in the right position I can kind of show you guys that I think it could be a super super beneficial thing if you guys want you know I could also just sweat my balls off and just beat all the little rings as much as possible it's completely up to you guys let me know down below how you want me to play that out I think it's probably more beneficial and you learn more from it if I try to play more down to the skill set of the rank that I'm playing against but it's completely up to you guys how you want me to play them in a below if you want to see ones or twos for every grand champ and if you want to see me completely trauma best the entire time or would you like to see me match the the rank that I'm playing and try to you know play around them instead yeah I mean that let's see the next game I don't think is dapper I think he stopped queueing after that cuz he lost a lot of points playing me cuz I'm not I'm not in the top hundred but I would say I'm pretty definitely a top water drink once player so it's kind of unlucky for Deb she's not lost that many points to me but I haven't played enough once a season for my rank to actually you know be the same as my my skill level so kind of lucky for Deb in that sense it was a 16 points to me buddy we were not gonna play him again we're gonna play somebody else so we'll see we'll see who we get here maybe there's Deb who knows we'll hope for the hope for the best year but Deb it's nice another intense game I'll take it I prefer it oh we got crazy let's guys solid too put this guy in in twos quite a bit very mechanically it's on the fennec I just faked this ball coming down I go for a terrible now these are very like risk versus reward shots I wonder flips at the end I didn't want to flip because I would have just flipped me into the goal I probably would have missed a shot and they saw empty net play for him anyway so it's not like the best idea to go over something like that patience for him he waited on that almost baited me into messing it up should I stay on this ball tried to bump him you have to be patient there so it looked like he just messed up it on fold but if he went at his full of speed try to block this ball I definitely get the bump on him I'm blocking the path the whole way through that's why you played it more patient that's the right play to mate trying to wait for me to pass him get hit to decide then maybe he can counter on me it was just a really tough spot to be in really shitty does he panics let's save try stay with this I'll leave now because he has a boost there we go my try something cheeky no we're dude if I got the flip that's the goal this is back you got it around me I was a good play for him oh I went for the this like Omega freestyle play there that's like next-level freestyling turtling up the wall it's high level once players in oh I missed the boost I thought he stole it to be honest it was going catch him off and garden cheated us here nice to slow down in his dribbles a lot I said that's going to deal with those vegetables try to be as patient as possible doesn't always work though oh we got the boost he's back we're just kind of tough for him probably his another just wanted them not let to get past me can get to go out of that it's gonna have to here I was letting get a second touch definitely give away possession me eventually you want the boost battle so I never actually gained anything from that it's there would have been my ball and probably a goal for me if you didn't get the boost but now I didn't get the boost but I miss my all that week sir I just feel like ass have us everyone I mean the game like if you're playing ranked man and keep feeling consistent sometimes yeah I don't know everyone will tell you that they feel like slow sometimes or whatever it's all like something they have what kind of experiences it's not like weird if you read let me start feeling slow sometimes imagine I score this oh hey I actually able to hit that I know I was going at it right but I didn't think I get it that fast to go past them I'm messing around a lot this came to go for some dumps up but we're having fun minutes what matters we'd be deaf anyway so it's like we gained the points that even if we lose this game by messing around it's fine we won't lose we won't lose that menu won't be negative for the video I'll slow for like a month I feel that I definitely had time to I feel that way Happy's oh my god almost own gold did gonna kill me I think this is really awkward you get some peds it's just an impossible impossible situation to to like it's a good like anyone knows how to dribble the ball there I have no boost I have to leave him the ball I can't go for a bad challenge day just like a really really harsh spot to be and I can't really do anything they play right so it down to them messing it up I'm just trying for like the dumbest place that that move is just so broken though if you get it it I'll stand by that at 50 right cool I can't do anything about this yeah annoying pretty much a kick I'll go again see officer just super solid minor kind of bad for once every time I say that I score dude I swear it's awesome talk I remember I suppose Austin he's like a bubble player and ice played them like back in 2015 I don't remember ever really being toxic yeah I don't know why yes you know I gotta stop giving me so much space that's like for all like he's getting like a lot of kick off goals like that I should just go in silly that just me not playing enough ones against the way people play down it's actually kind of better than if if the ball I kept dying had as it was I was losing every single battle and it died like that I'm gonna finish its fortunes if I have to make it so serious make it play yeah I could just hit her Freegal alright comes down to the kickoffs here really and his have seemed to be much better trying to stay on this that would be nice let's just straight any but it won't be just launched another one if I get his boost here it's pretty good for us not in on think pretend like I have no boosts gonna hold on to this 20 he messes up we could score if or not they were eating scored on here okay I decided challenge early you're gonna have control here my back off leave us this I just in know so close when you get K off hold on calling it wait we're gonna get the kickoff goal oh this is never good alright this is better wait that's internet go first gonna shot huh hello 50 boom there we go and ten schemes on on the board oh yeah quality stuff guys I was going for a lot of dumps I like fried [ __ ] pink going for it but yeah hope you guys enjoy to have yourself wonderful day or night whatever times in here right now watching
