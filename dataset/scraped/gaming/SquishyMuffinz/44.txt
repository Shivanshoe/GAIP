yo what's up guys gonna be playing some two today with garrett it should be some good game just gonna be chilling hopefully we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right the first game we got ourselves bullseye and tea barista both very good twos players but luckily we have the real garrett gordon in our team i am goat this is this is just peak placement peak performance what more can you ask for out of a shot placement perfection i could have been better but i definitely did uh did throw him off because it was different good demo great demolition from garrett nice little controlled play here i'm gonna wait because it's probably gonna also dribble this ball i'm just gonna go figure it now hopefully this is okay probably won't be yeah in my head like perfect scenario best case scenario just turns for me when that guy is dribbling and he tries to make him flick but i waited too long and the timing was kind of bad at that point like we're both waiting for each other to go but that's like obviously the downside of not having problems i'm just playing like off assumptions everyone's assuming what the other person is going to do that's often not what you expect trying to get in the way just cut it off let's forget oh i didn't even realize that i scored i won't lie i did not realize that's why i like communication especially in pro level is very important like just calling out who's going for a ball like especially when someone has a dribble like that like trying to make it so that the person that's lost back has easier time dealing with whatever situation is that's the most important thing i'd say in pro level any kind of like high level game in rocket league just challenging in a way that your teammate has helped at all times is like always the best thing to do bang bang bang absolutely power shot from garrett there placement and everything perfect take my time right here it's not going to come back for a while so i'm trying to bring this ball to the ground or block them maybe actually well played for me it went like on the right part of the ball so we can actually do anything out of that it's a good b and i have 60 boost so so he takes that actually doesn't matter it's a good shot take the boost let gary go here that's a laggy batch just so i'll be able to get back to this fall yeah i should beat them nice demo very talented uh gamers we are here the game is totally not busted with the demolitions it's totally not a broken mechanic i'm gonna fake go down to the ground get a bump try to bump him as well i can't so it's gonna be hard for garrett but i actually played it pretty well i was unlucky ah i couldn't help him out wasn't my fault i think any time you leave your teammate in a situation where they're alone like that for too long it's not their fault for getting beat in that 1v1 it's your fault for leaving them in that like vulnerable position actually good save you guys going for some crazy shots here i'm trying to stay in front of this ball i know that's all he's trying to do here so if i can keep possession of that keep going over and over again like this it's good you didn't have to go one time there and we were able to yeah that situation pretty good for us i'd say nice good help from gary just in case i would have had it but it was good for them to to be there in case they didn't again always trying to make sure you're helping each other out in those situations you guys can go crazy you're going for the past i wasn't expecting it uh maybe if i got the perfect actually it could have been a goal it was always going to be a little bit difficult good save very fortunate spawn if he's on the other side i would be able to get back or he wouldn't have been able to get back into that but i'm just gonna go for a bump there so i just waited fine dodge his bum take these pads rotate opposite side of the ball that way in most case most cases like if you're rotating out the side of the ball it's going to come to you next it's a good thing to get a habit of doing oh i forgot my flip that's the goal for sure going for a bump i'm trying to be annoying here i could turn on that i can take mid boost so we still have pressure and we got a minute with the two goal lead here looking pretty solid solid rotations good job alright alright good first game very very solid stuff let's get into the next one let's even keep it up get back to back dubs on the day but that's really good good elo as well we got out of x those guys play a lot of twos just get the next one we'll see how it goes all right we got a sweaty end game here juries and t curl two very very good twos players they play very slow they like to control every ball every situation almost started off with the goal right away i got dunked a little unfortunate i have some time here it's just good to control it yo it should be okay and that secret place is like absolutely perfect it was always going to be like a tough situation i did want to follow that but i thought greece would go so i'd rather scare it so it but two of them go for that i think that's worth it auntie girl doesn't have the boost so that's definitely worth it care's going crazy right now but fake oh he was so smart i was actually really good play for him the fake on the pass it was really good and he gave me the option mid right so i should use it it did look sketch i definitely could have just soloed but i have the option there i'm going to use it at least fake out of it or at least like make it more difficult on the opponent in some way you're trying to install them in any way possible it's good yeah you don't want to be giving garrett uh a free ball in that scenario you don't want to be giving gear if you bought like that i feel like most of the time you're going to slot it even on his bad days he hits that ah i'm lucky there's an awkward awkward position i think he thought i was gonna roll up better for him and didn't that's okay not a big deal at all it's a really big 50 yes ago again now didn't have to get one more time oh i messed up nice good save oh you ended up panicking a lot maybe a double middle you could save from them he's gonna play this back get all the boost as well actually really good from garrett touch off the wall to himself he backflip to keep his positioning so he didn't like flip too far toward the corner he wouldn't be able to follow it up again the backflip is huge there and then you got a very soft touch that can follow up obviously it was good presence of mind for me to like turn on it but really well done from garrett mark from greece doing back all day he just jumped to the backboard i say from here nice just forcing him off the player pretty much they're like i couldn't really do much detail just baiting plastic i know they like to do this kind of stuff so it's like pretty easy to counter if you know what they're doing people are baiting really heavily like that kind of just driving up to make you force the ball away but some people do a little bit too like excessively it becomes like pretty easy to read and for the bump there game might actually be in a really bad spot i believe in him though this is very tough very tough situation too to get out of saying the sugar back right it's good save looks so easy that people defend nowadays like i'm gonna go every time way back obviously but like a year ago i feel very very smart how they choose to defend things good job from garrett waiting on that i'm trying to grab the mid-bc actually really good delay touch from garrett softly like that's almost always good uh left minute 1v1 here good into the challenge should be okay i think i don't have any boost here but i can try to do something with this i shouldn't leave it for him see what he does i i can't believe that worked i could not believe that worked a lot i know i couldn't get a past middle and if i did try to force them past the middle it would have been bad so i just waited fake i know i had no boost too so i can't really do much has to be some force touch middle i'm gonna sit on this i'm not gonna go just wanna like scare him into making that flip play right and there's gonna be back wall so anything that he does will be covered anyway here's a little wall dashes from garrett there's moving different today i play like really slow and weird for him let's let him control this nice well done good game actually both really fun gear played really well as well always fun playing again the two sessions we've had like for i don't know six years now always been some of my favorite out of anyone throw it so very very fun stuff as always hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is like comment subscribe to see us on the next so
