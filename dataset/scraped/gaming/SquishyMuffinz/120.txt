yo what's up guys going to be solo queueing some 2v2 games for today should be some games let's get into it steven get some dubs see how it goes all right the first game guys was oath against sky and expert see how this goes also i don't think i could do a road to ssl series anymore they've made some announcement where they don't want creators to do that anymore they can apparently ban for it so i don't really want to get in trouble or anything that probably won't do it i might ask someone at sonics about it about the specifics i'm not 100 sure but i would love to do one again that's actually what started up my whole channel way back in the day 2015 doing a rhodo grand champ seriously back um so i'd love to do it again if i can but we'll see got to figure out the the specifics on that i'm not sure as soon as i know though i try to get around to doing one figure it out i would really like to do it though if i can i'll be patient here one more touch beat two should be a goal could have been probably won't be anymore fortunate i can't go for this one either try to turn on the wall here get a good touch back in bump the last guy back there we go good try on the shot wait for his next with the middle here if he wants to use me good job really good pressure there honestly my team is kind of just going over and over and over again um he's cutting a lot like rotation wise so i'm gonna try to just let him ball chase and i'll try to be more passive i don't mind having to play passive but you're playing what someone is playing like how my teammates playing you have to kind of adapt and play the opposite way let them have this now i like staying on the level normally but again i want to let them have the ball when i can get off the back wall good job hit it to the side wall there be back on full boost to my time fake jump that's fine i still have a possession here he has no boost so really nothing you can do on that best shot i could have gotten a situation not back so i could steal his boost off of it it's fine i'm not going to back up i was going to my teammate went decided not to take the other boost to another probably really boost starving situation a little bit over click the boost again past middle go for a bump bump again might be bad it might be bad off that we'll see yeah it is unfortunate he may not get the touch that he wanted it's actually a very good situation for us if he was just a little bit patient but he ended up going it's okay it happens i should have just played a little bit more patient though they're both boost starved the only way they get to go to that the only way they have a good advantage in that situation is if you you dive at a challenge that you shouldn't let him get that boost take the other one should be fine put it around one here he's gonna wait could leave a good opportunity for me to make a play unfortunately get that boost still be able to get back it's very awkward i'm gonna go for the touch here i can't really forge it passes this is a really good situation for us can't go for that though didn't use this flip he used a double jump so take a little bit longer than normally would have to get the pass across it's a good challenge good shot hold on well done well done you gotta flip out of the the first touch and then took it well one of the few ways that ball is actually scoreable missed a boost but it's fine we still want to be relevant in this play and my teammate can get that mid boost anyway i just gotta challenge this pretty much over me it's fine it's gonna be backwall should have been backwall should be fine though most times that situation you want someone to challenge the the low touch and the one to be back all in a good position i'm gonna pass this middle there we go and try to use my teammate wall there it's an opportunity to pass middles better than going for a shot better than going for the selfish play normally works out quite well if you do it right there take the boost from him he's gonna be low he just cheated so he has to go back i know that  the angle here let me get a double couldn't quite but it's fine try to get one that i can follow up on the wall i'm again gonna go for a super risky shot again the only way to get a goal there is if i dive very aggressively still gonna be tough to get out of situation but okay well that's unfortunate teammate didn't trust me at all i'll get that i would have had it whatever easy save put aside then i got bomb unfortunate though a little bit of lack of trust there look like well took my time tough situation a lot tougher than it looked to get out of that hit it around them i don't want to go for a shot there actually can't shoot with them challenging like that so hanging around the best bet teammates should be patient here i probably should have been savable as well i'm not gonna lie it wasn't the best shot from him it was well played to get another touch on that but it wasn't the craziest shot i should have been savable he might have just thought it would be better than it was gotta position a little bit that's okay i'll be left side if he wants to use me going alone again wait for his touches teammates going solo a lot like that you just wait all you could do is just play patient around it i could've taken that touch better but you would have saved it regardless i don't mind that situation too much play around one block the other it's a good play teammate should have a play forward here finish hold on good counter good for save there too from the defender nice touch from oath i'm gonna bait this now gotta make him throw this away put in a spot where they can't get anything crazy out of it should be game there we go i don't dive in aggressively on that i don't give them a chance to get some unlucky 50 50 to go straight into our net right so you're trying to play that the safest way you possibly can i think we did that there good first game against the next one tv keep it up get back to back dubs on the day let's see how it goes all right we have the same teammate for the last game see if we can do it the back to back wins here let him touch that that's fine get the back corner boost i'm gonna go for the mid here there's a solo place there's no danger and i'm getting like an immediate counter attack touch down to the ground here go for a 50 that's fine it's around me here's my teammate of three balls i don't really mind that too much i went for the the musty almost worked he made almost slotted it i'm gonna bait this and make him flick it it's fine i'm just in the ground again sit on the ground two fifties play off the right for my teammate job i play patient on this ball it's gonna bounce and i have time to let it bounce and come up to me guess it chase me down and go for a demo make the flip reset go for 50 instead get pages for my teammate i'll be middle if he wants to use me good fake actually like that i have to be patient there's actually a chance of time against the bump but we can square off that it's fine i don't mind that bump should be good for us actually you guys are gonna be out of position for a second it's a good 50. he may have to play a little bit patient here feel time for me to get back good job in i don't know how we'll watch this back i have no idea how this went in i don't think he was even trying to score i'm not gonna lie wow yeah he was not trying to do that but it just him so we'll take it sometimes you get fortunate sometimes the unfortunate you know you take what you can get when you can get it get my time here edgar was so now he was under me trying to bump so as soon as he goes oh i was gonna try to go back down to the ground that time but it's fine so have it set aside yeah as soon as i saw like i leave off the bump that's when i was gonna go down to the ground and take my time made him back off very very tough spot to be in it looked like my teammate was gonna get a bump on him or something i could have actually challenged at any point during that would have been fine but if my teammate goes for a bump and i challenge it hits into him there's a weird 50 50 that happens so it's a very awkward spot just because that team was behind him if he wasn't behind him i would have went it would have been fine probably just made it very awkward not a bad idea from him he just couldn't reach him the whole time so i was kind of in a state where i was wondering if he's going to be able to get the bump or not and there's no real way i can get the save after that it's fine if he goes for this yeah he missed as well touch would have been bad either way i don't know how he hit that backward i played around them it's fine one of these touches i'm not using any of my resources really and the touches aren't like bad for us at all the end outcome i'm gonna try to always save your boost for when you need to make a big important touch right unfortunate i said sometimes you get unfortunate sometimes you get fortunate you gotta hope that the unfortunateness of that uh 50 doesn't end up in a goal here hip-hop from him it's gonna go quick played over two round to the ground i can't actually shoot off this so i put these fine don't mind that i'll bump them as well i'll bump the other guy maybe would have been a goal if i bumped that guy's close okay i took my time on the shot there better than rushing that i don't have to rush it i have no pressure on me no one's challenging me take the time place the shot while we did you could even go for a double tap there if i really want to but that's probably more stable to be honest more readable than where my shots going better block them i can't go for a goal and i can say my boost if i block them as well which is good mind if i die there spawn back left really good fifty job i'll play to a play slow down there in the corner so i got the back boost here killed some time here in the air dribble that's fine so 50 boost giving us the ball for free as well really good situation for us i can bait this out i'm just gonna show presents make him touch it make him panic a bit it's fine i leave it you don't get points for something like that but it's such a good thing to do that's why i like doing it game doesn't think you're doing anything but it's more important than if you're challenging that ball a lot of time one more to my teammate should take it now maybe a double good try it's fine try not to get demoed here situation's fine actually prefer he chases me there leaves him very bad spot after the fact most of the time i can panic again just baiting it out i don't need to actually commit to these challenges he's going for a bump still doesn't do anything nice go for a bump on the last guy here let my teammate 1v1 fine i can get the boost i can't really do much of this but i don't think should be fine chance of him getting a goal of that is so low almost almost if you left it for me it was definitely a goal without had enough power to speed it up or first solo play that's fine i thought it was a pass originally so i went let's go go against us should have been more patient i guess that's all i've been trying to do with um without my team right now because he's playing very aggressive i've been trying to just play super patient around it because you can't also play aggressive with someone that's playing the way he's playing well like like something like that something a little like that if he left the ball gonna be a goal every time stop the pass nice good job good job back to back dubs we'll take it we'll take it sweaty games that's a good example like if you have a teammate when you're solo queueing or you know playing in whatever rank you're in that's playing very aggressive try to play around them don't do what they're doing don't get upset the fact they're going for the ball a bunch of times or only going for solo plays not passing stuff like that try to just like play around and play safer cover up spots where they might turn a bunch of times like try to just be in good positions to cover the field stuff like that's very important this can be obviously though i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love you peace you
