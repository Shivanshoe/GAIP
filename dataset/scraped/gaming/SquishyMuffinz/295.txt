cuz we've been doing the road a grand champ but I can't score series so this is one of the first videos back since then so it's gonna be weird but it's gonna be definitely a welcome change I can't wait to actually score some goals 450 out let's get into it and let's try to give you guys as many tips as possible and what we wanted meaning because I haven't played this game on in first ever it feels like let's get into us you know it guys all right for the first gamer playing gets boring tragedy I played this guy before I know he likes to do a lot of those flakes the same flick every time so you gotta be careful when he has space for sure it's a dangerous place thought to have to play against should be wide dangerous 50 there but I made it out alone gotta watch his demos well he likes to bump a lot when you have control on the ball and you play super aggressive in general what a pretend like I've done a much busier try to running a little bit of a mind game on them I paid for him kind of faked them on that second turn there and her give me the ball try to boom this oh that miss I swung too wide where's a tough angle about I should have it for sure I just brush it a little bit I didn't need to use a problem there it's like hey play this offense like super slow tries to beat you in but we know he's doing it every single time you just got to play it smart I think I've played this guy in my 1b1 Reggie greenchem series I don't remember it was him exactly but name sounds familiar I got the gold back it's got to be really careful on on defense though I can't give him too much space Thank You Veni one who's good at dribbling too much space in one's so that's gonna be our main game plan for the challenge really I go for an edge of a bump or some sort of air dribble play here I'm not gonna bump nap because this position is really good I get the flip pretty set a position on the wall there the issue with that is if you should I go for the air dribble bump but he could just jump off and flip into you and there's a chance that you get lucky you fly into their net the ball goes off the backboard it's a side wall and you can get a counter-attack pretty easily so they're decided to change I decided to cancel out of the air dribble bump there I didn't think that was the best play that situation and I went for the flip you said instead better to shoot that so he does got his boost which is good I don't think it give us a quick one about there I try to get a touch up the wall like I just pop the ball to wall with me and they go for an angel or something but he went instantly with no Boosh as well he only had like 20 I think two pads be surprised if you get certain time I did should be able to get back that was just stuff to turn in quickly those are those little pop that's where he's very um very like 2016 placed I'll be honest the way you place the the crown pinch as well it's very 2016 it still works sure but you could tell where you play the same things every single time nice I made two pretty pretty big mistakes this game doesn't give up goals I could have played them both situations much better and I could have already gotten quite a few more goals I'm just slightly off as they miss another one don't worry just a warm-up I haven't played a game today my hands are freezing cold so I take a little bit let's see we can do with this there we go I'm missing the easy ones but I'm scoring the hard ones so counts I can't really your first shot in this I'd be careful is shot see if you can do you bake them to be free to go can I score this one what spell did me and empty Nets and wimpy ones my worst nightmare that's where I have to take him as slow as possible I'm a problem game the empty Nets just scored them all right do I miss this one there we go in threes I have no issues scoring empty Nets did in in ones for some reason I can't hit them I don't know what it is no way I'm doing the impossible right now I've hit like three minutes in a row this is going credibly well you're slightly slower on just kick often me so today we're gonna win super hard for him or when super hard for me depends on what I do really I missed the boost here but I think I just committed a shot either way I said I'm and I'm going for the boost wouldn't really have been too relevant there I just wouldn't needed to wave - I gave him a second to challenge me but he hesitated I made it possible to score all right we're running away with this game there we go we got a quick 4/5 there I could have played much better like their goals I gave up or we're really bad on my part can't lie to you and the a lot of chances I could have probably finished as well but he played well we might buy two more games depends on how quick the next one if the next one's quick or defillippo - if it's a longer game that might be it for the video but good first game though a lot of goals like I said couldn't if we played better but is what it is got the one about the wizpig better than the second one let's get into it yeah alright Robbie get some merch I'm not sure who this is well you find this game instantly so he means is around my rank should be around my rank I'm correct see if I can get for flippy there we go you're way to start off the game you didn't Dominus you gotta have a lot of confidence to go for stuff like that and ones that feel like it to be like super confident your durability what you can do on offense if you're going for those risky plays like that so I don't recommend everyone does that but if something if it's something you know you could score every time there's no point of not trying your enemy and yes sometimes that'll backfire but you know you never know if you can do it unless you try to do it sometimes I know everyone is the best place to try that because end of the day you're not screwing over your to be two or three or three teammates if you suck at what you're trying I mean just you it's a good place to practice and you know add new things to your are so playing at this boost might be able to get out of this just really tough spot to be in I must say the rest of my bouche f30 so I can use it to get through this one there we shadowed in a decent distance away from him that way we can get back to the shot there I would have liked to have turn a little bit earlier I think after I baited out the shot because it almost got a scored on not being able to get back there how'd you play you play for me I made a mistake though I shouldn't have challenged again that's just half up out of that situation cuz he's gonna have to go toward my goal right I could still lay them for as long as possible get it over my control how's he gonna get 50 I was really really tough to do it's nice to be sated with it really well I'm you're able to cut at the end and get the flick try to stay on this go we have some space with the ball now you know he has to back off and we see him backing off a little bit and I know he has low pitch just to go from mid so we have that little gap of time there try to make some sort of play happen even killing some some seconds off the clock there's not bad when I have a lead but again I want to extend my lead ah backflip I show that pretty easily it was a good flick but I was in a good position to get it I shattered enough decent spot come on 10 booster so I kind of want to save this and use it one necessary for the flick there we go that was enough to get us a pair of you needed the saying that close to the ball makes them have to wait for me right because he doesn't know if I'm gonna go for a quick shot there I've quite a few options so use those options to your advantage nice again I have a lot of options here my line I'm hit it back to me maybe it's fine should win this boost battle in the second boost battle and you can't do much with this snow so I can just go for the third boost you have to back off but that's just cute 1/2 the back off so I can go for some sort of a dribble play here we go nice let me set off there dribble that's super hard for him to stop because I have I flip until he challenges as soon as I saw him jump by I can use it right I might flip that entire time falling down there just a good good contact on the ball at the reset not sure I took my time again this is a position where I know he's not gonna want to challenge it's just such a scary place to challenge because if it goes badly you know almost 100% you go you're getting scored on there if that gets 50 dr. wall badly take him back off I'll go for power shot now oh yeah those little movements that when they're watching your car like that you just drives with the ball make them to think you're gonna get a power shot when you back off it makes them give you that space this is a really tough thing to stop I don't know I stop what Siang shot maybe if I can get a good touch nice I tried to delay it like I was gonna go for and then I backflip at the end try to like fakie right here good try you almost got the double save there really good try my friend she smiles she's like secondly I wonder what he's talking about I'm on the double reset most people I talk to the land make me smile humble kind of hard to remember you say I love meeting a lot of you guys I'm singing a lot of you guys like this people that I don't like meeting but every one of you you don't hit me as well as a pleasure lens on my favorite parts of land just me and everyone that watched me consistently and they're always so nice double tap I would do one more but I feel like more going games are so long like these games honestly feel like there's so much longer than normal games so I think the two games you played today are are good for one video and I could play some more ones if you guys liked this video I could play some more one in the next what a two back-to-back 101 videos 7 played once in a while but YouTube stuff but it's been two good games I'm playing better this one for shared and last got some good flip resets it's so nice being able to score again though first game was a huge warm-up came for me feel like I could hit the ball half the time the way I wanted to at least I could hit it I can recovery can I save it they up number reset second flip say up no recording alright that's gonna be it for for today's video guys I hope you enjoyed got three or four things I think three really good flip resets today so not too bad considering we were plates you're great in the first game we gave up some goal depression they've been but end of the day we got some good goals and we had fun so it counts so I hope you guys enjoy dope you guys learned something today and I'll see y'all in the next one I promise here to play one more video at least of what we want then we'll get back to some twos maybe queueing with a pro we'll see yeah I think as felt supported they appreciate y'all you're the absolute best make sure to LIKE the video if you enjoyed
