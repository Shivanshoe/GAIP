yo what's up guys for the last two videos i did a hoops video a drop shot video and today we're gonna be doing a rumble video so let's get into that see we get some dubs see how it goes all right we got rumble on this map with the ramps i actually didn't know this map was in this the old neo tokyo this actually used to be in competitive play those of you that are new players this map used to be played in ranked way back like years and years ago five years ago probably and they removed it because enough people complained but i think the idea of it's cool it's just the rams can definitely get in the way and be a little bit annoying at times for a competitive play at least i think for this mode it'd be okay good start from them they had the the goat power-up spikes ran in bullets everyone's just messaging me about two minutes ago nice plunger i think this is actually oh yeah i don't know how i feel about the the ramps honestly like if they brought ramps back it's actually like comp games oh there's a good boot from him they brought ramps back actually would be pretty cool i think but it'd be a big uh adjustment period for it for sure let's go bump them into it all good this really does feel super hectic though just because the ramp i think it makes it feel worse than usual rumble because normally rumble feels pretty bad but like a whole uh on a level after the bounce you must should be able to go nice i've only gotten a good power up to yet so hopefully we get a spike or something not only much i can do with the ice oh boy oh boy a teammate's coming full speed with his uh his spikes toward the goal here oh good what can you do alrighty a lot of time all good all good this has been uh as chaotic as you'd expect rumble to be oh oh my oh my alrighty all good i got spikes at least can we do anything with it see i am getting teleported all right well look for a moment to actually be able to hit the ball here it would be nice all good all good all good oh no oh no all right i mean tornadoed by my squad member all good all good and then i get landed on right there very cool punched into my net all good all righty four goals down i don't know how we got into this predicament but we're here and this is this is my life and we're keeping this in the video because i don't have time to record another oh what just happened i'm crazy i actually don't know what happened i'll be honest wait i 50 this glove with my thingy wait flippy set double nice clean actually really cool nice all right we have wait two two four four four looks cool we actually can come back maybe potentially i'm not gonna get my hopes up but it is doable the magnet how do i use this thing i don't even remember like the freeze made it hard to use there but did the rams actually make this like really a lot harder than should be no i'm stuck man no way i'm stuck what a shot almost oh damn my team is touching it all right we have some time here all right well he i was gonna score it but he switched into me as i um as i shot it so he ended up ongoing all right comebacks almost made almost almost made here dude that does not bounce like normal i'm so used to that bouncing so much better when you do that oh no getting launched around here oh oh good oh it's gonna be a goal isn't it oh that's almost crazy i must pass to himself ah there's always something that just messes up the shot last second in this mode i don't know how to use this to shoot i don't know if it's possible too keep hearing someone jump behind me so i'm just trying to let them go and not cut them off so many scenarios maybe it would be better for me to just go but fine oh this is crazy close i didn't mean to do that i think that helped them i save i have 30 seconds only had boost man i should have been so good doable now or never now we're never ah it's never it'll be never for today maybe tomorrow we'll win potentially it'll be possible maybe next game we'll see the start of that game was was rough that was rough oh good these extra modes have been not treating me well but one more game let's see if we can end up here right for the last game we have hyper genix w bw kid amperage gumbo and sorry boosted this guy's boosted all right in that case we should be able to win this if he's truthfully boosted i should say that for the last guy oh man we're actually on a normal map though i'm dead we're actually on a normal map though which is nice that's just in my net oh i cannot get a boost oh good i'm dead again universe is really really testing my mental fortitude these extra game modes what the hell i know what's going on middle maybe oh boy oh man got me uh on the edge of my seat it's a very exciting gameplay this is more stressful than lcs yeah i give that guy a boost i didn't want to i wanted to give the guy in the air boost but he would have a plunger he would both my teammates went for that too no way now nervous could definitely be a factor i've had a lot of people in this game say they're nervous playing with me or whatever could definitely be a factor why these games have been difficult but it's cool i mean i remember when i was first like playing this game and i ran into the first pro that i played with i was like freaking out a little bit too and i was like wow this is crazy it was it was so cool i think i played really bad too so i get it i've been there i didn't mean to do that it's gonna go for my teammate since he wasn't have some time here oh nice just so cool the normal flip reset i thought someone would like kick me away or something so i kind of rushed to flip i didn't need to i could have waited a little bit longer yeah normal map definitely uh it's a lot better for me in terms of muscle memory and stuff oh okay i think that's the guy from last game who went crazy another team as well yeah there was oh man good try good try all good all right nice a lot easier to do that on normal map or you don't have to go up a ramp it's also why that map is kind of flawed i think it's kind of hard for people to get like a double tap or any kind of normal play just everything is a lot harder on that map with the ramps like that i should have a hard time hitting this probably just going to be a goal i couldn't get a shot over them but it's a good try try to kick this guy when he goes oh actually close for full boosting like that is actually really close i got a good lead though two goal lead two minutes left still losable for sure it's not loseable but pretty good lead okay left well that's actually a good idea i know i had my flip still too let him hit this you just go back well i think that's scorable if i hit that hard enough i feel like that was horrible awesome vehicle probably really hard for you yeah really hard for anyone to defend that if you have no like boot or kick or like anything that can like disrupt him it's really really hard do you also look like he had no boost as well there's like no chance we'll try to see if they just roll the ball to me and maybe i can get a play off of it i obviously have like a really big advantage before the abilities come up so if i can get myself in a spot like before they can freeze the ball to actually have control oh my god i could probably score most of the time i was trying to do that but almost worked it took a little bit too long to get control the ball though this is good this is like prime situation i'm for like the perfect angle though all right well my team started stepping it up i'm like crazy here we go lead down minute left could be pretty hard to lose this i would take a pretty big blunder actually crazy that's actually really cool got to run all three fake the first one jump over the second guy recovered their dribble really well it's really hard to get back around it got enough speed over the third four goal lead now you get fake nice well done we're actually where i'm in this game this fake is really smart he has to block that angle that's a good 50 computer on that whose engine noise is annoying far down that's him nevermind didn't realize both of them are afk i looked away right as kickoff happened i i almost always do that they never expect but we are up by a lot of goals so it makes sense the defendant said jump to the wall touch around one maybe all right i'll use the last like 20 seconds just to say thank you guys for all the
