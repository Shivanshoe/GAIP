before we're getting to the video guys as you know we're on the road to 1 million subscribers and these last two weeks have been insane every single day we're reaching between 3,000 and 5,000 brand-new subscribers which is just it's crazy to look at so thank you so much guys for being a part of that and you guys are watching this video right now when you're not subscribed head down below the channel press that subscribe button help us reach 1 million subs before the end of the year I appreciate you guys more than you know enjoy the video love ya yodels up guys in the previous video we finished off at champion 2 division force you know what that means if we win two games today we will get ourselves into champ 3 which is super super solid that means we're only like a hundred points away from grand champ at that point so super close to ending off this road to grand [ __ ] and you guys have really been enjoying every single episode so I appreciate you and all the feedback I do read all the comments guys and I appreciate that a lot of you guys are enjoying the series and anything like it when when you see everyone get toxic for some reason you guys really love when people get toxic which is interesting to see pretty yeah let's let's get into the game for today alright they're playing against - chiptunes in a champ 3 you can't use another team so we'll see how youngbae Rock does try to beat up that ball it's gonna be awkward for your last guy back to finish it off pretty easily that's just a matter of reading the game hey I got tell us about the awkward form so it started gonna be a week he lost all his momentum he stopped did a very simple double jump so I'm coming in from the side with momentum I'm definitely gonna be this teammate who's not gonna be expecting a bad touch I just a free girl at that point I go for this ball I bet he's gonna go on the wall for it so it's gonna be a free goal because I think d-roc was expecting his teammate to go up the wall quick and I just want quick view I know I could beat him because like I said that that golden rule you're close to the ball you're probably gonna get there first like 99% of the time unless they're on the wall that's the one of the main exceptions to the rule if you're on the wall you are faster than if someone's on the ground I'll play this off the wall for my teammate should have a shot off that good try good job room to wait middle that's the main thing I like about that gonna go back here yeah I'd love to do a road to great shape and once was it what I think I'll do the next series in but the next series is more of a challenge than like super serious and educational but it'll be fun for you guys to watch for sure but also trying to show you guys some things and one of the main things I'll show you is how useful like face challenging is in 1v1 the amount of times you can get the ball give it away to you for free just it's crazy if you fake challenge to the right spots you can like destroy people who are dribbling you there always second-guess themselves then you can switch it up and start actually challenging when I think I'm gonna fake challenged everything is super cool to see the my games you could run in and when we wanna place one more over them there's one more touch the drachma teammate to to be there I could do anything crazy I'm just gonna pop us up once and I might ride of this place off the backboard okay nevermind oh god dude I can't I can't get myself to like here like I wanted to go out the back but then I when I was doing it my brain just like you can score this so score it and then my fingers just did it without me wanting to I was trying to hit it off the backboard like I want like I was attending to you and then as I saw that it was shooter boys my brain instantly to try to shoot it like have no control that's what I mean this is such a hard team for me to do it I don't know I don't know how to like get yourself to just stop doing that stuff I've been doing that like not for the entire 11th doesn't have like 11,000 hours in this game so every situation that that I see I've seen it a lot of times right so my brain naturally just knows how to react each situation like in this series I'm trying to do things a little bit differently but I've seen that situation so many times I brain knows what the most like effective thing is to do in a situation in most cases so I can't really control that I turn that aspect of my head off like that - man ah you shouldn't make me annoying but it only speed because I want to do less but it's hard to do less especially when I know these guys are capable of this so it's even harder they could not capable of that every single time but I'm sure they've done something like that at one point in their career disgust checking my profile on a person I don't know this is it's it's hard but it's kind of more excusable because we were playing champ threes now and they're almost grand champs just one more time one more time yeah I'll try not to do is watch the rest of scam I try to just bump and set my teammate up a lot QA I missed again I'll just fake challenge I faked out over time she does I see the speech for my teammate I'll just roll this one in yeah but there that guy is so much based on the ball I take challenge twice and it made him just give it to me for free and then my teammate beat the last guy up who shouldn't have went because my teammate was closer and like I said you follow that rule on defense you'll almost always always be in the right position to defend a lot of the times especially in these ranks one of the bigger mistakes you'll see people going for ball is that they're definitely getting beat see the guy focused over here no one should he shouldn't be in such Allen geing me they like the guy who returned I haven't fully focused on him if he drives towards the ball and then backs off I don't flick this over him and his teammate doesn't expect him to get beat there so he can like fake challenge me and then back away and that wouldn't be a goal so it's a lot of just offensive decision-making really like these girls aren't aren't hard to defend necessarily it's more just warrant like doing the right things and restorations if you should fake child reading here why is he give me all this space to just line up a shot when we could go toward me and make the painting anyway I said I would stop trying to score everything but I just can't do it dude these last few like episodes are just gonna be complete messes and I'm still giving you guys tips like these are very important tips I'm giving you especially the chat like the challenging stuff is probably the most important tip of this whole series fake challenging and whenever the coach to the ball probably don't go those are the two like most important tips that will help you defense so much like seriously even theirs even grant players I couldn't use those tips for sure but I see the grain shape all the time going for balls that they should not be going for and yes sometimes you go for a ball like that it pays off because the person who's much closer doesn't expect it but you don't really want to do that teammates roasted me even though he's asked yeah I need a champ three player so I probably thinks he's he's nuts but to be fair you're probably beating like Logan chance right now for finding them shy passes back to my teammate nice touch around let's go that's the play baby nice little passing player my teammate there I don't know if he was looking for me there to be honest but I was there for the option and look like he was trying to shoot if I'm a hundred percent honest with you but that works sure well like I said I always position yourself middle for situation like that even if it is a bad shot I'm there for the outcome of it to me good patience oh dude out of them nuts I finally get it off the backboard take his boo shoot [ __ ] kills guy let's be big they've given up I think at this point dude it is fun though man like also I saw a lot of you guys telling me like after I had recorded a lot of the first few episodes that in the last 30 seconds they want me to go like full sweaty and just go for much of cool stuff that's how I'm gonna do another series after this we're really playing what we wanted I'll just go for a bunch of I'll just try to like make it as stylish possible but there's gonna be a big twist to it may be a huge huge trick to but to be a lot of fun trust me so just wait on that I mentioned in the last two videos yeah be patient with me you guys we really like that series I think okay this game is over he's gonna give up but yeah I mean they're already losing about a lot and then apparently the champ three guys roasting his teammate which isn't very good he probably mad because you lost champ three after that I'm guessing probably just got champion is gonna lose it anyway we got 90 points off that every win the next game will be in the camp 30 so let's see if we can get the back-to-back wins and keep up the streak and I wonder how many games gonna take us to get the grand champ like how many total games in a row winning I'm guessing it can be like 26 or 28 or something I don't know many we're at right now it may be something like that I'm guessing who knows anyone's get to the next game and online I played a better Platts what trash Jesus alright so let's get a little hostile let's get a nice game and see if we can keep up the streets good oh my goodness alright so this is this is a big lobby dude please everyone in here is like really hot right you guys are almost low grant my teammates almost look really guys almost agree in shape see how they react to certain things I like they didn't panic there he's trying to go for an irritable set off the wall but again he's closer so I'm not gonna panic to that so rule that stand against every single player you ready playing pros they're closer don't go gonna get beat almost every single time please hit it over him all right I could turn on 950 yeah be careful shot there let's pick up in just the case shouldn't be in nice pitch for my teammate you can tell there's a big big gap because you see already between these players and players we were just playing against going off the ceiling after wall Timmy should go for this can be a little bit hard for him oh wait for Nick stuff she's close she's needed off the wall oh she had to go there I should really kill this guy put the pressure okay so he he's facing the ball ready so I should just wait it's fine he may panic a little bit that's okay I'm gonna wait here it's going to word them so he's an updated back to me I'm trying to fake them that way you make it turn it across let's say I go for the be sure it makes a life a lot tougher on thief it's not because I can't challenge me so I'm gonna go hi I know one of them's lib douche I'll take this ball hi that's gotta have a tough time dealing with it actually a really a touch for situation he was in you get past my teammate though does have a lot of pressure and again we're spacing ourselves up well to the point where we could follow up on they touches pretty solid stuff get delicious mighty mega kill from us you have a shot here ever 101 now try to go for a bump on them oh good follow-up so that was really good from his teammate to come back and support him there this shot was done my teammates slotted him home dude so their fighters actually closer to Grand Champions grand champ last evening to see this one grand champs title my teammates playing solid take my time here I just bump me to Mars the boost should come back I'm from touch he is closer like I said I'll just wait big challenge him until he eventually gets the ball all right well Nadia I messed it up so bad I was trying to pre flip it to that and get like a good fall out of touch but just gave them a free shot but don't worry it looks like I'm actually this rank all I think that second touch on these I was normally in high rank someone follows it up instantly they actually didn't that time good patience for my teammate there you're waiting for your touch you touch it gonna be bad and then all you have to do is just walk it in vitam tune it at that point I'll take this up the wall here I'll look at my teammate Moodle nice see I don't hit that hard cuz I know he's close so let me just sit on the ball get a nice soft touch to him and they're gonna have to wait for my touch but he knows I'm gonna shout I did the best possible thing for him just tosses off backwards you did do nice my teammates very very consistent compared to what we've played with and against very consistent and they're still making the same defensive mistakes that they had been making that was a good good taste of what champ three looks like already and that goddess is the champ to ourselves so I think we could play one more game I think thank that's permission to play one game and slightly early we're at fourteen sixteen we got 23 points from that's played one more and let's have one one more look at what chance he looks like before the next video so yeah it's in to the next one and see we can keep it up but those guys were saw in our teammate played very well as well and I made a very major mistake I should have got a sport on to be honest but a lack of like game since I guess it was where they didn't know where each other were on the other team they double committed they bumped into each other and got a bad touch off of it so again that would almost definitely be a go unpunished in high ranks but bad mistake for me you should never really be doing that she just hit it across and comfortably get it out of danger but that was kind of kind of slightly messy here a little bit I shouldn't have been but regardless the main things that you're seeing that I'm doing a lot is just fake challenging sit make them give me the ball and then only challenging when it's a definite challenge win that's does two main things that I've been trying to do and then outside of that I'm just trying to shoot when I can and look for my team win again those are the things that you you really need to focus on in these drinks we asked into the next one and that'll get us pretty beeping the champs we already all right for the last game oh no oh no my teammates name this is never gonna go good you are so bad a teammate and there's a bunch of stars as well on his name this will be interesting I really hope is that somebody just like own Bulls all the time I don't think he is he looks like he's taking issues I'm closer so I know I could beat him out a single shot play the song go again wasn't exactly on target but it's fun everyone hears around around champ three if not their high-end champ two she may go for the nice little aerial off the wall I wonder why his name is that I wonder what the story is I'm so curious that was a good little girl off the wall Sean his mechanics ready take it around this guy wait is that does he have a muffin no wonder Mon I think it's a crown I have my own like topper in the game but I've never even made a video on it I should make one you guys can see I don't know how many you guys even know about that but I got my own topper putting the game a walk back but it was that one but something's wearing a crown good Ariel still let's see that many fat cereals which is surprising to me I thought more people be fast you ready here for a week double there we go if you can get good at being able to pop the ball up to yourself when you have a space and just go for some like some like weak-ass double touch listen to be anything crazy really just be able to to beat them whatever think he's asking for a fake here not quite pass but help him out bring up the wall he's up there he's probably miss I'm closer like I said that guy should not be going for that ball if he knows I'm under already waiting for what's gonna happen that's like one of the biggest tips I think I've gained like I said I was definitely close to the ball there that eventually got them scored on him going for that a few weights on me I mean I'm not just him thrown away to them because I know not see but most players would don't point really just trying to make someone give up the ball without giving up your own position Dammers trying to beat them did it backward so sure my teammate I'll wait for shot here good shot in a battle but I gotta be there first so I'm soon back off okay you missed pretty low chance of that happening the bouncing ball so it's kind of hard to expect them I think I should be going that guy's already on the wall so I'm more likely than not he's gonna get beat to that alright you went it's fine close on a double I'm gonna fake this make them give me for free just like that all right still have the ball and almost have it as part of it as well we play actually we got back in time all right I will take my time I go for a dribble my cow you actually saved that what an absolute legend I didn't think he knew he saved it actually kind of I'll watch that back from his view I honestly don't think he knew that he saved that ball you were just sitting on their goal line that's it should've probably had that let's all get to try again like it it's the same mistake every time they're like he's definitely not gonna beat that guy - you shouldn't even be turning for a second challenge a few weights he's gonna say that shot very easily like my teammate already show that he is good aerial control it's just what he challenges isn't very smart try to help him here okay you never run for the ball buddy Ellis didn't put himself in a position where you can save the flick so put himself in a very awkward like middle ground where you can't do either again pretty much the exact same situation the street quick goals they're all just very defensive mistakes he then put himself in a position on the cheat where you react the ball this is how I like to cheat those situations okay that's cool so he's tilted at himself I guess because he's the one that's been messing up or tape it here we got it back but I mean literally all three of those goals were kind of a result of him either challenging correctly or not challenging at all and the third one was on kickoff which it's just the lack of him just knowing where to be on the sheet I guess I'm not trying to blame it but you tell it did someone who'd lend his teammates a lot but there's a lot that I see he does wrong as well so maybe if you look at yourself more instead of looking to blaming teammates it would definitely a preview game that's why I think I improved really quick at the beginning of the game because I never looked to blend my teammate when if it was something that happened I would always look at what I did wrong or like what I could I'm different to avoid it from being a goal and that's why I think I approve really quick so I would never look at when we got scored on and be like oh this is purely my teammates fault there's always something you can slightly do differently I feel like when someone's making a mistake and they think they're entirely in the right good save you think my boosters look good it's fine again you price didn't even charge the ball because that guy's much closer who's ready to touch that you dicks I still control them forward but I think this is the kind of player you just like it's really tilted easily and he starts just playing however I'm not gonna look too deep into it he doesn't seem bad mechanically if you just thought about what he's doing more it'd be a lot better I'm gonna set middle I forgot the cure yeah let's get a kill one leave the ball for your teammate and then just a measly position yourself middle let's take one of the display and then all you see Vanessa just get by one in that situation the guy that was on the wall did not challenge very well so left a pretty pretty simple opportunity for a pass middle yeah the guy might not be having a good date but you didn't do too bad I just I could tell he was getting upset just bothers quick chats and how we started playing you go for the kickoff after you guys were on three times meanwhile they were things that are very avoidable very very avoidable but either way guys that is going to be the video pretty much done we got well into champion our 1436 MMR it's very solid all right I want to look at that real quick to see that guy saw on his save all right I just want to see if like he actually tried the positions up there if it was kind of lucky this where it started off start off as an air dribble officiating not the one where off the backboard and they try to shoot it was going in I just want to see his you you see me start the herbal peddled over his teammate here's kinda awkward he didn't have him so he doesn't know what a half of yeah he definitely did try to do that he's just driving around like I don't know what to do and then it's gone it's so perfect dude ladies it's right into this car and going into that's just my luck though yeah a good read from his teammate here it's like immediately hits in a way you didn't need to at for time on it and you're like this is kind of interesting to see you later Bobby that would be a idea for soon as well just like reviewing lower-ranked plays but look how much space here okay I didn't notice it but obviously there's a wide open goal look at much spaces on the right side here I can't get in the way of this if he passes over to the snark and ARBs this is a real free banger and there's no there's no possible in hi Rex this would happen every single time this guy pass here that's 100 percent of gold there is zero percent chance this guy can save this play if he passes there that's too far to reach for him and you can just bang it and there's absolutely no way anyone will mind so you could save it but he goes for shot it's not a good shot but look what my teammate does my teammate goes straight back here let's go to this you might see me gonna straight back here easy to save ever like look where the ball ends up this is why I tell my brother is when I'm watching him and he challenged up a little bit see really the ball ends up bouncing before it even comes in right if if he just realizes okay this guy's closer like I said look how much closer to the ball he is how was he ever gonna reach this ball in time even if this guy dribbles he has full control business but you don't want to do that so he turns for some reason to challenges and that just gets us scored off now I want to see the desk here as well so that's good that's challenge yet but then you put this up in the spot where he doesn't get ready for the next spot like I don't know if he's not gonna challenge at all don't challenge at all don't like kind of challenging and go wait on it it's kind of weird and then for the cheat I want to see we did wrong cuz he knows I can help him out in that dribble situation so you gotta kill more time for your team okay so you this pushed up too far in the cheat that's all you gotta sit little further back because you have to be able to react if you're cheating into you have to be able to react to the worst-case scenario as well and you could tell he's immediately mad about that and he doesn't even want to go for kickoff and you spam a quickie at this point so it's pretty interesting that's how that's how you act after three goals that are very very perfectible and it's a very like winnable game still but I don't know and this is very bad I think that's the player needs a fixer their attitude more than anything either way good said the game's hope you guys enjoyed thank you for all the support early on the channel it's been nuts as I've been saying I can't think he doesn't know seriously I love each and every one of
