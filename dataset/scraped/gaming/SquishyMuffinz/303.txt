and yeah anyways enjoy the video guys and good luck in the giveaway if you do happen to enter yogas look guys in the previous video we finished off at 1188 MMR and we're getting close to 1,200 oh we should have actually gotten 1,200 but sonic server's died on us we're about to get our third win of the video I'm gonna Gus up to talk on there so I decided for this video just so we can get back to where we were supposed to be because this series gonna be hardest out we need every single win so we're gonna take that one really go into a game and we're gonna try to just get the win by any means so getting goals whatever it may take just to make up for the win that we didn't get because of the servers dying and then every game after that will continue as normal so we get to grant champ we're getting closer and closer we need this win so hopefully we can get into this I'm gonna be scoring for this first game and then for the second game of the video I'll play as normal and hopefully we get to camp 3 by in today's video let's get into all this see how it goes alright so up against all 1,100 players we have a little hundred players on the team as well like I said for this first game we could score which is gonna be a nice change for this series because I haven't been trying to shoot at all we have to get used to playing these lower ranks again I forgot we're kind of getting into now everyone's getting better and better but being able to shoot is gonna be nice for this one game that's for sure yeah I know the record these in bunches on Sunday nights guys and like I play the whole week against high grant players and pro players all week long and then I go against this since it's very weird very weird transition kind of hard to explain that's why I'm gonna be back for the save oh I would have to double tap if you didn't bump me but it was a good touch off the backboard these guys are actually super setting the ball right now when your flip reset did I haven't been able to score in this series for so long so this Redemption game because of the the circuit crash is so nice I can't wait to do the tryout series as well I might take a little bit of a break and go back to normal like just playing with pros and high rank videos just going through my thought process for a little bit and then I'll get into the charred 3/3 series because you know I feel like we've been doing a lot of these really grand shape series and you guys probably want to see a little bit of the old content again and of course I'll always go back to that but a lot of guys been requesting wrote a grand shape series for a while so I'm just kind of getting around to them now yeah me it passes I think it's nuts I'm gonna fake this touchdown this ball come on touch soft I'll go back now I did my job did it behind me should go for this it's fine a little bit awkward was fun I like use my right stick every now and then just to kind of see like what we're dealing with especially when the ball goes above your head like super high it's nice to kind of like look around see if someone's gonna be there on the posing end grab some pads hear a little patter and I'll turn around okay I could turn on to midfield and keep pressure off this ball here I was almost a good goal I went a little bit too close to the ball oh my bad to me I'm just thought it's gonna be able to jump over me I'm sorry take some pads here trying to keep myself available and feel I'll go further past middle off the corner good try still gonna try to pass every now and then here there we go a lot of pressure the job yeah I'm not sure where grande shape is I think it's like 1280 I'm guessing it's like 1280 anymore 25 I don't know probably 100 from where we are right now so yeah that that video that last came in the video that we didn't get the points for you that could be the one game that we like actually need to get to grand champ I didn't want it to because this series it's pretty frustrating to record like a lie to you it's like pretty bad for my muscle memory as well kind of messes me up a little bit so I don't want to have it go on for too long that's why I think we really needed the points for that disconnect that's why we're doing this yeah if I do do a try hardware degree in shape I'm gonna try to score as many as possible trying to make the suit as quick as possible obviously but I'll try to give you guys the best tips in terms of what you should learn mechanically like what you should focus on mechanically if you're trying to just outplay people because there are like quite a few mechanics that are just better than others in terms of trying to outplay people like stuff like that right there getting good at being quick on the ground with your turns to pop it over like one or two players really quickly it's a very good skill to have yeah that series will be a lot of fun there we go we got the method up there all right so we got the W got the points that we weren't able to get in the previous video because of the disconnect and we're up to champy to Division four I'll play two more games today and they'll both be without passing so hopefully we can get off the champ three and hopefully secure a division of the chanter as well so let's get into it let's get some dubs hopefully and let's see how it goes no scoring from this point on for the rest of series like I said this is just an exception of a game yeah good stuff all around and played some solo players so let's get into the next to see how it goes all right we got the second game of the video but technically the first if we're counting the actual challenge itself that's a good start you go all right right Boosh getting aerial just love you saw it already good sell your patch middle I'll try to play it off the backboard shakedown should be right open nice and it's your job well place hyper the empty net slaughter it right home that's what I like this see dude that's what I like to see let's eat up here you should be that be back I'll place my rotationally for the rest of the game but I create plays I'm you can if you can get a second buffer gold I'll be really nice to out for this that's good that's good I didn't resonate a can go it follows my team's nuts - link you're not so I like to see played around one I'm gonna go for a bump on this guy she met trusted if another guy went as well both of them trust at the bump there's a good end bad things - double committed no leave that for my team grab our corner out a full boost now my teammates kind of pushing it behind run away - up not gonna be a great touch mole need goal - to keep it in probably go for a bump as well nice let's gonna wait we're a pretty good spot here we have all the pressure trying to keep the ball in as much as possible as a big pinch should be over the net they can't really shoot off that I'm just gonna rotate back post here behind my teammates whatever happens I can follow it up push forward now she's gonna fake challenge gonna be their first person to give me the ball I'll to be in please save it nicely I didn't mean to shoot that to be also they're trying to keep it in so I have it keeping pressure like that I'm placed off the backboard to me pretty easy for my team at this shoot if I can go for a kill you good job well done for my teammate to be there nicely done right it's 12:05 everywhere I checked it by the way guys 1297 MMR I think it was seems to be granite chain it seems to be the beginning of grand champs so we're not crazy far off of it and we got to finish the series before the start of the new season which i think is March 28th but don't worry guys I'm recording this before March 28th so even if you see this video released after it you still got time to finish the series I'm gonna try to make sure it's done before then but videos probably be released after the new season comes out don't worry I'll definitely make sure we get this done not our heart of this know how long it takes but I'll try to win as much as possible without losing I'm sorry to me so that it doesn't get strung out for too long if you win all of our games from this point on probably want to take a couple more try to three more episodes we're chilling and my team's liking really saw it I like how they're playing I think I can kind of slot in really well right now I'm gonna let him just hit this over me it's fine my tumor behind me I can get behind him now to support it around oh I'm gonna go back guys on a wall ready so I know I'm not gonna go beat it to that ball just play it soft down one touch my post middle I've had a little hard for him to shoot he probably wasn't ready people don't like go for this too much a solo standardized soon leave that they got middle BGA hit me up for this it's fine good touch hit a fake I'll make them rush ball for free hey close I will do this again Jimmy probably is a better angle I'm not gonna turn I'm gonna get a bad touch there's no reason to throw bait on why are there two men to get back there we go I could just boom this now hope that's not in I think it was a I'll just make it sure I was gonna be and I gotta be careful shot now shoulda jumped left it so awkward from other teammate they follow up there's my booster so at least block this team it shouldn't be fun nice one of 12 boost you though good read and a mess is teaming up which is good obviously not what you should do ever in a situation if you're them but that is what we like to see of course we take those look here for a bump just a mess that gap he's gonna be the follow-up there but that bit of pressure they had we're all in low base my teammates are doing a really good job to you especially since you got they're just faking force the ball out not waste my position again same situation I even waste my position at all and forced the ball that past everyone on the field pretty much this point if I can get a kill on this guy to be nice I missed it but it's all good out get back behind him I wish I could get behind here and sit in a situation like that support them totally duh I don't want to soar and I can't see me getting the height have to go off the backboard for my teammates so it's funny just leave there off the backboard good try 90 seconds left on what teammates deals this decently refining I'm good on 20 boosts here's more than enough to do with this touch it to me please let's go what is that dude what is that what is this steel bro what is this steel what I don't know if you wanted to do that but that was go dude what the hell yeah what did I just watch that was crazy that was insane dude what the hell we got up the champ three lists oh dude let's go that's freakin huge we got 12 21 MMR got chance to out to let's play one more game for today's video and hopefully we get ourselves up to a champ 3d f2 and secure ourselves champ 3 with a one-game buffer let's give in to it all right for the last game of the video we got the lesser MMR players but I hope that they're nuts I believe that they will be IFA we lucked out one of them's a FK teammates please I believe we need everything we can get here actually I'd rather not screw off for that but you know we still kind of scored off the pressure from it which I preferred that and for what he's afk but you know good start my teammates don't look don't look that bad David ye son welcome to get elite so he's got to be somewhat decent I don't know it's not hard at all to get that title and you want to think but still got to be decent player we haven't seen him play at either this game in FK so far let's play solid rotationally open up some options for our teammate we're also being back to defend when we need to it won't be good back into the corner grab some mid boost here gonna fake challenge first Judy does yeah I don't know if I like that for a teammate to be honest but I'm ready on that ball but it's fine I just hate it like super awkward I doing that and I had full control of a situation mm-hm again not a fan the push but it's fun it was awkward you sure probably think I could follow it up okay that's gonna do the super confusing my toys are both playing it really like a weird way but we got a co out of it so I mean I'll take it yeah I'm gonna whoa complain somehow we score off of that that guy missed they have to 1201 this is gonna be big mm more for us if we can win this we really need this game should be a great game to end off on probably get us up to like 1250 ish MMR until 40-ish massive I'm gonna trust a teammate can beat them both almost did I'll just plays off the wall kind of forward so I can get a shot out of it awkward friend release teammate will go good pressure your job awesome scan turn here try behind [Music] goal is to keep it in here try to push middle a little to readable past I'll have straight back so I can assist with it happen to you try to dodge the bump nice good job he's using a space ball though that dude you go back here just force the ball for my teammate play it over to Mike and kill this guy that'd be great that's fine nice fifty job pay you fifty again you might think it's actually playing a really solid killed that dude is waiting on the boost she's making himself pretty useless by doing that you know I really wanted to sit on the beach try to always be try always be moving not a silly full speed but try to always be in motion teammates aren't there it's all good my face with them not panic on that ball knowing that my teammates were ready played over to my teammate did you play back made you try take this visual quick it's gonna stop them from having much more play going forward I was a good bump from him I'll hit it around all right honey's the wave - get it around him but yeah actually got a really good touch to block that my team's played really solid those first half of the game and I'm liking what I'm seeing outside of the two little weird miss touches at the beginning they just didn't let me take time on the ball I'm gonna let him force the play nice so I get I should go to get this up the wall random gonna beach but it's all good so force a good touch middle all right to go up to me to go it's fine that's a good touch it's more than enough to delay the play there I was gonna go it's probably around me shouldn't be terrible it's gonna be hard for him to shoot that nice follow for it to me time to make it awkward for them by touching that all right low pitch back here so I'm time to probably pick up pads my team is bolted front of me but I'll be next year I just hit it up the wall clear do anything too crazy at this by your party set up something the boom oh my god dude I almost landed on that I should have flipped away so there's no way I could squirt so I'll give those good speed to beat that guy's gonna be up for that we go again show you one more touch around this guy probably gonna jump in a sec there we go cement couldn't quite see but it's fine we killed a lot of time with that player going forward and I can grab these pads guys he might see me getting full boost so both of this year we move forward last attack I'm having all these pads give it to my teammate off the back I shot a bump the sky close nice somebody turns I'll do it therefore I play the middle I couldn't I just got back we're good there they're two goals 15 seconds I can't see this going terribly this point you got a nice block as well but smart though this this video we need to do this one or two more videos of two games apiece we could reach grand champion no time and so I like to see my teammates played really well as well perfect video we went three for three the first one is really counted was just making up for the previous video that one game of Reedy seed but the last two played really well our teammates held up super solid the whole time we got a division up to Division two which is what we like to see over 1238 now we're about 50 ish points from reaching grand champs so getting about 16 apiece not far off whatsoever so yeah send me off today guys I hope you enjoyed it was a good-ass video like MIT mr. clean have yourself wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys all in the next one I love you all peace you
