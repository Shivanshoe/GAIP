controller giveaway for 900k so make sure you do hit that subscribe button enjoy the video love y'all yo what's up guys i haven't made a video like this in a while but i decided that i should finally do another replay review type video this is going to be a video that's going to help you guys massively if it comes out the way i wanted to so pretty much guys i get this question all the time while i'm streaming or even in my youtube comments how do you improve quick like what's the quickest way to improve at rocket league in my opinion and what i've always said is watch back your replays of course grinding out mechanics grinding out just trying to focus on your positioning in game will help you 100 but if you don't watch back your replays you don't pinpoint your bad habits and every player has bad habits i've been playing this game for over 10 000 hours now and i have a lot of bad habits still and i don't watch replays as much as i should be i do watch them every now and then but i should watch some more and i'll show you guys all the things i can point out in my game play even in a win i'll just pick a random game a random replay here and i'll even pick one with the cool goal let's pick one with the cool goal in it and i guarantee there's so many things i did wrong in the game i probably named one recently i just keep going down to my name one um i guess i don't name my replays anymore all right double flip reset so there's probably a double flip set in here according to the title so there's a good goal in this but i guarantee i made a lot of mistakes so let's watch rpov and now that's after the fact it's very easy to point out what's wrong and i'll try to show you guys what you can point out in your game play to try to improve from it so i'm going to hide that bar we don't need it and we're going to go on our player we're playing against rebels and satyu here and i'm playing with garrett so that's the that's the lobby so i try to always get this over to the left side where my teammates at that's why i do that kickoff there's something that you guys ask me a lot in the comments so to get the ball to go to the left on this you just want to make your car hit more to the right side as you see i'm trying to go more to the right side of the ball that way he has no choice but to push to the left over to garrett and he's going to have a free possession off of that straight off the bat so that's how you lose the kickoff is you want to go to the opposite of where you want it to end up so i'm waiting right side for the passenger that's good good thing to do give garrett the option playing patient popped it up with full boost really good place so far we don't waste any boost good flip reset a good double and then a perfect air dribble into the back of the net there that was really good really well done uh the biggest thing here that i think you guys could take note of is as soon as i got that mid boost i held on to it the entire time i left garrett that option i went back middle waited in a good spot killed a lot of time forget with this pop here so he's behind me no matter what at this point even if this ball ends up going down to the ground i don't get any kind of goal to this i don't even get a flip out of it or something weird happens garrett's already gonna be behind me in a second like he's already gonna be in a spot where no matter what happens with this he's gonna be able to follow up on the next touch he has so much space and they're both trying to defend my flippery set here so this is something that's perfect to do not only because it killed so much time for gear to get back behind me but we got a gold of it so if you're good with the mechanical stuff try to go for it in the game if you have the boost for it but that all comes from saving our boots we use every last bit of boost to get that gold that was perfect one of the best level flippy sets i've had it's probably why i say didn't actually named it i don't name any of my replays i shouldn't use boost on on a cheat i don't think most of the time i don't like using it that's a good 50. good way to hit back to garrett that's smart take the back boost hold on to it it's good good 50 from garrett i shouldn't probably go for this ball so i noticed that right away this ball right here garrett's not behind me fully yet if i jump quick to this it's going to hit off the wall towards saffy there's no way i'm winning this next touch in high level game there's no reason to just hit that forward there we're not gonna get a play going forward i should just fake challenge honestly and just reset i can fake challenge go all the way back get the ball or i can make a softer touch to the side that i could follow up and the rebels would be having to rotate back so i have to hit this ball softer so i can follow myself or just fake challenge that's a better thing than just hitting it forward toward them that's a bad habit that i do have that i probably will do a lot this game every single pro has bad habits though every single pro makes mistakes i can go to anyone in this lobby and pinpoint probably like 20 things they're doing wrong in this game they're all pro players that's a bad challenge but we didn't get scored on it's not terrible but here the ball is grounded i don't need a full commit to this on saturday's screen if you go to his pov he has all the advantage he sees me that entire time he could probably see me turn here you gotta try to think of things from the opponents pov he could see me turn instantly and he sees i'm going toward the ball right here right if he shoots that right here this is a goal bottom corner and i can't do anything about it it took a little too long to shoot so i was able to block most of the goal angle and there's no way you could have really shot that because it took a little bit too long but i made my challenge way too readable there and that and that's something that you have to try to stop doing because this wouldn't even be a dangerous situation if i just fake challenge the ball's rolling just kind of just drive toward it make them think i'm going for the challenge and back off this ball is going to be rolling so slowly look how slow this ball went would have been such an easy save to make i said i have full committed to it he ended up missing which is good but it could have been very bad and you have to try to cut out the the possibilities of making those mistakes that forced two out the document on that this is good i'm killing time for garrett here really nice pop that was really smart and a good goal wow that's actually smart play so here garrett's touch was middle to me but i'm not going to be able to turn to that and if you had a gears pov i'm sure something you could have done different here he didn't have to go as quick to this right he could drive at the wall fake take control rebels is there to pressure it but if you drive with the wall he's gonna be scared of the boom off back wall they both have to be scared of it so you could drive with the wall kill time for me to get behind get a pass middle right there's so many options here you don't have to jump right away and waste them all but it's okay because every single pro player makes those mistakes and i'm sure you guys at lower ranks make hundreds or more mistakes so this is what i mean by watch back your replays and try to find those little things that you shouldn't be doing it ended up working because it did keep pressure and i was able to get a good touch here this was smart though because look where both of them are i see statues falling in front of the ball he has no more boost he can't possibly get it rebels is mid flip here i'm not going to go for a shot because they're going to block this rebel's just going to pre-jump right away i know that so any shot on goal here would be blocked statues jumping as well to try to block it off the wall so i popped it over both and i have full boost just followed up and get a free goal it's a really really well played shot but they're going to played this very different as well riddles had no boost here but i think he didn't trust sathya fully in this situation he flipped right here and then he just jumped right away again instead of just staying grounded and maybe potentially having a chance to save it so a little bit of a lack of trust but that happens when you're solo queue all right another kick off to the right side gear followed it up well good pinch it kills a lot of time not a bad thing to do they're going to have full ball possession here so i challenge this good fake challenge smart that's good i still baited out the ball all we needed to do made that super easy for garrett look at garrett's pov he knows he knows this whole time i'm not going to dive in on this because garrett has no boost back i'm trying to kill as much time as possible for him i know he's not in a good position behind me so i'm not going to go for this i'm going to keep myself in play and then as soon as he gets over me it's fine because you guys can have a free ball the challenge good touch from sathya to hit it back waiting middle full booster you missed i'm just going to pressure them it's going to make them be scared of me same thing i'm just going to go try to help out garrett this is a fine ball just boom away because i have no boost clear the danger wait for me to respawn and get some boost to be full back wait for sathya here garrett it's a good pre-jump i shouldn't probably be going for that we got a goal um i mean it's not bad i i was probably confident that i could win this ball in the air that i had a better read than rebels um this was just a really bad really bad take off from meadows reynolds i think here didn't expect us to pinch as hard but at this point you can just drive back right you don't need to try to force this play and go for a shot that you might not hit when statue's stuck on the wall if you get beat to this it gets hit anywhere around you this is a goal against you right so i should have shot it on goal but i didn't even need to i could just beat him anyway off any wall and garrison would be able to follow up the next shot um but this is something that reynolds needs to just fake challenge and go back forward and there's no reason to try to win this if you're not confident in your positioning according to the ball he's way too under the ball i'm coming at the ball in a better position i just pre-positioned for the play much better than than he was i was further back and it's probably i can follow up so easily that was a good play just needed to be more patient there from riddles i think this is a close game i'm pretty sure this is like a a four two or four three game here so they get some goals so we finally get to see some big mistakes out of us it's better to pick games you get scored on more obviously but i just want to show you guys that even games where you do play well or you do get a good goal you're probably making mistakes doesn't matter if you're a pro player or not it's a huge demo from gear i'm waiting right side of covering a lot of options with this just pop it up high it's a good play to make i could pass this middle to garrett a little bit too high so that that should be kept low if you can't pass low i don't think i should be passing this at all because this wastes all of garrett's boost probably almost all those boost yeah he's falling now with 27 boost here and he's gonna have to go back with none so that just forced him to waste all his boost for i play that's almost never going to be a goal unless it's a low pass so not a good player to make there um that's a good touch to delay time though i see gear on the other side trying to kill time for him to go back i shouldn't be jumping for that ever so this is something that why am i turning and challenging this instantly i don't know why am i jumping from here that's the big issue here why there's no reason to jump from here and obviously if he kept dribbling that i probably dunk him and that's probably going to be going toward their goal but he flicked instantly right he's always going to flank that instantly if he sees me turn because again it's probably way too readable from his pov so look at this from he's just staring at me staring at me he sees me going toward the ball and he instantly flicks that right he has no boost so had i fake challenge this not only do i get the ball for free kills time for gear to get back gary's gonna be behind me i can go back grab the ball already be further ahead than him i'd grab the ball take it back grab the boost as well and it'll be fine but instead it made it a little bit of a risk situation geared at the rush and now everything's kind of rushed because i rushed that one challenge one challenge just caused the chain reaction of just rushing everything it feels like it's a good player to go back now so a big thing for me i think my challenges need a lot of work in terms of how quick i'm challenging and what i what i decided to actually go for a hard commit to or decide to fake i think i'm i make the right decisions of what i fake but what i straight up charge at i think i need to work on that a lot it was close good idea on the ceiling shot it does leave gear back in a 101 which is a very vulnerable situation and twos i'm back with 40 booster which is good see how i deal with this all right that's not what you want to do it's a right idea it was the right idea honestly it wasn't bad but i jumped too early so i kind of showed him what i wanted to do i was trying to to fake them kill time for garrett to get back because i see garrett's far away control this ball get in front of it land and 50 this right put that to the wall and not it could that would have killed enough time for garrett to get back completely but instead sathya was able to easily read that i was trying to control that he's hit it off the back wall it's a free goal every time so that just needs to be either controlled better or hit to the side or something i could have i could have waited right here just sat on the ground if i'm still on the ground i could jump now hit it to the side and then metal is going to be mid anyway so it wouldn't have been bad at all that was just a bad idea to try to control that that was just trying too hard to kill time but all i needed to do was get a better hit to the side pretty clear mistake there good fake that just baited the ball out from riddles and i stole a full boost that was really smart thing not to just dive at so i can tell that i'm making many adjustments throughout the game to try not to make stupid mistakes but it's just bound to happen that's a really smart play over one for free and i just hit there to force out the second touch guaranteed on the back wall don't need to jump for that that's probably a mistake honestly i probably missed clicked don't need to go for that either there's no point this is much easier for sathya if you look at him because it's coming toward him i have to jump toward the ball this was already coming towards tatthew way easier for him to hit that than me if that flicks backward or toward me then i'll win that every time but if not it's not worth it and because i over aggressed for this sethi got a good win to the ceiling here and garrett was stuck probably with no boost let me go to his pov yep no boost rebels can just get an easy double tap and there's nothing that garrett can do he could have maybe had the read there but that's on me for for forcing the situation i forced this whole situation to be a little harder than it needed to be right that's why a lot of high level 2's now i was just sitting on the floor and trying to bait out the ball over and over again because no one wants to make that dive that aggressive challenge right but it's smart because it doesn't leave teammates in a bad situation like i just did right there obviously it still happens every single game and every single player does that and every single player makes that mistake but you want to cut it out as much as possible and actively try to see that you're doing that wrong a lot of a lot of the things you'll see in replays are just bad habits in terms of challenging or in terms of the way you hit the ball here i don't know if i don't think i needed to just air dribble away straight away here i had more time on the ground but the other guy might have demoed me so it's not a bad play i'm not upset with that play let's see good flick i just made it out for garrett not bad not a bad play there and twos as well the first guy should be the guy beating out the challenge for the guy back that's your your main setup every single time this is a free ball for garrett you see me losing my my stick it's a good touch from gear i still waste some boost from them makes a little bit awkward if garrett won that boost battle that's huge i think he did because he's not using is nice don't need to challenge that straight up again this is a ball that gear stuck in their half i don't need to shut up go for this no one's gonna be there to follow it's gonna be a free ball for them and i'll get stuck in a 1v1 situation which you want to avoid but statue did mess up so it should be fine and i'll have a lot of time that's smart to control that's really good not to panic yeah it's going for a bump now now i have a 1v1 it could have been scoreboard i went for the fake though one for the fake play tried to make him scared that i had a flip which i did but i decided not to use it for the fake that's a good fake as well really smart to control that okay that was good that was really good i kept pressure here with no boost in the corner i jumped fake touch control that no gear it's far behind me here i'm just killing time fake them with no boost there's no downside to that i didn't flip and then i got the flip over to last guy that was smart that's well played so still throughout that game there's so many mistakes that were made and there's a lot of things that going back i could have done much better so that's what i mean guys watch back your replays try to find your bad habits and once you do guys do this for like one or two days and please let me know down below in the comment section if
