yo what's up guys so for today's video it's going to be a little bit different i'm going to be one be wanting a friend who's a pro so we're going to be doing some pro 1v1 scrims pretty much and i want you guys to let me know if you enjoyed this kind of thing and i could do this with other friends other pros um and just have fun with it but yeah gonna be playing for uh nothing for today obviously there's nothing on the line but it'll be fun games for somebody trying to win obviously and uh just try to have as much fun as possible with it and yeah should be fun john is a really good player super solid individual and uh should be good let's get into it see if we can end up taking some games off johnny here let's play two games for today all right put it on champions field yeah johnny's really solid maybe interesting played around him i got this boost in this show i know he's kind of far here and he has to kind of aggress just to keep the ball in actually did a good job at that yeah just close enough to where you're still like getting in the way to play but he didn't over aggress which is good it's actually a hard thing to take my do here wait for the bounce good job you actually stay in the ball really well try to just control this fake the flick here or for low 50. can't shoot so i'll just go for a boost just chill i know he's a little beast here too he has to flick it pretty soon actually close i gotta stay in front of this and usually it's really close though like they're always like really good games and his defense is always super solid so you have to be like really careful from going for stuff like this like any kind of like flippers that play like this he's normally really good at stopping it that one is just unstable honestly it's like a really fast shot most of the time he saves it and then gets a counter out of it so you gotta be like really careful it's gonna be a good situation for him probably a goal yeah good first touch that's all down to the boost right if you get the mid booster if you win that you're gonna get the go out of it most of the time save and play all the way back i'd be careful here though still an awkward situation i don't want to get bumped she was going for which is the right play take my time here nice a little like stutter step kind of thing there where i have all the space i have all the control in that play like i can shoot at any point in time stopping for a second makes it so much harder on the opponent they have to respect the fact that you could shoot a little bit earlier try to close down some space here and back off just the right amount of uh pushing forward there on a fake challenge because you obviously do too much you're gonna get yourself scored on hit it one time i can go for the mid boost here and i'm gonna be pretty low boost has to retreat that's fine i still control this get this boost should come back i saw him staying on it so i just wanted to beat him when the boost battle let him hit that i have control now i'm gonna play to make and again that's just like taking his boost slowly kind of like bundling down his resources hitting it over him making it really awkward for him we got away with it let me get the mid boost here and the ball buddy get back into a good spot to defend really tough spot to be in though yeah that's kind of situation same situation is the other goal he got right when's the mid boost when's the ball if you get that most of the time you gotta go out of it most good players will convert it into a goal johnny's definitely gonna be able to do that play it across he's gonna have to back off now a little bit really good 50. there we go another smart play it's a lot of what i feel once is really like i won the ball there on kickoff it's not about even getting the ball to go trading off kickoff if you can win the ball like the possession and get the boost that's almost as big as just the ball going straight in like this situation i feel like if i get the boost it's really good for me because you can't really score off this just to kind of back off i feel like as soon as he makes this touch now i even have time to control this get the boost i play it over i'm just gonna bounce bad for me but hit these fine take this boost when it comes back in a second i just pop it once be annoying here it's a good challenge really good job from johnny there can't shoot yeah but i can stay on this fake jump back off all the way here i gotta watch the shot though much instago it has an awkward situation so i think it's better to just go right away just came back to again i'm gonna wait i have control here right [Music] oh i was gonna play and i just skyed it that's a good example right i have so much control the bounce is like in my favor completely so using that to your advantage is so much better than to just throw it away right away same thing here right look how much control i have in this situation i have a flip i have all the power insulation i can use them for any time yes i respect the fact that i could flip here here also wave dash could do anything i just let it bounce and that gives me even more space opens up a lot more options for me it's been a good game though johnny's super solid like he makes you have to like really get the work for like every every single goal every single time i like i usually do just do a lot when going scream to johnny by the person i play most in ones just to practice gotta bump them here challenge nice silly play didn't really just jump off and shoot straight away so taking that first touch is really good or go lead but a minute left definitely lose the ball especially if my kickoffs do that because lee's gonna be really good off the wall here he goes down to the ground it's also good nice challenge i'll go straight back try to defend the shot yeah i couldn't that's a good shot good power it really does come down to like if you can get the ball and kick off that's like the biggest thing i notice when i play one every time this right here are the ball here i'm normally gonna be able to get something to get out of this situation it's a really good save i don't know how he always does that too that should have been a goal i ain't go high enough but he's like so good in the situations if i really like i really like playing once against them because you can't just like spam your triple bumps so get saving them for no reason that's a good example though um you have all that time all that space and you know usually it's going to be a goal for you it's a good example of johnny's defending as well though take it to the side gives me a lot of options on the cut here should play it around him i don't have to go for a goal or anything play it around go to the ceiling we get a pinch oh i went for top corner not a bad idea that's gonna go nice all right the first game i like that super solid match super close very good cannot be playing we'll play one more game and see if we can win back to back worst case scenario we go one and one johnny's a great player it's not a bad thing at all guys i actually really do like playing once against friends and like other pros and stuff that's a lot of fun i prefer like over ranked for sure play back to my corner i like to try to play for possession a lot in ones so you'll see me like back past myself like that quite a lot let me get the boost i got to leave it respect the fact that he has control here makeup moisture's boosted he's probably wasted 40 i'm not going to waste anymore smart play for me probably still has some i know that so i'm not going to let him get away with baiting me in really a challenge we should come back right about now there it is should i go for like an air dribble here ah some goal all good good attempts but one of those things you go all in for you're gonna get punished right probably better obviously if this like isn't just like a private match and your stuff on the line i'd probably take a slower approach but i like to try stuff like that occasionally good shot and that's where like again the possession i'll kick off comes in so close right take the back boost here all right try to take a slower approach down field there we go that's kind of what i would do if i was taking it like extremely serious and like trying to make sure every single play was a goal that's probably what i'd do because i feel like i have so much control over every touch when i do that i know i'm very good at getting those shots every time but i don't mind going for some you know out of the ordinary stuff when i'm playing these good saves from johnny look for the boost here let's still make them probably be starved here it's good good situation take some light touches again nice take the boost here it didn't come back kind of sucks kind of ruined my plans a bit yeah got another portion that was all my whole play there was like working toward that corner boost if i get that corner boosting goal for me if not it's gonna be really bad for me and ended up being bad eventually get scored on in the next like 10 to 15 seconds but had i got on that boost [Music] it's gonna fake yeah i had a feeling to work if i don't use my flipper it's even better again because i'm not full committing right i could recover easier because i have my flip to wave that shot if i want to there's so much better i was gonna play another great example right look how many times this this video already done this right the bounce is in my favor i'm just using the ball's momentum and the bounce to my advantage i have so much control over the situation that you can't really do much that's how to respect that it's a good way to make sure i get control of the ball here boom it high makes him half the jump and waist boost and i can try to take advantage of this let him hit that that's fine that's why those are good too right take a little soft shot i know he's an awkward spot i'm not trying to full commit for that if i poke him in and get to save i'm in a bad spot now so i'm gonna do that to myself i might as well take a bat shot something that's just soft it's gonna make it weird for him he might not expect it like he didn't there and if he does that's a really good shot oh my gosh perfect um if he does expect it then i'm still able to recover and get the ball so it's not bad at all really fun game though but it's been a good game to watch for you guys yeah he's good in these scenarios gotta be careful [Music] gonna be over same situation as early right you're all in for a situation like that and if it doesn't work out then you get scored on but if it does give yourself a goal it's kind of just a 100 type of play and that's why you don't want to go for those as much as possible is there not a consistent way of getting you the result of a goal right good play got both the boost got a good touch on the ball it's tough enough to follow up yeah two will lead off that you can get one more goal i feel pretty comfortable right now i don't the goals is nothing in this mode let's go for a double reset maybe [Music] messed up oh my gosh it works i messed up so bad that he was definitely hesitating because i i had a chance there was like a chance that i had a flip there there was a small chance but there's probably a chance he expected me to have a flip still so i understand why he messed up there again let the bounce do the work for me that's fine yes it go all in for this shot i don't know if he will yeah and even if he misses that's like huge for me good fake i was trying to play his touch back but didn't hit it back as smart of him played over him in a way that he can't really follow it up easily it's a good demo all dash back i'm gonna fake it i had a feeling i had a feeling i just held my ground that's a good that's a good turn i didn't think you'd go again got two aunts [Music] literally could read on the fake though he had a straight up goal if he shot quick i had fun he's trying to embarrass though this stayed i knew i couldn't save this straight up shot regardless i might as well play the chance that i can save it right right to the wall again self control [Music] i just want a gen i'm playing like a psycho right now [Music] gonna block them [Music] i'm gonna save they'll control those again let's start up one more air dribble probably [Music] maybe just in can't save it he has to go all in right so much control there again like the whole situation every single ball is kind of in my favor and he has to react to what i'm doing that's how you want to play twos or threes as well i feel like always try to make sure that your opponents react to what you're doing or you're not playing so reactive all the time like you have the control over what's going on so i was trying to do there the whole time [Applause] really good save he's gonna have to double reset yeah good games johnny's like super super solid it's always fun always fun playing ones against him hope you guys enjoy it if you like this idea i'll play ones or more pros maybe even get some of my teammates in on it let me play one game scare and do one against justin not sure but uh i'll figure that out let me know down below if you guys enjoyed it have yourself wonderful day or night whatever time is watching this like comment and subscribe and see us all
