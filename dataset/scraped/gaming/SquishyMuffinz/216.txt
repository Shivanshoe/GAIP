one of you guys are the absolute best thank you for all the support on the channel hope you guys enjoyed today's video yo what's up guys we're back with part two of our beginner's guide to rocker league and uh i'm making this of course because free to play just recently came out so there's a bunch of new players and i'm trying to help them out any way i can as you can see there's a billboard right there about free to play i'm trying to help them out any way i can and there will be some tips in here that'll definitely help you guys even if you're an older player um there's gonna be some tips about rotation in this video some tips about positioning in general um the hard part about this is i'm gonna be showing you guys these things through pro replays gonna be pro game replay so it's a little bit weird because obviously you guys aren't gonna be pros so the position is gonna be a little bit different but i'm gonna try to go over to the best i can and explain the basic idea of rotation and what you should do um but it gets a little bit different when you get to the higher level so it's a little bit hard to explain perfectly but i'll try my best but we're going to go over the stuff that's not directly like gameplay based or team based quite yet we're going to go over the uh faster early mechanic half flipping and wave dashing so those are three things that are huge for you to learn early on so we're going to go over faster than first i think this is honestly the most important mechanic in high level play this is one of the biggest ones to learn because if you don't know the fast field and you just do this if you just do that you're gonna get beat to every single ball everyone every single pro player is gonna just destroy you to every single ball you're not gonna have a chance to even hit it all right so i'm gonna show you what a faster it looks like first looks like this that's all a fast real is um so the thing about a fast rail is really good is you save boost you get up way faster you also have a more direct path to the ball rather than doing a single jump and just doing this right your path to the ball is going to be much better in general when you're fast airing so it's something you definitely need to learn and it'll give you a huge advantage even if you're just starting to play the game now so i try to explain this the best i can but pretty much the actions of a faster you know what i like to do for a difficult mechanic that's hard to learn at first is split it up into three things uh so you're gonna be holding boost the whole time so that's the first thing you need to do obviously you're gonna be holding boost the whole time because when i'm doing a fast shot that's what it looks like holding boost the entire time you gotta find binds that feel good to you for me i hold circle the whole time my thumb just goes from circle to x twice like this that's me not using my left hand at all so this is the action that i'm doing without using my left hand at all just my right hand i'm going circle to x twice so let's do that on freeplay first that's all i gotta do and then we gotta throw in the hard part that includes the timing okay that's the first part of a fast stereo so now let's slow it down and let go of our boost let's just this is break it down very slowly without the boost okay so we're jumping tilting back and then we're jumping again that's all it is now the thing that a lot of people experience the thing that makes this hard is you might accidentally backflip you gotta jump tilt back let go your stick and jump again jump tilt back like on your stick jump again because if you hold your stick you're gonna backflip that's the hard part about faster airline and in general guys you want to learn how to normally aerial before you can fast aerial but that's not necessarily the case i think because if you could just learn how to faster the first it's better right i think that you should only single jump aerial if you're going at a ball to flip at it so that's what i was going to talk about next but we'll finish off fast shutting first um so like i said you're going to be jumping tilting back and jumping again now do that with the boost jumping tilting back jumping again that's a fast cereal but that's a slow version of it it should be really quick should we jump until back jump jump to back jump if you see my controller in the bottom left i just tilt back and let go my stick right away that way i don't backflip because like if i if i hold back the whole time i'm going to backflip i'm not going to be able to do it so that's what a faster yo looks like that's the idea of it and like i said it's gonna take some time to get used to but just break it down into little steps like i said hold down boost double drop x and then the action of jump tilt back jump again do that and then just do it quicker and quicker over and over again and you'll get more and more comfortable that's what faster than it is and it's a super important skill now if you're not fast airling that's why i think you should learn fast aerials there are simpler ways to learn how to ariel straight off the bat but i think that faster healing learning that right off the bat is just way better than just doing this to every area i think that's just too slow and it's just it's just not a good it's not a good thing to get into the habit of doing i think if you learn faster right away you'll be building on that through all your hours playing broccoli so i think that if you're not fast airling you should go into training packs and just practice jumping boosting and then using your flip to get a good shot so go into any training pack i don't even have one set up here but let's go into training pack let's go to um let's see what we can do will be easy here basic rebound practice sure i don't i don't know what this is gonna look like okay so i take time here i'll jump and i'll try to use my flip for the shot so just go into something like this and just practice doing this for normal aerials and then if the balls are really high like this one's a really high one let me go for a double jump area a fast area right once you get comfortable try to go for the fast aerials look at the difference between a double jump quick aerial and a slow one like this you see the difference you see see how much different and how much slower i get to the ball doing the normal way so learning how to do the fast cereal it's so much more helpful it's gonna take a very long time to get comfortable to the level that some pros are comfortable doing it but what i will say is that it's one of the most important skills one of the most fundamental like high level skills you need to know so like i said guys if you're not double jumping you should save your flip and just use your flip into the aerials those are the best things to do when you don't have to double jump for the ball you should take your time and try to get a good flip shot into it so that's why i think that learning how to um learning how to fast here is good because you don't you don't need to do anything besides fast failing for balls that are high up in my opinion you i mean you can't you can't hold your flip that long and you shouldn't be single jumping so fast airling is uh by far one of the biggest skills that you need to learn so i hope that my little tutorial made sense to you guys it's a very weird confusing mechanic to learn just visually you have to try it you have to give it a try yourself or else it's not going to make a crazy amount of sense right off the bat the stuff probably looks a little bit weird to you guys if you're brand new because there's a lot of things you don't know about yet but i'm using my flip there because i actually got a flip off of the ball if your four wheels come off the ceiling or off the ball it's called the flip reset and you have an unlimited flip because the the game thinks you never jumped but you got a reset off the wall or ball so that's something that's a thing as well i can make tutorials on the future i don't have like a lot of tutorials on i have i made a double flippers editorial not too long ago but that's going to be way too advanced for you guys if you're brand new there's a lot of super advanced mechanics i haven't made turtles on yet and they're honestly really hard to make turtles on like this um these double tap flip resets like off the the back wall like this it's a hard thing to explain idea perfectly it just takes time you need to get a feel for it there's a lot of things i want to make tutorials on you guys just gotta let me know what you want to see down below so i covered fast airling let's get into half flipping half flipping is is a huge one as well half flipping is one that every single pro uses every single game multiple times so half flipping is something that like say you're at a position here you're gonna back off like this and you turn your car around rather than doing this the alternative that most lower level players would do is this which takes you much longer than just like a really quick half flip like that so instead of uh just doing the good old uh u-turn left or you turn right what you're doing is a backflip flip cancel so you can flip cancel by dodging in one direction say a dodge forward but i flick my stick after my dodge downward so i'm going to dodge forward and flick downward and my car does that so all it does is cancel the animation of the flip so the whole flip is like this but when i flick down it cancels animation it makes it look weird right so that's the idea of what a half flip is so you're going to start by doing a diagonal flip either to the left or to the right whatever feels more comfortable to you whatever your your finger can naturally do for me it's to the left so down left so i'm going to diagonal flip down left that's the first step to half flip and then you're going to take that down lift input and you're going to flick it from the bottom left of the stick if you look at the bottom left of your screen right now the bottom left up to the top of your stick that's what you're gonna be doing for this action while holding your arrow uh that's what i do personally i don't think you need to hold it i'm gonna try not doing it yeah i'm not holding a roll and you don't really need it at all i use it for the very end to make sure that it it finishes up completely the full rotation but that's what it is it's pretty much just it's pretty much a diagonal backflip and at the bottom of your flip you're flicking your stick from the bottom left to the top of the stick and if you're on the right side you're flicking from the bottom right to the top so some common mistakes that you'll have during this is if you do it too quick it looks like this your card will go pointing up and that's why you have to find the timing it has to be more of a smooth fluent timing to it you see how smooth that looks it's because i have a lot of practice a lot of time doing it but the first time i did this it looked like this okay because everyone thinks you got to just slam your stick up full speed you don't try to think of it as one motion don't think of it as like a snap a quick snap think of it as i'm going bottom left and i'm just slowly bringing my stick up bottom left i'm slowly bringing my stick up don't snap your stick because look at my car it shouldn't do that right it should be one nice motion together so that's something that takes time to learn and again you will have this mistake this is something that every every time i taught someone how to have flip i've taught a couple people it's over time like brand new players my brother was somebody that struggled with this when i was teaching him it would just go up every time because we do it too quick so just try to slow it down if that's happening you're just flicking your stick too early that's all so just try to slow it down think of it as one motion that's all you got to do so yeah again that's just a diagonal backflip and then you're pulling up at the very end and that's pretty much used for whenever you're pushed up too far the ball goes over your head you can get back really quick like this and that mixes in well with the the last thing that i mentioned in the previous part of this video um holding down your your drift button whenever i land i always hold my drift because if i land sideways like i could just keep doing like drifts like this i keep my mountain the whole time just doing half flips because i'm holding my drift the whole time that's why i mentioned that in the recovery portion of the last video that uh l1 tip or that's my that's my drift button but in general whatever your drift button is that's why that's important because if you land awkwardly off the half flip for whatever reason you can recover easily because you're holding your your l1 button so that's it for for half lift it's pretty straightforward you'll get an idea of it um but yeah just get the motion down and it'll it'll come to you naturally and it's something you just never forget once you learn it it's something that it takes time for sure but once you get it down and you understand how it works you'll just never forget it all right so next thing we get into for like just pure mechanics and gameplay wise is wave dashes there's a lot of weird ways to wave dash this is a chain dash on the floor you could do left to right chain dash um there's even wall chain dashes which are like this those are very hard to do and these are like super advanced um but in general i'm just going to teach you the idea of how a dash works that's actually really sick what the heck so for wave dashes i'm holding my drift button the entire time that's why i had to mention the recoveries and drifting again in the previous video because every time you land off of a wall like a wave dash like this i'm always holding my my drift button because if you land sideways you want to be able to keep your momentum the whole time right so how wave dash works is it's pretty much just one flip either forward or a chain dash is to the side all that is is a side flip but i'm going i'm jumping close to the floor i'm lifting my wheels up like this and then i'm just flipping to the right that's all it is slowed down so my flip to the right is just cancel it out because the ground is too close to my car when i flip so it's giving me the speed of the flip without having to see the animation which is a really useful skill because i could jump off the wall like this and wave dash once and i get the full speed of the flip for doing nothing pretty much doing this is the same thing except way faster doing this that's that's the exact same speed you get from a flip except instantly that's why wave dashing is a super important high level mechanic right there because you can see how much feet i just got from doing nothing let's jump off and just flip so how to do this the best way to explain it is you can do a little bit a little tiny jump be close to the floor and then use your flip your second flip forward or to the left or to the right it depends on the situation but you could do this any direction you can even do this backward it's super hard to properly explain this but i think it's pretty easy to tell what's going on you just jump when your wheels are really close to the floor and you get the speed of the flip without the flip having to go through that's that i'm trying to show you what it looks like when you mess it up so if you jump too high that's what it would look like and you don't get it right but if your wheels are close enough to the floor like this you're gonna get the full speed of the flip um there's some cool things you can do with this that like some freestylers do where they do like a spin like that if you just do on the front wheels there's some on the back wheels as well like this you do some weird takeoffs but in general a proper wave dash is just like this and this is going to take some some feeling out it's just going to take some time you got to just get a feel for it but the idea of it is literally just a front flip when your wheels are about to touch the floor and it's going to give you the speed of the flip without the animation having to go through and this is most commonly used in pro play off the walls you land off a wall and you just do that because you get full speed pretty much instantly and it's quicker than doing this whole jump and then flip like this and you can't actually turn right away whereas if the ball's behind you you can wave dash and turn right away and go into right it's much it's much better in so many different ways to wave dash instead that's the whole idea of wave dashing and now we're gonna get into the two things that are very difficult to explain but i'm gonna try my absolute best to give you guys the best idea of what i'm trying to say so when you get into rotation and positioning and i'm just gonna go over one replay and just kind of give you guys examples because i'm gonna try to cover rotation now and it's a hard thing to cover honestly but i'll try to check cover as best as i can i'm gonna be showing you some threes gameplay and idea rotation is that there's gonna be somebody on the ball someone waiting a second man and a third man further back at all times that's pretty much how every three's team should position threes is the professional gamer that's played in rocket league so that's how everyone should position at all times for example here you have reynolds who's coming back off of a big challenge you have arsenal who's stuck in that the sad face name is arsenal hashmate is typical um this is ssg they're one of the best n a teams right now i'm gonna be using this replay as an example so here we see exactly what i'm talking about the idea of rock league is you always have one guys third man one guy being second man the challenge and then one guy that would be the first guy to challenge and that's pretty much how every basic team is set up in pro play and that's how you should try to set up in your ranked games it is a little bit harder because no communication but that's the idea of it um and 2v2 is the same kind of idea there's always a first man and then a last man and the first man tries to make it as easy as possible for the last man to get the ball for free if that team has possession the other team's doing the same thing the first guy is trying to make it as easy as possible for the last guy so i'll cover all of that really in-depth stuff in another video if you guys want it but i'm gonna try to cover basic rotation i don't know if this is the best replay to show this but i'll just try to show you some examples here so cs play unfold justin is the first man here his out to gear gary hits out the back wall i'm third man coming in that's my job to be there next for that ball that created a play going forward i gotta be there i gotta try to finish that out and i do i slaughtered it well that's gonna be a goal for us so let's see how the kickoff unfolds here there's always one cheater one goes for k off one goes for back boost so i'm second man here i'm just trying to teach you guys a basic rotation works here so garrett should be up for this ball i i'm running across here justin's gonna be the last man i beat him to this so now gareth's rooting his last name he's here garrett rotated back here and i'm telling him to go forward now because i rotated behind there's almost a goal chance and justin's got to rotate behind because i'm going so there's always somebody rotating back as someone's going toward the ball that should always be the situation all right so here's another example here i'm third man i'm not going for this ball taking my time in the corner i slowed it down it's a good 50. garrett's going to second man justin's probably gonna be back here justin's third man very far away i'm not rotating back as third man justin wins a good challenge and it's a goal so we have constant pressure because of this rotation that's super fast over and over again just going for the same balls over and over again so you see how even if this had gone wrong i'm gonna be back there is some open space in the field here but i'm gonna be rotating back on the left side and there's really no downside to that play let's skip ahead to their goal let's see their situation i'm gonna rotate around this way let's see how they got a goal here they have a little bit of a breaking rotation but they still get a goal out of this situation i'm pretty sure um so they see you see reynolds is going for a bump here on garrett um he passes back in front of our net and he starts rotating back right he's rotating back rotating back typical's in third round position right now rebels should rotate behind him here and typical should come in middle a bit more but reynolds turns with sip at the exact same time so they must not have combed it properly um and then it comes middle and instead of sip being the one who should have been in vettel's position that red has been further back it should have been swapped but it still worked out uh sip has to come in here he gets a shot and uh it bounces the bar down and no one can actually go for the ball and they get to go out of it because arsenal's rotation comes in here at the end but they messed up the rotation a little bit and it made it really awkward for us i think we might have been confused by a little bit as well it's a little bit weird looking but that that is an example of like a mistake in rotation but here we have i'm third man you have two people in front here so i'm just waiting third you can see we have a clear idea of what we want to do on offense we have two people forward we have one guy waiting third far back and we can cover anything that happens here if it gets boomed far i can kill time for my team to get behind me and then i'm first man in the play and someone's gonna be last somebody bumped here by arsenal and i'm third man i know i'm third man but i also know that garrett's gonna be coming back so this is my ball to now go for it in my in my opinion in my eyes here i'm now the new first man of this play so i'm gonna go for this straight away i know my teammate's gonna be behind me because look i'm not first man garrett's gonna be second man and look is behind justin's third man that's how you gotta think about rotation right there's gonna be uh order of people that should challenge the ball it's a double commit from garrett and justin but it's okay i'm back here and i'm gonna play it play it well to the corner so i'm rotating back as third even though both my teammates went up always rotate behind your teammates like that and you know it's a little awkward situation just hit it forward not the best touch for me but it's still dealt with well good pass over to justin and we get a counter attack out of that so turn the double commit into a goal regardless because we have a third man back there and their rotation was late there because look at arsenal he's last man for a while right his teammates are just landing for this he has to not go for this ball he has to try to cover goal side he's trying to cover at least the past middle but he turns toward me here thinking that he's going to fake challenge me uh but i'm already up for this ball committed to the pass so it doesn't matter what he's doing uh and now reynolds is not back so i got the passover to justin it's a wide open net instead arsenal should have just waited try to get back try to kill time for riddles cover this pass and then a team is going to be last back so he should have again been the first man in that play like think of it as you're the first man challenging you have to get in the way of this ball and your team is going to be behind you he has to try to kill time like that but he didn't do it in that situation that was a good job on our part to rotate properly when there was a big double commit there so again i'm third man here now i'm going to second man garrett shows hitting back a third man you see like the basic idea of how this works it's just an order of who should be going for the ball next we're both up forward here that's okay from garrett to miss that i'm trying to kill time justin's lost back garrett's hitting his last circular rotates all the way back taking a wide turn here that way if they do bang this ball out ssg loves to control the ball like this that's a good kill from justin and now justin's the new third man so it's very like dynamic is the best word to explain it there are no send stone positions you see i'm rotating back at third now justin is now the new third i'm waiting a second so it's very like set in stone and who should be going for the ball next and it's very obvious to everyone playing on the field like everyone on each side of the field who should be going next most of the time there should never be like a confusion of who's next again gary starts hitting back here i'm rotating all the way back your turn you can see the idea of how this works it's pretty it's pretty clear i'd say even if you're a brand new player but it looks a lot easier than it is to to coordinate this wall obviously because you have to be calming properly and it's a constant rotation like we have garrett as third man here i go for this ball caused some pressure i take the boost justin goes for this i'm now third man gary goes for the shot constant rotation going left and right and left and right over and over again so that's the idea of rotation it's very hard to explain but pretty much the basic points are this you don't want to be in the same spot of the field as your teammate is you don't want to waste two players in the exact same position because you're not covering a lot of the field you want to try to give your players on your team options if you're playing 2v2 the same situation uh you don't ever want to be in the same spot as your teammate especially in the 2v2 because there's nobody else on the field to help you out right if you double command 2v2 it's a goal but 3s is the main game mode that we're covering right now and the whole idea for threes is to always make sure you're spread out from your teammates you cover as many options as possible you're ready to challenge ready to bait out the ball for your teammate you can just travel to the ball get your team in a free ball just by driving up and showing presents right so doing that for your team is really good as first man just doing things like that to help out your rotation be cleaner um that stuff is extremely important it's hard to even you know explain it's something you have to just learn over time but i hope you guys gain some knowledge and idea of how rotation works pretty much is always the first man second man and third man and make sure that if you are the third man you play safe that way that ball can't get boomed over your head because that does happen even in pro games still it's happened to me even recently i make that mistake quite often still where i'm a little bit too pushed up and that ball just gets blasted over my head and have to go all the way back instead of being in a better position where you can just keep pressure and keep that ball in so even though this is a super high level gameplay i hope it wasn't all generation i hope i can help you guys a little bit i'm trying my absolute best it's a very tough thing to cover very tough thing to explain properly but i tried to give you guys examples but anyway hope you guys enjoyed the video have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is in your watches let me know down below if you did enjoy or learn things love you guys and i'll see you guys on the next one peace here you
