yo what's up guys for today's video we're going to be playing some 2v2 games with uh jans i believe is how you say that he's currently on the best team in south america in furia so i'm going to be playing some 2 games with him for today should be some good games i'm not sure how it's going to go honestly because we're playing at a pretty staff time of the day it's gonna be a lot of good players on let's see all right the first game we got ourselves bambi and tool so pretty solid set of players so we can do here let's go straight back for net here didn't have a hard time getting a good shot on that i know that so i think opting for defense there is always more important unfortunately i'm pretty sure uh jens went with me oh you got bumped actually so man he played it right he didn't jump at all but the other guy just confirmed they went very all in on that play had that bump not came through they're getting scored on there so that's actually it's a risk that may or may not be worth it all depends on if you actually pull the bump off nice touch around them didn't have one more hit here just played around one that's fine wait for baby touch here he's probably after the wall if you go solo here just bait the flick no more danger in that and go back wall now ah i love to bump it seems both their goals about the same thing the shot's not threatening really at all and then there's just the bump that comes through pretty unfortunate it's 2v2 for you a whole lot of that stuff goes on i gotta bump back gotta be annoying it's fine as long as they don't have like that bumping opportunity i don't think it's really gonna be any issue in this game because we're able to get a lot of like good opportunities on offense as soon as we have the ball but it's just a matter of when we're on defense if they have the opportunity to bump it's probably going to be tough for us especially because yen's ping is pretty bad so any shot that's really close to the net especially if he's like late to having to react to it because of a bump it's going to be hard over one look for the boost here both of them went for it which is good for me i can do something there we go good job to slow down there yeah at offense we're doing really good just on defense we got to make sure we move a little bit faster to dodge the bumps that's a big help in dodging the bumps most of the time that yen's like solo play here fun one little touch they actually did really well to mess them up like that for example okay so the ends probably should be moving forward fast here like he is but at the same time if he wasn't like having that delay in his ping there's no way he doesn't react to to getting back there it makes a really big difference actually very difficult to play on a thing like that definitely gets back to that if he's able to react well done played around them better stay on this ball oh almost got the dunk i needed nice good cup from yance right behind him here just in a spot where i can react whatever happens might have slotted it unfortunately it's a good attempt actually very close to this being in [Music] let him just follow that a little bit too far for me to like try to go for a shot or like a touch that can be scored so yeah played that pretty well also they're both very on top of each other and again if they weren't able to get those bumps in this situation it's gonna be really bad for them most of the time so this kind of team that like if you wait long enough you'll get an opportunity where they will double commit because of the because they're just on top of each other way too much something that's been happening a lot should have this should be fine [Music] okay they're both there again so it's happening a lot of this game already like just those double commits they actually could have been pretty bad right there if that pinch went for my net i think it was gonna be a really bad situation again going for the bumps unfortunately that he got all the boosts but can't really help out the ends now nice little touch back to him there's a 1v1 now it's actually pretty good situation i like that you just flip for the recovery fun no i didn't flip the flip didn't get the the corner of the balls it didn't work that was really good to get around the first guy should have definitely had the flick there though messed up just a little bit it should be fun made it for whoever's behind me so as long as you just go early with some of the flip like that it takes out all the the danger situation fake right here now i don't commit i don't need to full commit for 30 seconds left we have a big advantage here and especially in a situation if we could just gather the ball to our corners or something we're gonna have very very minimal options nice and displayed off to the right it's gonna kill a lot of time i think learning how to play your lead too is something that's very very hard like a very hard skill to actually know when to challenge stuff and you know how to just kill time play time in general such a hard thing to learn but as soon as you have a lead you have such a like powerful thing in your hands but it's a matter of learning what to do with it you don't want to over aggress right you're not trying to commit for bad things as soon as you have that ball in your possession try to kill as many seconds off the focus you're winning the game by doing that right you're essentially scoring goals by just keeping the ball next to you so as long as you can do that and learn how to get like really good ball control in your corners and stuff like that you'll be chilling when you have a lead late game and especially in 2v2 right there's one less player to worry about than 3v3 that can bump you when you're dribbling the ball and controlling it so it's definitely a valuable skill to have for sure so into the next game steven keep it up get back to big dubs see how it goes [Music] all right for the last game we got ourselves ftm here and zanil okay [Music] pretty much all like the main people you see always grinding rank twos who we got today a lot of the the main ranked twos grinders [Music] i try to get one little touch on that 50. so to spill it middle but he's fine could still force him to flick it just by bumping him [Music] twos is very like bump heavy these days which i don't really like it too much honestly but you kind of have to play twos because no one cues threes during the day for whatever reason so it is what it is nice shot good job i think me just trying to follow up the ball like just even falling toward the ball while boosting might have faked him thinking that i was going to go for a double there so it works out pretty well make sure to bounce down yeah i probably just shoot this left it open for a little bit too long i think yeah perfect placement though i think it was any more to the left of the net he would have saved it yeah he would have and any more to the left he saves it all right he delayed the kick off really hard there he's actually smart because i've been winning it pretty hard but actually ended up working out pretty well for us because he goes straight back to my very mechanical teammate who could do quite a bit with the ball he booms his back while i can do something with it going for the corner that's fine i could go for a bump maybe i can't beat him to it but i can at least fake i think i'm last back for a bit here so i got a challenge no flip on them should be fine force them to go as well now again the ends in these positions pretty dangerous let him panic a bit nice that was a crazy play wow wait they insta forfeited okay we'll play one more game let's get into the next one team keep it up get back to back to back dubs let's see how it goes all right for the actual last game of the video we got rep the g enzo the same guys last game and then just gave on top of it sorry i refer i'll be referring to crepaji as gate by the way guys for the most of the video when i mention him i'm just used to from from way back when he was a pro still very good though you don't just forget how to play you know especially in a game mode like 2v2 i never really forget how to play 2v2 it's very just solo heavy and stuff like that solos bumped and you'll be pretty good we're getting pretty high rank in 2v2 to be honest yeah i knew you couldn't reach it kind of just went quick i always keep track of like if they were able to get the boost on kick off because you know if they weren't able to get the boost they're probably pretty low a bit off the bat right we got going for kickoffs always gonna have zero boost ready to hit the ball they got cheating's probably to have like 40 50. so like when i cheat i get one pad two pads and i just wait play a one four it should be a shot plus play it off the wall weird for them you're all the way back here ah try to pass it off right for three and i don't think he was ready for it work so then for the bump on the last guy i was trying to control it should i play right side don't for my mid boost i just go all the way back it's fine it's gonna be a big deal because i was probably gonna go back anyway in that situation that works out pretty funny actually instachallenge there surprised left side oh played around two of them sorry about the steam message sound i think it won't be one for a while i have faith there the insta challenge i like that killed both of them nice good control as well after the double demo very nice very nice yeah yeah it's really fun to play with especially because he has a lot of um like aerial thread as well like this stuff that he's doing it's very dangerous so it creates a lot of space for you a lot of players are very good at that stuff obviously but some are better than others at it he's one of the ones that are pretty exceptional at it obviously i'm doing it right here as well creating a lot of pressure with it but it's just good to have the whole team that can do that you know a whole team that can create pressure doing that kind of stuff in the air good challenge but above the last guy here it's gonna be really good couldn't quite pump him there all right this i'll let jan's go for me might be bad still very good i got above it just enough it's that forward i think he has a boost for it uh he actually liked the latest shot so hard he's always so awkward one little cut it's not gonna do anything here i want i wanted the fake where you just drive the whole time quality i hit it around him in that situation where i'm low boost my main goal is to try to get into a spot where opponent's not gonna be able to do anything about it that was i'm trying to do same thing there right i know if i just hit it off the back wall if i do any kind of touches high i'm gonna have a really hard time doing anything then i go for the bump in the last guy it makes it pretty much impossible for them to defend but yeah good games for today hope you guys enjoy it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe but i see us all in the next one i love y'all [Music] you
