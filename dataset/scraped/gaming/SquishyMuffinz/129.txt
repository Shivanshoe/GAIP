yo what's up guys so today we got a very exciting video you guys will be the first eyes to actually see this this happened today the same day this releases we scrimmed team bds who is absolutely dominating europe right now they're beating everybody they're winning so many regionals and uh right now we're ranked number one in n a on the rlsx leaderboards they're ranked number one in europe so this is the number one team versus number one team based on rlcsx rankings right now so i'm gonna be showing you guys some of the wins and some of the losses as well so we scrimmed them uh how many games here so we started this one was a very quick game 31 second game because we'd started playing and the ping on the server was bad so we had to restart we remade it so we played the first five games on european servers so one two three four five and the last three games we played on na servers so one two and three as you can see here we ended up winning the first game of europe losing the next two on europe winning the next one after that and then losing the fifth game on europe so we ended up winning two on europe losing three and then on na servers we won three in a row we won three zero so i'm going to be going over uh two of the wins and one of the losses why not let's just split it up like that because we ended up winning five games losing three so let's go over two of the wins out of the five and one of the losses out of the three and uh let's get straight into it i'll try to go over what i think about them because they're an amazing team i think they'll be fantastic to play on land and in my opinion there will never ever be a fair way to see who is better when it comes to playing online cross region scrims like this it's impossible my ping to europe is a hundred but it feels a lot more like a 200 ping 250 ping server most of the time because the connection from canada to europe is pretty bad so yeah just keep that in mind we're playing cross region all three players on our team have over a hundred ping all three players on their team when they're playing cross region will have a hundred ping i'll just go into the games and we'll start off with one of the losses let's go with this one to two loss right here all right so as you can see extra marked by eight and monkey moon his name is mickey moon right now which is kind of like a little meme going on but uh we'll watch my uh pob throughout most of this so i won't pause too much i try not to pause a crazy amount but the pings as you can see all over 100 for us my ping is 112 like i said it feels a lot more like 200 200-ish because the canada to europe like routing is very bad in rock league i'm not sure why let's get into it this is on their servers their kickoffs were very solid that was the first thing i noticed from them very very good kickoffs and their team play and their passing is very good as well a little pass back attempt to justin probably a little bit laggy for him and i'm double cleaning there but it's fine watching the midfield pass good job from garrett thing back on decent amount of boosts you're waiting back post is the best spot to defend the situation because i can wait react whatever happens again that's very laggy you can't see the leg on the replay that's the thing about the replays guys you see what actually happens you don't see the lag so you won't be able to see the exact situation for what it was from my eyes but the idea so right here this is a ball that i should have probably touched but for my pov i don't want to touch this and mess up my team because in my eyes garrett probably has a better touch with this but i think gary had expected me to get in the way of this right but still a little bit unlucky because honestly garrett had a block and i just went under him so a little bit unfortunate i should have probably touched this i just didn't want to mess up my team because in my head if i touch this i make a little bit harder for them i didn't even realize the guy was as close as he was so it just became a little bit awkward it's all good though my camera also kept doing the shaking thing so if you see me spamming it trying to fix the dead zone issue that always happens their 5050s out of their side also was very good they're doing a really good job at that i'll switch through some of the povs as well or watch some other people first touch here try to pass this right actually a really good pass is a really a pass and if garrett's in a slightly more pushed up position probably a goal because they were not expecting this touch for monkeyman wasn't the best yeah you can see how much space there is on this pass right extra actually whips it if it gets a little bit closer probably a goal you can't expect that to to happen obviously good boost conservation here not wasting anything see this one of those balls that in real time that goes through my car on european servers you can't tell that on the replay but yeah it's one of those balls it's very very tough to react to good patience well they're well done so you can see how we deal with the situation as well here look where justin is so he's behind me i'm first man on this challenge so whatever happens i'm reacting first he's playing back post so worst case scenario he can go up the wall here he can react whatever happens if the ball gets past me but it doesn't and i could just take full control of the ball here which is a good play good play to make kills a lot of time for my team to get back at boost everyone's in a very good position with boost now and we can actually make a play going forward if we could win some of these challenges get touched to the corner here save my boosters well which is a good play bring a block from garrett play this middle it's going to create some space really good reaction from gear i don't know how you reacted on the ping that we're on but uh very well played from garrett it's fine base the ball for justin it's not a matter of like if i get to that it's terrible because that's not the case at all i get beat to that ball it actually gives my team a free ball we're actually in a pretty good position after the fact a lot of space to my left i know that let's try to play it off to the left side kind of forced him to make touch into my team yet again it's fine justin called me off so i waited obviously you don't have comms here but if stuff like that happens i'll try to explain that there was communications involved play it to myself try to follow it again i had a little bit more time on that that i thought i decided to rush me but we're doing a good job of like saving boost this game a lot because this team is very good once they get in your corner they 50 well like that like what monkey interested once they get in your corner they steal your boost really well it's a good challenge to stay on that it could be a shot i sit down ready to play from uh from justin and garrett here we started from that challenge for me goes with the wall just gets a fast touch justin very fast up for that very quick and we're tied back up two minutes left yeah i'll go over two wins after this this is the first uh loss i wanted to go over because there's a lot of little things throughout this game that i thought were interesting like the slightly different way they play and the way they play on defense is very very patient and then on offense is very like explosive very pass oriented i played this to myself good control get fake there get fake to stay with this again and a good flick get over the third guys you almost got by the whole team and get everyone for the bump here and if you're against the bump here which is a very smart player to go for it's actually a goal for us straight off the bat it was really good control to get all the way down the field there almost 1v3 let me rotate out rotate all the way back here mark's a lot closer than me to the ball here that's why i don't it's a challenge because if i answer challenges he'll see me all the way i guarantee on his screen he can see me yeah you can so i turned away right here and that forced him to throw away the ball right when he would have right so if i had challenges right away and again i'm on european service here so everything that happens is a little bit delayed i can't challenge this and be able to react to what happens last second i have to play the fake i have to in any situation here i've last back for a long time and it's one of one for a long time if i challenge right here i know he sees me i know for a fact he sees me and he would have hit this around me right you can see when he starts swinging toward the ball he would have to surround me but i turned away in time and now because of the fake challenge that i did very well there we got the ball for free put it away and my team was able to get back so we gotta have a very rough situation very good patience here i was lost back again because garrett died so i killed a lot of time on that clear had a monkey man get in his way they try from justin i'm gonna fake this probably probably should have faked it i thought like me watching this back i feel like i would have faked it but i didn't there so i was actually surprised by that but that's a good example of what they do in the corner so they try to play it around you and then just go for 50s they try to stay in your corner and make 50s that make your life awkward and difficult see how hard he made it on justin and garrett there because they don't know what he's going to do again good control out there we're doing a good job of this game of controlling it justin was able to pass this back to me i don't think he was yeah look where it look where it is right so the only way he can actually pass this back to me is if he jumps up and saves his flip and if he does that i think mark probably gets here so yeah it's a very tough spot to get out of there's a good shot from justin it's from garrett i'm trying to pass this mid probably it's a good pass you can try from justin he doesn't even have to go for that there really but there's a chance that if he goes for that we can get to go out of it another good good fit the attempt from monkey moon there slowed down a lot now you know he's in an awkward spot and he's slowed down well should be fine forget this game just happened but i honestly forgot what happened a lot of a lot of the time it's crazy how quick i forget i should go here so i know my team is such an awkward spark it's a good pass for monkey moon and there's one up for this action is probably scoring this if i don't touch this so i'm the one watching the mid pass here so in a scenario if this pass uh this ball goes across here marcus where is he wait where is mark oh never mind what happened hold on how did he get here okay okay you missed all right nevermind see i actually would have scored this for sure so if i didn't touch this ball good touch to get that out of danger i think their goal to win this was not very good i think it was a kickoff goal i want to say and that's a thing too i don't want to blame ping but the kickoffs like this team has a very good kickoff to be honest they do so every kickoff you have to play a little bit different and i forgot to play it different on the kickoff coming up so i turned a little bit early i think it was and the ball goes right and then flies left on my screen because of the eu ping so this thing was super hard to react to and then get us left in a bad situation so you'll see you'll be able to see what happens well i'm even i'm safe cheating i'm not even going that far forward here to be honest but this ball you can see me turn left because this ball actually goes left on my screen and then i have to turn right late and then garrett's left in this one situation and uh mark doesn't do anything he just fakes it and garrett just gets fake that's a very tough spot to be in there because you have to watch high you have to be careful with the high but i think like this is the first time i ever played this team the more we played them we'd understand that they like to fake these situations quite a bit that's a very good uh fake from them honestly a little bit unfortunate that the kickoff they would have did on my screen because i probably would be able to react to this but either way i took a pipe for them they're off's very solid though throughout these games one thing that was always very very consistent with them is they managed to get possession off kickoff very very often even when they're on our servers even though we won every single game on our servers um they managed to get possession off every kickoff so that's uh definitely something that you guys will see i'll watch the six one game last because there's a lot of goals in there so we can see we did well to get goals on them uh but we'll watch another close game because that was a one to two game let's watch it three two let's watch the three two n a three two game this is what their ping looks like by the way on n a server so it's pretty similar but the thing is you don't know how their routing is to these servers because again my specific routing to the european servers canada to eu is very bad uh us to eu normally isn't too bad according to justin and garrett this is fine so it should be okay for them it's not necessarily about what the number is because my number is lower than say monkey moon's 124 it's like 112 i think my opinion is but uh it's not necessarily about that because some of the servers feel awful they feel like over 250 ping even though my pings on like 112 for example so yeah that's just a little idea of how the pings working might feel different but uh let's try to ignore that and get into the games like i tried to ignore it for the the other games because all you can really do when it comes to these cross region matches good flick from justin so monkey is playing first man here and they do this really well he just he sits here he just sits here because he's first man all he has to do is bait justin's flick right he does that early he jumps you know it's over him it doesn't matter because extra is a free ball that's a smart play from them the first man plays the role pretty well good control good job to play it around them almost got around another one there that was a good play go back to gear up you for a bit here it's my ball to clean up here it's going for the boost good control out of our side really well done i get a bump on them get out of our half and we keep pressure off of it drop from justin what am i about to go for here right to the corner well that's the awkward spot to be in okay let's see what happened here so i cut out this ball because i know extras under me up for this right so i cut this out hit it to the side it's actually a pretty good touch only downside to this is that aerial so high that i have to fall down now right so he hits it off the wall i just land here gear gate gets me to this ball i flip back as i should be and i think justin was slightly out of position for this so see what happened justin people so i intercept the pass i'm landing now you got a little bit confused if guerra's gonna be able to reach it or not and he moved up a little bit far so i think he was just expecting garrett to make contact on that and i was obviously falling down off the interception so that's a a good shot from mark catch us out there good control look at play got it round one good job to go for the bump here it forces them off a bit good bumps from extra they look for bumps at very good times as well which makes this team very very tough to play in those spots when they can go for the bumps going for more bumps controlling all on the corner here that's very good let's get back to our pov so i know one of my teammates is getting bumped here so i take my time controlled us i don't go for my boost so i don't worry about that get it over one with the flick go down for the bumps now forces out a touch to the wall but for two bumps it's gonna play and i say my boost ball here go back to their pov drop from garrett played around one good challenge from garrett again beat from justin nice they're just waiting they're very patient on their defense which is smart put it over to justin one thing about monkey moon i will say is one of the best players that just intercepting these like high passes he's very very fast in the air very quick to get to the ball he always reaches it and he gets in the way something very good about about him as a player his interceptions and the way he tries to move downfield and get in the way of plays is very good let's see what i do here we have a lot of time here garrett pops us up he called it he's popping it up once so i go for this i have a full boost i put this to the ceiling so i can play it to myself and i see mark really close to me i see garrett middle but he's backwards so all i can do here is really play it away because i don't want mark to have a free double tap attempt here so i play it over them puts them in a pretty rough spot that was a good play good touches around them should turn here like i beat it's fine i didn't jump for the ball i just baited it out so it's going to be easier to play for my team make a play on this only bad side is is justin kind of had to wait a very long time on this ball because he wasn't sure what's going to happen and then garrett has to commit as well to help out and that leaves both of them pushing forward which leaves me last man back for a while because like garrett just flipped midfield justin's out of position with 12 boosts now and i'm back for quite a while on full boost but i have to get in the way this because actually up for another touch i jump up i get in the way and i'm falling down again in a bad spot i can't recover and justin's a little bad position because again that double commit that happened earlier is a little bit unlucky i want to see how that had to play out i think i got a better touch to the corner just a rough spot together because i don't want to get bumped here either if i get bumped to go against me so happens two goes down now half the game left though a lot of time here for the bump i did bump him but didn't do enough somehow let's go back on their pov here it's a good shot from justin it's really close try so watch justin pov actually so again i'm first challenging you see what i do here in a situation really good thing to do in threes especially when they have the ball in their corner you got to think with a 100 boost how much can you really do right you can't really air dribble across the whole field from where he is especially when you have to use already 20 boost to get to this point so all he could really do is play it around me so all i do there is i just drive up i make a situation awkward so he has to be worried about my challenge and i just back off not only does that get the ball over his own teammate by accident but now gary has a free challenge and we're actually in a pretty good position here and we gotta go out of it so me just baiting this ball out actually gets sickle made it out i kept my boost and i'm in a position where i could still follow it up very good 50 from garrett as well take his time on this very patient challenges from both of us there and actually tried to get in the way and he actually just helped me because i saw that he was gonna flip into this ball so i kind of just used my flip into him when i use my foot to pinch it in those are good challenges on the wall they're smart here it's last for a little bit here it's a good read take this good control to get out of that very very weird situation to be honest on the wall there got from justin i'm gonna pull this back i should go for the demo and extra here i did but a little too far and we have one waiting left this is a really good setup from us if you look at the field our coverage here is actually really good so we have one right in the middle one all the way far right and which is me and one left side which is garrett so he hits this right side i jumped early which is a mistake here i should have waited wall um but most of the time that actually would have been okay if i had waited but mark deals with this perfectly to be honest because he's lost back for a while here he takes his ball plays it to himself plays it around me which is very well done from him we still end up getting the the win on the challenge out of it but it was still really well played play from mark there end up hitting it across the justin off that got the mid boost here should be my ball to go for very good light touch to myself good pass to garrett what a shot beautiful beautiful beautiful this happened earlier but i already forgot that this happened this is a really good play so i i have full control again this all came from that three-man push down field we're all watching something right i called garrett off this right away extra's here on the wall and what is he doing he's doing the same thing that i did in that previous play where his first man just trying to bait out the touch for me so he drives up see here turns around right away tries to battle touch for me i didn't panic i didn't throw it away put it softly down to myself his bait now effectively did nothing so i technically got by extra by not throwing that ball away now monkey's up i see him i see garrett middle played around them well at this point there's nothing the last man back can do if you go to his pov he's stuck flat-footed it's all in garrett's hands he hits his shot it's a goal and he does so effectively the first man bait from extra because it wasn't good enough and didn't get me to throw with the ball it becomes a little bit closer to me there i'm i'm panicked i have to do something but i know i have the full advantage in that play played that really well there's almost nothing they can do in a situation so monkey moon pov again he's probably gonna think i'm banging this as well i'm coming to the ball with a little bit of speed then i slow down played around them which is really good and then perfect top corner shot nothing they can do about that very good shot from garrett good job to slow down on that as well beautiful and that's to tie it up two goal come back very good stuff the little things the little things like that first man bait paying attention to the first man understanding what the first man does in most teams very important in threes very good demo first man's goal is almost always to get the ball out to their team almost always so you gotta always pay attention to that i'm trying to bump there i should have stayed for a touch maybe but it's fine too because it goes straight back to garrett good high touch double tap to myself let's go to their pbi i made it out two here so i got extra pov here but it's a left wall to myself b2 off that's big and now we're in a position where we can fit to the last guy pretty good spot to be in i don't have a past middle here and it's better to let gary get back so it's a very good place to kill time there now they're all in like a panicky situation ball got baited out for garrett and off of that we get a goal so that's really well done again stemming from when we have our time we're in this position we know we have to do in this position we're killing time for our players to get back behind us we beat two people to that ball and then just another good 50 here with no boost plays it straight to garrett who takes his ball and does very very good shot with this garrett played really well this game very good control every game was super close though every game in eu every game on na is super close except for the last game i should show you guys and we'll see why that was not a close one we'll see why it was a blow i'm not sure why it was i don't remember but we'll see the goals after this here it's kind of trolling try to bump me there go for a shot it's like a challenge are you off the ceiling like this look how many options you cover right you have your flip the whole time so i just wait on the ceiling i just wait i cover anything middle you can't pass middle here my team behind me justin's ground right we have everything covered high and then the low just covering the only way he can go here is left we know that he's full boost covering that i'm covering anything high let me go for a shot on that not a bad idea winning down left if he can pass he ended up winning that but it's fine nice from garrett it's a good challenge very good challenge to make break that out again so i'm not even planning on going for a challenge here just to force him to make that touch and it gives gear to potential free shots it's a good play to make try play to the corner and try to block his dunk here as well  the hit really a challenge from justin i think mark is going for a bump here if he turns off ball cam i think he's definitely going for a bump yeah i think he was going for bumpy just let that ball came on that would have been a goal i think i would have just locked it in maybe i could have gotten back i might have might have got back not sure good job to get over one there zero seconds now we're normally pretty good at killing it in this situation and there we go we had everything blocked again if you got the shot off i would have been there if you look at his pov where can this ball really go from this angle when he's shooting right i'm gonna be by the time he shoots his ball i'll be around here there's almost no way that whole angle is cut off there's almost no way he can get it in the top corner by the time he'd be able to shoot that ball yeah that's well done blocked every angle it's a pretty good game all around let's get into the last game now the 6-1 game and let's see why this was such a blow of a game i want to save every replay that i can make this video for you guys because no one's ever seen two na and eu teams play each other online this year and everyone wants to see that there's been no lands for so long everyone really wants to see it so i wanted to get this video out to you guys i can't show you guys every game but i want to show you guys at least one of the european games and then some of the na games yeah five to three was the total score in games today we won three on na we won two on eu and they won uh three on eu this is a good play here so i'm third man here i gotta play a third man roll good 50 from garrett now i have to wait i have full boost in this position which is really good but i have to wake his extra if he jumps here which he did he beats me to this ball he made a mistake he backflip so as soon as i see him backflip you'll see my decision making that's when i go for the kill i go for the the shot immediately as soon as i see him backflip that's my pretty much green light to challenge that ball and i'm gonna beat anybody because mark should expect him to be up for this right because actually probably called i'm up and he's looking for who's up on our team no one's up right because we're all respecting the fact that extra should be up for this and as soon as i see that he's not that's why i go on that right away instantly because i know mark's gonna have to make up for that mistake and i just dust some terrible but that's all because of extra obviously making this mistake which happens that's something that definitely just happens this is a really good challenge from garrett and this is why i like these a lot you didn't do anything here really he drove into the ball he drove into it right you didn't do anything crazy and that's all you need sometimes just enough watch that some people for a bit here all right i'm lost back for a bit see how i deal with this tried to go for a ceiling pinch downfield not a bad idea a good touch from justin good bump on mark i don't know how that's not a kill to be honest so i'm i'm first man here i know mark i know the situation i know that both of their players are back like on our side so if i bump mark here with garrett in this position is really good for us because whether this is a backboard touch or a straight up shot it's gonna be in so i hunt for the the bump on mark here and i just don't know how that's not a demo i'm full speed the whole time right i have the purple lines behind my card the whole time should be dead for sure but it's okay we got a garrett's pov now mark almost got bumped into the perfect spot where the ball got placed there really good shot from garrett but again if mark got demo it would have been a lot easier for him to not have to worry about him but well played from gay good bump there has first man gonna cheat from justin i tried to hit this off the ceiling for garrett like either fast off the ceiling or straight down for him and i messed up a little bit but it's fun those are the little mistakes you shouldn't look at too much big goal steal for me there huge as well played from justin good beat on extra and then he gets one touch and monkey moon ends up hitting the tip of it which is unlucky it would have went over either way but the fact that i hit the tip of him and went straight in a little bit unfortunate but it happened that would have been a goal regardless because justin got it over either way you could tell this was getting over him either way right there that was definitely over he was last back so regardless it was going to be a goal we got a good steal on that get to chase it down have my time here played around one try to go for the shot actually would have been a goal if it was on target slightly wide though it's a good idea got some pads here they touch back from garrett played off the wall for my team again or for his double just baiting this ball out i have no intention of actually going for this i'm just baiting it again did i just leave it for justin these are for the person with the better angle on the ball and now we have possession out of that yeah i got kind of confused so i was gonna go for this ball right here i decided not to because i thought garrett was really close i thought garrett can possibly get in the way and gary had no intention of actually going for the ball so it was a little bit awkward and it was kind of a bad assumption but here's the thing here if gary goes through this it's fine if i go back and don't jump it's fine so either way you could look at both of the mistake but the safest thing that should always be done here is me as third man should be playing deeper back and that would like completely avoid the situation every single time so this is way more way more my fault than it ever is garrett's it's just my mistake was the assumption that gary can maybe go here so i instead of going for this ball which also would have worked i backed off last second and then i had to try to recover and get back so garrett's pov here he had full boost but it's just such a tough ball to go for and my pb definitely looked like he had a better angle on it but still good speed from uh from mark regardless definitely definitely a mistake for me though i should've been further back but it was an awkward situation it was like the other game where uh justin was creeped up a little far cause he thought gary can get a touch on it again kind of a bad habit that we have that we're trying to to get rid of we all kind of make that mistake this is a good touch back here by the way as well almost a really good play so monkey moves up i hate this around him to garrett left side garrett has time he's off the wall he tried to get his back mid to me it looked like if this skimmed the middle to me and i was able to shoot that that would have been insane that would have been such a beautiful play good double from justin good 50 win as well yeah i should go for this that's really well played from them so let's see what i did here if i challenge that that's fine that's fine it stops monkeys hit downfield actually now has to go alone on this ball and garrett's now the person needs a challenge first in this play so he challenges doesn't need to get a touch on his ball he just forces that second touch quicker than it needs to be and now that leaves justin with what should be an easier ball to deal with even though it is still tough that's an easier one to deal with for sure get back to my pov for a bit all right so right here this is kind of awkward because i know there's someone's gonna be behind me i hear someone really close to me right in reality this guy's actually over here i think he's over here so in my head i can't see anything that's the only downside of a ball cam here i can't see anything so i think he's around here when really he's down here and gary and justin can't really call that quick enough it's kind of hard to call uh but i see him at this point this is when i know i can wait i don't need a panning through this ball i need to jump to this ball because i am technically closer than he is so i could just wait for this so i just get a soft touch i don't panic to it beat the other guy which is big good touch from garrett and the beautiful shot so i all came again from the the patients on defense every time we've been patient on defense this whole series every single game we played them we uh did really well beat that guy very good read from garrett off the ceiling and then what can you do if you're on defense here look at the defenders in this play right very very tough spot to be in who got beat initially to this ball it was extra so he gets beat here and garrett up immediately and the really really quick follow-up monkey was the one that tried to challenge this that's just nothing you can do situations way too tough really well played from garrett there again see what happened here wasn't sure good play from garrett just a float there could be that's fine should be fun only as bad as the monkey moon gets the bump on justin which he was kind of close to going for some crazy stuff would have been a goal not a bad idea good patience there you know we can't shoot off that like a full boost i wonder if that was a pass mid or not why i moved up that way it's kind of weird i wasn't sure if he was able to get it it just looked awkward in general so i wanted to be there to support in case very interesting little wave dash there i would have loved to get the brazil here i think we just barely barely missed some opportunities at the end it would have definitely been funny the first like big n a verse eu match up that happened energy versus bds was like a brazil in it which would have been funny in fact we got six here is still insane really good fake from garrett so here let's go back to where it starts let's go back to the sequence i just drove into this ball another good drive challenge creates a lot of pressure on them i'm gonna go for a bump sweep across the net turn up the mid boost here and now i'm second man i kind of i cut my rotation here but that's fine because i know justin look he was back in a spot where it would have been good from two but i already have momentum so why not my little turn let justin keep his boost and we gotta go out of it so it's fine that's a fine situation to turn and if justin told me to turn i don't remember but i decided to turn anyway good touch from garrett there very good speed be extra by pretty good pretty good margin here right that's gonna leave gear in a pretty good situation look how much time he has now in this spot to make a choice monkey moon his last man back he knows that he has to wait for whatever gear wants to do here and garrett just waits for the very last second to shoot which is very smart extra pov here pops it up hashtag in the way for his last back went up really quick for that and then garrett very slow look at monkeyman pov probably got faked by garrett's slow shot yeah your way to the very last moment very smart oh sorry i won't get your pov yeah very very good fake has got all the advantage in that situation he knows that very smart smart ball to do that on nice these are the most threatening situations to be in i swear very good kick off from us by the way good 50 win takes one touch and just plays the middle immediately i'm ready for it because the guy on the wall here you have so many things you have to cover because justin could fake this ball as well right it's actually well played for monkey moon to go back wall here it covers a lot of the options when you're back wall but it's bad because this pass-up bill is a lot more threatening on your back wall so that's well played for justin to notice that he probably spotted out monkey moon immediately yeah he did so he sees monkey right away here and that's why he's able to make that pass so quick he knows the best play to make because how do you cover this pass out middle from there you can't even if you flip out as quick as you can like you did there you simply can't cover that pass and i turn out wide here this is like a good idea to do any situations turn out wide because i don't know how far across this pass is going to go so stay in a spot where you can react to both the really wide touch and the really close touch like this one is a little bit closer side to turn left and we still got a really good shot out of it so i was well played now we got a minute here i'm in here and i don't think any goals come with this but we can see how close you were to the brazil very good like boost conservation though from our whole team when i watch these replays back something i noticed we're all doing a really good job of holding our boost and all they're wasting it in bad spots good touch to this i know a shot is never going to go in here right i'm never intending on shooting this ball and i even called in calms i'm just going to bounce it like make it awkward for him because never in a million years with this ball if i shoot this go in if mark and monkey are in this part of the field right you have monkey being able to cover this whole side of the net which you can react to very easily he could probably save anything i shoot even if it's up here at this point from where the ball is back here if i shoot up here monkey is still saving that very easily and mark's on this side so mark has everything that's on this side of the net and he's everything on this side of the net no shot anything i shoot here will be uh a goal so this is the best thing i could have done and look how much more awkward it makes for situation if justin didn't pre-jump but he was just trying like see what would happen it would have been uh a free ball for him to to clean up right that doesn't matter obviously we're up five goals but that's just a situation where you shouldn't shoot that was good help there awkward spot for them to be in waiting right side here because again garrett has this option to pass mid potentially right so if he does get that around them i'll be there for it he's got a weight here should i play this out smart bit at the ball well for garrett would have potentially been a goal if i got past and that was a good bump from garrett a challenge from justin well done clicked over one here over two and mark's going to get a good cleanup touch here put aside see there people on that uh look marcus challenge is a little bit obvious and then extras in a bad situation because he's a low boost it's probably been expected to get over monkey so quick we got three seconds left now i got fake to that ball i wanted the goal i wanted to go i wanted it quick that's going to be a game it's a good kill for monkey the style points nice double you guys going to be up this one though starting from this game again every game that's red are the ones that we lost every game that's not red are the ones that we won so you can just see i'll go through it again so you guys can see obviously you can't see every single game i want to show you guys three out of all of these but uh final score was five to three was a lot of fun they're very solid team they're passing their team play their individual play is all very good the way they play the defense very smart players i could definitely see why their best team in eu by a good margin you can tell when you're playing them what makes them so good whether i think they're better than na teams it's impossible to tell i don't think there's a single person on this planet that can call whether they are better or not and i don't want to say that because we beat them in this scrim or because we beat them in this this match against them that we're better than them because that's not how this works it's impossible to tell who's better until there's a land and until then we need to just accept that there are so many very good teams in this game right now and we'll never know who the best is until those lands come back so we need to just chill be happy that we have so many talented teams to watch be happy that we have so many good matchups to come and uh just wait for that time to come but i'm super excited to play these guys on land i think they're three very talented players and they definitely deserve all the success that they've had and much appreciated that they're able to make this cross region scrim happen and switch service with us and be you know willing to do that as we were as well and uh yeah hope you guys enjoyed the video let me know if you want to see more stuff like this in the future maybe we can get some more scrims with other youtubes maybe even some more scrims bds and review for you guys and uh i'll see you guys in the next one i love you guys so much thank you guys for always watching you guys for always supporting peace how could i trust you when you hurt me
