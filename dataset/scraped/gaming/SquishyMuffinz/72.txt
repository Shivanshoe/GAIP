yo what's up guys today's video gonna be playing with the brand new bmw so this came out not too long ago so bmw m240i actually came out like probably like three four days ago but i've been a little bit late on making this video so i did tell you guys i would make one though so here it is this is the decal that comes with it it looks pretty cool so i'm gonna use it for today play some games get into us even get some dubs see how it goes all right we got rumble off the bar we're playing a full squad that's queued up together and i think if i'm not mistaken we're pretty close to ssl and this could be wrong but i thought i was getting pretty close to ssl on this i wanted to try to guess on all these extra game modes too just kind of hard to cue them super often and they're also like random as well for a random feeling it's a good save there i don't know what uh hitboxes cars by the way guys i should probably do that research before doing a video like this but i'm trying to just go off of it based off like feel what it feels like to play with every time i get that that boot and rumble i always do the same thing i just use it immediately i gotta flip off that didn't i i like trying to get the power ups that you can actually score off of oh i thought i had my flip still for some reason didn't play that i wanted to this feels to me more like dominus than it does octane but lately some of these long cars are for some reason been octane hitbox i don't know how it's possible but on their way they're chasing me singling me out i think this is definitely more likely to be dominus at fox than anything [Music] oh you had a plunder my weakness i think one of them is just hard demoing me that's what it looks like trying to eliminate me from the game oh i thought maybe that could work i double touched that that i switched to the last defender if no one left dude they're getting the plungers at the perfect time give me that yes sir other 200 iq pop though his last name back [Music] well done for my teammate to be ready i'm trying to get some dribbles going some air dribbles see how the car really feels i like the way it looks a lot i mean this car's well you can't go wrong with it even in real life it looks really nice ah did not bounce out of one i was going for the double and i hit that that corner lipper doesn't come out anymore how do you go for a play here oh my god it was crazy if i timed that flippery i would have backflipped off the post that'd been insane [Music] so i hit this one more actually i can just use the magnet i almost made a moon goal i should have done that i should let him just hit it in i like this decal too it's actually like the only truly fiery looking decal even like fire god i think it's called doesn't look this fiery i thought you'd have that kind of i kind of like cancelled out my area when i saw him jump also the exciting news that most of you guys probably already know about but we qualified for sweden which i mentioned in the previous video i think but i will be gone for i think like two weeks probably but i'll still try to have videos uploaded starting i think it's like the beginning of december i'm gonna have to travel december first like 13th or something like that so i'll try to stop videos for you guys it might just be a little bit less than usual but it should still be around three to four videos a week it should still be around there i'll try my best to have that and i have to record a lot ahead of time though for you guys i don't want to leave you with that uploads it's the last thing i want to do i've always stayed consistent even when i had to travel so i want to keep it that way that was weird i feel like i definitely should have had a flip there if i got my flip that's a goal by the way right here yeah i don't know didn't give me a flip for someone either that's me not understanding the car probably [Music] felt weird there for sure but i've had that in octane too no yeah i feel a little bit off on this car there's something like even that ground double i don't know it's very as well normally how i feel on like octane um to dominance that that difference is like normally messes me up so i'm assuming this is like a dom hitbox it takes me like a game to get used to and i'm gonna figure much better with it [Music] when we hit off the back wall doesn't matter where it goes that guy yes sir we're using our abilities pretty well actually i'm quite proud of how we played this game i feel like we normally don't use our abilities all that well we just focus on like the game itself they're so used to the default game mode we're actually doing a good job of being bull take this back boost oh i thought i skimmed it like i got the smallest touch to steal it my team's going crazy too so it helps i don't know how i feel about this car though for me okay dominic i've lost like a lot of love for dominic it's not gonna lie if you guys remember my channel i think it was like a year ago i i said i'm switching to dom i use it for like probably like a month or two you guys actually thought i was serious and i thought i was serious and then i just remembered the octane just the best part in the game and it's not even close there have been a few moments where i've questioned the rockets the best and fennec thenx release was one of them that i remember i said is this going to be the new octane you're going to improve doctrine and a lot of people started using fennec a lot of pros actually use it and even to this day pro still use it so i wouldn't say i was too far off with that that comment but i don't know if you could beat the og octane man i don't think you can can exactly beat it this car feels okay though it does feel okay for me i'm not a long car player anymore if you are a dominus lover you'll like this car i think the look of it is quite nice if you have a bmw in real life i'm sure you'll love this car no i missed time to i got for the last i can actually touch one more goal here i'm saving it oh i think i go so fast [Music] all right good first game look at the fire on this thing united in rivalry all right we're actually not close to ssl at all on this i thought we were so much closer what are we close to it in oh we have it in hoops okay we have it and that's what i was thinking of all right we got the next game whatever we get we'll play see how it goes let's go we got snow day wait i'm actually hyped to play this i think i truly think that the long cars are a cheat code for snow day that's exactly what i want to end the video off on it's a banger snow day game long cars are actually a cheat code for this mod you stay grounded you stay i'm air dribbling don't care oh wait the my bit of my bad it caught me off guard all good oh my gosh that went fast okay that's not even his fault really the physics are just weird in this mode he tried to dribble it i'm flying it's a good kickoff you could read it around him good whoosh is afk he's not feeling it oh he's back now i think his controller was just dc in or something i was good oh i thought he was leaving it all good played over one 50 this guy i'm playing like it's threes oh i'm dead [Music] try to play it smart get out of defense slow create some chances i feel like you can use the same theory and do well on this should be a goal nicely done crushinator it's crazy he's going absolutely crazy what's that profile picture though wait that's a sick title online it's sick i wonder if i have that [Music] no i had the right idea i was trying to get like there's like a touch you can get in this mode where it skims off the bottom of your car and just absolutely fly like pinches really fast trying to get it there [Music] did i control this bounce down for me no the double dude i'm like just on the brink of greatness in this mode always and then i just barely missed oh no my idea did not work there at all found a pinch again nope that was the most technical anticlimactic pinch i've ever done oh good i got it oh [Music] dude the bounce either it either like actually bounces or completely dies and you'll never know which one it is i'm staying on this oh i want to add something crazy i wonder if could flip he said this i'm gonna go for one maybe if i can if the chance comes up for it take our time here i tried to chip it around him like it's a ball forgot what mode we're playing all right i was also again trying to getting ready to dribble that wait the wall dashes might be crazy in this all good under control oh my almost not under control my team trusts me still see what they do here this is good oh my we're so strong oh my gosh wait we're crazy look how strong we are this guy comes in hey from there oh and then i forgot about that honestly well i have really bad memory short-term memory loss i guess wait my team is crazy try to get back and help them dude look at the speed on my squad members huge bump oh passing play mini one nice [Music] no i should went for like uh wait wait oh we're crazy i should run for like um like a delayed musty or like a musty off that i feel like maybe you can get some crazy flicks on this thing in the air dude my team is nasty though this car feels like it feels like you turn like fast for some reason i don't know if i'm losing my mind i feel like even in the air you're like aerial really quick feeling maybe i'm like placebo'd for some reason or this just oh one other guy's rage quit mc hammer daddy he had enough [Music] all good [Music] nice no he didn't bump me this is just absolute domination what more can you say this car this car like does not suit me at all does not suit me at all but i do think that it has potential like i said if you're a long car lover especially i thought there's a lot of bmw lovers out there i feel like it's still gonna be a popular car for those people for sure i just need a car that just like beats the octane man i need i need something that like for sure beats the octane that way i can actually commit to switching to a different car panic is like still the closest thing i just don't think it'll ever be quite as good but again like the way i think about it is this like i've used octane for probably like 12 000 of my 13 14 000 hours in this game so why would i ever switch to another car and have to like relearn everything about it you know what i mean even if it's the same hitbox the visual is going to be different so why would i have to relearn all the visual cues everything about the car i feel like it'd just be like not smart to switch unless it was for sure just felt better than knocking in every way like i said fennec was the only thing that came even close to that and it's the same hitbox and everything even then i just still don't see why you'd use it over talking [Music] how do i even do that one more for the boys he'll be set and you flip your set i feel like that should have been it but didn't give it to me all right it's gonna be here for today's video though i hope you guys enjoyed if you guys haven't tried this card yeah i think it's worth trying out honestly i do think it's worth trying out and it's awesome hard to tell exactly how good it is because we weren't able to find real ranked games we're just playing like extra modes and stuff but i do like it i do like the way it feels i like the way it looks especially the the decal that i was using i think i like it a lot but um my 100 honest opinion i will not use this over the octane ever uh but it is nice it's definitely nice visually i think it's a cool thing that they added into the game you guys should definitely give it a try love you guys hope you guys enjoyed the video and i'll see you guys the next one peace [Music] [Music] you
