and i hope you guys enjoy today's video love y'all yo what's up guys today we're here with a different kind of video but a video that i've wanted to do for a while it is a fun one fun idea and it's a good challenge for me personally i think it's going to be a lot of fun to see how it ends up so we're playing against my friend austin and my friend jegs yeah jake's been a mod of mine for a very long time on my twitch channel he's uh been supporting me for a very long time on there and he always helps out in chat and stuff like that he's a good friend of mine austin good friend of mine as well and both of these guys are grand champ austin is around 1800 mmr and the eggs around 1550 so just recently reached grand champs so they're both grand champ players not going to be the easy match whatsoever but it is doable so we'll see if we can win the 1v2 against two grand champs i've never tried this before i've tried i think a 1v4 against diamonds and we were able to win that but i don't know about 1v2 against grain champs we'll see let's get straight into it let's even get some dubs play best of three for today let's see how it goes all right i let them know what's the best of three i'm trying slightly new camera settings for this so i'm not sure how we're gonna do but we'll see austin's got the supersonic legend title on you know he's about to be hitting bangers he's already the highest rank all right kickoffs are the hardest thing in my opinion in these 1v2s because if you lose the kickoff hard they're just going to have a free reign to do whatever they want they're also in comms right now by the way guys they're in discord together so it's going to make this even harder to try to win we'll see what we can do though i'm gonna try to fake this play the 50. instead of going for the the full risk shot i actually bait them in a lot that was a good play that's a good dribble started off there's going to be a lot of trying to bait them in for sure that's the main way we're going to get goals here i got to fake the kick off i don't have much of another option it's a good fake to get the possession for free and we don't risk them winning that cheat oh good bump from yeg gotta go back here he's gonna have possession on the wall and he is good enough to do something with it so i gotta be careful holy flick austin's definitely the one we gotta worry about more yeg's a lot more on the inconsistent side like you can tell when you watch them as a newly promoted grand champ like not super high mmr player you could tell he has um quite a few things to work on still but austin is pretty solid like he doesn't really make many mistakes and he hits the ball well every time try to fake this get one touch that's not a good touch at all not what i wanted so i'm just gonna back off gotta hold on to my boost oh no i keep thinking they're gonna shoot on target oh i should sword on oh man i'm overestimating some of the things they're doing and then i'm underestimating other things so i gotta find a a decent in between but it's okay we'll we'll find our footing we'll find our groove it's a awkward awkward matchup straight off the backs i kind of know how both of them play they obviously know how i play and yeah i'm just trying to find a something that works i guess a strategy that'll work the whole time decent bounce i don't have any boost here so it makes a little bit awkward let's get a touch follow it up ourselves there we go that was a good place so i got to get those 1v1 situations to go my way or else this is just not winnable i think as soon as i start booming the ball to them they have so many options they can bump me they could do whatever really so i gotta start just trying to make it as many 1v1 situations as possible i skyed it oh my god also guys it is 6 a.m right now we all have not slept it's uh interesting scenario for sure so there will be open end bases there will be some mistakes but i wanted to come through with the dub that's what we're going for oh couldn't save it it wasn't doable too much power too much sauce in the shot i'm gonna go for the faking off that's good get the boost try to control this i'm gonna fake him i'm gonna leave that i'm gonna leave that make it awkward for him i was actually really good control good touch to slow that down should be able to score this there we go yeah i can catch the eggs on those awkward situations it would be interesting to see how it do against two 1800 mmrs because yagi is a lower mmr i think two could probably beat every time but i think as soon as you get to 1800 range they're too solid and they're a lot smarter they have more game sense in general that's when it gets tougher in my opinion like what wait how did i even do this wait what the [ __ ] what is that i've actually never seen that before i feel like i didn't even like flip wrong that was really weird [Music] i obviously didn't do something right but didn't feel all that wrong when i was doing it and normally i could tell something like that's gonna be messed up but that one did not feel weird until then until it just skimmed off my car that way it's a good 50 all right minute 30 to go like i said trying slightly new settings right now my control in the air especially is a little bit different than i'm used to it feels weird at first but i think these settings are more consistent for everything else that's worth it to get used to i think yeah go to the play try to blast a shot there we go now controlling is like gonna be the biggest thing man i'm telling you the only way we win this is just taking smart touches and controlling over one might be in there we go that was good that's what i mean like on the ground these settings were really good in the air i'm still getting used to how it feels to control the ball but you shouldn't really be going for too many like aerial like risky plays anyway oh my god the placement all right we brought it back after the own goal somehow brought it back yes this is the best of three so we can get the best possible most consistent result and um if you guys want to see more videos like this in the future against different ranks like 1v4s or 1v7s like 1v7 is against like a bunch of silvers or stuff like that i'm down i'll put it up to you guys that you just gotta let me know just faking them you might be able to get back now i don't think austin can go he had no boost so i can hit this back to myself i'll leave the boost so i get the 50 first then i can get the boost controllers up the wall i won't be one i could just boom this probably top corner there we go if you guys want the settings i'm using by the way they're right here 60 stiffness is the main thing that changes a lot of the control feeling in the air that's the one thing that feels off to me when i use high stiffness that's something i gotta get used to but i think everything else was so much better on the ground that's a good shot from austin those are hard to get under the bar that was well placed well place [Music] actually like a super underrated shot to hit consistently yeah austin seems very consistent the eggs like could be passing these balls or it could be like doing different things in situations then he seems to go for the solo play more so i think if he used his teammate a little bit more it would be better but game one in the back yes playing solid though too so it's a good match up eight to six final score for game one and we had two own goals in there um so yeah hopefully we'll do better in the next one let's get into what could be the last game of the video if they win we'll go into the tiebreaker match we get let's get to the next see if we can keep it up let go let go so we know we want to do i think the hard part is still kickoffs for me because if i lose these hard or i lose them the wrong way then uh they get a free go out of it pretty much it's gonna fake the first one try to make it wait for them to turn around this get a better angle on the ball i'm gonna fake this trying to just bait them out that's one out of the play hold the austin go that's two that's good i can take the mid boost now there's no danger in doing that i just try to bait this get control he's gonna have i'll go down over there you pretty jump is the other that's what i mean they're like too solid where you can't like just solo play everything because they're gonna be ready for it so you gotta try to play the safer route on the floor gonna wait for shot here ready for the follow-up shot yeah it's too hard i had to worry about the bump from austin if i had a little bit more boost and i didn't have to worry about the bump there that's pretty easy safe to make but the situation was made really weird just because of austin honestly at the bump that's a big boost still from them again i just don't know how to play kick off out it just feels really awkward to me every time on kickoff just save me some boost here should be okay i don't think jaeger will go for this either it's over one there we i was go really hard on the players right there it's all i'm looking at like super tunnel videos i'm super tunnel vision there on if they're gonna challenge me or not that's when i decide if i'm gonna flick over one trying to fit together that'd be really good if i had a teammate but in this it doesn't really do much it's a good 50. i'm gonna fake this try to get over one but keep it close i faked them both i kind of just make the egg and he bumped awesome there i'll just be annoying on this let's see a block it's not bad i actually could play from them should i control this there we go that's a good play take our time there those are the solo plays you want to go for because there's no way they can challenge so you want to take advantage of those when you can i'm gonna go quick and then just back off there you guys will get a challenge as well timed the boost is the big thing here because he doesn't have any yet but if he gets a good control on this i can't do anything yeah kickoff is still so hard man i can't figure him out i can't figure out what to do different because they know i'm faking now so i should just try to win it i think but then that happens it's so hard okay that was good let's try to push keep my boost here i'm gonna fake this i'm actually gonna go i just wanted to get a bad touch i could bait this this could be good for us go for the bump damn i hit the bottom of this car for some reason the bottom of the car hitbox if you go for the bumps on those it just doesn't work that's a huge boost still from them i have to wait now austin's dribble is actually really good though like they're pretty solid makes it like super awkward every time which is good that's a tough thing to learn and like do consistently over one he's gonna have down the wall i gotta wait it's a good 50. it's gonna shoot high might have placed it there we go yeah yeah has to be worried about that being in so you just pre-jumped it that's not really on him the own goal like that is really unlucky because you don't know how that's gonna bounce oh did i place it that's huge that's massive actually massive you went for the speed flip i think you slightly messed it up oh that's bad okay so that's what i mean like the kickoffs like that i just don't know how else to play it because they know i'm faking now i didn't have control i guess i should just fake and shadow defend probably the better play then they get the boost and then it's even more awkward it's just so tough every time look at the pads all right 30 boost here might be okay i'm gonna keep getting some pads when i can hopefully he just killed time hopefully he just kills the time for me actually good for us might be a double there we go that was a good play i could go for those solo plays more but the thing is if they're on back wall i'm falling toward their net full speed they can get a boom over to my half and it's just super risky the reward is there like it is a doable goal but it's just like the chances of scoring off of it are much higher than if i just play it safely that touched me i made everything so weird yeah i was screwed no matter what but that was a good play from tim to bump is good sorry one more touch okay i might have thrown but i'm down for ot yeah i thought they go for a clip i'm down to extend the video though if we lose i'm okay with it like i could just play it safe kill time there and it's probably the game over but gotta go for the clip he's gonna play hi he's gonna be back wall it's a okay 50. not bad i'll wait for yaeggy here let me go up the wall austin's gonna have this i gotta wait oh they hit over him imagine oh my if i went down to the ground a little bit quicker i think i have that he's gonna know i'm faking this is really awkward this is good actually round one there we go all right geez all right we got a lot of good goals in there we got a lot of really dumb goals against us we're not playing crazy good honestly i could have played probably like five times better than i played but dubs and dub those are against two grand champion players so it was a good matchup good challenge if you guys are seeing it's any particular rank or you have for example like four diamonds or you know three champ ones or three champ twos in mind challenges like that let me know down below and i'll get around to hope you guys enjoyed the video i hope it was fun for you guys it was fun for me having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is when you're watching
