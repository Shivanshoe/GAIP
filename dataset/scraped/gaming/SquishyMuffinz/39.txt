yo what's up guys today we're actually using a different car this is a car that i said i'd make a video on a while back and actually forgot to and someone in my comment section reminded me so for today we're making a video with this car right here and it is the ford mustang shelby we actually didn't make one with this i think we made one with two of the other cars from this pack but i didn't make one with this one and the decal we're using is one of the ones that comes with the car it's actually not usable in any other car but it looks pretty cool so i'm gonna use this car for today but

code squishy at checkout this is good actually sorry [Laughter] all right first game we got wonder mic against anxiety and taliban's actually cool name anxiety like that block just stay on this try to block me it's fine any kind of like 50 on that's pretty good i think it doesn't really matter where it ends up going as long as i know my teammates behind me that's the main thing there put this aside watch the big clear let's just see if i can stand this myself ah close look at try actually like long cars i'm usually not the best i getting like a good first touch when i land like that and i did a really good job of that that one there wait i was in oh my god oh no i missed you so i have to put a little bit of passive on this could be okay it should be a goal so that's like honestly not a bad play from charlie all day i actually like the idea a lot but it's a big mistake on the second man because you're playing you're playing for the first man's play to be absolutely perfect and when you push up that far like that you're really gonna just leave your team in a really bad spot you you want to be covering the net more than anything that situation cover like the 50 going badly not going to walk because even if it goes well there's probably not going to be a goal for you so cover like worst case scenario more so than best case it's gonna stop you from getting scored on often big demo for the second bump would have been huge like we're making one that might want to switch cars oh it's actually a really good try [Music] got the full boost here so we actually make a play to this soft touch to ourselves beat one should i go for a bump as well i'll be big play it back now you make a demo so it's my turn to just defend and just play safe and now i can go and i know he's behind me my my go-to as soon as i saw that he spawned behind me that's my green light to go good job commander follow up on that oh you just left and i almost said mustard shall be mustard but anyway good first game they left pretty early actually let's get to the next one seem to keep it up get back back dubs see how it goes i got the same game again back to back here actually on a team intensity gg i think is their name that's good good practice against a pro team i'd say the semi-pro because they don't play rcs but close to pro good test for the car what a flick oh my gosh this car is crazy crazy perfect flick i'm actually not the best at getting those that perfect with low boost on octane i think the longer cars have pros in in that area like flicks in general stuff like that is a lot easier with a lot of cars it's just a really well done play in general they're solo play from the mic i trust them to get past the first man and then i just bumped the last one nice from one day fellow play here and it's empty night as well good double scoob close gotta play it safe and watch the double here same thing in this situation it's fine sudden dribble actually really touch i think boost as well here then i can rotate back kind of like half rotate like are you ready for the big clear there i know i'm gonna have boost regardless so the main thing is grabbing that boost and holding on to it and being ready for whatever direction that hit ends up going from uh from what i'm like there i'm gonna let the touch come through most time that touch won't be threatening because the second man is not going to fall up especially in twos you don't have anyone to help out so segment usually is a little bit more passive on that ball and they're not going to follow so you can be very passive on that cheap ball one that goes off the wall nice 50s so i passed middle here it should actually just be a goal well well well i did not expect that to be top corner i knew it would be a goal did he have to shoot it like that no but hey if it works it works it went in so good job really really good shot but did not need to do all that for sure i played over one 1v1 now can be really good situation almost impossible for the defender to deal with that you have no help the biggest thing in pro play and the biggest thing to stop people from getting solo plays like that is having the extra defender to help you if they're challenging properly that won't happen i got it over the first guy really well that was just well played just teamwork in general just really hard for me to do anything because my my goal here is to get the challenge in a way where i made him do this thing and i can leave now it's one of mike's turn to make him do his thing and then it's my turn to get the follow-up right so when you're layering your defense like that i could just pass through some eagle when you're laying your defense like that there's really nothing they can do to get out of that situation right good second game let's get into one more because they're both uh quick forfeits but i guess this car is crazy it just helps us get ranked dubs like that since the next one steven keep it up get back to back to back up see how it goes all right for last game we got desi against dalton and loopy already see if we can end off on a good note here do this car the like i could try it's gonna be hard for me uh let's just get right away i think i have to watch the demos the main thing that could have really made that hard day good bump do you mean it should have this nice ah it could be bad actually good clear i didn't say like flicking where you do this like hit it with the back of your car because it's so long it feels crazy i didn't bump them somewhere pinch something to flip into it but actually still kind of work should be okay i think trying to take these pads on my back it's a really good option if you don't have the mid boost probably going to be around max boost anyway uh i don't think he meant to shoot like that but ended up working for him literally you're just trying to get a middle i should have just challenged though i would have beat him for sure i was kind of just playing him to have a bad touch and ended up not having one it was definitely an awkward situation though and it was very fortunate it worked out perfectly try to take all the views from them even the pad it's gonna be really good just to keep pressure right now i had zero trying to turn on this wall good job trying to go for a double off the wall i thought it would work better than just a shot but here we have a full boost for the middle you find this as long as one of us challenges that like timo's going back so it was fine for me to go it's kind of like my green light to just go probably gonna touch us to the wall it's fine teammates should have a little bit of a panic but it's okay part of the situation you don't really know when someone's challenging the ball's like above your head right like right here pretty hard for the guy on the ground here so the backhaul guy should help him he does there's no way for me to score that either with how they're playing on defense they're quite just playing like super safe here i got the bump it's pretty big should be a follow-up shot nice good job a lot of pressure there demo helps a lot as well makes it really hard on them i'm going to cheat on this i know i usually don't but i'm just going to say middle that's fine i could just go back as well put it over one but i got demos i feel like it's not even a word or worth it trade fun i used 10 boost for that made him kind of play all the way back and i got full boost out of it so it's worth it played around one but for a bump they can get a bad touch i played it too quick i tried to play at mid but a little bit too fast for my teammate should be okay oh almost perfect 50 day i'm not going to go for that i just cancel out because i don't want to just beat me on the wall then i'm stuck on their half for so long like that a challenge let him waste all his boost here there's a flip still so i just wait let me go to the ground here try to fake the like air dribble pop almost worked wow there's a crazy sequence that just happened right there we should go it's fine should be okay for a second it's definitely a dangerous situation here but okay they're just trying to keep the ball as much as possible that was really tough to get out of anybody to like try to control one of these balls for us the thing what i'm doing here is good in a situation if you don't have any resources to get out of this we want to keep this as close as possible now i got full boost out of that teammate should definitely not have went for that but it's okay you got a little antsy it's understandable yeah if your team is controlling the corner never never never never ever like follow up right next to them like that it's never going to help if anything it'll 50 to opponent i don't really want to do that that's fine that's not the biggest mistake it didn't get escorted on i mean definitely could have but it's a good like talking point i don't mind didn't that stuff happen there were one i said i panicked at the very least although he probably shouldn't panic because he just demoed my teammate so he shouldn't know no one was there should be okay to try if i get a bump here it's pretty big try to cut off his path couldn't tell his scholarly back pass back here would be huge but to me nice very smart it's fine i should have faked the the high attached version better i have some time as i don't have to like panic crazy hard if i jump to back wall it's fine as well it has time as well and go backward cover the high actually could score up this potentially the challenge he beats him it's big to try now i gotta be careful here close good try i think it's gonna come down to kickoff goal or something off kickoff here i have a feeling yeah i don't know why i've had a feeling it would anyway good game for today i hope you guys enjoyed actually really good using this car i actually liked it i'm not gonna lie for a long car i haven't used a long car in a while since dominus probably
