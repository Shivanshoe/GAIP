yo what's up guys for the last few videos we've been queueing all three game modes and whatever we end up getting is what we'll play and yeah let's get into it see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes oh we got threes again man it's becoming a full on well on 3v3 channel now sorry about the steam notifications oh okay i i you guys heard me i got i'm scared by the miss i did not expect it good shot though for my teammate really to start i know why i've been liking this decal this car set up so much didn't take my time here no one's that close try to play it around them nice touch to the side try to save my boost here very unfortunate series of events i can score this if he misses a good read i actually like love getting down into situations if i'm on their side like in their corner like that and i can't get a boost i'll take game demo any day i'm gonna fake play over one more try to just fake the bump there make him get a panic touch behind him here nice touch try to follow there we go thank you thank you it's actually a really good uh play for my team and again if he shot that anywhere else he's getting saved there's a guy going off the top of the net squishy saving it there's a guy on the ground and uh anything there that was shot on target i think it's saved so i like that little delay i thought 40 boost as well and i got it over the guy i think that's definitely worth it he passed it one more time across it have been huge and going for the fake i'm gonna turn one more time for a bump here i think it's worth it if i can get one if i don't get one it's fine at least it still forces them a little bit off but i should have it my teammate go i hear him jump i backed off right away trying to see if i can get a pass mid but a little bit awkward wait i'm scoring off this what the hell that's so weird it's actually so weird i tried to get a dribble off the ball like i was being a bad team right there i'm not gonna lie but i just wanted to see if i can get an irritable my teammate just let me i can save should touch the left corner hopefully hit it right that's fine good demo my teammate missing right for shot i took the boost that's actually really good booster good fake jump for my team i don't know if you intended that but actually really smart oh my that was crazy okay i wanted to see it i was about to say i thought i'd be upset i didn't go in that's crazy i hit it across pre-flip is going into couldn't save it and they left alrighty depending on how long the next one is um i'm gonna try to do two more but we'll see the next one's along t maybe it won't all right we got a two's game we got tally bird against tz and cam interesting playing for the mid boost here just backflip this be annoying double 50 it's pretty big let's play it back now nice this is a good play stop talking for a second to focus up a little bit but there's a stop there i think his mistake was like not hitting the ball harder to the back corner because he could hit our hearts his backhoe and then trap it toward the left wall and then force the 50 but get into a spot where he still had to like gather control of the ball and it made it really hard for him give me ends to follow nice one right behind you you let him touch go for a bump i had a challenge for my teammate let's make it easier really good now they have a full 1v1 situation here i can't really it's a challenge on this let me go now really good figure that was perfect well done that's a really good situation to pick i think the best times to figure when someone's in like a super big panic state where they kind of are in a position where they have to rush back and then if you have a shot they have to go into the back to stop it and if you you know if you use that situation to fake that's when you're getting the most out of the fake i think touch it for a teammate mid let me go for the boost here tried to time the challenge perfectly for the goal but a little ambitious of me got the bump which is big stops are ageable but it's off to myself good mid boost grab stops me from being able to do much nice one more touch maybe i'm gonna pass back if i hit a round now because they weren't able to get the pass back so it's not worth it trying to block this guy should be falling for a while so comes the 1v1 essentially i like that drive challenge smart doesn't like fully commit to the play when you do that as i fully commit to that play winning behind a little boost should be okay other guys farther back try to bump them here at least for some wider really good bump it's gonna be empty as well if it's shootable i'm not sure all right wait a minute to get back and then i'll challenge here that's fine force them wide job done i'd say nice good try oh good oh almost got the little clutch i wanted there good shot though then when you're on the phone they're terrified yeah which is true it's funny all right i'm gonna play one more so they're both early four quid against the next one all right for the last theme we got rush and esterium i like that name a lot assyrium it's cool try to play this to myself control forward actually shoot off of it i should have went for that it wasn't like technically it wasn't a pass to me i'm gonna fake this take control i'm gonna pass my team actually why not see him on the wall really big double fifty day trying to run through for bumps you make a turn pass left wall nice i actually got the perfect touch on that 420 really good pass passes are super op i think get back right here i'm gonna fake go for the boost instead looks not gonna be anything crazy ever have time now on the ball i played over both should be free goal plus pop to myself let me go again to bait touch got the back but it's probably gonna be a goal for them actually worked out because he missed i could not tell what happened it was like laggy as i waved ash couldn't tell if i actually went dash or if it was like a server-like thing good follow hit around two it's really good teammate is instago here i think could be two here with this touch to make him beat him that's pretty big wait for the mid touch that was thus far actually really important demo that guy's gonna be huge in that play because he's gonna turn there and be annoying and be really disruptive but now look how far back he is he may have loved getting those i should like that i almost got the oh that was good played safe third here see my boost it's in a good position to react whatever happens played around one i shouldn't instagram there it's always gonna beat me to follow up get off my teammate nice right behind here again just stay third if he gets b it's gonna be my job to clean it up let him hit this away that's fine if he misses didn't use too much boost to win that as well it's really good take some boosts chill mid nice fifth time on the ball now right down the middle he wants to shoot timmy's not close so i can turn on this hit it back again actually i i love that like little infield touch like that to get a pass is like so overpowered in my opinion if you like fake a big shot like fake a wind up get a soft touch mid and then pass it back in threes when you're when your team's ready like especially with my team like my actual team obviously a little bit different i'm not playing with gear and just right now but it's busted when you're playing with people that are ready for it super good try to pass it back and try i should have shot it again i get so used to like little habits from scrims and stuff like that and then and rank definitely doesn't work the same way that's why i can understand your guys's frustration like when you're watching me in higher level games in general you don't have the same level players on your team so it's harder to make the same plays that i'm making but i understand it on a different level obviously in a different way but i do understand that that comment like i try to like you know use your tips but my teammates don't do this this and this i understand that it's more about just if you're actually trying to do it enough it's all you can really do is just three individuals together so if you can get your whole team to you know if every player works on themselves i'm trying to say is you can get it to the point where you know you actually have your teammate doing what you want them to because everyone has to work on themselves as a community i guess which just happened that's how people rank up anyway gotta try to block them gonna delay a lot of time there i say done that clear actually might have just won us the game gonna be very hard for him to get out now so let him stay on this all right believe this for me we should be good played around one played around two but for the touch to the corner because that's where it has to go now i'm dead but it should be the game well done alrighty i hope you guys enjoyed having a wonderful day or night whatever time it is like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all you
