i love you guys and i'll have that one more montage ready for a round when we hit one meal enjoy the video what's up guys gonna be playing someone's games for today let's get straight into it they're probably gonna be super sweaty because we are supersonic legs and the highest rank already in them let's get straight into let's even get some dubs hopefully there's some sweaty games let's see how it goes all right the first gameplay against kef found this game instantly so he's probably also really high up in once not gonna be easy game whatsoever see if we can do that should i play smart let's toss the shot on goal see if he does good control from him a little bit unlucky they got a bump there but it's okay should be able to recover out of it i don't think i'm gonna be able to score this try to make him jump go for the boost again try to get some pressure like that i know he's a little boost here so i'm just waiting for the ball to get on the ground he has to push that forward toward me right so there's really no downside of letting him just flick that toward me on the ground that could be a hard thing to stop should be able to control this gotta go there we go got a bad clear on the back wall he probably should have scored he didn't get enough power on the shot one of those shots where it just hits the wrong part of his car and then i was able to get a good count out of it so honestly we probably should be one all down right now that was actually nuts that was actually really good double flippers said double tap actually my best goals not gonna lie but that was insane i was mad clean all right we take those good start good first minutes keep it up even if we lose now i feel like we won because that was a really good goal what point is for content and then we're definitely getting some content with these goals right now actually baited and made well played pretty good starting out the first minute pretty good here actually really a challenge it's easy to to mess those up oh he just stops playing all right we made him give up unfortunately because i trolled a little bit there i was gonna have an empty net again i did a fake jump instead of the shooting i think he got upset about it he just left so let's cue one more that was a really good goal the super happy with that goal it's one of my favorite goals i've ever scored easily so yeah let's get to the next one stephen keep it up let go let go for what might be the last game of the video depending on how you feel we got ourselves lagertha i'm gonna go for the mid boost it's really late right now i would want to do one more because that first one wasn't really forfeit but this might be at last depending on how i feel should have this it's a good flick from him good fall from us good control good job i should have the pads on my back here though should be okay it's gonna be really hard to stop i have no boost yeah unless i go [ __ ] off the bat there like i don't hesitate at all on the challenge it's gonna be a goal every time my boost was just too low i could have played a few different things better there ended up having more boosts and stuff but it's all good it happens it's a good play for him as well he he kept good pressure there we go good conversion there i know you couldn't really get a shot on target to be honest so it was more about just playing patient quick question ask him what's up after this get some pads here it's good to stay in plain ones with pads over like the big boost i feel like it's much better to say and play with pads even in threes i think it's the same thing just a hard thing to get yourself to do like to get into the habit of get a challenge i keep on dying unfortunately which is making this really tough to get out of on defense it's a really important beat though little ball should be a goal what's up i i don't i don't recognize the name shooter there's so many people on ps4 like that i was friends with or i talked to too many to remember to be honest i'm sure there's some people that like well they'll say like do you remember this person from ps4 and i just i can't think of the name even though i'm sure i probably talked to them so long ago now it's five years ago time flies man holy i playing this game for a very long time holy i just thought about that and it hit me five years playing this game since i was 14. i turned 15 the year this game came out that's crazy this guy's playing well though four years ago in private match yeah i don't remember that at all good boost still what he does really well is he slows down to play a lot with his dribbles this super super good skill to have to consistently be able to just slow down the play completely try to make it awkward for him or just keep turning in good job you actually won the beast battle there too let's really play from him go for the flick there we go yeah i believe it looks like somebody's been playing once for a very long time you could tell he has that experience i like that he's like he's okay with just leaving that and going for the boost like it's a good play to make he knows i'm not gonna have boost for the next little while because of that and the only reason why i got a goal of that is because he messed up his touch in the corner but in general it's a good play that he made back there 100 take my boost and give me the ball because i can't do anything with zero boost really at least nothing too dangerous no matter who you are no boost you're not going to do a whole lot right good early challenge there's no no fear at all from him there again there's a good element of risk to that just instantly going there but if you win the challenge that hard you need a goal of it right it's the risk versus reward situation i can flick him very easily because a challenge right away but if he doesn't win the challenge that hard like you did then it's a well earned goal take some pads here instead of going back for boost that's not the best fit day from us just trying to bump them if i can only out of that situation one four boost here all right like i was saying earlier you can't do anything with no boost but actually you gotta go out of it so never mind we did manage to get a goal with no booster but that was because he decided to go all in on in a challenge there you had the full boost all you needed to do was wait for my flick it would have probably been fine i'll take the pads here instead of going for the big boost ah honestly i wanted to fake jump i wasn't trying to like save or anything right there with that jump that would be a fake jump i jumped way too high and you just didn't care again you just went for the straight up flick i noticed he doesn't care so much as to what i'm doing he just kind of has an idea and he sticks to it which is a good thing like same situation there i went straight up just low 50'd it and you won it well let me drop my heart yeah he plays a very solid game at once definitely tell you there's a lot of experience in ones should win this mid boost snack so that bump see what he does i'll wait for the touch off the wall i'm gonna play a shot all right he's gonna have that i missed his boost this is a pretty bad situation for me now yeah i'm playing pretty bad to be honest i'm making a lot of mistakes and giving him a lot of free goals but it happens it does happen you have games like that i'm overthinking situations and it feels like he's not even first second second guessing himself on decisions which is what you need to do in 1v1 so it's definitely winning the the battle of confidence in this game i've never really been a super confident once player to be honest never have been i do enjoy like the idea of the mode but for me i never liked the idea of defending on low boost a lot and i don't know not having a teammate to pass too it's never really been my thing but it is good practice for a lot of things in your game there's a lot of mistakes i've made this game honestly because i don't play a lot of ones anymore so one for the cheeky play might get me scored on the risk reverse reward situation again that was talking about earlier i'm just gonna go you should have ball patrol and the back boost so i got to win this challenge hard here it could be a goal for him if i don't play this right would have been a huge demo to get but the bump was enough to force out ball position and we have boost now too let's go for an air dribble bump oh he challenged okay so he's challenging super early like ridiculously really and it has been working to be honest it really has been so i don't blame him i was gonna go for a dribble i thought he's gonna give me way more time than that as well right there i wasn't even expecting a [ __ ] i popped it over him it's a good challenge you probably thought i was into the shadow i decided to go this is really tough to save now got to play this out well i should just kill it but i kind of want one more no i tried to bump him get the catch as well it would have been nice all right so i would say one more but that game went on quite a while not gonna lie it was an eight seven game that was quite a long game he was another supersonic legend as well there's only like 20 of them right now in one so you know this guy's a legit ones player like he's super solid super quality yeah guys like i said i did want to do one more but because it is like 5 a.m right now i think i'm gonna end it here it's a good one to end off on we got a nice chunk of punch in that as well 1387 mmr now so we're probably getting up there on the leaderboard if i had to guess let's go take a look where we're at on the leaderboard all right we're number 30 right now that's pretty good considering i haven't really played a crazy amount of ones honestly but yeah i hope you guys enjoyed the video we got a really good double flip reset double tap at the beginning and i'm sorry that first one was a quick forfeit but we had a sweaty second game i could have played a lot better i was making a lot of mistakes if you never make a mistake you're never really gonna learn but that's why there is no perfect player because every single player makes mistakes but you have to take time to realize your mistakes and try to focus on them right you can't just look past it and act like you don't make them because you do what everybody does so yeah hope you guys enjoyed i'll see you on the next one thank you for stopping by and sticking around for this video i apologize that it's a little bit shorter than you might like but yeah i love you guys have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you're watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all
