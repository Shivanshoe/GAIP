yo what's up guys so it's the brand new season and that means it's a brand new rocket pass i'm going to skip to the very beginning of this and i'll slowly just go through everything for you guys let me just go quickly with my controller i'll go through everything with you guys and you guys can take a look at whatever you think might be good the decal i'm using right now by the way um it looks a lot nicer in game i don't know why it looks like that right now in this menu it looks like mustard yellow but it's more like gold i think the shaders are like off for some reason but there are two major things that stood out to me in this rocket pass and they're both toward the end of it um the beginning stuff's not bad but i don't know i'm not the greatest fan of like the wheels like these wheels i don't think i'd ever use a lot of the wheels aren't the greatest i think sonic's needs to add more wheels and stuff that you can use on any car that would look clean especially like more like darker wheels like all of the black wheels look really nice so i think they just try to release more like darker toned wheels they're really really nice when they do those there's nothing too crazy in the beginning but once you get toward the last like this detail is not bad by the way i like it it's all like supposed to be like space theme there's also tournament rewards i'll show you guys those those are pretty sick too um but for today by the way we're gonna be playing some uh placement games i'm just gonna queue ones twos threes try to just solo cue it placements are always a little bit messy so you'll get the pure gameplay what it's really like for a pro's first game of the season first few games i haven't played it all yet so this is where it gets good this decal neural network this thing goes crazy let me show you my blue car it looks really nice in game it looks insane but that's not the best thing in this past for me the absolute best thing in this pass is coming up right here you can't tell me you can't look at that and tell me that's not the best gold explosion that you've ever seen this thing is insane it literally covers the whole map in that everyone's car everything looks just like that when you score so hopefully you'll be able to see it today i'll fail score it cool um i'll also make a video with this brand new car and let you guys know what i think of it i don't like the cars the single boost uh hole that much because i don't like the way the boost looks coming out but either way i'll definitely make uh a video with that but i want to really highlight this glow explosion i think this is the best close potion in the game genuinely this is the best like explosion that i've seen that they've made i used to love the nuke go explosion i remember too because it was just so big and like just out of nowhere this one is even better covers the whole map such a great like effect i don't know i love the way it looks also guys if you're going to purchase the rocket pass you can use code uh squishy muffins if you're going to buy anything item shop as well i never really mentioned this but you can support a creator go here type in squishy muffins and there you go you're supporting me and everything you buy i'll get um a percentage of and that would help me out greatly thank you so much guys if you have used my code in the past um and just for supporting me in general i appreciate y'all and yeah shout out to psyonix for that great feature but let's play uh some games for today but wait one more second before i do that i forgot i got to show you guys uh tournaments tournament rewards preview rewards so there's some really cool gold explosions in here this is a pretty nice decal as well looks nice actually i don't know about the boost they never really have a good boost and the wheels are a little bit too big oh my gosh those fish bro what are those wheels this is nice i like this one a lot i really like the way that looks ombre is clean dude the wheels need work the wheels need work i'm not a fan of the wheels but some of the right that's sick it's pretty cool all right so yeah the goal explosions are the main thing that i think definitely stand out in this but for today let's cue ones twos and threes whatever we get we'll play let's get into it let's see how it goes all right the first game we got ourselves drip against benny cracked an orange juicing topaz i don't recognize anyone in here but we will see what will come with this game i didn't expect to recognize anyone in here because it's the start of a new season so it's going gonna be random try to go for a quick shot there not a bad idea i don't really like shooting those all that often but there are those a shot there are those like rare occasions where i feel like it is it's worth shooting because you know you can definitely catch them off guard oh no we can't clip them for a video if you're shot here [Music] oh my playing crazy you got two dunks in less than a minute already i have to do anything yet and he's ready already very good start it's gonna make patient here try to save my boost also i changed to like the colored boost meter you see how it's like orange when i'm on orange team i usually was using like the the default one where it's like always red i'm trying to challenge my teammates should i have this for free now this might be tough yes so usually i have it on red i'm just i've been testing out the colored one i'm gonna go back i'm gonna try normally again yeah i like the normal looks a lot more i think this is a really good start but i feel like they might forfeit if it keeps up i don't know how these first games go it's gonna fake jump i might play off the sound queue it works something's air dribbling you gotta like remember the balls above them most of the time if they hear your jump they're gonna think you're up they get a little fake to throw in sometimes on defense definitely throws people off throws me off sometimes especially when you're just playing pro players all the time they like to go really quick for a lot of challenges it's a good uh thing to throw in every now and then good control try to bump the other one as well nice pretty much the perfect play there stuck on the bat spawn defense got it all the way out to midfield and i was able to get the bump as well last guy back in a really tough spot can you pull it out here i'll try to fake the click at the end let him hit that's fine let me get might have moved up too close expecting the the pass but he hasn't let me down yet so i have no reason not to trust him there and it's a goal as well if if the touch comes true if the game's 0-0 and i haven't seen anything my teammate's done yet i'm playing a lot safer on that ball but he's played pretty well so far so let him hit that gonna be a really bad spot for a little bit here i should buy fake challenges make him click nice it's kind of my teammate's doing he's actually doing a really good job i don't know how i don't know how he turned that into a goal honestly it shouldn't even have been possible he got really fortunate i'm not gonna lie he got bumped into everything's just working for him this game you got two dunks that you probably shouldn't have got that let the goals as well as uh that right there you got bumped into the ball i think you might have saved that not sure if it wasn't good either way watching the pass back down a good idea but it's a little bit too obvious like his line where he jumped from was pretty much a straight line to his teammate you gotta have a little bit more like misdirection and like a pass like that i feel like it's a little bit too obvious might be in i'm not sure if i sniped it post somebody get back pop up to myself just play it around maybe get this boost as well i'll be huge i'm gonna touch on middle oh he tried to flip reset did not expect that maybe just did the one hit middle it would have been perfect very well i think that's like a like kind of like the beauty of this game too being simple in situations like that is oftentimes better than trying to do too much you know a little light touch middle would have been way more than enough to uh secure that but anyway i'm gonna first game let's get into the next one so you can keep it up get back to back dubs yeah it goes all right for last name we got ink i think it's how you say that again smoothie and raid what's up too if someone's like jumping 40 like that like that guy just suppose if the ball's on the floor that's pretty much your green light the challenge there's no way you can get that like into your net the ball just on the floor like this right here but then you can do what i just did right use that to your advantage kind of just back up a little bit you know they're gonna hit it into you because they're going to think oh that's the green light the challenge and then you have the counter to that right nice perfect little touches there and there's a gold explosion left let's go actually didn't score last game it's like i had four assists and my team had seven goals there it is that's beautiful by far best goal explosion in the game makes me happy just seeing it nice little 1v2 as well to open that up and that's like a good utilization of our space here gonna fake here when he comes in make sure i cut it to the right side give my time single jump you should be able to touch this [Music] wow [Music] what that was actually so good i never would have thought of that i don't think he meant to do that necessarily like you're trying to shoot and it just worked out but i don't think he's complaining he can get a big hit here if he does the goal he's waiting i like the patience if i kill this guy it's also a goal for us i was looking at the guy but i think my teammate missed he must have just swift yeah so he made a little bit too awkward on himself that's that's okay gonna just play a little bit slower whoever's there on attack is gonna be waiting for your play almost every time there so literally all you have to do is just let them come to you like don't give them the mistake for free right back there if he just like goes afk on the wall that guy is never actually gonna challenge attacker and if he does you're going to have the advantage for sure so that's good to wait and be patient like right here i'm not going to go quick for this why would i the latest player to the corner i have the advantage he can't score off this there's nothing he could do to actually score off this to make this circle so i can just play back well if teammate gets beat it's fine easy save to the side play left side up in space you should come back let him touch this probably has one more touch i'm gonna fake this go ground now one's out of the play yes hit it away first touch here it's actually really a fake i can pick again though i made him jump i messed up his play already i don't have to do anything already messed up his play really bad he made it backwards though that became awkward against my team is kind of just making it harder than it needs to be for himself by putting himself backwards there so the pace down a little bit like on defense in those situations and you'll find you're gonna be in a much better spot as soon as i get this full boost you see a lot of times i just sit here with it and look this guy's not gonna score this guy's not gonna score either i just baited both of them in and now he has to turn and make an aggressive challenge for pretty much no reason not to be any like real danger coming out of it again like look at the situation right i have full control as he hits this past me it's fine my teammate's there really doesn't matter that's why it's good to do stuff like that it's okay that was a perfect example right i didn't want to do anything i could have done something there's probably actually a way i could have scored that but i just want to show you guys that if it gets behind me it really doesn't matter you want to try to have the advantage in every way possible in every play like you want to try to feel like you're the one in control another one reacting to what you're doing that's a good goal though good shots gonna fake this so good example again awkward ball i'm gonna do i'm not gonna rush just touch because he's waiting for my bad touch play the empty space to make a take if you want so i'm just going to pinch looking for a bump here i could just sleep more than enough pressure created just by going for the bump waiting to save spot fake challenge here gotta make him flick this right he's all the way in his hat he's not gonna score off the flick so if i can make him flick it perfect for us try to pressure them early too when they just get control of the ball on their half definitely try to be the one to to get in their face and make them get a bad touch right here i'm going to keep faking this until i have the ball cleanly that i don't have to do anything and if i got the bump right there that was probably a goal as well can't go but i jumped the very least made him jump it's right there again look at the spot my teammate puts himself in right he's sideways he's only covering the sidewall if he puts himself in a better position he doesn't leave me in such a bad like 1v1 there all he has to do literally is just stay with the ball right don't flip don't give them exactly what they want like right there gave me everything they they want it out of that it's okay to make mistakes like that i feel like the big thing is like recognizing when they come and trying to figure out what you could have done differently that's what separates people that are like improving fast people that aren't really improving it's realizing you're making that mistake right because defense is the biggest thing in this game look at that situation again right really tough spot to get out of big challenge make him lose control of the ball he dropped it off his car and then i have that green light it's on the ground i could just go pretty freely again same thing here i'm lost back for a bit big jump do little things to make his life more difficult at least i can get a save right my teammate jumped too so he didn't trust me but if you waited like okay yeah you tried to go for the save as well but it was going to be over if you read a back post so if you save to the corner you can follow my touch it would be fun they play the one by one pretty well let's just straight up only one like if we're playing ones i could follow it up my teammate was there for me it's also gonna be a fine situation but yeah it's gonna it's gonna be a tough game to win here it looks like teammates having a a rough game but nothing that's not regainable i tell him to take this i'll play those fake to me let him panic here that's good we can't score off this i gotta back off he should go for me though yeah a lot of like awkward situations are coming from stuff where it just feels like our challenges are not good like if it feels like the challenges need to be uh much safer i'm just in smarter situations let him hit this that's fine he actually put it in a good position there i like where he was should leave this though that's better to leave for whoever's behind you because like if you rush that touch on the wall what does it do right just give it another ball this is good though i know he's gonna fake because last man can we take your time at the wall that's fine he got dunked a little bit unfortunately [Music] nice double save one more touchdown mid here be huge you're gonna go alone that's fine another thing i like about this is if he lands in their net then it's pretty bad i suppose hard to get the perfect angle on that that's a good challenge to make right there doesn't mean my teammate in like a vulnerable state ever and i'm still with the ball the whole time play behind him let him hit this away jimmy should be there i don't want to go for this though he's gonna hit it back to me and this is the 1v1 the vehicle there we go you see like when i do get these shots or these these crazy situations it's more just me playing off of what i have like the situation that i have around me it's not me doing anything that crazy most of the time i'm just paying attention to where they are where the touch is going to go and most time they help me out play them like right there i didn't have to do anything i knew that first guy would make a bad touch over to me i would be able to catch it and have a free 1v1 right so why am i gonna jump try to beat that guy for no reason when it's actually gonna be bad and go to me anyway right so if you know there's gonna be no danger that's something they have to take advantage of for sure yeah this goal explosion definitely gives you powers a lot of fun good game for today hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all [Music]
