guys here all the time and yeah hope you guys enjoyed the video love you yo what's up guys gonna be playing three today with the musty and justin it's the brand new season so we're playing some placement games uh we don't have a rank yet but still be some good matchups let's get into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right so i'm gonna go for this didn't call it i forget must he likes to get kicked off i remember last time he recorded that was a problem we had because i have muscle memories just go for every kick off i always want to kick off my whole career in three so just muscle memory all right behind you i'll go for this one else can go up should i pop this up one more time double tap for justin i just can't go for that wait behind you right middle for musty couldn't quite get it around i noticed must use alpha boost now i think he uh finally changes card design it looks like it's funny after so long i'm surprised all right nice little 1v3 triple it's actually clean number one over two and then a nice bump at the end that was a good play good job to take our time there it's better than just throwing that away obviously create a lot more opportunities like that he's up early i'm gonna miss that so i'll just try to take control again there we go trying to dribble every ball justin's there for the bump nice actually worked out there that musty missed that we're able to get much better control of it than the touch would have been and touch would have probably just been forward to them but instead were able to get that control we got goals out of it so much better to do that even if it is by accident it works out better in the long run you could say it was on purpose you know if it is the better thing there we go try to place it around him like i might have had the block of my shot right at him so that's good get past from musty across there try to get this left side nice and behind full boost here flip the floater i go for a bump maybe good bump to go for creates a lot of pressure now try to challenge i think justin's back though yeah i would have been okay i don't think justin was behind me though he wasn't ready yet yeah he was getting their corner boost i shouldn't have went full speed there i wasn't sure where everyone was so it's not something you should just dive in on without you know at least checking you want to be confident in your first instinct but at the same time you should try to be more aware of those situations like that i think try to kill one left side here if i pass right to justin should be a goal close what just slowed me down his car slowed me down the bumps have been weird for me lately i feel close until you get on the wall here doesn't still has i think oh he faked him twice we missed twice but it works with a fake that's the beauty of missing a high level everyone thinks you're gonna hit everything so it actually works as a fake most of the time oh let's get kill nice good pre-flip from justin he's gonna be there inside the way i'm gonna fake jump go again i'm gonna leave that now someone should be back in time it's gonna fake again at the bump he's gonna delay him a bit mossy should go for this even if it's over him it's fine because i'm behind him try to pass them close good of him to be ready for the pass at least bumped one bump two musty should hit this i hit this across go for a double i can leave it now try to go for one more i'm gonna fake you first i don't wanna just bang that off the back wall i don't think it's better to fake that even if they have the ball right now because we're gonna end up getting the ball easier than they would have before before we just have to keep banging it back but now we have actual control on the play there we go i got the goomba on him stop them from being able to jump that's a good play to make i know justin's not passing that one there so might as well just pound the guy into the ground the last one left bang beautiful shot amazing stuff by the time this video comes out people will know what mmr supersonic legend is i believe i've heard so far that it might be 1800 mmr it sounds about right it wouldn't make sense if it is um that's like high grand champ from before or like higher grand champ oh this is nuts oh if you had more speed or more boost it's probably go i pass to him try to get back i'll be back while here what a fake picking us all up killed one i'll give my team a free ball with that so to go for a demo again get both boost which is good i can keep this in high touch there wait for his head to the wall oh my god that's actually a really good idea i should practice that that's a corner pinch like that that just goes straight in if you get that perfect definitely worth practicing i think probably middle here wait oh my musty had the same idea it's a good first game though played it well let's get to the next one see if we can get another back-to-back dub to finish off the video yeah good first game for sure see if we can keep it up let go let go all right for last campaign it's foxy toucan and it's michael breath so let's get some passing plays get some good plays going end off with the banger of a game here hopefully i control this speed let's be uh justin wanted the the pinch i think i was gonna say let's feel a little cheeky i'm gonna make it weird three from dustin's are very awkward close i'm gonna fake that should i play it back nice i'll be right side here press downs again double yep yes sir you had no boost at this point pretty sure you'd know more still got it the touch off the the ceiling was really good he was able to follow it up even though he had nothing off back close to trying the shot good follow there we go i always forget musty goes such a hard habit to break when you've gone for here up so long right side i mean waited either you could have scored the double it's a goal though still probably nice yeah i probably could have just scored i'm so used to pro players going instantly so i went quicker than i needed to taking that shutters challenge should be easy for musty good control right behind you oh i didn't try to pass bad idea though in hindsight it's a miss shot enough time here see what justin decides to do pop it up give it more time on the ball close bump the last guy right left side here i hit around one i need to always go for a shot i think it's a very like overrated thing in threes everyone always goes for shot always it's good to hit it around people sometimes too try to just keep pressure keep the play in don't always just try to shoot every possibility there we go pop the ball up there for one of my teammates left it for either one i wait for it for the the option there so they see me and that's the easy goal so the beat one guy i'm gonna have the advantage there because it's coming toward me because the pass was good i'll be back here should be left side no dude i trolled so close that's the right idea for sure try to bump them it works one for the double flip reset double flip reset pass that was so weird looking wait justin got an assist when did he touch it did i just miss it oh he did he did nevermind i was just thinking about the play he did touch it all right right side here now save musty has nice put us back down to him justin off the ceiling what the heck i'm waiting for this boost i think it's the play it's a goal still yeah all right i'm gonna cheat i'm gonna do my slow cheat here save all my boost that way whatever happens i can follow try to take a decent shot it wasn't a bad idea i had more time to go for like a flip shot if i wanted to but that's going to be it for today's video guys i hope you enjoyed the game there are two bangers get a lot of good goals within them so yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times when you're watching this like comment subscribe i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace crap
