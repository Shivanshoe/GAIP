yo what's up guys this video is going to be a little bit different it's probably the question i get the most when i'm streaming or even youtube comments just like what are your settings what are your camera settings your sensitivities dead zones etc so i'm going to go over that in this video before i do get into this though properly i just wanted to say if you guys are ever wondering what settings a specific pro uses you can head over to likopedia my link to my wikipedia page will be down in the description so you guys can always see my updated camera and the sensitivity settings but you can look up any pro on there from rocker league and you can find their most recent settings they try to update it as recently as they can but some of them are a little bit older than others but for me mine are almost always always updated so you can check that if you're wondering what i'm using and you can also be updated on like what matches i play and stuff like that through there also guys follow me on twitter if you aren't following me over there because we're almost at i think 210 215 000 something like that so if you guys want to follow me over there definitely go follow me because i always do that when i go live on twitch as well as match results stuff like that so yeah let's get into the video for today i try to go over to settings properly in a way that explains it well if some of you guys are new or if some of you guys don't know what to use for your settings i try to explain it the best way i can so to start off guys we're in gameplay here i have everything pretty much default i don't change anything most people either have cross platform play on or off depending on if you want to play with console players or not as completely up to you everything else i tend to just leave and uh it's pretty much all up to you obviously whatever region you're in that affects that there's no nothing really too crazy here nothing too big outside of maybe game stat display level i like to do main stats only i don't like all stats to show because that'll show up every time you get a aerial touch and all the little things that you don't want popping up on your screen so only the main stats is in assist goals stuff like that there won't be anything to fill in your screen for no reason so this is a very good thing to change the main stats only so we'll get into camera now this is what i'm using right now so this is the thing about cameras this can change a little bit and i'll give you the ranges of which this can change i've made a video like this pretty much like i would say about every single year because it does change a little bit with the metas and the camera settings do change quite a bit throughout the years um but i want to say that there is still rangers that are very good to use throughout all these settings so for field of view the best ranges are 108 to 110 distance the best range is 260 to 280ish maybe even 290. most people use 270 though that's pretty much the average i'd say for a height 90 to 110 for angle negative 5 to negative 3 for stiffness 0.35 to 0.7 i'd say is the range you want to maybe stay between most people use i'd say 0.4 or 0.45 those are the most popular ones for swivel speed all clearly up to you depending on how fast you move your right stick to see left move your right stick to see right it's completely up to you you have to mess with this and free play and just figure out what feels nice to some people have this on 10 some people have this on like 2 3 because they like it being slow 10 instantly snaps left instantly snaps right so you got to just mess with it and try to find the best use for it for you go into free play here to show you guys transition speed and the effects it can have on your game so if i have this maxed out at two if i'm looking for this boost it instantly snaps to the boost instantly snaps back to the ball so it'll just instantly snap there's no um there's no motion between my car and the ball pretty much there's no slow motion there but if you go down to default transition speed you'll see there's that slow motion between where i'm looking forward and the ball the best way to test this is just go for a boost and try to snap off the ball and back on the ball because most of the time this is the biggest change you want to see the information in front of you so you want that to be quick and not too much for your brain to handle you don't want to be too fast i think 1.2 is a good in between where it snaps off quick snaps on quick and you can get all the information that you need so moving on after we looked at our camera settings like i said we're using 110 270 100 negative 540 1.2 that's what i'm using right now i've been messing with though outside of this 110 and negative 3.5 0.45 those are the ones i'm messing with outside of the ones i'm currently on so either of those are what i'm on right now you can switch between them they're interchangeable go under controls now what i've changed from my controls i haven't changed much powerslide i changed from square to l1 arrow as well from square to l1 i as well change arrow right to my square button which was originally regular air roll so we just pretty much traded out uh square which was default arrow over to aero right and we put air rule and powerslide the default versions on l1 so those are the only settings that i've changed in terms of my controls and then we switched out scoreboard to r1 since we had r01 as an open slot at that point so that's pretty much all i've done for my controls everything else is default only thing i've changed for steering sensitivity and aerial sensitivity this is all personal preference there are some players that use this at four or three for me personally i turn on my own like i turn without wanting to turn on a sensitivity is that high so i tend to have mine low enough so i don't feel like i'm turning too much from overturning so one way to test this for yourself and just find out what you think you should use and what'll be best for you is for example set this to something high like two for aerial sense try to jump up and see if you overturn so you see how i jump up here and i instantly like feel like i'm wobbling you see my car is wobbling i'm just trying to like level up but i'm wobbling everywhere that's how you know it's too high for you so i'm going to go down to what feels comfortable to me which is 1.4 the range is multiple used for this i'd say anywhere between 1.15 all the way up to like 1.85 is the most common outside of that there are some outliers that use 1.92 some some use three some use four very few amount though use sensitivity is that high but in general you want to stay around the 1.4 1.3 range those are the best most consistent sensitivities in my opinion and most pros do use those sensitivities as well controller dead zone is completely up to your controller if you find that your right stick is doing this kind of thing where it shakes on its own i can't do it on my own it's kind of hard to replicate it but sometimes your right stick will just shake on its own that's called stick drift and uh you'll also be able to see that if you respawn in a straight line with the ball you just drive forward if your car is straying off to the left like this a little bit or straight off to the right a little bit that stick drift as well and you should raise your dead zone accordingly so raise it until you no longer have that stick drift and you're straight instead of being you know driving off to the left or to the right so i have mine at 0.05 and i can put this as low as like i said until it starts driving me on my own to a certain direction so if i wanted to i could probably put this on 0.01 without it doing it but once i go to zero this is a good example you see how it turns me to my left that might happen to some controllers on 0.05 so this is not a one size fits all this completely depends on your controller and how your controller reacts to the game pretty much if if your stick is bad then you're gonna want to have a higher design if your stick is really good you could probably use a 0.0201 denzel to be honest uh most people use a nice solid consistent 0.05 because for most controllers it works it's fast it's very smooth responsive you'll probably like that so we're going to dodge zone now completely up to you again pretty much preference but the range most people use for this anywhere between 0.45 up to 0.75 is the most common range for this i'd say i would say though if you're having trouble with fast aerials raising this will help you a lot because the biggest issue with fast foods that people have is they accidentally backflip and this study right here is mainly to help prevent that so if you're having trouble letting go of your stick in time then this is going to be a setting that will help you a lot with just getting better at the fast aerials so i would definitely recommend having this at 0.7 or 0.75 uh moving on to interface here this is completely preference for the most part uh some people have this changed i know justin has this of like 87 then 95 150 so that's just in settings if you guys want it um but there's players that have interface and display scale change i never like changing these settings to be honest i like keeping them default i never liked having my boost meter be smaller you see my boost meter shrinks on the bottom right there i like having it normal size all the time i feel like it's nice to have that information big in your face you don't have to stare at it it's always in your peripheral you don't have to pay attention to it you can just always see it's always kind of in your vision nameplate skill i like to have this at 150 to 130 between this region i think it's perfect i would go as small as 120 but no smaller this is my personal preference there are some players that use even 80 for this maybe even 100 but this helps you a lot for seeing people around the field and having a better vision understanding what's going on around you so having a bigger nameplate skill is definitely helpful it's definitely a setting that'll help you massively in the game if you don't already have this if you have this on default try raising this to 130 or 150 you'll love it promise you nameplate mode default i think is always showing i'm pretty sure like default is so that the nameplate no matter how far away someone is it's always showing if you put it on simplified or nearby only i think it is nearby only it shows uh only when they're closed no when they're far away turns to just a triangle i don't like that at all i like knowing exactly where people are having it big bolded and known because that information is very important uh i have all this stuff off for the most part and uh i don't really like having the red thing on the bottom left here all preference but i don't even know when it's on or off i can tell all preference so like i said video settings here most people have this all off i as well have it all off lowest for everything the only thing i potentially change here and sometimes do change is uh world detail and you'll see it makes the grass look a lot better but also on top of that when i hit the ball here you see how the ball has four or five trails i'm gonna hit it one more time really fast yeah it has like four or five trails if i turn that off if i go here turn the performance and hit it you'll see it now becomes just one trail the only time i'll switch is if i just feel a little bit off on the normal game i'll use it on high and it kind of gives me a little mental reset and it starts feeling nice again so i like to have it high for the multiple ball trails and also the grass makes it look not a lot nicer as well to be honest i think the grass really pulls the whole field together but yeah it's all a change for video settings personally uh for audio this is what i'm using but again this depends a lot on your your windows settings so it doesn't really have too much of an effect on you guys if your window settings are are different than mine if you have like the game on windows a lot lower or higher affects this a lot uh but these are the settings i'm using for audio for my chat i have everything default i'd keep it og and that's pretty much it guys those are all the settings i'm gonna go over for today but i hope i covered them in some depth and i hope you guys have a better understanding of what to use what most pros are using right now and what's going to give you the best advantage there are definitely settings that are bad but for the most part settings are all preference and you can almost make everything work but it depends because there are some settings that you should never be using for example something like this this is something completely random you shouldn't be using something like this although it doesn't look terrible right it doesn't look awful you're gonna have a tough time getting precise touches on this and you're gonna give yourself an advantage if you use something like what i'm using for sure i'll definitely give you an advantage so there are no settings that are wrong but there are definitely more right settings i think if that makes sense but yeah i hope you guys
