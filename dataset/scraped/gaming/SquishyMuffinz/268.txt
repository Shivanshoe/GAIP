for making this dream a possibility I appreciate you and if you guys enjoy it today's video you know guys gonna be so lacking some tuesd games for today were 19:51 MMR so let's get straight into I'm using the black benek setup right now a dude black matte fennec looks so clean and nothing compares to look so damn nice so let's get into it I think it's gonna give me super powers because it's a nice matte smooth silky black looks so nice let's get into it see how it goes alright for the first thing we got ourselves Mikey gets buzzed and Jung Lee's and all that memoirs are pretty even I'd say 1982 hundreds all round I'm playing a crazy amount of twos this season to be honest like I've really been grinding to you super hard so my memoirs not extremely high playing more threes and one's not even a lot of ones really mainly just threes like but I've been playing a lot of rain I think I have a decent amount of twos games played I just haven't won like a ridiculous amount like I normally do when I'm trying to get hot at the leaderboard I've kind of been having fun with rank more anything it's been more enjoyable for sure the experience little bit unlucky day challenge you got a temper might sue me I think it's low on the save here I tapped it close teammate circuit which was fine we need to flick it a lot quicker that was the only issue day he just took a little bit too long to flick it away I might actually been a goal for us a few folks did a little bit unique for one more decent block my tune actually went for that again so not sure if it's gonna be in or not I think it is unlucky welcome back I believe probably shouldn't be coming for that ball though they're a lot closer than you just wait wait on the touch so probably make a mistake and you can get a plug on before you need to force that and their full possession of the ball they can choose what's gonna happen next going forward or as you kind of have to just react right so you shouldn't jump really we don't really know what's gonna happen over to gonna be back there nice should I kill me should be free nice we can come back we have a lot of time it goes the government we're just defensive mistakes anything honestly defending psychic laughs is kickoff nice that was a good call because you just scored directly off of it I guess I thought I was gonna go I'm not sure cuz it look like it's go up it's weird the opponent good job down I don't know decent 50 shutters getting away be annoying my teammate it's fine good even scarf this maybe there we go Plus that counters like they did their first tee goals are kind of the same thing is that really what's gonna fake it seems I was like for his touch it's fun on the other force anything that's okay do you read did exactly what I was trying not to do but it's all good from I still have a decent amount of boost she I just slowly force the ball around them chooses a lot about just being patient honestly and just being in a good position to follow what's gonna happen next like I don't really need to address any of these balls because eventually just gonna give it right back to me like kind of just wait try pass to my teammate should be shootable might even be scorable you know like all I did they were just wait and they eventually gave me the ball for free and that was like the mistake I was talking about earlier for my teammate where he could have just waited on their touches and studied delve in and then it's kinda free go out of it so you have to kind of have that patience where you know you're not gonna overextend but also know when to address when you can how's the demo I'll be back it is a spa fine 26 booty also got a hole into your boots really wall in twos because if you waste your boots starts getting really tough really look for my teammate he's coming at a better angle nice all right for the balanced snow roll roll threat super close so it's fine good demo I was finally meeting my time there again like I got killed but I'm back and there's really no no threatening situation before day almost got a go out of that as well forcing them to make the mistakes Oh see I don't need to go for that that's a shot that I'm not gonna hand most of the time while he was fronting me left the bish me which is good how's everybody going for shots that are like super low percentage like that cuz it's really not worth it one touchdown could have been in good try just miss top corner playing for the bump on me so I'm gonna play a patient here I was good you spawned there a little bit unlucky on the spawn there past middle that's back to my teammate that's back to him I like the idea from I see anything to look for you both times as well but I snipe it was 107 boost I want to stay relevant in this play because I feel like there's a change something can come of it if not that cut it back off here it's gonna be a little awkward now it's fun I trust all right so you guys are doing good on demoing on the way back like that which I get seed pads before I get back oh my god mm I did for it all right they just gave off how did that not go in what the hell had nine points from that as a pretty juicy way good little too will come back as well but yeah that was never over I mean we had we had a lot of time and on top that the goals I got weren't like they were really out playing us you are there was more to us make it a little bit mistakes yeah there so and it was get the next game super solid place for a patient create a lot of good opportunities we like to see yeah so next let's even keep it up for the last game of the video be us alright got Astro and extra two dudes named Astro by the way one of them's asked her with an age and wear them just Astro without the age those gonna be interesting and red oak oh I know they just both ashes are good they're very solid players the dirt goes all the rest little players well everyone use around are the rest level I'm gonna try to wait for my chance here and then go for workshop at a far corner there we go but a nice and patient there don't need to force anything too early wait to get the best possible shot and worst case scenario he beat me to that ball goes straight to my teammate sir not bad at all there there's really no bad outcome don't step out to the corner I didn't rush it that early but fine maybe I can bumping me it's a good bump see me wasn't quite close enough nice feet I'm gonna leave that because it's probably at me please wait okay I thought it was the one for your sake but it's not there we go good plays you know I feel like I play smarter with my car's all black like this like I don't focus on my car at all I just focus on everything else doesn't make much sense but I guess in a way I feel the same way on octane that's why I used to use that default octane like this is a good team were playing against like they're both very solid to gain more plays and they're both like all the rights level we're playing like super solid affiliate against them and it should be like super close but playing smart smartin is still super important this day and age even even though mechanics are like passively more important now than they used to be if you're smart and you got mechanics you got it all that's just that's how you want to play that's what the best player in the world would be just perfect annex and you use it perfectly because you're just playing smart that's what I'm striving to be always always trying to be better you know I know I can get a lot better in terms of my intelligence that comes to the game and just find smarter I'm not making dumb mistakes a lot of the goals you give up these days are off mistake that you could probably avoid pretty easily so it's definitely a struggle but something I've been actively working on trying to improve its being smarter can I have one more I may be faking this for me I don't know kind of hard to tell I don't really want to mess that up and then we get immediately countered on my study I counted on you unless I can help that's fun could be hard for me to get a W if he does good for him that's a tough angle ok just my teammate it's not giving anything to work with just sitting right in the way that's how you got to do it nice we get it yeah really good patience a whole livia for fools got by the first guy take our time about a second of all day all right two minutes for goalie do I think if we score one more ting might give up but if there's for the next they can definitely don't come back no doubt in my mind right side nice pass I see this car if it's so clean I wish this was actually an option in game it's uses black paint job like this good pass by the way yeah that's what I figure they scored that one they probably would give up on the game but man I want to end up there that's that's perfect clean gameplay I'm happy with that and I think honestly I'm gonna be using this black fennec from now on I really like fennec but the black paint with the matte finish is so so nice on this car man I love it absolutely love it so yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night with examiner's when you're watching this like comment subscribe and I see you guys all in the next one I love y'all
