here not subscribed so if you're one of those people please go down below the video right now press that subscribe button then while you're at it press the bell as well she always notified when I upload a brand new video we're getting closer and closer to 1 mil every single day you guys have been showing me incredible support thank you so much for everything guys I appreciate it and let's keep it going we get to 1 mil way before you into the year if we keep this up so let's do it love y'all enjoy yo what is up guys today we're back with the brand new series that I was talking about I'm super excited to tell you guys how this works it's a completely original idea I've not seen this before in raqqa League and I think it has a lot of potentials so pretty much the gist of it is we're gonna be doing a ro 2 grand champion 1v1 for the series you guys wanted to see me try hard every single game for one whole world the grand champ series so that's what I'll be doing in this one I'll be trying to score in any way imaginable but there is a twist so here's where the challenge comes in so to start it off this doesn't affect our gameplay at all but what we're gonna do is go to create new preset and every single video we're gonna randomize are pretty set so this is our car for the video this is the first thing that popped up this is our car for the B so that's we're gonna be using alright now here's the fun part this is what gets tricky every single video we're gonna do random camera settings as well how we're gonna do this is gonna go on Google we're gonna go to random number generator we're gonna put in the minimum of each camera setting the maximum of each camera setting and whatever the random number generator gives me I have to use that camera setting for each slider for the entire video so for example if somehow I get the minimum of everything I'm gonna have to win with settings that look like this so that's the fun part of this video I'm gonna be doing everything I can in my power to score but I will have the disadvantage of not being able to see anything at all sometimes or maybe I'll find like insane camera settings get super lucky you never know but it I think there's some there's some settings here that if you get it like you're pretty much screwed I can't see my car at all if I get something like this so it's gonna be interesting that's the whole point of this entire series I hope you guys really like this idea I think it's gonna be fun so let's get into it let's test out what our first camera settings of this series will be if you guys like this idea then trust me this isn't gonna be a one time series I could do this you know over the years over and over again if you guys really like this I give you a different game modes I don't wanna mess with people too much like playing threes with camera settings that are really bad because I mess with other people I'm playing won't be one if I lose because of it and just for fun right that's what I think this is gonna be a good idea but yeah let me know down below if you like this idea let's get in to actually figure out what our camera settings will be for this video yeah hopefully we get some really really hard settings to use because we are playing our placement games for today our first placement games so obviously the players are plenty ants aren't gonna be that great so we need a big challenge to make it at least somewhat fair so let's go on Google right now I'm gonna switch the screen to my displace you guys can see there better number generator I would just have some really quick you can do negative numbers and you can so we're good to go man everything is looking good this is gonna be fun as hell let's find out what our first camera settings let's generate 60 is the minimum fov 110 is the max so let's all right so we got 86 fov that's our first camera say let's go into the game and let's input that really quick all right from 110 to 86 that's our first setting done all right so this since we got minimum of 100 maximum of 400 our kid is gonna be interesting so minimum 100 maximum generate we got ourselves 289 distance number we did get was 289 and obviously these go by tens so the closest thing for the number is 290 we'll just round it up and that's we're gonna be using for our distance which is actually not a bad number at all that's not that much of a disadvantage you setting so far aren't too bad can't lie to you so we got a height now and we got 40 to 200 now this one makes a big difference this one makes a huge difference so we got 40 is the minimum 200 as the max the 40 minimum 200 max weirdness 120 height that's not bad at all man these settings aren't actually that bad that's the middie of the series though you never know we're gonna get I hope we get some like really like impossible to play with camera setting and one of these videos because that would just be so much fun imagine being the grand champ when I can't even see my car like the heights all the way up be so [ __ ] we got negative 15 as the absolute minimum to zero alright negative 15 to 0 we got ourselves negative 12 alright so we got ourselves negative 12 for angle okay so that's gonna make things a little interesting so we're working with so far interesting settings interesting settings yeah I love this idea I really do love this idea like I was super happy to get this out to you guys like I really wanted you guys to see what I was talking about I think that some of these videos could've so much fun playing with these weird settings all right so let's get to the stiffness now the minimum is zero point zero zero and the max is one point to the zero zero so let's go figure out what our sicknesses all right first stiffness I'm just gonna do a zero to 100 because when you do zero point zero to one point zero zero and obviously you're just gonna put one or zero so I'm just gonna do zero to 100 and whatever we get will just convert that into the decimal in game so we got ourselves 14 sorry that that's gonna be 0.15 stiffness let's change that in game real quick all right 0.15 stiffness all right so we got our sit this in put it as well so the first five settings are good to go I'm not gonna even bother with this full of speed because it doesn't have a major effect on the gameplay like only effects left and right looking which isn't a big deal so I keep that sixteenth higher series also guys story about this intro being so long I really want to get you guys to understand how this series gonna work it's pretty straightforward but we're walking through this one very slow and the other ones would go through much quicker we'll kind of do the random number generator and then put the cameras in again really quick but this one I'm going step by step so you guys can see what I'm doing for the entire series but this pretty much the gist of it for the last one we're gonna be doing transition speed this does have an effect because when I am joining welcome on and off it'll give me a headache when it's on too so we don't really want it to be that so we're gonna be going anywhere between that one point zero zero and two pi zero zero for the vendor murmurs generator I'm gonna do one hundred and two hundred and then just go from there cuz again if you do one point zero zero two point zero zero it's just gonna you know give me one or two and I can't have that so let's go check some between 100 and 200 we got ourselves 146 146 would come out 21.5 after rounding it so that's a transition speed that's pretty neck breaking it's pretty fast so it's a little bit knowing to play with honestly as soon as we got aren't terrible so for the very first episode of this road to grand champ I'm calling it randomizer edition that's what I named it I don't know I really know what to name the series to be honest but all these settings are random our car presets random so so why not name it randomizer edition you know what everything's random that's all point that's you so these are settings not bad at all to be honest they don't they don't look too terrible it's gonna be kind of hard to pull off like crazy stuff on these because you have limited field of view I feel like but we'll see what we can do and I'm gonna be sweating my balls off 100% try my best that's what you guys wanted in the previous one the previous ones are strictly for learning whereas this one it's gonna be more for fun and trying to hit as many cool goals and just trying to win by as much as possible pretty much so yeah let's get into the games with these have these beautiful beautiful camera settings the first camera settings of this series that may may go on to be a classic series who knows maybe you guys will absolutely love this maybe won't I have no clue I'm going into this blind and if anyone's watching it right now wants to try it for yourself and have fun with it I think it's a great idea I just popped up in my head the other night and I was like this would be a sick idea for for a video and I've been thinking about it ever since and a camera it's actually getting to a game and play the first games with these and obviously throught this year is gonna have so many so many funny ass camera settings so should be fun this is only the beginning let's get into the games though alright so we have 0 out of 10 that matches plate as you can see and of course we finish out the previous row 2 grand champ on this account I finished off at 50 51 we're still undefeated and it's gonna be a hard as hell to be undefeated at the end of this series because we're using ridiculous settings it is super hard to get the grant to quite a lot of really good won't be on players so we'll see a big average grade ship like this definitely dock people do we needed I don't think it's gonna be very difficult but regardless is getting into the first games of this series I can't wait let's see how this goes this car is the first of many random presets you'll see throughout this this series pretty interesting what the game put together here but honestly I'm pretty sure the road hog has an oxide hitbox so I'll take you I'm the most used to octane o'clock so definitely we'll take this coin let's get to the game so let's see let's see how this goes are you finally got a game the service have been giving issues so I'm glad we're at least able to find a match oh my did you could immediately tell though the Oh playing a smurf turn off the bat or play the Smurf you could tell I was gonna say that you can immediately tell the FB is the biggest thing that's hardly it you stupid settings like this even though I am gonna be trying really hard he said super but he's also spirt you could tell no one no one had bronze is flip it around like that and no one had a kickoff and stuff properly if I was gonna say even though we'll be going for like cool stuff and kind of messing around a lot this year I still I'm gonna be trying to give you guys tips every now and then and I'm gonna run it to tougher opponents where I need to take it Superseries obviously so dude this thing give me a headache man I gotta stop turning off my ball Kim you're crazy this guy's flicking a bronze no way our first thing we read this summer that's crazy let's go dude these studies are kind of nuts he left he's getting out smurfed he just left alright might to play a couple games just because people might leave early especially for we're trying super hard we'll see what happens that was like very that was really quick that was like way too quick let's get to the next one you got 500 mm are 550 of them are for that she eased to you all right let's get to the next all right playing against pretty tinkles I'm gonna fake kickoff I always fake it often once on the corners at least almost always because I've had a history of losing them pretty badly so the combat that I faked them so they give me the ball for free and then I don't have that risk of losing why is everyone so good at dribbling is everyone smurfing in once I swear I did you know what you get a dribbling for this ring but yeah especially when I get to the high rank so plating it's better players I'm gonna give you guys as many tips as possible even though it will be using dump settings I could still give you guys positioning tips chicken imagine I hit some like ridiculous Shaun like the dumbest settings like some double flip reset I'm gonna go flip reset this game that's that's the goal oh I didn't want a double jump there double set what what other not double-time hmm this is the one right here yo dude this is hard man I completely underestimated how hard this would be I would love if one of these episodes we get 110 that would be somehow let me Holly oh no way dude chick you're here I love it if you are like what is this guy doing that probably looks I probably look like weird like I'm doing like things that a good player could do but I'm not doing at all cuz I can't like fully tell what I'm looking at double flip reset right here Oh see I felt like I was scoring that and then it went so far why I did one thing I will say that lower fov for some reason challenging feels so easy you're tackling a dribble no way I almost got double flip you said no dude recover recover you show up oh I thought I owned gold okay that was happening pitch I'm bitching no way go in no way this guy saves this what is this Frank I don't understand this is my my place me games 200mm are be flip do it it feels like I'm scoring all these I don't let's go is challenging feels nice more lie to you no flip for that just playing solid them and it's definitely not this ring I'll tell you that much we were playing the too busy road to grand champ everyone we played the early ranks you could tell they were definitely the rank there but they're at oh my god yeah I thought I was banging that this is so much harder than I thought it yours are the tries for yourself we could also do something like if you guys try this yourself and you find some like ridiculously hard setting to play with like I try to play with them for an episode let's go I know there's a lot of possibilities with this but it's hard as hell also I don't know what to say my people ask for rank and stuff like that I don't have any good responses I don't want to upset anyone either dude I keep thinking like my depth perception is so off I know this guy's book show is really good though for how low is NMR is so if somebody just doesn't play the ones much Oh someone who doesn't play ones much or he might be on a new account obviously but who knows for ones though one tip that will remain the same throughout pretty much this entire this entire series one serious tip with the fake challenge as much as possible without doing with you again it feels like I'm eating the ball but I'm not fake challenge as much as possible without throwing away your position so they give you the ball for free that's one big tip that will work against any rank you want to try to make them give you the ball for for free without having to do anything that's always how you want to play it won't be won in situations imagine I hit a double flip you said dude with this I've been practicing this lately I can actually do them now one more a gerbil across the map he seems that as well let's go dude that's height that's height and so are they control your car at the settings man oh I'm gonna be honest unranked I know you aren't the real squish the mate the man thinks because I was playing so bad so bad that it's not me that's funny he's champ one in twos and threes that makes sense I feel bad for people that are just starting to play this game and they play well everyone ranked and then just get this short but people that are just like way better like it's all this guy wasn't obviously this low rank but uh but you know anyway let's play one more game because the first one was a early forfeit but let's see if we can get a nice goal or two in the next got 17 points that only that's pretty bad because I guy was lower my mark you just started playing ones I guess let's see the next up and see we can do dude we played nothing but question mark profiles and someone who hasn't played ones yet so we're playing better opponents than we're expecting already this is interesting now I was watching my brother play ones of the day and he ran into so many Smurfs I didn't realize that there was this many Smurfs and ones until like right now like I thought he was getting unlucky but there actually are so many Smurfs it's crazy the question Mike profiles are not many dead giveaways and I don't know this guy does it look like crazy good though it's probably some of us like diamond or something and he's just trying to pry this one's on a halt alright nothing but good goals this game but I showed you guys situation still when he does up the bowl of a face challenging a I showed you guys a lot of it in twos and the situations where it's helpful but in one's like in terms of getting possession of the ball back if you're in an awkward spot fake challenge he's gonna bail you out a lot so if you are looking to take one seriously something you should definitely practice kind of digging this car though low-key man [Laughter] I'm not even doing and these going as fast as possible I better hit a slippery salt on them I can't I can't drain anything mm mm reset oh it dumped them I didn't really get the double but you left I think I got the flip out of that I didn't get the second flip head tuck them up and just in salute low okay one more one weird game and all of those way too quick do you really there's like breeze buyer placement games if they go like this then we still have our undefeated streak alive we got another 20 points in that pretty soulless into what should be the last game of the video another low MMR play why does everyone say okay when I'm doing the lobby he has like diamond stuff on there's obviously not a bad player like last season the diamond decals he has on trying to bump him why is he saying okay every time a lot of guys really like the chat reactions to the previous series so if you like those when I was like only somewhat trying to go for cool stuff I can go for whatever I want to go for this whole time should be some funny reactions I don't wanna make anyone mad but I guess it doesn't make good content almost I'm going back alright so fake challenge in this situation okay you just threw the ball away really but that was a good spot if he didn't control that boss perfect spot the fake challenge but it's pretty fast this guy playing pretty pretty solid go for a bump on him nature will pump you've waited too long he was screwed though to be fair like you can't get out of that situation if I wanted to I could like literally just go for edge road bumps this whole ski she's just a troll I got Friday edge will bump my way to green chip mister side part if you do that every time you could actually win every game I'm gonna do it again you can go for the ball it is just so hard to judge how high I'm hitting the ball with these settings oh let's go I saw you staying with this on the angle oh I want you guys to guess how many games gonna take me to get the GC in this this mode while using this word settings because well they'll start playing higher rank people it's gonna get really hard like I stopped focusing for a second the kid says dude is like diving it's already it's already hard of that hahaha to be fair I mess around a bit but it's like he gets better players gonna be really tough man watch the replay see the road hog flying through there sound ranking that is my response for doubt because you guys have to give me responses I don't know what to say after last you know the double tap the angle Oh actually get that let's go we had two good goals of scheme so far that was hard to salt a hit on these settings from I didn't even look like I had it I sit on rank again because he went silver I mean it's not sober either either he has diving stuff on big aerials dude it's so hard to pee the whole just the one this is about to be it all the video right here oh [ __ ] what do I know Oh big hustle hmm dude how are they that off I really felt like I was making contact there my perception is so bad a lot of the fumes come out of the pipes in this car as well you really see the fuse reverse dribble wait dude it's so hard to do that to you I want to get something like nuts I'll flip you say no only one did my goal is to hit one double flip reset in this entire series that's my goal now I want to go for boots I can get that this guy's not bad on like on the ground I'm showing the ball on the ground but my balls are like weird spots for him y'all galaxy doesn't know how to react to him yet I'm blaming for that like he's not gonna be able to know how to defend against these things spray it I saw are the empowerment no he's so funny that's the best alright sit him with the bamboos I'm gonna fake you off and then you go off the top and you head down hey wait I'm up here what well I bumped them okay work and see we can do you the last 30 seconds with this car set up in these camera settings can't say I'll miss them it's a missile these are pretty tough to play with but I can't live where you kind of lucked out get into the lowers I think we'll get a lot worse than this I don't put I don't believe my eyes I think once you get to like higher ranks though I can obviously commentate as if I'm trying to teach you guys stuff but I'm gonna be using these settings I can go for about one obviously but I'd fun with it but for these lower ranks is gonna be just messing around and fun I have fun with it but yeah that's gonna be it for this first episode of the randomizer addition of protech hm I hope you guys enjoyed it even though it probably is a little bit stupid at first I hope you guys we're gonna like it over time I think it's gonna be a lot of a lot of cute videos to come from this so I hope you guys enjoyed it off for the first video for
