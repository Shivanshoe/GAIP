before we get into the video guys as you know we're on the road to 1 million subscribers and there's still a good chunk you guys who are watching my content and you're not subscribed so if you're out one of those people go down below the channel right now press that subscribe button and press the bells most always notified when I upload a brand new video thank you so much for the tremendous support that you guys have been absolutely insane I can't thank y'all enough at this rate we could reach a million subs way before the end of the year which is just ridiculous thinking about so thank you so much I appreciate you guys more than you know enjoy the video yo what is up guys are back with episode 2 of the road 2 grand champ randomizer edition and the previous one this was our ugly car and we're gonna be randomizing that right now to the brand new wait for it oh my no dude the boosts ow are you kidding me this is where we get oh we have to hear this boost on the whole video rules are rules rules are rules we went immediately from the previous car to the new car for this video this is what we're using ugly ass care so that's our car for the video now we got to pick our camera settings if you guys didn't watch the last video you got to watch that to figure out why I'm doing what I'm doing it's low point of the stage pretty much you just pick random camera settings you go on Google random number generator between the minimum and maximum each of the camera settings and you pick camera settings randomly that's the whole point it's randomizer addition so let's get into training and get her camera setting setup all right for fov we got ourselves 64 dude 64 to be so hard to play with all right rules are rules 64 fov alright so 64 did oh my god no no no no there's gonna be so hard to play with Jesus Christ okay 64 that's out of the way distance by distance we got ourselves 325 okay that kind of bounces it out a little bit 3:25 so gonna round up to 3:30 on that now bounces out or fov a little bit cuz if you had blue lobe distance look what it would look like we would not be able to see anything though the 3:30 distance does balance things out quite a bit so we'll definitely take that so on - hi alright so for our height we got ourselves 40 17 dude after I did the field of view I don't think I showed you guys the random number generator for either the distance or the height but take my word for it I would want to play with either of these settings so I did not rig this this is what it gave me I just realized I didn't show you guys so we're gonna go onto angle and show you guys from there like we should be I just forgot alright so for angle we got ourselves a negative 7 that's not bad not too bad at all we could work with that negative 7 is a nice mid-range number we're gonna have a lot of view of the field actually not bad at all so far to be honest like this worked out pretty well you guys got to trust me when I say that we did get the height of 50 and the distance of three thirds is actually what we got it I wasn't just making that up I didn't show you I guess I didn't press the display captures you guys couldn't see it but those are the the settings we got so far now I want to sniff this when you have two more left stiffness and transitions let's get those done for stiffness we got ourselves 0 to 155 stiffness not bad that's not bad at all ok these are actually settings we might be able to work with the only thing that I'm worried about is the FOV making things hard to to hit like perception gonna be really off but anyway the last thing we got is the transition speed the 100 to 200 so you're finding between 195 dude no way we got the highest possible transition speed we got the highest possible you got maxed out trans just be that - so our next literally gonna snap look at this oh my god this is hard oh no dude I'm not doing too bad with these okay this is hard as hell to play with and then we got this time I apologize for not switching my display character for the business and the height you guys didn't get to see those but I think my reactions will still be over so you can see that it's legit either way these are the things that we got if you guys want to try them out try them up for yourself so you can see how hard it is to play with that's the fun part about the series as well all these things that I'm using in these videos give it a try yourself so you can see how hard it is to play with these settings and how hard it is to hit the ball would make good contact on it so uh so yeah let's get into the next games for today's video these are the settings were rocking with let's get into it let's see if we can keep up the win streak dude I hate our snappy the ball cam is that's the one thing that's really throwing me off already planning its Maddy boy I turn off my book him and back on a lot every time I flip so might give you guys a headache your challenge I can't see anything dude let's go big start to the game I might have to lower my interface skills do that maybe I could see more like that I could see so much more now oh yeah I have a good field of view now is that cheating I feel like it shouldn't be counted as cheating excited to change my camera settings technically that I don't go oh my lord what the this guy is incredible wait this guy's not look how he's moving around with his boots and stuff dude he's moving around speedy I might have an actual good matchup already I'm faking he says give me the ball for free let's get to work no matter who we're playing we're gonna do it to him you know we had to do it to him I can't tell this in Zen my goal I said my goal did oh no I'm actually scared tortoise how to dribble backwards as long as I can't see the top of my car this guy's actually go dude right now all right we got to go full sweaty mood oh no wait I'm insane I actually just surprised myself I can't believe is cord this I gotta flip off the ball and then I flipped into it a head that was insane with I wouldn't even be scored that on my normal settings I cannot stand these flat did the game literally gave me the most annoying combo it made me have the lowest possible height with the ugly-ass flour-based so I have to see this Barbra's my face no longer imagine this guy looks at a replay and sees my camera settings I'm going for shot although I can't see what's happening to the corner are we good oh I missed a boost I don't like to have an interface feel smaller I'm so used to see my voice bigger dude you can't read anything on this how am I ever gonna be hiring players like really high rate players - oh no wait that ball I'm so proud of myself I'm gonna go for a demo here you gotta whip out some demos in ones well nowadays gonna whip them on every game mode oh you saw stood it up someone stop this man just jamming out my saw stood him up with his flower beast oh this is way more fun than playing the game normally I'm not gonna lie to you alright oh this is the one right here not gonna hit them well I'm not even going toward his goal no way men this is so hard dude I thought it'd be so much easier to control my car with this stuff but it's not I thought it field hits of like really cool high schools with these headaches but I can't figure them know what I'm going no no no I can actually loose I just realize that I don't have a big lead oh I'm feeling it he's feeling it Michael I though the game also feels like way more action-packed with these settings I need some high height settings man I hate these low light setting like this is so hard to have a good perception what's happening oh let's go I double tap that I'm kind of feeling it right now these settings I was kind of nice let's go did you start you start to the the video you know I was scared first you just kind of popping off and I was scared but came through empty I'm gonna raise the interface scale back up cuz way too small there's no way these kind of silver man these guys are just too good to be silver there's no way is the ones that might like just people don't play it as much right it has to be a power game I was gonna play once it we're playing so many load my player is good like they're actually good so let's see let's get the next game to see we run up against 24 points for that game there let's go alright we're playing is another question my profile so most likely a new account again that's kind of crazy I'm not even score off that yet I guess I should be just going like super hard on the hall oh my god oh this guy yeah it's got this Murr I could tell he's dribbling the ball around dude I guess I can't be bad I'm also on this first but take Church Wow Oh turns he wants a freestyle all you want on me okay I'm taking the dub though turn this into a freestyle everyone okay Sam just salami what you got Sam alright I like it I like the attempt I'm ending with a pinch I don't know where he's he died wha manglu that what a bump above him no we stop can you even do that patients care I mean I hope I assume you can it's just like I can't see what's happening oh no oh my god oh the god flakes better coming in Oh oh my god I gave you see the ball why it's gotta playing no you see one see it's a new account see one what I see you from Sam the salami I did not expect to be freestyling we wanting in a scarab on these camera settings today when I woke up but I'm down easy reads oh this is it right here okay never mind dude this is impossible to get a good goal it's actually impossible after this series guys I was thinking I would do I can see I was thinking I would do a road a good shape at threes where I can't score that would be the idea of it wrote a grand champ but only my teammates can score and just give you guys made it as possible for threes and trying to improve your team play might be the whole idea that series I don't trust this guy I'm gonna score more I think you guys seen her learn a lot from that if I did I wrote a grant shape of threes and only tried to set up my team or another position wall I literally wouldn't I would try to not score at all the entire time and if like they somehow own-goal off a touch of mine the only way I could really make that d'affaires if I only go back but I don't make my team upset double tap no I can't lose to you Sam the salami you can't do this to me you can't tell me we're no free stuff won't be won and then beat me like this you're that I think he's going for the fakie golf thing that I've been doing but can you let me be on no I cannot let you weigh on it is against the rules I'm gonna play all right give it to me Sam I'm gonna play to my janky camera settings like fake challenge man easy easy business you see one but the fake challenges are still enough to bamboozle I'll take the vicious it's gonna go up at the corner come back middle I'm gonna wait I can't see the ball of there Oh big challenges yeah oh not like this dude I'm not letting me lose this early not letting me loose part of the Sun right big flakes hmm ray oh [ __ ] that boost I'm too smart oh let's go D that's how you that's hype right there if I've ever seen it a hype goal that's how you right there Rick are you normally though I'm not answer that question this is my problem these questions aren't answerable oh you can't win it's impossible our gear giver guild we kept our our streak alive one more game but do one more game I'm gonna say like dime and song he's a gold already dude what are we then already 750 MMR it's got a nice so everybody liked him what we're waiting bubble damn alright seen some nice game last name of the video last time I want to play with this terrible terrible car cameras any combination let's get into it he said oh [ __ ] you just work on mechanics bubble we're playing against someone named bubble you know bubble is one of those words that no matter how you say it it can never come out angry like you can't say the word bubble and sound like mad you could be like so mad at something here am I making any sense but was just one of those words you can't be angry and say yeah I mean it's just like you say and this sounds happy I probably sound really dumb but then again look what I'm doing so I think this flower bridge again to my head I'm leaving I'm dancing what you got bubble he's goaded oh you missed I got him blocked here watch this chain - hmm hmm well it feels cool what's up with you saying how long I try something no I didn't do it right well he's here dribbling - man I don't even know what rank are playing I haven't been keeping up with that like I did in the previous Rocha grand gym I'm assuming it this is already like flat I don't no idea I'll just the first two videos are all placements anyway like next video we'll be finishing up placements anyway so we'll see see bubble gives me the impression that he's a nice guy because his name is bubble so I bet she's not gonna type anything in this game he's not gonna get mad if he's losing by Allah he the type of guy to just be like GG and leaves you know gotta go kill me like that Baltimore now whoa oh that's kind of nice where's he gonna cut on this right this guy's dribbling and [ __ ] everywhere he's got a good good car control he faked challenge there he's not bad at all knows how to play the game for sure you could tell my first shot here shot could have definitely been better oh yeah shootings just slightly off everything I was like you could tell me his understanding of how to play well we won his dribbling is not bad knows how to control the ball catch him any see you all right playing out the wall I'm gonna get from there and figure out some any mine no sort of wall hit this is like better than most of the TVC players are playing against I feel like let that whole series like this consistency with things no flip on that well you backed out of it that's shameful that is truly shameful I was down to lock there for the next two minutes 18 seconds Oh No why is the game not punishing him the game should punish him for disconnecting my car is moving did you guys see that I don't wait we're good we're good he's ready balls grounded so I like a challenge there's no there's no danger to be able to get that past me in that position we're not even close to score not I'm so scared I've never been more scared oh my god did I can't see anything get me out of here please this guy is too sweaty for me right now not like this please miss somehow no dude he's so sweaty he's so sweaty the sad part is he broke out of the brook out of the room while diggie and still didn't get punished for it man the game may be the game's holding his punishment for lady oh oh yeah pie smart we can't really see much what our brain still works let's go dude let's go our brain still works you know I would love to get some like a really good camera setting so I can just hit like just super nice shots for the whole game every game of a video and not have to deal with barely winning because the settings are so bad bang see there's this karma dude it gave me a kick off ball I've only ever broke it out of like the lock few times probably two times because I like got bumped out of it but I immediately get scored on every time that happens to me I swear I can't see anything that wasn't bad at all though it's not over yet I still lose but this guy is not bad by any means dude it feels like eyeballs in front of my goal but it's not Giada you did yeah a year Oh Oh No was it a clip of the video oh I was so focused I felt like I was so focused that whole game I did not want to lose it I can't lose I don't want I don't want to lose any games between this series and then the next 3v3 series I want to try to be undefeated the whole way through it's gonna be so hard but I have faith I have so much faith and then we finish off this video at 793 MMR the guy we just put against with 624 at goal 3 so I'm assuming that means 700 is plot or 650 s plot I don't really know to be honest but we're in plat right now I think we're platter high I think maybe diamonds 800 I'm not sure to be honest with you but we are in a pretty good spot already and then we still have only three more games left the placement so for the third episode of this series was the last three placements and yeah hopefully we keep the the streak alive if we're doing pretty good and hopefully we get some good camera settings soon thanks to these settings were so bad just so hard to play with if you guys want to give the settings that I was using in this video try here they are one more time or of course you can go to the beginning of the video and fire them there but they are hard to stop play with I'll tell you that right now you should definitely not use it if you're trying to play series because this is super difficult to the ball but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed and I appreciate all the support you guys are incredible you guys do seem to enjoy the series so far what I saw on the first video so I'm glad you did and yeah hope to have a good rest of the series and have some more interesting games to go the appreciation show thank you for all the support as always like I said you guys are the absolute best see you guys on the next one like comment subscribe and I see all that peace you
