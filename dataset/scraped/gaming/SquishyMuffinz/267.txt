yo what is up guys so this is an announcement that i never thought i'd be making but i couldn't be happier to make it i will be joining energy alongside of georgie and justin i cannot wait for what the future holds with these two man like it's gonna be absolutely insane let's see if we can accomplish together as a team but along with that comes another announcement c9 is leaving rockley they're dropping out of rock league so gimmick a tournament no longer on c9 they got to find a new third player in a new organization as well so i wish them all the best of luck we had an incredible time together as uh as teammates and friends we won five major lands together which is ridiculous and you know endless memories man winning lcs that's something that we all wanted to accomplish when we came together as a team obviously that was all our main goal and we did that together on top of that we won four other major lands which is ridiculous to think about two of them being dreamhacks that's just it's kind of nuts when you think about it gmax are so difficult to win we won two together that's kind of crazy our skill on land was always way better than online for whatever reason and that always made it so much more fun when we got to atlanta because we just knew we'd do well every time that was such an amazing feeling i hope that with this new energy roster just playing at all times feels like that like playing online feels like that landfills like that it's just it's one of the best feelings when you know you're going to feel good like getting into a match and we always felt that way going on into a land match so yeah it's super exciting and uh i'm super happy to announce this to you guys and it's obviously sad to me believe in gimmick and torment because you know those two i absolute homies and i've known him for forever and they really helped me further my career and you know we did that together we really grew together as as players and people during that time so it's obviously very sad to me and i still wish them nothing but the best of luck and it's gonna be really weird playing against them in the future because i've done nothing but play with them for for four years so it's kind of crazy it's kind of crazy that all this is going on but i hope you guys still support me in my journey on energy i know a lot of you guys have wanted to see me play we're just on our team in our lcs and play with geared on a team in austin so i've recorded so many videos with these two in the past and they've always been my friends for the longest time so it's super dope to be teaming with more really good friends of mine and um two incredible players like justin's been in the conversation for best player in the world for dude who knows how long he's been he's been up there in the conversation for a very long time garrett same thing extremely consistent extremely talented player very few come close to his level consistency and what he's accomplished so i'm just super excited in general and uh and i don't know i don't know what else to say really but i just i really look forward to the future and i hope everything um everything works out for my ex teammates because yeah nothing but good times with them honestly i have no no regrets with them and how long i i stayed with them how long we stayed together nothing but happy memories and good times but uh but yeah this video is gonna be shorter than most of my videos but it's managed to get the announcement across that you know i am joining energy that's the whole thing you don't need a 30 minute video to announce that but uh what i do want to say is that uh i want to do a nice ending video for me leaving c9 so what i want to do is make a top 10 favorite goals during my time on c9 my c9 era and uh i'm gonna talk about like what i was thinking while i was like you know in the process of scoring the goal and uh you know just ranked them one to ten my favorite my favorite goal of all time you guys will see what i think my top 10 favorite goals of all time from my c9 era c9 days and hopefully in the future whenever i retire or whenever i move to a different team which i hope isn't for a very very very long time because i'm really looking forward to playing with these guys for as long as possible literally as long as possible but um yeah that's exactly what i said when i joined the gimmick and tournament as well i want to play with these guys for as long as possible four years later and i'm actually switching to a different team but um yeah like i said i wanna put you guys for as long as possible but in the future i'm gonna do the same thing i'll make a top 10 calls of my energy energy days which hopefully isn't for a very very long time like i said hopefully that's when i retire that i have to make that video though but uh yeah that's about it for this video guys i didn't want to string it on too long but you guys on youtube are you know a big part of my everyday life big part of my journey in rocket league so i need to make sure that you guys know what's going on because a lot of you guys might not follow me on twitter you might not follow me on
