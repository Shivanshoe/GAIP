yo what's up guys for the last video we did our hoops placements for this video we're gonna be doing our drop shot placements and for the next one we should be doing our rumble placements just two of them for each um outside of that after we're done those maybe i'll do snow day i'm not sure um if we don't do snow day then we'll just play 1v1 placements maybe or we'll just play two something like that um but yeah that'll be the next couple videos i am going to be in la for the rlcs major coming soon so i'm trying to get some videos done for you guys for when i'm gone so that way you guys still have some content for me and when i come back things will resume as normal but yeah for now i'm gonna be playing some drop shot games for today let's get into it so you can get some dubs see how it goes all right well the first thing we got ace and broccoli against off missionary and dreaded just goes i actually don't recognize anyone in here obviously but we found this game actually pretty quick i just usually take pretty long for me to find but this one is fairly fast i actually love this game mode i feel like this came out of so much potential to be insanely good like i've always liked that i thought it was really good i always thought it would look sick in pro play as well it gets very messy i won't lie like extremely messy especially solo queuing it these guys are three queued usually gets pretty messy but we'll see all it takes in the day is just one good play and it doesn't matter how much damage they get really my teammates are kind of uh all over the place so far but it's what you can come to expect had a drop shot this is what i've signed up for and i know that i'm aware but we can still win this it's very very very very winnable they haven't done anything special they're just simply hitting the ball taking turns hitting the ball whereas my squad is kind of all over the place this mode is good though because i think it teaches you the importance of like quality of touches because every touch has to be good and you have to learn how to rotate around each other but my teammates have gone for the same ball i think every time so it's always going to be more difficult to get a play going forward like that every time every time we have a chance at the ball of like two or three go it's always going to be very hard to get any kind of pressure you should be a lot of damage we have a lot of time though hopefully the double commits happen a little bit less because there are some games truthfully where no matter what rank you are some games will be unwinnable you have to like learn to accept that i think that's something that over time i've learned to accept especially doing like three solo queue placements some of those games will be unwinnable like there's actually nothing you can do but just hope hope and pray that your teammates start to work together to an extent just lose some of the selfishness etc stuff like that oh like it's over every once in a while this is gonna be hard man i don't know if it's winnable it'll be very difficult oh no oh no all right maybe i should just go like super ball jc for the remainder of the game if i take over a bit i might do that i feel like it'll work i'll just keep going already working better yeah i definitely should have done this from the start trying to learn trying to actually rotate around in this mode maybe isn't the best yeah it worked so much better if i just go i'm just gonna go for everything i'm trying to actually rotate on my teammates and position around them but if everyone's not doing it it's not gonna work so i'm gonna just be the main aggressor and hopefully they just kind of give me room to do that it's pretty good no way no it's giving me anxiety man we're doing good though doing what we can nice huge oh no take your time broccoli all good i know i don't know if we got the damage or not there oh oh no i trust my team should be okay i got the way there oh no oh no i tried to back off with this on my teammate again it's been so messy i've actually never this is actually probably the messiest drop shot game ever played this game is usually chaotic but this one's like extra bad right now i don't know why feels like more more chaotic than usual somehow you could touch around them nice oh boy this could be it really my teammates there nice good job huge oh lord no no why oh man all good all good all good what can you do what can you do you know oh man that was hard that's hard on the mind um but yeah let's get into one more hopefully a little bit cleaner um let's see how it goes all right for the last game we got dudes and win vs chop mop sin and strawberry jam it i hope this one's a little bit better last game was not good i'll be honest was no bueno but okay drop shot can be like that meant to be chaotic oh god it's really hard when you go from like pro scrims all the time and then playing like placements early season and people are whiffing a lot really hard to be used to like it kind of honestly is bad because even like regular ranked as well a lot of people whiff and then kind of creates bad habits because you start to expect misses but pros do not miss like this so it becomes a an issue in a way but much better start to this game should beat this guy  bounce i don't think nice from tudes big damage man did not did not get it to go in for me nice to probably score here in a second they keep pressure someone should be there nice i'm trying to beat the guy that was up behind me but would have liked to be able to get a better angle to get a shot it's closer see like all of that is so hard to reach for me nice win might be a goal nice all right we've done well as a unit so far four people up for this ball oh no waiting behind you oh nice i'm gonna fake if i fake there it's not bad because it's gonna hit into my car it's gonna become like safe on my side which is good and it's a good spot to fake too so i get the possession later one more maybe nice mini little mind games there you try you should have a touch here all good oh oh good don't have any boost i can't do anything but still got a lot of damage off that's just good she have a double nice actually good damage let's open space back to my teammate also away from that hole there's a hole back there i don't really want to be near that they're doing good though oh it's almost i didn't realize there's a whole day it's good i'm gonna try to go for that hole maybe try to dunk him and he actually missed so i just faked me close no way i feel like that was an accident it seemed like he wanted to like hit it further and he actually just drove into it and shot it nobody shot into the one hole that is there i feel like that had to have been accident but if not well done i've never seen someone like purposely shoot by driving until like that and all my hours even like normal games no one's ever like purposely shot by just driving on the wall like that all right very losable this game has become losable still have faith in the squad though i'll hit her aside okay open space maybe i could beat this guy is huge oh my team went as well though it becomes less huge this is going really bad going super bad now kind of just flipped nice it's good nice okay and this one stresses me out actually stresses me out all right 18 seconds we have a lot of holes left i'm going to defend because i don't trust what's going to go on here i feel like it's going to go in that hole right okay no one will freaking go maybe it was mikey off to go for me that's on me i don't know all right that was a interesting set of games hope you guys enjoyed that you see that my games aren't always as clean as uh i'd like them to be either but uh it was fun either way hope you guys enjoyed it have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is watch this like comment subscribe and see us on the next
