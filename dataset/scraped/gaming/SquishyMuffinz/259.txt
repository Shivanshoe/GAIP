nice 50 potentially go as well nicely done actually me surprised you got a bit about that team while we're silly queuing and I see we run into them again they'll play extremely well on the next one so let's get to the next and see if we can finish with two wins if not we might end one of one but that's not too bad considering we were pointing it so it's going to the next even keep it up like goalie go all right for the last game of the video we're playing it's Lobo Noah and reluctant visa we never self glow-up and freshness on our team this map is so bright I never kid over it dude it's the brightest map I also raised like a bunch of monitor settings recently so it's probably not being my brightness in my my digital vibrance is way up let me focus get some pads on the way back nice touch so this boom this suit they do messed up each other there's good I almost had to go out of is well I can try to push this keep it in I've 80 boost here so my teammate can turn on this would be perfect your follow us on me that's fine Malibu's on defense still to try to follow one more close he would have been there for the shop I was good on my team it to be ready right side okay I definitely shouldn't have a position so aggressive there but I didn't think there was any a world where you could miss that to be high someone lie to you I was just way too aggressively position for a Miss like that to be ready whereas I should have been in a spot where I can react to bull all right well that's pretty cool this has been a fun game so far yeah not the not the greatest two plays back-to-back but yeah I mean come back I'm just gonna focus got a blast went home follow-up shot good job well done there's so much time now how does he get boomer on gold a it fall up as well like I should meet these guys I'm kind of worried know what they're gonna say but it's fine I'll leave it all right Tim it probably shouldn't rush that so much time with that that ball in the situation it's all good maybe a follow up nice that's fun little date why again should have left that for our supporting teammate who had a much better touch than him but it's okay he seems to be maybe a little bit no I'm just I can't really tell to be honest just making a a couple bad choices he in there right that's all good happens it's fine this is a decent touch okay I'll let him go all right that works you made up for it interesting hi we're back just like that 258 left gotta play smart number one I could quit all right Timmy's lost back for a little bit I try to go back as quickly as I can its funds you save all right let me bake a fuse there he jumped for that and I thought he's having then he didn't have in there wasn't enough time to react after that it's been quite a confusing game to be honest has it been the greatest this is what you can expect out of a 4 a.m. 4 a.m. queue also I would respond to these guys but they said some pretty interesting stuff so nice hit finish the double flip reset pass the job done be ready for that IRA back even yet again good say from now I'll go back let's go way back here nice that's fine I could turn this just faking see if they panic two of them Penates on that all I did this fake jump they're kind of wasting all their [ __ ] here can't double but I can get a touch to make a rocker for them which eventually so cool that's more than enough in that situation yeah those are tough to get to get clear on and freshness was ready I was a good good reaction to is clear your job to be there try just blast one home there we go good slow cheat I like to take those slowly just because if the ball just flies to either a wall you want to be ready you want to be able to react to it I'm so worried about this guy sniping this is the guy I type the questionable stuff before okay not that bad over 1 over 2 almost got the shot and get shy it's gonna be they're just gonna be ready for it there we go good try almost got there in time nice good play around one and then just a good shot to finish it off minute 18 I don't know if they're gonna stay in here we'll see like it deftly still come back but okay they are I'm glad we're good two full games me a Masucci said cool then people like they say stuff like this and they expect me to respond like if you just you talk like a normal person you ask me a normal question I respond but here say stuff like that I'm just not gonna even bother so I kill one maybe alright think I definitely still come back we gotta pay attention here nice the boom team it's up good speed middle pass I know I thought someone was like close to me that was my bad that's a bad pass you know that I cross fry under it - bouncing I don't mind how to get that around you miss should be there we good should be fine famous last words are we good everyone's within about we're good all right good two games been liking these settings a lot I feel like there's a lot of good about them a lot I'm not fully sure of yet but still getting used to them I do like the higher sip and it says something that I have liked in studies in the past so I'm gonna keep testing them out for like a week and if I decide to stick with them I think I want to stick with these settings for a while I don't want you to my settings for a while guys I think it's just gonna lead to black it's just to see if I keep changing as much as I as I normally - so I'm gonna try to stay with the same ones anyway I hope you guys enjoyed a video however some wonderful day or night but with Sanders when you're watching this like comment subscribe - see you guys all in the next one I love you peace you
