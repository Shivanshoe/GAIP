chicago should be some fun games let's get into it let's see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right first game we got ourselves kenny eris and that monkey lips i'm not sure i say that i'mma call him monk so i started off with the goal so that's how the game goes till the game begins i'm trying to read their names and i just didn't have a good kick off he won a really good challenge on musty and then chicago was just hot out just a little bit in front of the goal line tough spot to be in 90 of the time it's gonna be a goal against you anyway not a whole lot he could do there okay just unlocking start to the game we'll get it back play over one bumped him as well must he had to play playstation though it's not a bad decision from him to take that patient for that mid gotta just pop this down middle again for chicago should be open on that one don't do anything too crazy there i know the situation i know two of them just panic really hard for that ball i have all the power on the back wall there all in my touch whatever i do next with it played it pretty well not gonna challenge that it's going toward the opponent he's always gonna win that next touch put it over to the right side to musty played it down field forward not a bad idea for him at all tried to read and get a really good touch there couldn't quite i went for like the absolute most powerful touch i could have gotten and i ended up missing because of it put it around one more close i didn't think chicago was that close that's how i know what that's something that obviously if you're in calm like in discord or something you'd know not to go for that's why communicating is like super important in pro games because stuff like that would happen if you don't communicate but it's all good the simple mistake and it's more just not being able to be extremely aware of where everybody is can't see behind you at all times you can kind of assume where people are but you can't always know exactly where they're gonna be behind you if they're gonna go for the next ball it's hard to just assume all that based on game sense and knowledge of playing for a long time even if you have played for as long as i have it's still hard to assume that kind of stuff right i'm gonna wait here let them panic a bit as the ball bounces down go for some bumps be annoying take their boost here it's going to make their situation on defense much more difficult than they'd like it to be played around one here still playing on another one get one touch middle musty wasn't exactly in a shootable position yet but he was able to kind of cut around it made it potentially scorable there on midfield here with full boost make myself useful the touch comes middle i'll be ready it's a good look with you to go for they're gonna have the advantage if i go really quick for that so slowing down and going for low 50's definitely the better play i'd say get the mid boost here hit it back if i don't get the mid boost it's fine so this challenge again because i might as well make myself useful from already on the ceiling at that point get that from them let me try to go myself here you can take it now maybe a shot there we go i saw he was close i didn't want to follow it up just keep air drilling into the back wall because someone was back well anyway so it's better just leave that at that point i didn't go for that originally with the idea of a pass in mind but the game is very what's the word dynamic right things like that change really quick notice situation i noticed that it's best to leave it that's going to get me the goal so i left it not always about scoring especially not in a 3v3 environment that's for sure that's from chicago timberlake just enough time for us to get back i just said the corner are very good in threes that situation i'm still also trying to lay for my thing to get behind me and get boost right that's the situation there that's not a bad outcome at all because we win the next bunch of touches right not bad by any means we should get pressure out of this as well we should win this next hit and should have some sort of offensive pressure coming out of this keep this in now leave one more touch here really close to getting that pre-flip really good angle there all the way back for boost wait for musty's touch not a bad soul to play attempt is gonna be back hole though so i know it's not gonna lead to a goal so i shouldn't commit shouldn't commit to a super close touch at least nice you'd say from us awkward situation to be in for sure good save nonetheless for cargo's hit here i like to play i like to play a lot he slowed it down for the low 50. the 50 are just gonna mess with the defender no matter where he is and that's the one that ended up getting us the goal well played from chicago remember some sort of fake you got but they partied there okay try to control this chicago is also trying to control it that's going to lead to potential shock for them but we got out of it i didn't even see chicago there was so focus on the the next touch i was about to make it's fine wait for musty you couldn't quite get it so i gotta try to help out if i can't then is what it is but at least i tried right wait for the bounce here good read from him i don't know so i'll put it out of defense and just go for the air dribble across the map try to get onto their side into safety and they did a really good job to read that you got to give them the credit followed mostly such here they're already up for that i heard them so why am i going to jump there's no point let them get the touch my pressure my presence alone is enough to force out a worse touching they probably want there same situation right there trying to read the the pounds i would have had it but wouldn't have done much gonna be game regardless well played well played got the gold back pretty quickly like i said at the beginning went down early but we're able to get it back nice okay i didn't know that i was gonna bounce that was over just under the crossbar but we'll play good first game let's get into the next one let's even keep it up get back to back dubs let's see how it goes all right the last game playing against benny cha and tally bird again recognize everybody in this lobby gonna be very sweaty but winnable definitely winnable my back wall here i know he has a big touch so better to stay patient on the back wall you can accomplish a lot more than if you're diving and stuff rotate behind you get some pads sorry right side underneath him he wants to use me i started to notice that he was going just straight forward in the direction of the air dribble so there's no point of me staying on the right side i'm just going to go straight toward the opponent right might as well stay in as far where i can rotate back pretty quickly wait for mostly touch again good 50. didn't have a hit middle gotta follow this up hit it off the wall all right not bad we're not running bad so far we're just like haven't had a lot of good off offensive opportunities just been a lot of like ping pong and a lot of times in threes it does happen like the early game is a lot of just ping pong and there's really nothing being formulated but that's a big clearance a big counter and it might actually lead to a really good play coming up soon play off the wall again but for a good double tap trying to bump him it didn't really bump into i think he flipped as i went for the bump so it kind of just denied all the momentum that i had tried to push him away with hit around one better play down middle probably ended up winning the challenge the good challenge win i got bumped i got to be careful and mostly committed so i have to be a little bit more careful again try to get the read here maybe one more touch back to chicago all right now it's a little awkward cause chicago missed i don't have any boost here we got of it pretty well it's a good little like stutter step type of challenge we baited them in made them think we're doing something different came out on top going to wait for the past he only has one option is to hit it forward but keep my position wait for that option and good things would normally come from that on defense you just play patient look for the down bounce plate off the back wall in a spot where they can't actually follow it up taco touch wasn't in a very good spot but it should be okay i have to just kill time for my team now very bad bounce for me but i stayed in a position where i could still kind of react to it the very least wait for tally get the back boost here again same situation better to go back wall than to jump for that in an awkward way the more often or not you're gonna get more out of going back hole than you would for jumping for a ball like that look at the demo from them shadow just pressure this killed one try to bump the other one maybe just be annoying again i mentioned a lot in videos but like you don't have to necessarily be touching the ball or hitting an opponent to be useful like your presence alone near the ball or near a challenge often enough to make someone panic make them jump or make them make a mistake right you don't need to necessarily be hitting the ball at all times you don't need to necessarily be bumping somebody at all times even if you drive near them you make them jump you're messing up the rotation by even a half second that's enough in rocket league to really get you a goal right something so tiny is enough to do big things so as long as you're playing solid and going for the ball when you need to be and then off the ball you're looking for the right opportunities to go for bumps etcetera and go for just useful fake challenges stuff like that that's all you need it's a little bit confused there but cargo wanted if you wanted me to take it or not both did the same thing here though nice to musty good 50. wait behind here good shot from cargo close good save i bumped one though might be good enough from us to get another touch let's see has one more here that's a good play middle i'm gonna fake jump here try to make them panic a little bit and i can follow up the next touch they'll have to commit to that first one all they want there is to beat me to that ball nice try to follow this up hit it around one maybe good job you're trying the shot there messi should have this good control it's a good touch to make i'm gonna mess them up a little bit fun again am i getting beat to that ball it's not super dangerous i do mind getting bumped out though because that is really dangerous especially when you know you have to jump from in the net like monster was there oftentimes you can actually own gold by accident and that's obviously never what you want we go for some bumps here put them up another one just be annoying really just make them do something me just driving there make some half the flick immediately wait for the air dribble stay at the preset i'm watching the car like really closely there in that situation because i can't just assume where the ball's gonna go without someone looking at the car you have to know how the car is moving around the ball and what they're looking to try to accomplish right yeah it's gonna be off to you guys i hope you enjoyed was two actually really sweaty close games but yeah it's a lot of fun playing with chicago musty hope you guys enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever times when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next
