yo what's up guys gonna be playing some other one games for today let's get straight into it see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first time we got ourselves against fast it's actually um a really good up and coming player if this is what i think it is 13 year old i believe or 12 year old and he only grinds one than pretty sure so he's pretty good at them normally really high in leaderboards take a flick on that there we go good shot to start it off with good control there messed up his character so i slowed down my approach at the end and i could just take the free goal but i was just keeping my eyes locked on him and i saw that he didn't flip at first that's something that happens in my controller too if you don't flip right away like that tell me what it looks like he has beaten me before though he's a really good ones player i played i played him like probably a few weeks ago and he actually beat me very solid could definitely lose this game give me good practice he loves doing that fake as well he actually does that a lot right there he like leaves it on the the sidewall doesn't touch it at all when you have to jump if you're the defender it's actually really threatening position to put the ball into something that i never really try to go for something i can kind of steal from them maybe try to snipe it you messed up his touch and i have a little window just to take a fast shot there almost pulled it off did a good job to recover take my time here save again take this boost it's a good 50 at least i gotta watch out here it's awkward there's a huge advantage in the situation because he has a whole nother shootout and i'm like backward no boost so try to cover those options the best you can gotta get this boost here he's playing his offense are pretty smart though he's not fully committing on anything he's leaving himself a chance to actually get back which is something that i think a lot of players have a hard time doing is like figuring out what that risk is really worth when you're going all in on a chance right he's doing a good job take a flick ah seemed like it went through me to be honest a little bit there i don't know watch that back it's actually a good challenge i feel like because if that gets around them that's the goal for me looked a lot different on the replay though full challenge from him as well just a slow kick off there get some pads here we should come back for me maybe i think he just got it actually came back which is good i think the mid boost though try to pressure him early here let's go play from him he hit it too far away so i can't actually get a shot on this i heard him get stuck on my net so maybe i could speed this up a little bit unfortunately i can take this boost though he's trying to play super fast and just deny me of any boost like any kind of play forward smart way to play so these touches like you just made right there it doesn't give me many options forward it's really good to do for that reason challenges in general are really good actually nice it's very hard to find an opening the way he plays um those defensive situations makes it really difficult i just beat him here there we go took my time on the extra touch that was like a turn really a turn to make there because he's gonna be expecting me to take that a little bit more passively he's gonna be looking for an opportunity to get a shot and actually decided to go quick and be careful on kickoff though like i said he plays a lot of ones he mains ones and you can always expect their kickoff to be really good when they're playing ones all the time good job take advantage of that aggression we know he's liking to stay close this whole game prefers to be closer to play so we can find a way to get that over his head really quick got a good shot on that take my time here use some open space to the side here one touch take a touch maybe go in field there if i can get that cut that have been huge uh good demonstration unfortunate let's go never feel good to give up what can you do part of the game he actually just left the ball i didn't expect him to do that i won't lie to you but i was able to read him last second notice that's what he was trying to do and i was able to get the go out of it we'll take it just pop this i'm gonna get that boost but i'll just pressure just be annoying ah the single jump is smart there i actually can't get back at all so he had full boost and if i challenge that in any way if he single jumps it he can just get back down to the ground that's a good play from him he gets contact on the ball and he doesn't actually lose much of his position so it's a smart way to play that get this boost from him that's pretty big make him just hit that away maybe ah that's a good shot spacing is just a little bit off and he shot it perfectly that's what i put you could tell he's a very very experienced ones player so he just turns and goes for the shot there i can't believe that some very unexpected stuff it's pulling out the the right moves at the right times there you gotta give them respect for sure it's a lot of fun to play these players that grind this game mode they understand this game mode and you can learn little things about the mode from them you understand the current meadows and what you should do what works well this kind of bumping stuff chasing you into the corner to get free goals like that he's gotten two off of that something i really don't do i don't like playing like that smart way to play ones for sure though but that's something that like everyone now in ones seems to do at the high level it's a good beat should be able to recover there we go good play there to bait him in i had my eyes again just firmly locked on him i know he's going to go full aggro there he's trying to beat me kind of play fast as his name says as you'd expect i don't have any boost shots trying to play it around here should be a game all right good first game got a lot of points out that for sure he's like top 20 top 15 ish something like that because again the next one steven keep it up get back to back dubs let's see how it goes so it's probably around like number 15 ish i just took i i want to say like 20 points maybe 16 18 points from him something like that so he's probably around the 1514 mark on the leaderboard so that's a pretty big dub there someone who grinds a lot of ones and we move quite a ways up here we move to the 30 35 spot that's not bad at all all right let's get to the next game keep it up all right we got fast again give me another solid game another really tough one to win see if we can do that better adapt to what he was doing last game no boost here but i should be able to finish it off a really good beat in the air there and he's already he's a very fast player i'm not trying to make jokes about his name but he's actually a very fast player very smart player and for his age especially he's a lot of potential in the future gives me a very very tough matchup every single time in ones and i've seen them play other really good ones players and give them really tough matchups and beat them quite often so definitely someone to look out for in the future very unfortunate there that we get bumped off that play but maybe the smarter player would have been to pop it up like we did and then fake jump he's going to panic the same way i think i'm up for it jump instantly and i'm gonna have a pretty big advantage instead of just going forward and then getting potentially unlucky like we did right there uh you just shoot right away there so that's something again i just don't expect another really smart play from him is if i challenge him off the bat there i actually want to challenge really hard so i expect him to like kind of take it down and you know try to play off of that but he didn't do that at all he got from him he goes down kickoffs can change a lot here obviously in one so try to push up a kick off see if we can get out of it for the wave dash one he's gonna stay on this ball he actually doesn't like to get off the ball at all and notice if if he has a chance to stay on and i'll kick off he'd rather stay than go for boost and leave me a free possession which is again a very different uh kind of approach than most people seem to have in ones even these days people still like to play for the boost most of the time there we go good shot i wasn't sure if he'd had it to be honest so i wanted to not say anything until we knew for sure never know they are crazy on defense these days i don't watch the demos especially in the corners like last game you got two of them i got two goals resulting in it so it's trying to be annoying here yeah i'm not going to jump on that i want to try to bait a minute if i can there we go good play there take advantage of our time shout out to to commit on his side so hard especially on on those 50s because he's actually really good at controlling where those 50s go it seems really good touch from him gonna stay on that again see he doesn't go for the boost really different i can see why he beats a lot of really good ones players like this i'll catch people off guard for sure really good save as well tried to rush the shot and he couldn't quite get the angle interesting way to play he always plays for the possession he always finds a way to get the possession back i'm trying to pull what he does back on him started to go forward on me as well uh might be able to turn that around in time he's not actually gonna go for the shot i don't think he could get it in time yeah so i picked the the front flip forward there and i was able to get back i noticed he does that quick power shot he tries to get into in a advantageous position right away there really good save i actually don't know how he saved that i'm gonna lie to you that's a good pop i shouldn't instantly jumped that's hard for me expecting to do that that's a good play for him to be honest trying to make him play his hand first before like diving on the the play itself i think something we gotta do better against them i play from him i didn't want to go all in and get potentially stuck just give him a free goal he's going for the bum yeah he loves those bumps after the after putting the i ball really do much about it that's why it's good no matter how good you are i can't really do much if you just bumped out of the play not the flick i would have wanted but all good take this boost here it's fine if he touches this don't mind that either he's gonna be falling with no boost here should be able to grab this mid boost in the pressure him again he just missed that back boost as well it's going to be good for me he's going to be really good at really bad he has been a bump on me it's going to be bad very good i thought he would jump for it so i wanted to play a little bit more patient there i have boost back and maybe make him go again make him go one more time nice good job to take my time there i had none and again he put it well he put me into a spot where i really had no option on offense i had to play it into the only part of the network she couldn't save you almost just got scared i'll go straight back and look how much pressure you're gonna have in me here just because you want to kick off i had to play this pretty much perfectly here that's the goal this is awkward now because that's my spacing i suppose it has to be pretty much perfect just gonna be a goal again we got out of that i couldn't get the the demo on him that was the big play there that would have been huge just like patient he plays that situation right there most people just panic and throw that away there's a here's a lot of really really good things to him i think that most people just don't have like the patience he has and and a lot of the the shot choices he he makes is really really smart i think those bumps are so annoying you see just how like how much it it does form how much pressure he gets off of the bumps as well really close opportunity oh that flick would have been a goal i think good of him to kill that i probably could have kept it up ah bad start to this kick off for sure but let's see hit this high and just go back for a boost our best bet of winning this situation i think if i stay close to this play it off back wall i'm gonna pop this up one time off that bounce see it does i just control this to myself then one big touch maybe we can get this mid boost now actually i gotta go all the way back turning it pretty well there there we go big demo should be a goal there we go good work sweaty games man those are like some of the sweaters games i've had to upload on my channel for once but yeah normally a top 10 top 15 ones player nna probably top three top i'd even go as far as a top two ones player right now probably i don't even know how to make number one i haven't played that many people in an a right right now obviously but this guy gives me problems more than any other player like i play other pros played first killer i played like aj and stuff they don't give me as hard of a time as he does i'm not gonna lie to you so honestly shout out to him for being as young as he is and and giving me that much of a problem to be honest it's just like insane how smart some of these players have gotten with their age and they didn't have that many hours like i have like 12 000 hours in this game maybe even i even say like 13 000 if i'm being honest uh my ps4 hours on top of my steam hours and these guys are like on par uh and one's ability like an individual ability it's pretty insane so pretty good game from him both times i'd say you couldn't have done much more better i'm not gonna lie like the way he played is really solid and i actually had a lot to take from both games i can actually steal from him in terms of low 50s and the demos and stuff like that but yeah fun games today guys let's see where we ended up on the leaderboards after those two wins i think we'd probably be like top 25 off that i think which is pretty solid 27th right now it's pretty good we got them down to 18. up to 27 pretty solid all right hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you're watching this like comment and subscribe and see you guys on the next one i love you you
