want to help me along that road please make sure you do hit that subscribe button if you enjoy my content i appreciate y'all much love enjoy the video yo what is up guys could be playing some more games today with garrett g and aj let's get straight into it let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game in the video plenty it's a full team so we'll see how it goes they are higher mmr players i do recognize all of them they're all like 2.2 kmr i want to say so pretty solid lobby at a nice speed flip kick off there aj won it well there i just followed up on the cheat i like to save my boost on the cheat because you can get a free goal if you position properly on it it's a big thing to focus on focusing on your your positioning in threes is one of the biggest things you don't need crazy good mechanics to be a very good threes player it's the honest truth of it you don't but if you do have really good mechanics and you mix that with being a very smart player that's going to make you you know the next level of good so you got to focus on being smart and using your mechanics properly having them in your arsenal to pull out whenever you want those are the two biggest things a little awkward but i gotta do my floating technique that i talked about in the training pack video that is one of the most useful things when there's awkward bounces coming down you can get a good touch to the corner that was good aj's touch wasn't exactly what he wanted i think he was going to try to pitch that forward but ended up just passing off the wall to them and they got a perfect top corner shot that was a really good shot from them well played can't do much to stop a shot coming in that hot i got the bumping them didn't get the ball there you guys can go alone here it looks like did i have one more so i just wait it's bumped into aj a little bit kind of messed me up but i should left it for him and he should left for me one of the two were both kind of just trying to take it from each other because we didn't know each other were there i think he's gonna get the bump maybe i was there just in case garrett can get the bump try one more here couldn't quite i've been a good touch but i got that boost next best thing okay i couldn't tell if he had that or not it's a very risky pre-jump but kind of worked try to follow this pop mid go for one more that's fine gonna be out to gear it anyway they're not gonna get anything too good after this it's gonna be a free ball for us and probably a counter attack here get one more off that i did not think you'd miss dude they calculated fakes the whiffs they're too strong these days i swear whiffing is better than hitting the ball it's crazy the way the game evolves into this being with it league wait for aj what the heck i can't read anything that's happening in this game but it's okay it's one of those games where just nothing makes any sense i'm just gonna fake here no point of going for that there's habit first same about this situation just wait try to follow it up after the fact not gonna play for major they all wait left wall it's fun past middle two went this is huge massive for us aj plays this smart there we go and that double commit was was huge you got to capitalize on those situations aj saw gear i knew garrett saw me it was a good play which is a little bit too fast for them to deal with i think i'm trying to put a little bit slower because i'm having trouble reading what's happening this game so it might help a bit if i just slow down the pace of the game instead of just assuming what's gonna happen before it happens trying to be too quick trying to read too far in the future so leave that there now can't do much but hit it to my teammates so that's what i want unlucky though not one gear one on the back wall but it's okay that's a good play to make because it gives gear to free ball if you can just hit it across but i think he tried to dribble it and didn't get that she wanted at all and the guy was still going to read it but if he gets that to the corner aj's there for a free dribble um if he doesn't hit the corner he gets a good dribble and he has full ball control there's no downside to let him have that ball win on the wall that's a good play they got two goals out of out of one that tends to happen a lot in threes if they get a good kick off off uh you know quick capitalization before all on the kickoff being good on them kickoff isn't all random pass the garrett nice that was a good play slowed down while the wall faked the first guy took my time i got a good touch over him to my teammate there we go all tied up again solid squad we're playing against like i said these guys did make um rlcs recently the the swiss stage not bad by any means nice i'll be waiting on the right side i can't go for that i'm like there you go gonna be a shot and a goal you will not miss those from that range not often at least that's a bang that was a really good shot wait right side here i like to just hold on to my boost on these i didn't get them for a fake or something i like the idea almost didn't work so i wasn't quite ready yeah grabbing corner boost on those kickoffs i like to just hold on to the boost turn toward toward your goal so you're safe and just hold on to your boost two things you have to focus on doing on those what a dunk i get this boost it's huge uh imagine the double reset there would have been perfect would have been a sight to see i thought i saw aj creeping right side there probably should have just passed assuming but i did see him i think i don't think i'm going completely crazy i'll be back here aj has on a wall anyway i'm just gonna wait wait middle it's fine he could have had a touch there so it's good to just wait in case i've been past the garrett probably a goal as well but good first game of the video let's get into the next one let's even keep it up it's probably the same people which i don't mind because it'll be intense games it'll be good content for you guys to watch and learn from so let's get into the next one stephen keep it up let go let go all right playing is the same team for the last game of the video let's get into it see if we can end off on a dub here we can get the back to back i'm not gonna go for that i gotta go back in case try to control this to the corner good dunk over two of them got a good fake there made them all leave pass to garrett there we go nice little soft pass over to garrett there i try to make sure aj knew would be over his head like i didn't want aj to misunderstand that it was for garrett you know what i mean i don't want to try to go for that and mess up garrett or mess with the play in general that was good of him to leave it as smart of him to recognize the situation it's a hard thing to recognize that quickly rock league is a very quick fast-paced game right so you have to be really quick and on the ball when it comes to spotting that plays like that a little bit of lag i guess that's uh interesting oh it's the whole server i think it's back yeah we all just liked i think also we would have probably been there i don't know what was happening but anyway it's good of them to cut it off i went forward here the pass down the aj not quite what i wanted i ceiling pinched it gotta get better at passing those weird ones there i don't know if i got the shot on target what just happened i don't know what just happened i won't lie to you i was about to shoot this on goal i got killed it's like left me it's a little risky but i trust garrett and this body is pretty good at controlling these and it's better to take that that mid boost from them for future plays moving forward it's gonna mess them up for at least the next 10 seconds if i take that boost nice from garrett it's fine good win that was a huge win because i died if i if i didn't die there might actually have been a goal i would have been able to follow that up a huge reach from aj i haven't had to do anything this game man give me spend as well that was a really big 50 from garrett and aj just read the fake you can't fake out once players man aj is good at ones you're not going to be able to fake them out and then i swear that's where that that one's experience comes into play everyone fakes now on the ground and those grounded plays so knowing when to go for those shut up challenges is huge i don't know what's happening this game dude i haven't had to do anything oh the double jump down good control and then just a shot that was nice all right i have to do one more that was too quick right i just have to do one more way too fast of a game i think one more and that'll be the last one hopefully it's them again let's get into it though see if we can get the dub all right playing against the same team for the third time again because they're the closest mmr to us that's expected let's play smart let's make some good plays this game nothing stupid let me go for this try to control this it's good perfect for aj go wait here gary's going to control pretty much like now especially in threes you want to make every challenge or like every play you go for be able to be followed up by teammates so every single challenge pretty much should be like an attempted bait for your teammates to get the ball next that's pretty much the whole point of rotation in threes to have someone behind you at all times so like here i'm the third man until garrett is back now that he's back i'm trying to get this ball to him easiest way possible like i don't have to flip into that and give them the ball right i might as well give my team the ball it's the best possible play to make there one's going to be up try to get the double jump pop in there i can take the boost and then i can rotate back to be third man i thought i saw a spider on my screen i thought so i got a little scared there stop talking man i hate spiders what the hell i don't know i hate that sword i just got a double i'm gonna keep it in two went i killed the third there we go i don't know what that touch was dude before i just flew off my car full speed let's get past from aj to find me they are smart to look for me again having that vision i got a little bit faked by whatever they did there it's weird not like in threes you see it the most but like mistakes on the other team and like weird stuff where their team looks a little bit confused with what they want to do it kind of messes you up more than if they were organized and coordinated if that makes sense like just like the weird stuff is like harder harder to play against than someone who's like really good really consistent and just like always does the right thing it's harder to play against the teams that make more mistakes it's weird it's so weird i don't understand why rock leaks that way play off the back wall he's gonna have to waste boost get a touch over to my team again nice play back 50 boost here could be huge if i get a good touch here that was a huge pre-jump how did he get there should have went for a demo would have been nice would have been no one middle here the double there we go good cut off good goal let's feel so easy on the fennec i'm still deciding if i want to use this car or octane i might just switch between the two whatever i'm feeling on a a day to day let's try from aj i'm gonna grab this back corner i'll be third man i can fake this ball i don't need to challenge and waste my position right away should be okay get it over him hold onto my 40 boost here so i can make a play that's pretty good aj can control i'll be back third man now and aj can make his play forward pretty good try i'm gonna wait because again i am third i don't want to waste my position right away let me just slow down some pace here i'll go back now for the boost because i know that it's safe trust aj on that clear that's good for us i don't have to waste any boost here like i'm trying to play as patient as possible any situations because really there's no downside it's not if you're gonna do much with these shots that's why i'm not panicking to my teammates up i'm just waiting again i gotta kill some time here but it's fine i don't need i don't need to make a play forward there's no need to just pre-jumping the shot attempt no real danger again he's gonna be there for that if i can get a kill it'd be nice bumped him it's not the touch she wanted got the bump again on the back wall guy bump again maybe he's taking the boost now i trust garrett he saves these nice oh the double attempt i like it so the one thing you can see me do every single time in a situation if i know i'm lost back i'm not going to jump right away and waste my position there's no point might as well stay grounded and try to just get a touchscreen delay time for your team so right here same thing i'm not going to go for a shot why would i i'm going to let my teammates get behind me aj went for that so it's gonna be a dangerous situation for a sec but it's okay can we back here it's gonna have this probably but it's fine i'm just gonna sit here aj is behind me nothing to worry about really because if he dribbles that i have the block if not it's over me and aj's free save play it over two over to garrett's side it's gonna win that ball placement close and that's gonna be game but you played really smart that game we played really smart that game as a team oh i think i was scoring that that was clean i hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you're watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all peace you
