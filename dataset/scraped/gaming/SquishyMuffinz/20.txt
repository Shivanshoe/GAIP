yo what's up guys sarah here with lethamer playing some 2v2 games i'm going to be using the fendi for today as well i'm trying it out let's get into it see if we get some dubs see how it goes all right we got bambi and cam to the first match here i haven't played twos with less than forever feels like years gonna fake the whole time force him to use a flip there and a bunch of boosts which is really good play to the wall around him ah unlucky for the 50 here for the right side probably will be right and fake take my time played around one it's a good demo okay two goals 30 seconds for the whole game left so it is 2v2 it's the most random of all the game modes anything can happen quite literally it's a good attempt to go for a bump here all good waiting for the touch here from one of them and they own gold already one of them hit it into his teammate and then into the nets very interesting also apologies a little bit tired so it might not be giving the best commentary at the moment but it's also 2v2 so it's a little bit harder to commentate on what's happening when i think no one in the lobby even knows what's happening half the time i was not expecting that to be honest he didn't really do a whole lot but almost worked better because of that it's a good 50. cut off the backboard he's going to miss actually got a good touch wasn't great but definitely better than missing body feels good man like the way you turn in it just feels like so clean i love it oh we should not hit it again but it's all good made a really good pass and then the extra touch was not good it was gonna be a goal for sure he just left it but again probably just didn't know and was trying to beat somebody else this is okay oh wow whole lot of stuff i'm not expecting is going on but all good i was gonna be a good goal good try all good money for your shot here take my time nice all right after extremely messy game extremely messy two and a half minutes we have found a goal we have found a chance back into it it is doable there's going to be weird to give leave it for less three shot good try it's gonna be all for them probably all right they weren't able to convert which is good unfortunate i landed on them there so i kind of have no choice but to throw it away because i don't know how close attackers got after that little mistake we brought it back i don't know how pulled off the impossible i'm gonna try to challenge hopefully he's behind me in time oh he's not unfortunate oh you went forward for a bump i think probably why i didn't get mid boost earlier timing usually works out someone's behind you by then shouldn't matter if it gets past use more about baiting the flick can actually shoot off this nice all right gonna be a post game to the end it seems let me go back here you can actually watch the challenge help out i had to go for a soft shot i just feel like i went any anything faster than that he definitely gets a harder hit back toward on that so before doing that situation there's no play here nothing you can really do excuse me a free 1v1 now let me get the bump on this guy just to be annoying you get a bump again good try oh this has been this has been a game it's been a game it seems messy but yeah this has been it's been rough been a rough one confusing just not what you'd expect that of a pretty high level lobby the camera in here is pretty good it's a really good flake this doesn't kill time with a touch nice all right good first game let's get the next one even keep it up get back back dubs hopefully it's a little bit cleaner than that one because that one was uh let's just say we probably shouldn't have won that i probably shouldn't have found that let's get the next one alright kinsei and bambi i'm another sweaty game here hoping for it to be a little bit cleaner though less random play back to left side actually could have scored it and he just whiffed did not expect that let off back wall wow this is bad this is bad i'll be hon i'll be honest with you there's two like i can say is technically pro bambi like semi-pro it's like couldn't be this random shouldn't be this weird and missy but it has been and i'm not sure why maybe it's just twos man just the beauty of 2v2 i'm gonna fake here but i can pop really good clear i didn't have to use any resources for it either makes it even better okay i wasn't sure should be easy for left to go i didn't think he'd go to be honest try to take a shot on that i said i was beating him i could have beat him easily if i just went quick if i take an extra second i should have done that good bit of control should be fine there loads of time i'm not gonna be in but maybe i can read it oh that boost came back would have been huge just challenged make him flip i played over one we did a good job with that picking the next touch to get a 50. i'm gonna fake the hit here good bum another good bum should beat him that's fine it should be okay you can't actually shoot this i can fake i was really well played i know i had like all the advantage there if i just go quick and hit that away i'm not going to score it and it also might get dunked i know they have to like try to play the block there so all the powers in my hands the ball's going to bounce over the net he has to get a hard angle no need to panic there let me go quick i just hope that's behind me every time i've done that it has not been the case sadly that really shouldn't happen much less doing something weird on paddling for sure because that shouldn't happen that much let me go for it like that from back corner it should usually be enough time for the we gotta rotate behind the challenge something weird happening i don't know what though it's completely fine to get beat on that the whole goal is to force the flip to happen early it's actually better if you get because the guy behind you it's a free dribble but for some reason that's just like the second light every time i let him challenge oh okay we're good wait lefty if he wants to use me i can't command this yet let's not back it be fine it'll be one now or something light is really good i hit the back pointer see what i can do with this how to bump them actually really a try i'm unlucky that's hard he's in a 1v1 for a while there he did a good job the fake challenge the first one but i think kenzie messed up his flick a bit so it actually kept it closer than he wanted that worked out better because it was able to be followed up on it's fine somebody just playing to to be left there not really going to go here with that thanks for the boost pump the other make it weird for him 1v1 now good try should be free shot find out the shot he wanted but it's still decent created some pressure i dropped nothing all the way back there's actually a smart play all right almost back part i try to play back until i almost backfire i'm gonna go to ot here there unless they make some crazy play which they might all right you can't actually follow this side of space now on this of course to the side let's on at least if you can beat them it's huge i go for a bump in the other made him jump nice so you're just forcing him to jump there made that pretty much impossible for him to save because you know has a harder time to get to the wall is to flip weird you land like in the net outlet has like full control on the corner and even if you can't get the go out of it straight away you can hit it across too fast for him to react and i get a free goal anyway but yeah good two games today hope you guys enjoyed
