new content and ya enjoyed today's video guys I love y'all enjoy you know wassup y'all see me playing some threes today with gimmick and rattle should be some good ones let's get into the games let's see how they go the first time I got ourselves against Ebanks doing diksa see this shows a huge bump from rattles the bump master doing some demo on them couldn't quite reach him it's fine cutter back boobs like gimme go for this bite easier for him oh I dangled block definitely sketchy but kill my challenge your different gimmick ye that's awesome can we go saying you think he plays bad on stream and I was just explaining just a joke philosophy the other one in the contest context on that contest can't talk when I'm recording sometimes a challenger first make him do something shut up just easily that's three guys out of the play I'm that one little fake challenge there ah couldn't quite bump him I got the bump on him but it wasn't enough to make him mess up there I put it down close on the pretty jump maybe a lot of pressure here's how to keep on challenging nice that's good you can give us a free ball again replacement all the pressure all the beast really tough for them to get around get a good clear click the mid right nice Goodwyn that second when I kickoffs pretty huge because you can start a lot of pressure out of that one hit a lot of times like a pass across here supposed to be for riddles but that's fine you have a three ball you to be ok nice cut challenges to riddles good block I don't want my boosts that I could be using the left side good luck how's it get 50 from gimme two you tried to get that over to my side you could tell by the way you slow down push push again so any further touches here having a spotter I could kind of react it over they do it's fine should be easy for riddles are these for set it touches really good that's enough and we'll do that there they're both panicking can you give me some space I'll be across unplug i severly gimmick man there are a lot of space here I just try not to panic I had an option in front of me they're gonna be covering that took one touch look for my option and get a good nice shot nice try to follow this I got on a super lucky I was a good bump there can't really react to that I'm gonna be give me a can that was are you just like full trust in getting that touch no Boosh I got a number one should be enough of a stall my team it's not like that I said this stall enough time for my team to get back and they're both on their way so I did my job I'd say you know it wasn't the greatest touch it was enough it'd be fine let's find again you mean you get beat up like that still works in the distance in a fake am i right how to flip no going that's a cool flip reset nice did I accidentally double jump somehow home cut ceiling I don't know how that was a good flipper you said to get the pass just shot you finish your game good first game I couldn't put a lot better we really do a whole lot but we got the dub so it matters got the forfeit so let's head to the next game keeping keep it up see how it goes we got ourselves pure D bank and brimless yang stir these are all high in my mark players like a night scene 100mm Archie game of our players so we'll see what can be done here it's fast it's gonna go quick gotta keep that in there awkward as well shopping give me any pads midfield wait for your real challenge that's fine it's not gonna have a lot of options here I have to go for the flip they said give me kind of read the whole way I was it really a bump spun me out ice Popp I'll be across for an option but it's probably be hit toward my goal very interesting what just went down Tony's blocking toward the goal good fifty you actually blocked like the entire angle I was trying to use the fifty that middle Fred that really wall it up to gimmick side I shouldn't have played the shot a little higher but we have the pressure here we have the boost advantage as well trying to keep that in off the wall now put it up take the back corner always play mid quick good challenge from gimme that in Busan there backboard so I'll take my time back here that's across there you go they pass back from riddles he's my time to like get me get behind me greater play going forward and just slaughtered at home wait for D Bank can't quite be sure so I should be fine what's going on plays off the wall I'm dead but should still install enough time to be hard to get a good shot of that look to my left here for pass this waiting for the next I'll play off this they both free jump so take two out of the game for barely any boost wasted as well so that's pretty pretty big win there I'd say we're back I can't beat this guy hopefully read listen to the next challenge nice good fall from gimmick place for it riddles I never to give me for free won't be one seen him score these plus bit off back there you go they're back here right side from spicy had boost like he had no boost maybe I'm stumped shot buddy had none de I was so confusing to me I thought he didn't go all the way back and then he saw me going on the way back so he stopped but I guess he had boost I didn't need you all the way back there a lot of like when you see pros playing and how they just know what's gonna happen next comes from just reading your opponent's like cars body language if that makes sense like you see how they're going toward the ball or where they're trying to go next so you can kind of get an understanding of when you should go and where you should try to like free position that's a lot of what pros do if you guys are ever wondering how Pro just knows were to be next like for example I'm waiting on this side and the nettles is there I'm on right side to cover anything it's gonna come this way and just trying to like position around where the balls gonna go next based off what their cars are doing pretty much always focus on their cards I got to do an eye tracker video so you guys to see what I'm talking about I better explain what I mean but kind of positioning this bar we have every option covered like here what does this midfield I'm all the way far right I'm still wetting midfielders try to cover that mid option I realize I don't want to cover their sub pros tend to operate try to keep every possible scenario covered just the best way to play threes or any game but really when you're defending a whopping on situation you want to further cover as many options as possible by yourself threes is the same way mostly got a touch maybe double lows see I should have been middle there cuz I'm already on the wall but in comms I'd know that not ready for position middle and ranks I can't obviously know there's need to be there yet he was on the blind side of my screen closed she I'm gonna go all the way back here this red how's it going toward the ball it mid right she riddles does it's fine him backing off there's my cue to go he's gonna pass for me I could pass across the gym clothes on I it that's so weak but I still stalls a little bit of time and we have pressure still so it's not bad I said right my fall riddles oh I thought he hit double shot if that was um that was a game where it was tied I wouldn't know went for the double read like I tried to read where the DoubleTap was gonna go and I got a go if it was a double but if that was a game where we were tied or we were one go down and we needed to go I wouldn't have done that I would've probably played the safe option trying to play compression instead of just the immediate goal but we had the lead no matter what either way no matter what I went for the extra goal oh yeah that's gonna be opportunity guys hope you enjoyed have yourself wonderful day or
