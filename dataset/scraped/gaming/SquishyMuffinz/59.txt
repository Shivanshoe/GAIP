yo what's up guys could be playing some twos or threes with gimmick for today whatever we end up queuing into we'll play just have some fun it's always the games of the gimmick i'll see how it goes like quick shot so i'm like closer than that i feel like in twos like trying to stick around as short as possible and just rotate back quick is like always really good i'm not gonna lie if you can just like try to take a quick shot that's gonna put a lot of pressure on them rotate around get a good amount of boost it's going to be always better than if you try to stay too long and your teammate tries to push up and then he gets over both of you guys hopefully that situation is always bad [Music] let him hit this gonna be to the right for the bump on him should be fine i have some time here take some touches fake this one time on the wall now it has to give me a cross the bounce shot is actually really smart i can't get a good clear out of the bounce every in that situation so it's actually a really good touch to make best case scenario they miss it's a goal worst case scenario that's what just happened they get a touch on it but it's never going to be something that they can counter off of nice let's not admit that it's fun you guys really love the bump though like every time i play these guys in twos for much all i do is just so you gotta get used to that and slowly adapt definitely could be frustrating though that's something that even the lower ranks probably do a lot it's a good tactic though and i understand it especially in something like 2v2 it's a lot more uh useful than it is in threes even though it is still useful threes people just spam it in twos because you can get away with it for sure you kill one guy and you're freeing up so much of the lobby [Music] jeez another crazy shot [Music] top bins he makes dirty though gaming's actually dirty it's already everything but the understanding of twos is really good super underrated how how crazy his understanding of just the game in general is i think the really has on the game and like where to go next has always been extremely good to me the 50m i'm going to stay on this now i don't have any boost but i can still fit it to the left wall off this touch and i can go behind that kills at least three seconds and gimmick's probably gonna be in the pretty spot followed up like he was the only thing now is i'm getting chased so you got to be careful of that like i said these guys they're their go-to for sure yeah it's just such a big impact only one person in twos right getting them out of the way for three whole seconds and then even then their teammates just won't be chewing for that time and then and once the guy spawns back in he's not even really back in the play yet does do a lot for sure not gonna be in to be bad bounce for him too take the boost nice gotta watch the bumps i always gotta be on the lookout nice you fake the bump he like just blew past them and they both got super scared let him hit that i don't really care if he gets it to be honest i can go back to gimmick anyway anyone wastes my resources anyway as well so try to stay close to this [Music] close right idea if i got the absolute perfect first touch there i think i probably had to go to that oh almost exactly what i wanted gimmick is just getting chased on the backboard again going for spanish kickoff just getting bumped to the ceiling and it's a goal ah this game mode's funny man that kick off by the way it's pretty much just the guy going off goes for the cheater has to bump the cheaters so cheaters give me their scenario and the other guy just has a free net to shoot on pretty much nothing that you can do [Music] if they get the bump that is [Music] it's kind of ratty but you do what you got to do for the elo [Music] wait for the big bounce here [Music] stay behind give me just keep my full boost whatever happens i can react to it [Music] get this around them take advantage of this challenge being a little bit too obvious nice can't really instinct me on that but i can wait it's fine let me over him plus let me try oh imagine almost if he was like a little bit slower to that ball it's definitely gonna be a goal but it's so much time to react for the dance game should be open you try it's hard nice follow he's gonna bait this i don't actually have to do much maybe hit it around me should be fun that's just a goal nicely done dropping me i was on his left as well if that guy couldn't get back or he if he could get back sorry if he passes that to me it's so much better but yeah get the first game against the next one see if you can keep it it's probably the same guys to be honest but let's see if we can do it again [Music] all right got the same lobby [Music] i'll probably make uh another video with gimmick i'll probably play one more of them i enjoy playing twos with them i think it's fun [Music] normally have a good time even though two's usually i'm not the biggest fan of it i think it's kind of a scuffed game mode he makes it fun to play i think definitely most enjoyable with him for me it should be fine that's touch i'll just go quick to this actually is that just fine let him hit it no big deal fine again bump the last guy now i don't really go for bumps myself into use that much but i feel like i'm just a little bit more enthusiastic would be so so much easier i make it harder i feel like i have to outplay the opponent so hard when you don't bump that's so that's the reason why it's good though i think because the whole like idea of having to outplay someone kind of goes out the window and they're just dead right was that boost in the backyard nice oh my gosh it looks crazy man didn't have to do anything it's actually dirty patience yeah even back then like that situation looks threatening it looks dangerous but look at me please that's so smart it stays grounded you can react to anything still it looks super dangerous it's really not should be it maybe i'll just kill anybody across it's fine i could try to bump him again for you make something it's close wait for shot here back post anything he shoots can't really go in i can just challenge if he doesn't shoot it how many boots i can wait around let him hit that it's fine and i'll work on the wall dash tutorial by the way for you guys i'll definitely work on that i want to make sure it's like really good though and i'm going to get the controller overlay back up for you guys for the next video i keep forgetting to put it on i've been seeing that comment a lot yeah i'll probably try to go for like top five maybe rank one on uh the 2b2 and 32 leaderboard i'm gonna be going for that probably this season not the end of the world if i don't hit it it's just something that i'm just gonna set a goal and just try to reach it i don't really care too much if we don't reach it but it's just one of those fun things i like trying to reach last season we finished 3v3s i think in second or first i don't remember finish up there though for sure and two's though i don't think i got that high i think it was like 20th i don't think i got like top ten two's is normally harder there should be breezy fake i'm dirty no guy i didn't throw my car forward enough i'm not gonna lie i had a really busy day and i just got finished working out i'm super tired i just hopped on and we're just vibing so i'm surprised we're even doing well nice little slow play on the goal line there that's the the tilt effect absolutely big brain from gimmick sheesh all right i'm clipping i'm flipping nevermind give them pre-jump me but it's empty all right they've given up i think i thought it's like it's time to just tell you guys thank you so much for all the support on the channel as always yeah all the support on the channel you guys are honestly crazy i i know like in general rocky was like booming on youtube and free to play came out and we're getting like 100k subs a month something ridiculous and now like everything's kind of died down for like subscriber wise for everybody but even then you guys are still showing up with every single video like 200k views of video which is like ridiculous that you guys show up every single time i upload you show support you show love you comment i appreciate that and those you that are brand new that are subscribing i know it's a lot less of you because most people that can't subscribe already have um but i just wanted to say thank you so much even the the brand new subs everyone and i really get to take the time and say thank you guys so much thank you because you guys allow me to do what i do every day and i appreciate you guys for that yeah also huge shout out to gimmick he's an absolute grinder he's a super good player his ability to read the game is crazy i still think it's like best in the world material his ability to read the game how quick he is understanding where the ball is going to be next what his opponent wants to do with it he's crazy i've always thought that from the moment i saw him play like way back to right now i still think the same thing about him i think he's insane i think any team that has him on it is a threat easily and i i wish the best for him going forward because i know there's some rumors going on but i'm sure he's going to bounce back incredibly crazy player yeah fun game for today very very fun hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one love y'all peace [Music]
