yo what's up guys gonna be playing some thrift today with gimmick and alpha cap should be some good games i'm trying out a brand new control right now so i might be a little bit poop for today but i'll try my best see if we can play well let's even get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we got ourselves a lobby here we got a very sweaty one on our hands so we'll see who we can do everybody plays these guys tonight this isn't the first game they've played against i'm pretty much screaming them right now but i decided to toss on the new controller and actually start recording pumping out some content so let's get locked in here back right i'm gonna try to get ready for the hard hit off the wall here from beast give me actually beat him to it oh my what a read i accidentally went too so it's on me shouldn't have jumped for that play it off the wall for a teammate maybe someone will be close gimmick was i'll play it back across here try to follow it myself dunk them not gonna be straight unfortunately it's close though right to the wall again trying to keep the ball in good position to keep offense good block from alpha good follow-up save got the bishop from them which is what matters in situations let me take this other boost as well are they killing the mid guys i'll just go for it the passing situation got cut off early so better for me to just keep possession of the play rather than force anything breaking them off the rocker getting used to the new controller the new sticks i'm actually using a scuff control right now so the sticks are a lot more sensitive than usual they're not longer or anything it's just way more sensitive i guess i'll show it off the bat like a try shouldn't be a goal nicely behind me i'm gonna wait back wall be fine uh tried the pass he's going for a bum little unfortunate i just didn't know one of those things it's easy to know when you're in columns with someone not easy to know when you know you're just assuming where they'll be positioned and you have to always assume in ranked all you really can do show them back here yeah i'm full boost try fifteen a good spot for my teammate go for a bump on one it's a good try good bit of pressure yeah put on them there good job from gaming to keep this in put in a weird spot for them got a good kill on one should be able to keep this in as well made a double let's go for a shot that's fine don't want to force a pass there and have it get cut off so it's okay to go for a shot situation like that don't put a bump on me i know that's a bus almost got a pinch of gimmick would have been a good play i'm gonna have a full boost across here if he wants to use me looks like a dangerous situation so i kind of left it for a second gonna be there if i just play mid again just going to be straight in we'll take it nakalya was trying to pass middle again but definitely one of those things that happens and you just go with it you know not complaining gonna cut the last guy back nice well played yeah this controller is just pretty much like a normal ps4 controller except the sticks are like the old ps3 sticks i'm just testing it out because i haven't pretty much like the only way i could try a ps3 controller on rock league i never actually tried it everything about ps4 controller that i like with the ps3 sticks that i used to love so testing it out is my first game on with it doesn't feel it doesn't feel bad but it doesn't feel like insanely good either but i'm still getting used to it so i'm not going to judge it off of like just one game or even just a few games i want to use it for a couple days i think so i get a proper idea of how it really is they're trying to play there i try to weird for him i thought it like behind him i thought he was stationary on the wall but it didn't quite work out i'm gonna rotate all the way back here but then i got a big clear in a sec so i gotta be ready for it that's what i was talking about but i was actually in a pretty bad position for it should be okay good job to be back all day from them i would have been back for it for another double tap so really good job from them well played jimmy can take i don't want to go the whole oh i think alpha went okay it's fine i had to back off with that i heard him jump there might still be a goal against us here it's really a tough spot to get out yeah tough thing to recover from a double commit like that in front of the net i think we both left it for each other you should have this i'll try the pass too hit away too low though might be one more goal for them but we got the dub they actually missed all right we'll take it good first game let's get into the next one stephen keep it up get back to back dubs let's see how it goes all right the same team here see we can do it's only team are playing right now holy it's gonna pass across gonna be a goal get off the bat good shot from gimmick replacement good job look for the pass there as well because one's just pre-jumping the back wall touch and one's gonna be a net regardless so it's the only way we actually go to that situation is if i pass there very good way to go about the situation up for kept should have if not it's fine i can get back in time probably rotate back post here a very weak shot should be fine for gimmick i had the high part of the net block get the low so it's actually really well played i'm gonna wait for touch here got in the way of that it's actually a really good double from them put a lot of pressure on us job to get there quick nice from gimmick try to take their boost here they're gonna be in a weird spot pass back to alpha cap play into this corner again maybe go again here off the wall so you can follow it up send to this bar my team always gets the next touches always the way i like to go about it i shouldn't went for that i'll be back on 40 boost wow i'm trying to block him he never even make contact that actually like sometimes works out better than them hitting the ball those misses sometimes the better they miss because it fakes the person expected the original touch sorry a little bit hard and we didn't have the boost to chase it was good to delay time install gonna get 50 to get a demo as well play it back keeping the ball close with my team i'm gonna touch this but it's fine if he passes the gimmick and can maybe pass me back oh i'm gonna go back down to the ground here off the corner let me go back now i don't think i can actually reach this unfortunately you may try to touch it down it looked like and alpha went for the shot it seems so one of those things where it's like you're playing ranked you have no idea that the person's doing it's all just assumption there will be double commits because there's no communication obviously that's how it goes probably a goal unless you can get a crazy touch again yeah very very tough spot to be in got two minutes 36 seconds here we got a lot of time though and the goals haven't been anything crazy from them to be honest the passion gimmick and the opening there play it over one wait for the miss potentially played off the back wall again tried to make them panic i'm gonna go for a straight up shot so not a bad idea to go for that who should be back play downfield a gimmick he's actually pretty good out of this yeah it's a really good spot for him to be in because he can threaten the pass across they have to be worried about me and one of them was so the tension was kind of diverted off the ball a little bit i thought it's going to be a good situation for us almost the exact same goal again they pre-jumped the back wall touch pass across quick get to that quick goal passes are so deadly man even the pass back images it is it might look scary but it's really not if you have someone's back ready for it not a bad situation at all to be in should be fine it cut off from gimmick i'm just gonna bait this make him touch it over to me play it over to him again i don't mind that make a touch to my teammate i'm pretty much making him pass it back to my team there like even though i passed to him it looks like that's done good demos really good demos there are giving such on the wall should be a 50. i'll be back here as long as they don't hit a perfect angle it's never really going to be a goal fine touch from us should be open definitely not the touchscreen we could have wanted there but he might have been trying to pass over it okay i'm not sure to be honest and behind you're full pretty good spot to be in like just waiting behind midfield when you're not sure where the ball is going to end up it's just like that you can react to pretty much anything plan yourself right around here with full boost and you'll see how many things i'll be able to get to i cover a very wide range of things in this position almost able to get the goal out of it because you can turn left you could turn right and you could very easily half flip backward if you need to so i like to just kind of hover midfield like that nice well played all right and that's going to be the games closed out for today hope you guys enjoy the games have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever happens if you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all silence
