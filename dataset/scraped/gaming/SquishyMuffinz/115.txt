right for the first time we got ourselves tea bates against brand and grills that's not the car here wow the boost being on the top is weird it's really weird feeling say patient middle here good touch from t-bits there playing a patient got over one which is good play patient again here to save my boost i shouldn't have turned for that probably i didn't think it would go again so should i play a little bit more patient i had to open space on the side there if he turns on the wall it's fine not gonna be too much danger out of this quite yet he messed up his first touch so it should be easy to deal with should be fine take the mid boost here take a touch i'm gonna pick the pass over to 50 instead he was covering the pass for a second there so i didn't want to pass that it is 2v2s right so if you make a bad pass like that it gets intercepted it's only really bad for your team in that case save my boots so i land here good block for teammates well it's going to be me today so it's got to be patient let them go for me like a challenge on that you can have really good control of the ball take a touch around them that's actually a really good touch really hard touch to make i'll play from him not a panic here just shadowing at the front so he has no option going forward hit that around one let this guy panic now if he makes me them even better gotta wait on the ceiling here come back down to the wall it's fine i don't mind if he gets touched here should be fine you gotta figure out like get a feel for what you should and should not challenge and what's bad and good to let the opponent have space on right so there's a lot of things that's actually no danger in letting the opponent have a little bit of space on so those are the things that especially in 3v3 you got to be ready to to give them a little bit of space let the moisture boost up and throw away the ball and there's no real downside for that you don't always have to be going for the ball full of speed you don't always have to put yourself in like a risky situation by challenging taking it slow and twos especially is a a very good habit to get into it's a very like ping-pong game but as long as you go for the ball when you have to you rotate back when you need to you're always going to be able to win the game like this this one it gets weird is when i'm in a 1 for a little bit but again play it patient let them have the space that they have and play off it after putting that to a good spot because you couldn't get a good touch on it not too bad to the follow up played a safe this is behind him so if he doesn't get beat on this challenge i can follow it up just pop that real quick nice two bits it's a free ball good bang awkward for him situation we can potentially capitalize on take another good shot for a bump here playing as simple as possible oh my bad i should have baited that just left it for him i would have had the ball but um no reason to overly challenge that's a good pop for my teammate take my time on this ball to be open i'm gonna say i'm not sure how they got out of that didn't get scored on i'm fully honest but i think we're about to score here in a second i'm playing yeah we played really solid so far we haven't had to do anything too crazy and um we've gotten out of this situation pretty well they haven't had an insane amount of opportunities i think we've had more close to scoring opportunities than they have this car feels a lot like dominance the only thing that throws me off about this car is the boost on the back the way the boost comes out it's so much higher than any other car the only thing that throws me off right now let's say probably still a goal oh really good saves from uh two baits thousands one on goal here let me have a touch here as well i could turn on the wall wait for the bounce here how do you get one more touch up man that's a good play take my time use my space there pull booster to the back here now i just gotta get in the way it's two of them plugging in the way and i put the ball in a really good spot for t baits unfortunately you missed but it still fixed it when they kill time for him to get back now let him rush that play get a flick on gold makes him hit it away and we should win the next ball here and i get that guys boost so it should be fine for a second if ftb just goes here i sit down don't touch this off the back wall or shot hold up well done well then i mean i played simple but solid went for what i had to go for you don't have to try to peek you don't try to do everything yourself use your teammate realize you have a teammate around you and um you know you're gonna end up doing better than if you're trying to just carry and do everything yourself use your teammate use the space you have around you use their positioning to your advantage fake for them i always try to get them the ball i always try to work every single game out it's the best way to play best way to be a team player always realize that you have a teammate you're not alone doesn't matter how bad quarter quote bad do you think your teammate is try to use them teammates played really well in that game well played in but we went for what we needed to go for we didn't have to do anything crazy and even on this weird looking car that feels a little bit weird we're able to win in a very very high cell lobby so let's keep it up try to get another win here see how it goes all right for the last game we got ourselves grand against cheese and kx so greater than our last match i think see if we can uh capitalize here put them on our team this time try to play the same way i was talking about last time well done so well done good shot just started off there try to single jump into this take a shot really 50 to take my time there i don't panic or anything i don't instantly flip i hit it once and then i use my flip after to continue my momentum and make sure i win the 50. it's really good use your single jump like that and save your second flip i really like doing that for those 50 50s this car looks so funny looking the the feel of the car isn't bad though it just reminds me a lot of the dominance and dominance very like hit or miss for me but it looks cool and if you guys like fast and furious i think it's from fast and furious i've honestly never watched it i'm not gonna lie you guys are gonna roast me in the comments for saying that i've never watched fast and furious like properly i've watched like bits and pieces like i'll see on tv but never watch the auto movies don't roast me though gotta wait for his air dribble here all right so it's gonna be a little boost good job to leave that i thought my teammate was backfill but it still works out give my time to the wall sorry i have the most amount of space right now on the field i'll use it gotta flip early it's gonna save my flip there we go so i just threatened my flip the whole time put myself in a spot where they have to be worried that i can flip over them at any time so that guy that was pre-jumping was in a very bad spot because he doesn't know when i'm going to use my flip that shocked him it's a good angle i get the mid boost here and they're working out really well because he put it back for his teammate so me getting the mid boost is actually perfect in that situation right onto the floor here i was really close i tried to go for the delay 50 there almost worked i'm gonna wait patiently what a shot you guys are crazy they're placing everything man they must have gotten inspired by the energy g2 series when everyone was just top cornering every shot perfectly this is crazy i like that fake a lot but i did have most of that covered still that's a smart fake though nice so you know arrow my arrow right after i pop that up once use my arrow right to like flick it over one more time and then i'm gonna go for the bump as well you see arrow right right here flip it up one more time and then i'm gonna go for the bump so he had to go really high and that's why he ended up missing he knew i was gonna go for a bump and at that point it's a very tough situation to get out of good demo really smart now he gets free ball and the boost he's gonna have a flip here ah unfortunate it's very hard to read something like that because he has the flip he has control my teammates up for the 50. it's hard to expect it to get by without any touch coming through and it happens a lot in pro play as well nothing happens and it works better than if something actually good happened if that makes sense happens a lot in pro play it's a very common uh goal that happens it looks like something that happened in low level lobby but it's because everyone's trying to read each other and nothing actually comes of it that it works it's trying to delay time look my teammate is right so i gotta try to put as well let me do like to see what he does here play at a good distance away so i can follow whatever he does played over him now and it should be a good situation for my teammate ah so i didn't want to double that if i didn't double that it would look really good put it over him really well and without a double it would have been uh a goal for sure oops i didn't mean to do that trying to pass to my teammate and i realized he was in a really bad spot and that's like a threes thing that i do a lot um trying to get it to the last guy back there for a free clear it's not a bad idea in threes and twos not the greatest idea my timers he was coming from i should have space to the left because of him coming from the right oh i think i had the double missed the demo by a little bit but it should force him far enough away maybe close all right wait for a second touch here again just play patient he has to play this ball into me i know that so i can just play patient on the wall there it's fine i can get the mid boost play it around them off the wall it's gonna be good for my teammate to follow up as well which is why i like doing that a lot that should be cool there you go another another example of using your team to your advantage right beat this guy off the wall into a spot where my teammates always gonna have the advantage on the next touch that's what i always want to do when i'm playing with someone i always give them the advantage i always give them a good position for the next touch and we did that while there so if you guys enjoyed today's video the car felt nice all in all i think that if you like dominance you'll enjoy this car a lot it's a very weird feeling to be honest um because the boost comes a little bit higher than normal on most cars but uh outside of that if you guys like fast and furious i'm sure you'll like this car a lot um but yeah thank you guys for watching i appreciate y'all like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all [Music] peace how could i trust you when you hurt me
