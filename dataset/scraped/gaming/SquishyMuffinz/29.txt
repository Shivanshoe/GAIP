awesome comments and i saw some of you guys asking me to play snow day so after all this time i've decided i will do it i've done replacements in every other game mode why not let's play some snow day let's see if it goes well i'm not sure what to expect i haven't played this mode in a long time wish me luck see how it goes all right it's been a while we're playing diamond tournament winners but they're probably going to be absolute gods at this mode this guy's decal looks crazy look at the back left boost here oh my middle i kind of still use like the normal game's logic in this mode the only thing is the mechanics are definitely different like that pinch would never happen usually gotta wait he's gonna have the ball i also call it a ball even though it's a [ __ ] i'm also canadian so i shouldn't be making this mistake but i do nice huge huge the slightest opening a little pass back from our dubs the goat the goals never quite feel satisfying in this so i'm gonna try to get some aerial play going on here if we can get some flippery set or something it would be kind of cool closely behind kiro here let me go quick why not maybe follow it up oh i dunked them 50 wait we're crazy we're crazy i pinched it with my teammate smells kind of fun it's not bad actually it's less chaotic than the other modes i feel like like by a lot rumble felt super chaotic drop shot was just a whole lot of double commits oops wasn't as bad oops wasn't terrible the other mozart are kind of messy got a dribble here played around one actually a good touch room nice curio huge passing play here absolutely crazy i love it you can defend by just sitting on the floor you block like pretty much the whole net just by driving on the floor right here in this mode double tap no no it was almost crazy a dribble put it on one how did i get so much power on that actually good pass though to kira the pin she loves his pinches aerial maybe shot it is so hard to get power on this thing kira's holding it down well done all right there's my turn to go again trying to dribble it here we have control like the one click two oh you can actually dribble this thing sorry teammate i just figured out that you can dribble i i gotta further investigate i'm air dribbling now there's nothing we can't do i'm pinching it i'm crazy oh well i'm overheating i'm going a little too crazy here nice oh you missed oh get it our dubs this is good this is good middle shot maybe our dubs are just go ah try waiting for the dribble here look at our go to defense middle middle maybe you see me potentially i got it controlling the play huge there's nothing they could do or a brick wall on defense right now the whole squad look at us go oh my god what a shot look in oh my wait it's in what i feel like it wasn't it i thought it was like 50 in i'm watching this back wait that counts as in there hmm maybe it's like a little bit over halfway it counts as in hitbox is weird maybe actually important to know that i feel like i'm fake i'm here it's a good 50 hit 50 again wait back wall try it's going crazy huge 50. look at that this is really intense stuff sitting on the floor look at me go lifting them close take it back to control the the game here here dribble across the map clip reset actually actually gotta please set off this i didn't know that was possible either you're not gonna lie ah good demo my teammate got back like crazy i don't even know how do you like even control this thing man time to get it set up for an irrigable wait wait i'm figuring it out i'm actually figuring it out all right good first game let's get to the next one let's even keep it up get back back up it's actually fun i got this car looks sick it's actually fun first game though can't the next one alrighty got another match here my bad i might boost still there i should have been cheating i don't even know if people cheat in this mode but wait i'm figuring it out you can definitely actually dribble this a matter of choosing the right time to the 50s though i don't know if it's better to single jump or not to jump at all like not jumping is better that is hard to get a controlled hit on though so this middle an awkward spot all right these guys are better defenders for sure we have a full-time goalkeeper here maybe this is meta for this mode i'm uncertain i missed i feel like it wait over 2v3 that's why he's defending oh my gosh we're actually winning 2v3 we're crazy what do you live for all good rafiki we're gonna win this bro anything's possible anything's possible maybe not anything all right we're good there man that's two of them massive oh that was actually crazy get it out of defense there like bumps really good in smoke too because everyone stays really grounded what a pass i say done rafiki we got the synergy huge oh there's some space got them lacking i'll kick off i don't know what to do though it's so hard to get control of this thing boost come back double tap all good oh no how are they getting toxic with each other in a tv3 focus up wonderful oh i scored all right snow day has proven to be an interesting game mode oh my beautiful all good i'm not going on another team i hope they figure it out at the same time i don't because we're trying to win here the tactical advantage if they're tilted all right this is good get them all to commit inch again maybe huge get the boost huge huge all right i can never thought i was gonna bounce or stay grounded it's actually really difficult all good all right they're closing the lead they're closing the gap 32 is looking less and less likely here gotta be careful last man back for a bit until i get control of this huge bump absolutely massive dude this map kind of hurts my eyes actually a good hit they can't do much off of it like it was good open space is always we should be looking for on clears like that oh wait i'm crazy i'm actually crazy did not think i get that much power on that that was good wonderful oh it's so hard to get around it also like if you hit just the wrong part of the puck it just doesn't go where you want it to like the slightest bit off even if you're in the right spot it looks like it doesn't go if you wanted to sometimes play around this guy or was jumping should i control this on the wall oh it pinched somehow waiting for this boost i guess it's fine the puck is like really far and then react whatever comes off of it what did i just do wait that's actually kind of crazy wait that was actually crazy wait for the head here oh wasn't expecting that good ceiling shot we actually got one all right i'm satisfied up four goals 50 seconds left 2v3 we're doing the impossible right now rafiki coconuts and i oh yeah actually good one more homework google no man man down man down to me oh my i got it i got it no hold on no man no damn they don't want me to have any fun i'm sad all good alrighty hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever
