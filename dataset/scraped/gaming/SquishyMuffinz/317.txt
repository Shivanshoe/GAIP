we should be well over 800 MMR at that point and we already have 6 out of 10 matches played so we're getting closer and closer to finding our final rank so yeah let's get to the games for today and hopefully we can get ourselves two more wins but who knows it's gonna be a completely random mess probably but I saw one in series let's get into it alright for the first game we got almost every single person in this lobby over 600 only one person's at 599 MMR everyone else is over 600 so this is gonna be a quality Lobby I hope compared to what we've been getting you know one wiper kick off on their side and one of their teammates already seems not too happy about that nice little pass back we have so much space here so both waiting so long alright my teammate just destroyed me completely there but we got back again like I have full control of that ball that point there's no point of going and exactly spot as me and bumping me there I mean even if he hits the ball it's not gonna do anything no one could follow it up too busy right next to me I'm gonna wait here I hit this to the corner on defense he almost always on the plate to the corner and smells like that because gets rid of danger for a second like no one's gonna be there for seconds in the corner time to control the ball God by one team say I'm gonna leave that teammate wasn't in the best spot the other guy should have been there but it's all good okay only one got to get by here put it up here again the pre jump you don't need to pre jump on stuff like that there you gain no advantage by pre jumping if you wait there's literally the easy to school you almost never want a pretty jump especially when you're so locating if you're playing it calms and you're higher rank and you understand like the speed of the ball and what the person's gonna do next sure go for it but there's no point of you jumping otherwise it's gonna make things a lot harder for you I pattern on this my team he was all the way back got a river one nice to me should be there pretty easy tap it up play it off the backboard here I'm gonna go back and teammate super far back people still need to be pushing up a little bit more toward midfield when they see their teammates on offense that's still an issue even up to 600 which is gold I think this is a golden flat might be flat now definitely still an issue a good goal good job to capitalize on the empty net there now just a matter about sitting it around them as much as possible take our corner place off the backboard here light forward it's gonna go up hit the curve and then come out a little bit keep it free jumping can same do that free time last time likes using that a jump button early hit off the backboard here see if they can hit that I feel like it has a free jump again and he actually touched that time I'm not sure plays up to the wall I was looking middle but my teammates super far back so there's no way I Steve and get to him should I control that over 1 over 2 I'm gonna leave that now that's not my team is gonna be coming in I didn't want to mess him up okay it's fine I mean you don't want to be like RIT sitting back on the same side a team it might be coming down but at the same time that that can happen especially if you have your ball came on you don't even see me in time so I'm say middle you give me an option again like I'm on if I could shoot this that's a goal pretty much every single time in these ranks so you want you want to give your team at that option that's the problem that a lot of these players aren't doing they're not giving their teammates that option this floor wow that is that is that unlucky he tried to dribble that that was the shot that went in oh we tried to control it he said oh noob teammate rib I'm the only one I could see that because I'm on PC ah noobs I mean to be fair he's not like crazy good either there's off the wall again nicely done might be in incredible stuff just great pressure all around also I feel like I'm just gonna say it now mentality is a big part of this game although gotcha might be performing better in terms of just like his mechanics and action hitting the ball and being in proper positions and not on bullying sure but his mentality is pretty [ __ ] I won't lie to you so if your mentality is like that I recommend you try to change that because that is somebody's gonna definitely stop you from getting better I promise you that if you immediately look to how bad your teammates are and you can't look past that in a simple ranked game and that I hurts you deep down that much that you have to complain something you definitely gotta look at yourself and be like whoa why am i this mad over ranked and my teammates not being as good as I want them to be yeah I mean ma'am it's all it is a huge huge factor you can't have that kind of mindset hey guys just I gotta just a little bit too much alrighty played well they were there where they needed to be and you could already tell the speeds improving but there still is the same kind of double commits happening quite a bit and people still not positioning fully where there should be there to play a little too far back in some spots but even then much better than what we've been seeing for sure but yeah not bad at all not too bad we got 43 points now we're over 800 everyone our 839 and those guys are all gold 3 all of them were gold 3 so we're getting close to playing against Platts but we're at well over plot now or getting close to Diamond I think I think diamonds probably 900 anymore yeah it's gonna last in the video and hopefully we can get her something that wins all right this would be a tough one plenty ins 700 any more players all over 700 anymore there we have a 687 still so it depends how good our 687 is whether or not we win this game I think because you guys would probably be much more solid I'm gonna leave okay that guy's already pretty solved with the the banger he just hit play it over one and play it to his side again it's over two players now plus that's the guy we gotta watch out for it seems like I had the angle block wasn't on target though I'm gonna take some pads which I'll just bang this one away get some more pads here nice put it off the corner then I'll leave grab the mid boost get off the corner Tim it's a little far back with his family saw pressure here I can kill this guy maybe getting quite good block from him I was trying to stay off the backboard but it wasn't matter to get my team years all the way back you don't want to run all the way back here's the primers to rule that I try to follow if your team is on offense you don't want to rotate like super super far back because you can't follow up that next touch so how do I just take some pads and and rotate it around midfield that's the rule I like to follow for that hit it's off the wall I run another one again look how far back there is no support and offense in that and that's creation where if he's closer to go for us most likely trying to hit an open space center setting it to them so we ended up double committing and then he said his wild to me interesting team it should be there for that nice she does I'm here to support the 50 whatever happens almost on gold [Music] see my should have that and the fall this would be a lot quicker after I bit the flick out just gives them too much time to get that one V to play again get it started you gotta cut that out as soon as it gets flicked teammates should hit that alright which I get this middle off a pinch just get buckling them off the wall good read this together much more solid than what we've been playing before you Fischer off the wall again how many times can they save it off the corner I try just off the wall maybe I better try to utilize like the corners and the walls just to hit it around them as much as possible that seems like stuff that my teammates will be ready for but even then they're still not fully prepared for a lot of this stuff he just you just took the boost in the corner but he's not going for the ball so I'm gonna go for it don't cry from there and I still have a booster grab some pads here I know a time so take the ball slow so I played it to the corner uh drop this down for my teammate shot good job let's go nice they're actually ready for like the weird stuff that I was trying to pull out there dribble that past all tricky from they all three went dude there's no trust at all there I'm gonna go back here so we gotta play good defense for a minute 30 that's fine I started for control again no reason to throw away a ball like that there's so much space and their teammates already on the ball there's no reason throw a ball in the situation but it's fine I'm in a mistake I was trying to follow up my a dribble good 50 there I back off I didn't do some more plays there I hit it off the corner they go for a couple demos because that works quite well touch middle gonna make it really öktem now get shot I'll put it off the back and then I go for some demos seam it up Sully missed so I'll get there let me have control this ball we don't need to throw this away quite yet I wish I bring this into the corner Oh hoping to get that boost or the kill I can get you there but it's fine we have a decent bit of pressure going forward at least a little bit scared that I was in a one on three again you should really ever be less than I want to it should be very rare that happens mortars your teammates not rotating properly around you but that's it aside where there's nobody empty space over there get to the corner round one I can kill one that's pretty big gotta try to kill this enough there we go also my teammate there as last back if you are in a position where you are in a 1 B 3 or 1 meets you don't challenge early because if that ball goes to the side it's a bad 50/50 your teammates not there to help you out you know you got a fake challenge try to get control that ball try to make them take a shot that you can get to the corner so it's not dangerous and they can get an immediate follow-up right so that was a pretty bad mistake of day in there it could have got a score tom but again we shouldn't have left them in that one way through there's always it's always a deeper mistake than the mistake that might cause a goal like I probably did something in that play if I look back that I didn't need to go for or I didn't need to aggress that left my team ended in 1b 3 that almost got a score down right but most people would look at that like oh my team is challenged really bad yeah you made the mistake to challenge a bad they're almost gonna scored on but I also parts to let them in that position I'm a reason why he was in that spot that was hard to get out of right so you gotta look at yourself in that sense and that's why watching your own replay is really important so you could find where you're making that mistake and don't always look at other people was the only person making the the errors you're making errors to every single person makes errors I make hundreds of errors of game honestly hundreds of little minor errors a game I still make and many other pros do the same thing every single Pro do the same thing it's not a single player it doesn't make mistakes every single game as simple as that you gotta look at yourself sometimes you got it you got a few replays watch what you're doing wrong look at where you're using your space are using your space are you wasting balls when you have the time to do more with them stuff like that and yeah hope you guys enjoyed that's those games done we got two more games left we'll do that in the next video we got 883 MMR after our eight games played we wanted lost one game style which is super super solid but yeah and as you know I'm trying to get to 1 million subs afford to end of the year and we're well on track to do that if you guys want to help me along
