yo what's up guys he's going to be playing some moving games for today the last time i actually played ones was on his channel last time we played it so it's been a little bit of a break since i have and i don't want to become too rusty at him so let's get into some games see if we can get some dubs see how it goes all right the first game i'm playing against rhyolite i recognize this player i actually played him before in one's like a long time ago pretty sure he's south american he's pretty high ping but about the guess i think he is it's around what the brazilian players get around 200 ping but they're always very very solid so you can always expect a good match i have so much respect for these guys all the same players that that can play on uh corner ping like can consistently play well honestly is very impressive to me the bad play for me i just gave him a free goal pretty much by flipping into that i shouldn't really flip into it obviously i should just say ground next to it let him hit the ball into me would be better play one more touch here maybe just go for a quick shot get the boost try to just suffocate him here see on this ball very good 50 from him is smart you went straight away for that mid boost again very smart play from him surprised he didn't try to go for that back boost a little bit harder that was a very important boost in that play he didn't really try to go for it though big demo here's off the corner quick try to just convert there we go demos are very very important to look for when you can he's in a position there where he has to hit it back he has to play for the boost he's a little boost so if you can get the demo it's the best thing to do in the situation up to myself but soft just chill here there we go i kind of wanted to think that i was going to go for an air dribble so i wanted to make him back off right there is kind of like a fake doesn't go for a touch makes him back off quite a bit like you see the situation he ended up going in right because of that they actually pushed out a lot harder for him to defend that once he's off his goal line i'm gonna play from the boost so i'll play for the corner i have to die here don't think i can convert so i'm just gonna go for the boost instead fake this he has to flick this away about now and go for this back boost now if i don't die it's actually really good for me can't really shoot this would have been really good to get the other boost by still 40 and he has to play it back again so i can stay grounded here that touch isn't going to do too much for him i can play pretty patient now should be a goal take my time that's a good situation to play patient right he has to put the ball into me it's going fast toward my side so either he plays it into me i get the ball for free either way playing patiently is a better player than the rush shot a lot of times if you give up on going once because you made a mistake in terms of when you challenge when you'll see even the highest level it's that same issue mistakes usually where you challenge i'll try to point out this game another example of it but he's challenging very aggressive and this is probably a situation that'll eventually lead him to to get scoring if he keeps doing this he got out pretty well right there but that touch don't really like it too much from him just because it leaves him falling onto my hat for so long and now he's left having to to get back right had my my bump actually went through there it would have been really good for us this is the situation to be very careful of because i don't have any boosts now getting a good touch to the side it's always hard not even follow up i'm just going to stay grounded the hope he misses and i played it much better than if i pre-jumped that if i pre-jumped that and gets scared there's a really good chance he gets a goal there tell us about the god of now good mechanics you got to be careful nice really good air dribble there i tried to think that i would slow it down in the last second try to scoop under it again did well there played across i need to be putting patiently there pop it up for solo play you try to flip early i didn't get my flip but i can fake that i have it and play to the bottom corner i knew i didn't get it because my my camera actually didn't do a little shaking thing it normally does let you get flip really hard to notice if you you know haven't been playing for a long time and haven't went for a lot of them but as soon as you have you'll you'll know it's a good thing again go fast for the ball last second back off very hard for the opponent to read it's gonna happen a good first game though against the next one let's even keep it up get back to back dubs on the day let's see how it goes all right we got a game with the exact same dude back to bad games see how this goes take my time for the bounce here i like to wait try to play the possession instead of rushing something and look it ends up letting his net off that it's really good for us i'll just stay on this now get a flip it's fine if i can get a demo on him it's huge if not it could be risky but still forced him to decide he might put a demo on me which is really smart of him quite to the side boost i think it's smart i could show i like that he closed down his face but i can still play it back best way to put it it's not going up the wall balls coming towards me he has the alert kind of close but if he hisses into me at any point i end up winning this challenge i think i actually don't mind this you guys tend to challenge this at some point i can fake that pick it again still get the ball back take my time here going for the corner boost instead of the shot i think it's smarter get a flip but never use it let's just wait you know he has to respect the fact that i have that flip right so the whole idea of me just not using that and just saying there is to make him sit back he has to wait and respect the pinch potential as well right so if i wait to the very last moment like that i can actually stay with the ball and get a really fast shot close to the goal line instead of just wasting my possession off uh a bad flip reset good job to catch him off guard we're putting him in a very awkward spot so like all the situations that we put them in are very hard to get out of they're very hard to read kick off should be able to finish nicely done really early lead here which is good never go wrong i could definitely lose the lead still i'm gonna fake this go for a reset fake take my time see what he does he possession so me not challenging again there that's the extra challenge that's gonna normally give me the extra bit of space very unlucky that he gets that pinch there i know from all my experience all my time playing this game there's no way he tried to shoot that like that but you know he definitely will take it when he can it's not something you can really try to do it's like just happens and you take it yes sir had a lot of options there so many things for him to have to cover i can go for a quick shot cover shot off the wall you actually just waited back i was not expecting that i'm not gonna lie i've never i kind of autopiloted i kick off because no one ever really fakes this kickoff but if i was paying attention i wouldn't really get caught off guard by that i kind of just wanted to kick off without paying attention a mistake there get a backflip i have control i'm just my eyes are just locked on i'm in a situation so a few backflips here which probably will in a second get a good demo on him get this boost as well hopefully he spawns on our side i actually prefer that a lot harder from the gada situation i'd say really good boost still actually can't reach that oh my gosh that was the perfect shot and all he did was drive into it so simple things definitely the simple things that payoff it's a big big boost grab somebody got the other mid boost here you can't actually go for us i'll just chill right to the corner it's fine if you get stacked i just played downfield now now i think it's good time to go for the other boosh other mid boost try to fake challenges early really good challenge there take the mid boost strongmax and i know he's going for that take the back boost as well go for the bump on him bad touch from him because all the pressure there we go at any point during that that play if you decided to turn around while i was going for his back boost i still beat him to the ball it's a safe play to go for i'm gonna play challenge you see what he does let's hit save click the mid boost here gotta get a good shot have enough boost to get that turn got a good powerful shot as well he's really good ones player we're doing pretty well so far do mistakes here and there want us to decide he's afk so it's going to be our goal wait wait for him to come back i wanted to score on them play to myself soft i always wanna try to make it as hard as possible for them to get possession on the ball right all right another early forfeit that's gonna be off listening guys i hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is you're watching this like comment subscribe we'll see you guys all in the next one i love y'all you
