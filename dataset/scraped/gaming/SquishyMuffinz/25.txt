yo what's up guys back to some more games for today with ryze i've had a lot of fun playing with him the last two videos let's get into it so you can get some more wins for today it's actually super clean two's games and it feels really nice to play really fun really fluid so yeah hopefully get some more games for say let's see how it goes all right we got eight wait and fly cool the gg off the bat again might be a goal for them to start here i don't know if i can get back it's gonna fake this you have to respect that i'm there first take the back piece here he's gonna be low you actually just straight up going forward which i think is the best next thing he could have done because i had the advantage there and boost nice can be really awkward for him really good to delay there it's actually i could have maybe scored that didn't get the flip there would have probably been a goal so i played to make my recovery was actually crazy i'm not gonna lie surprise myself nice i had to stay ready there the chance to shoot that i knew the demo is going to be coming i honestly don't know who this is get off the back wall for ryze forces the next guy to touch it quick which is good and it's always good that ryze uh loves to play patient on those because it's just gonna give us a free ball every time like the perfect way you should play that i think it's a good demo let him stay on that you might be able to get back it might be too hard my bad honestly i i probably should have left it because ryze got like a heavy first touchdown so i thought maybe it was a past they trusted me i was not happy guys not same goal as uh from last video i remember they got exactly like that um yeah i don't know they um they do not seem very happy yeah trying to play some ranked games running into ryze and i that'd be sad too solo queueing and these be your opponents but can you do really good 50. well done texas 50 super well very smart does it close there uses the left wall to his advantage and has his last name as well if he gets that left he can actually follow it if he gets it right he can't very like basic stuff but does it really well really close try to get like a super thin angle on that probably slightly come from the side here try to beat him quick and again it always forces the second guy to react quick to that played to ride this corner got the boost room which is good i'm just going to instago look at so i play to make wow that was actually crazy damn it was actually really nice oh my bad i missed the mid boost all good though the kickoffs are superior to ours i feel bad for ryze honestly huge respect and credits arise for playing on 140 ping he's having a good time he told me i didn't know this but he said that i was one of the players he's always looked up to i saw a tweet of him saying that i'm his favorite player which is crazy because this man just beat me at the major and got second like that's insane to think about that people that have watched me and supported me for a long time are making careers for themselves and stuff like that it's insane so really really proud happy forum love to see it notice people being successful even if it means i'm failing as a result sorry my brain was frying trying to think about what i was trying to say there doesn't usually happen but it happened there actually very hard sometimes to commentate and like try to play but you think over the years i'm getting i would have gotten better at it and i have definitely it's not as difficult as it once was but still definitely can be nice it was a really important save i think if we got square on the other game gonna be really tough but we can definitely take this now let's close recover decently as i should be able to get back to this a little bit close they're trying to like stay on this and be annoying hopefully you guys can get there unfortunately we still have time to no problem could be our first loss oh he joking i was really hard he jumped as i got bumped so he had to try to commit to it this is winnable still i have faith in the comeback ah just insta challenging too much confidence he's lost too many times he's in his uh just do whatever mode and it's working better than whatever they're doing before we get one quick it's doable ah all good we'll get our next game what can you do we scored now we win mexico wins next school wins nevermind i lost that sad sad sad life for living here i haven't dropped the ball all righty good first game though against the next one seem to keep it up probably two games should say because they didn't have a quick forfeit for once the fly cool guy didn't instantly but let's get into the next one see we can keep it up see how it goes all right we got a rematch as long as you go 1-1 that's a victory my book is first game we lost together was the last game which is pretty good we're like eight in one right now i think what we've been queuing not too shabby number one it's my weight from rise here trying to pop it up kill some time put it around them let me go for a bumpy get away from him i'm just turning just to be annoying actually good shots and get a try good attempt let's go for a pinch there like that bumped him off i think should be fine he's gonna have to get like a panic that shoot if i just go for the boost block the net which is good that's all i need to do there nice i was honestly really awkward to do felt weird i needed to get the beat there and a pop to myself the ariel looked awkward but that's like the only way i can get a touch that i wanted and not be bad it's a good block trying to get the perfect touches and it's being my downfall here when like any touch would be better than a miss i'm gonna backflip be annoying let him hit that go for a bum force the pop which essentially is like me popping at that point actually can't reach that's so unfortunate all good yeah bump and like perfectly it just helped them here's what happens to me when i bump someone helps them more so than doing what it's supposed to do but happens good flake it's gonna wait for the right pc like the beast force one to like me out now which is good [Music] nice we can go again would be huge we probably can't looks so awkward oh my god i actually got back so i have no idea how actually perfect but he got bumped actually good bumps here for let's play all the way back i think it's better because there's someone just bumping me so probably to be a free ball for them at least now the ball's in ryze's hand and actually do something with it by the instant challenge it's the second challenge i did not expect like it's like a bad thing to do that because i went a little bit quicker it's just a goal against them right away but worked out for him nice good job a lot of uh traffic to weep through there well played there i go for the bump another guy as well let him stay on this i could react whatever happens next play that soft touch to myself do another one maybe maybe just trying to see if i can kill as much time as possible there nice good patience on the golden player for a shot maybe too ambitious probably but worth the try why not wait for the touch across if i can control this would be huge pass back down it's smart to wait on that touch at least we'll be forced back into them and you can probably get a save on this without taking the boost because i honestly wanted them to be able to take it and go but paul didn't even allow for that really it's a good pass yeah i did not they didn't i don't think they passed the same time this whole game and they looked for the pass in the last 10 seconds unfortunately any ranked different different breed all right at least we can get a cool law school now unfortunate almost got the perfect touch back goal but you gotta hit on it should challenge should away from me i was really hoping that would just go top corner and that's the game would be too easy if that was the case there i'm going to say my full boost here and wait left you got bumped i'll fake this i don't know any boost but at least the forces touched it aside missed the boost which is actually really bad situation becomes really awkward because of that honestly i would have been able to help out before now i just i'm late to being able to do i leave this be a 1v1 i feel like rise okay if rise doesn't know it's only one okay nevermind this guy just left it i have to respect that the bump might not come through there the answer these guys don't care i think they lost so many times to us that they just figured they should stop like thinking so much and it works better almost always does the less you think the more you just say like whatever i'm just gonna go for whatever works better in this game especially in twos are you just gonna instago again it works so much better it's actually impressive how much better that works all right we switched to eu servers for the last one because driver's thing is ping they're becoming difficult to play with wow off the bat i can already tell how oh my gosh getting tossed around it might look really bad this game but at least it's only one game the rest are all played on n a which is good for cross region duo it's got a lot of n a games honestly like huge respect for ryze for playing i don't know if it's this bad for him but the canada to eu servers is just terrible nice well done really a touch to make there again because the guy grounded just waiting for my shot i feel like doing there is always going to be saved so that that back wall touch is so much more valuable let's stay on it go back here for some pads oh lucky oh good it was awkward i have anybody to help him out with using a bad spot on the back wall and they played it well it is very it is very hard it's so hard how to get this to the right side especially kickoff that's why there's something out goals that went in and i was playing with them i think because like what just happened happened like it looks like it's going one way and then just randomly switches yeah we're doing not bad though just a little bit uh enough to react to some stuff ah i should have been overall i'm the other guy i'd be huge i'm upped them again actually just bumping them the whole time and if you're up to the worst part though of the laggy how do i i don't even know how i react to that let him panic a bit it should be free shot now the garage is playing safe on that which is smart little one going in the air for whatever happens good job that's actually a good shot i'll just straight in it's like that situation it's like impossible i cannot tell what's gonna happen i'm trusting that the the bump's gonna come in like right there and watching it looks like it is and then it's just past them and also just looks like people like warp around the field this game is really i think this game is as hard as like fps is to play with high ping it's like super difficult maybe even harder it's a good beat try to look for a bump on the last guy she's gonna play safe here bumped him off awesome you goalster oh you missed it's a good shot let's go try can i have a hit though gotta respect it should have played it over him because he wouldn't have been able to react to that what about one of them is gonna try wait right wall thanks for the solo should respect this i'm gonna pop it i don't know how close the guy is there so i'd rather be safe than sorry let me go back now still like this amount of boost play software should be shot try take the mid boost here try not to like full commit trying to make them like force wide every time i don't even know just happened i just got like super laggy all of a sudden i don't know if you guys saw that it was like a really big spike nice oh my gosh they're gonna score off of it they're to score off of it okay well honestly that's funny like this kind of sums up my uh [Laughter] kind of sums up my major experience in l.a honestly good all good the game's been testing me lately i'll be honest but i will prevail wow i was like good try alrighty hope you guys enjoyed having some wonderful day or night whatever time as you guys are
