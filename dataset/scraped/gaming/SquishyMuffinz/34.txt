yo what's up guys so the new rocket league season is here i'm gonna go through the brand new rocket pass really quick i actually don't think the soccer pass is that great but i will go through it also before i go through it the video today the whole point of it the whole idea of it i want to be focusing around this decal i think this is like the sixth decal in the game this thing is insane i'll show you guys more when i'm actually in game but you can only mess with the primary uh for each side but the slurpee part of it is crazy it moves like the faster you go the more the decal moves it looks sick uh this is actually not in the game yet we only got this uh from energy it's like a 7-eleven sponsored decal something like that i'm not sure if it'll be available in the future but i'm actually one of the only players in the game that has this right now me musty garrett justin and sis the only players that have the sd card right now but it's super sick i love it and i think it's the best decal in the game right now i'm not gonna lie i actually just cannot get enough of this decal so i'll play some games with it uh some of my placements but before we do that i'll take a look at um the rocket pass for you guys i don't think this rocket pass is that great i'll start off by saying that i think um like all the wheels are kind of underwhelming this decal is not bad it's kind of cool um i don't know i just i wasn't too impressed with this one usually there's like one or two items i really like and this though there hasn't really been i think i looked through everything already but for the most part i don't know a lot of people are complaining about this season i haven't really played yet and i haven't even tried the new map apparently the new map also it's kind of weird harder the eyes but for the most part the items aren't like crazy good in this rocket pass i honestly don't think i don't know maybe i'll buy it maybe i'll try just like get the car and make a video for you guys with the car but yeah if you guys want to pause any of these things you can but there's really nothing too too crazy where's this finish watercolor it's kind of cool this okay i don't know i don't know who designed these or what they were thinking but it's kind of gross man [Laughter] no comment no other comments on that but interesting i'm not sure but um what hitbox this car is looks like merc probably honestly cannot tell though i guess merc is octane though so it's probably octane screen tone that's kind of cool that's low-key kind of cool not bad this is the goal explosion i don't know oh it sucks everyone in and eat some i didn't realize he does that it's pretty cool anyway today we're gonna be using this though this car um this decal like i said i think it's the best decal that i've seen i'll show you guys really quickly in training what it does when you move with it so when you're stationary it just stays like this when you start moving it actually moves with you which is crazy i think that's sick and the faster you move the faster the decal moves as well and the more color there is on your car i think it looks insane anyway let's get into some games for today lq 2s um i've heard the places have been bad for people so wish me luck i'm gonna go straight into it all right i actually recognize um to the players in here i don't know who drunk top 100 twos is but the other guys i do recognize i think i've played them before we'll see try backball challenge late i think it's better to stay on the wall as long as possible it sounds like air driving like that especially the solo air dribbles where they don't have like a past middle just stay on the back wall as long as you can nice good pass run teammate it's really good to wait like far across there that's like i don't know that's something that you'll learn with time but when someone's on the right side there like that on the wall all they're gonna do is hit it far across the left so you want to be positioned there early if you can be i was going to go for that quick i can speed up his shot attempt fine made him waste all of his like boost for that as well and he had to commit pretty hard the challenge yes that's fine put one touch forward image should go here nice let him fall out himself one high touch forward that's going to make this guy waste all this boost he's only touched here is going to be delay for his teammate most likely it's gonna be a low 50 like that should be able to wait a good boost still from him forces me to flick it away trying to be annoying that's fine good boosting from him as well wait left wants to use me it could be a goal goes for the shot it's fun i think my teammate wouldn't have been there so it's honestly better that they beat me because it kind of gives my teammate the ball again good control to yourself just wait again this is like i can't score off this but i'm trying to contact my teammates behind me any kind of 50 is good my teammates should be able to win the next ball so i got the opponent to go for that by waiting super long which is good get this boost save my boost as well so i'm gonna make a play to this better flip back now if he beats him that's huge nice put my time on that because i know i have time i know it's the last guy trusting my teammate to get the win there he did a good job well done that's really on my teammate to get up to that quick and get the pass forward well done you can't actually shoot off that it was a good try though i'm not sure if you're trying to pass or just hit it forward maybe i shouldn't have went it might not have been a patch for me if that was the case then i shouldn't went actually really good block too many should have a lot of time though if you flicks this guy i can actually just score off this maybe did you fake them ah a little too high should have been a goal for sure it's a bit of a mistake for me minor one though not a big deal it's gonna save and wait until like the last possibility the more time you give yourself before you have to commit to the challenge on the goal line the better your chance will be that you're actually gonna save it you have all the way until this point to make the save right so you might as well use as much time as possible if it's not like a super risky situation if a situation super risky then you should go for and try to help your team a good first match against the next one seem to keep it up get back to back dubs for the first games of the season my team actually played really well good job to him good job for the solid gameplay in general let's next one so we'll see i actually don't recommend anyone of the two new players in this lobby so let's see how this goes wait for the bounce up the wall here take our time i'm fine if he hits this just follow myself again unfortunate that i land on my teammate but it should still be okay i think i might just be straight in very good i don't waste any more boost here [Music] only time i want to waste boosters if they're definitely challenging me and like that's the worthy investment for what's going on i'm gonna fake this try to stay in front should be okay drop my teammate trying to keep it close there's a good play this is an awkward situation to deal with really good though that was like really hard i'm not gonna lie it's like the worst spot to be in when the balls come around the corner like that drop my teammate good delay there that's smart good work nice took my time on the shot i know i have time right so why not use it i don't need to rush there what is this guy gonna say two things first get out i'm gonna follow this try to like beta test room i don't have the fulcrum right here anything is just to make them flick this away right right around here and then i can leave this becomes awkward a little bit now let's save it again i don't know how we're getting these like really tough situations it's gonna play dribble here baking another good save good job to use our time day huge beat for my teammate good job i'm jump on the wall here to control this myself maybe a good bump yeah i should be fine he has no angle here nice that's a good play to make try to get focal throw the ball forcing the back off and then i have the free reign of the the bump there well done that's so nice thanks for the support brother i'm gonna fake the high should be to go under him this again makes him the backup kind of has to respect me and then i can go for any kind of shot there only thing is i was worried about the guy that was coming behind me for the bump so that's what i played took a little bit too long there my bad oh looks like i bumped them take my time here could probably go up the left floor or two he wants it to like out of his way it's all good do it there i stole a full boost as well that's actually good they're both backing off the plates are right around one until i go to the ceiling let's save it's a good play obviously like pay attention to like where they're coming from and try to try to play opposite side every time that's like the main thing that i'm always doing when i have the ball if i'm like dribbling low to the ground like try to pay attention to if they're facing the right or left but there's always going to be like a weaker side where they can't really like turn to challenge it that's where you should try your best to bring the ball kind of like real soccer if any of you guys play real soccer try to throw defenders momentum off a bit like force them to throw their hand to the right and then go left something like that try to do the same thing in this game kind of wherever they're facing try to go the opposite way oh my first touch here this is fine i can't wait back hole anything he throws at me i can very easily just catch doesn't really matter close good job my teammate not to flip there so he didn't actually commit anything to it but he still got hit on the ball which is good flipping is the the biggest mistake you can make there because you're like completely committing to that play working out i was my teammate i was beating go back well even if i have zero boost pretty much can cover anything but this on the ground anything but a grounded play that's the only thing i could uh not cover there and that's like my teammate's job but he jumped is a little bit of a mistake but it's okay but yeah anything back while the whole the whole play there if i was played properly would be someone's on the ground covering the ground play forces the flick high and then i'm back hole can easily catch and bring to corner and then get full boost and carry carryout from there so a little bit of a mistake for the the ground player but it's not a big deal that will happen sometimes you know what i can do with this ball i'm fake human's getting a little crazy going for some freestyle who jumps gonna fake this could actually lose this i could definitely lose this we'll see maybe we're just making it entertaining for the people nice i think we might be able to score off this shouldn't play it around him so you can't get a shot of that now that's not going to be great i put it left side okay it's fine there's like a lot of time to roll it but it's okay it comes at 1v1 for a while now timmy should go again for me this might actually just be a goal yeah unfortunate again okay so like that situation there's been a lot of panic for my team the last like three goals we probably just loosened up because we're winning by so much but he shouldn't be jumping from under the ball like that he should just say behind me i challenge i gotta touch the ball of course the back hole but the second he goes for like that it kind of makes it really difficult essentially becomes a 1v1 there's no follow-up after the first challenge a lot of like mistakes on challenges in general but wow oh my gosh all right all righty we're good what is going on i'm just gonna try to take control of the ball as much as i can the rest of this game been a little bit messy better just ball chase a bit my teammate's also doing it so actually not i'll play safe because ever since my teammates are doing this uh it's not been good for us so i'll try to be the one that doesn't let something bad go in wow i don't know what's going on don't hit it again please look so scary one high touch here it should be hard for the last guy back all right well okay well that was a lot harder than it should have been sorry i was nervous yeah i figured it's okay it's okay alrighty hope you guys enjoyed having some wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one thank you for supporting the channel peace you
