yo what's up guys so the brand new season season four came out today with uh a brand new rocket pass which honestly didn't seem to have that much cool stuff on it um i'll just go through it really quick for you guys if anything stands out to you guys you can pause the video obviously i'm gonna ignore the bottom stuff because there's nothing really that cool on the bottom outside of one pair of wheels which i'll show you um but it doesn't look that crazy i'm honestly probably not gonna buy this rocket pass probably just gonna let me like play it out just level it up by playing um but outside of that we'll be playing some ones for today i think is what i want to do and uh i'll probably be trying to go for top five in every single playlist that's what i said i would do the end of last season these are the wheels that are on the bottom that i think look interesting but um i tried a brand new car in a different video as well and uh this decals are weird what the heck i'll try the brand new car in a different video i'll try the dingo as well in a different video there's also a new map that came out in this update which maybe we'll get in this video that'd be nice to show you guys these decals are weird i can't tell if i like them very weird or this one interesting very interesting all right so yeah i'll try to get all the the new cars and stuff and make videos on those but for today we're gonna get into some 1v1 games i've already played seven of my um what's it called my placement games on stream today and we lost one game to uh two pros so that was the only game that we played two pros in and i was solo queuing everything so they're they're partied up and obviously they're gonna have the advantage in a situation like that so unfortunately we're able to go perfect in our two's game so far but i might be able to finish it off with uh you know three wins in a row we'll see maybe i'll cue with someone so that way we can kind of guarantee that we'll we'll have a really good chance even against two pros if we run into um but yeah let's play some other one games for today hopefully we can get some some dubs throughout the season in a good way some more wins and try to go for that top five in every playlist like i said we try to go for let's get into it all right it's really early in the morning right now and i q ones and we were not able to find a one's game so i just played twos for today's video i know i said i was gonna play once but it's already been like 30 minutes of queuing so let's get into a 2-2 game hopefully let's see how it goes all right the first game we got luke against that and kishmer see how this goes i think i first shot off this i think by the way try to see if we can get a decent chance i wanted to pre-job i was hoping to pre-jump the the high shot to take advantage of that but he actually played it really well i played patient that's why i would have played that i think in that situation luke should be okay here all you can do is throw it away so as long as he doesn't get dunked really no danger in that it's fine i'm gonna wait for his next touch [Music] let's stay on this i know i got another flip out of that because my screen did that shaking thing something that like i think most people have figured out by now that your screen shakes a little bit when you get a reset also makes a little bit of a noise one way to know if you have it or not there's no indicator but that's kind of the only indicator the only way you can find out if you have one i'm lucky that they pinched that i might have had an opportunity but definitely worked out well for them they can't reach us i'll have a double not it's fine so created some decent pressure off that i'm gonna wait for the bounce here little touches it's fine still gives me the ball after it i don't mind i still have the ball technically there we go i thought i might situation as long as i know that i end up with possession after everything as long as i know that possession after at all it's fine with me zach is uh pretty sure he's known for being very toxic so i wouldn't be surprised if he says something else this game i've only heard bad things about him sadly to be empty really good demo from a teammate well done to set me up for that and all you have to do is beat him there so we went quick then i'm just going off that first touchdown i know that his teammates demoed right so it's all about just beating the other guy that's my main focus here if i get that that's pretty much getting the goal really good from him i should have played that different there my fault if this goes in [Music] that's my fault i didn't need to go at all normally i don't go for that i thought maybe why not let's take a risk i'm too goalied [Music] any time for bumps on the last guy back unfortunate how to get this to my teammate right side looks like he's going right boost to be fine though [Music] it's a challenge i'm just fine teammates should have it it's only bad if my teammate can go [Music] i just block them get back quick now take the middle pads back that way i can get pretty much like 100 without having to leave like most important part of the field that's the way i think about it being able to be in the middle of the field like that you could turn both ways you can cover a lot whereas if you just rotate back for the corner boost you can't really cover as much i don't like doing that commits you to one side of the field only nice challenge gonna have a turn here probably a flip it's fine playing patient on this i don't need to rush anything ended up beating him which is really good now this guy's forced to make a touchdown should be back for that he goes along here this is not bad [Music] it's gonna wait give it away which is really good now i can get time for my team to get back i'm gonna play opposite corner i know there's nobody put them if i have to it should be okay now it's a 1v1 [Music] try to pop it up go for that second touch it's really good to do normally creates a lot of pressure doing that place myself on the wall tried to block his touching actually didn't hit it so it might work out better for them my teammate misses this that's unfortunate so me expecting him to to hit that actually ended up working out badly for me duplicate login detected what does that count does that count as a game oh so let me join back what just happened oh we're back all right well new update the game is breaking a little bit but it's fine stay on this [Music] let's say from them my teammate done well done really good pressure there good dribble off the start and a good recovery good shot for my tv all he has to do is get that fast on target he knows that played it really well i'm glad let me join back they went for spanish kickoff which is just in the kickoff ticker goes for the cheater popularized by spanish players why it's called that go for the radio bump here there we go got a lot of space there popped over the first guys over him it's gonna be a pretty easy bump for me very very good uh play to make how do you get better mechanics [Music] i think i don't know what i'm going to tell them but i think that's the best way to put it [Music] i really think there's no there's no cheat code and there's no quick way to get better at certain things like every good player in this game has a lot of hours especially the best players the top players hold on the top players all have 10 thousand hours or more very very good players so like i have 13 000 hours right now so that's just to put into perspective how much time people have really put into this game that's over a year of playing this game straight if i sat down and played this game 24 hours every day for a year straight that's how long i've already played this game so even more than that actually but yeah that's just to put into perspective how long and how much grinding it really is right it's in the next game though let's even keep it up get back to back dubs on the day yo guys all right the last game we got ourselves lambo galaxy and we have an apex this is the new map by the way guys i actually was hoping we'd get one of these games on the new map we did hope it's still going i don't know how he sells boost he doesn't okay but it's okay it happens [Music] nice nicely done thank you for the new map my thoughts on it i think it's a little bit too bright for my liking not gonna lie um outside of it being too bright it reminds me too much of wasteland it doesn't feel different enough where it stands out to me i don't dislike it but i don't particularly like find it insane or amazing but yeah hopefully they release more cool like scenery maps steps low-key like the you wouldn't think it is but like the stuff in the background is kind of distracting to me somehow on this map it's like the only map it's like that surprisingly i don't know why my teammate touch gonna wait here teammates should make him get the ball away that's fine as well just bumping each other there we go really apply it's a good fake there good air dribble take advantage of this space oops my for some reason my flip didn't work double jump me instead [Music] okay there that's my teammate i played around them i can't really score off that but i think playing around like that's pretty good because they have to still control the ball it kills some time for me to get back kind of helps with your recovery time a bit when you do something like that as well it's only gonna take me a while to get back but like that even if it takes me a while they're gonna have a hard time controlling that in time right kind of mix up for how um how much you went all in on the play i think we're gonna try and 50. i bumped the mid yeah if i bought the mid guy here pretty much no threat and i bumped the other guy as well i might not be able to score though yeah that's tough take both boosts here so he has no mid boost no back boost not guys obviously oh actually he's able to reach i thought he would be able to reach to be honest [Music] hard situation together if he pre-jumped if he didn't pre-jump that that full control that plays that's all we'll play they kind of have to two goals down they have to make a play patience on the save there nice good job my teammate should be in i sit down really good challenge good job at least pressure him there because you don't want to just give him free um free space just turn and field there he's able to turn in field he actually makes a pretty dangerous play it's really good for my teammates to recognize that and actually challenge that's pretty much a big thing in twos as well i think you got to make sure you're closing down the space of your opponents have same situation ones and threes but i think two is a really big deal if it's a lot of one-wheel situations you don't want to leave your team in those only one situation so if you can close down states like this as quick as possible and leave your team a free ball it's much better than a situation where you don't help at all right you just have to have a free dribble gotta get a double middle not necessarily a score but at least put that pressure on like i was talking about before i can actually get a shot of this there we go we shoot it really well very good very well placed shot there nice and simple and that's normally what's most effective in this game i think a lot of people over complicate things when the the most simple way at the ball the most simple approach is almost always the best it's not exactly what i wanted i was hoping that i could pull up the next but it spun me out unfortunately it's a challenge at least it kills time for me to respond same thing challenge for my team [Music] he's after that it's okay only bad that i wasted my boost the only thing that's bad about that it's fine if you double commit if i stole a booster if i don't boost how to fake him fine teammates up early imagine he pitches that internet be crazy i was hoping i could pass to him i don't think he was ready or like wanted to commit that hardcore but that's fine the safer play a shot hold on the shots always look good i think when they like you come so quick off the curve that the back of your car is still like lifting off the ground like that [Music] i get big i'm gonna give him a heart [Music] if you're my teammate there my philosophy like in that situation would always be just go for the ball i think if you play the ball there and they get it past you it is what it is but if you play the like the read on the shot i think more than likely you're gonna get scored on and most scenarios either you get a bad pick you get scored on so i think playing the ball is almost always better in a situation so if you want to avoid getting fake that's the best way i think you can do that [Music] by just challenging those going straight for the ball ignore the ignore the player just try to intercept the ball don't try to intercept the touch that's about to happen if that makes sense my teammate did there and that's why it was a awkward situation to get out of for him they play from them passing got it back for this boost 30 seconds left into three goals i didn't really have enough time make a play on this do not worry too much should be horrible maybe of course all right one more chance one more chance we could do something with this ah never mind it's internet too obvious i was trying to try to get a really cool like musty or something like a ceiling shot musty double or something cool we already won the game if i was playing for the win there like if we needed to hold on to a lead really bad i would probably just put toward the wall stay close to the ball obviously they played a very different a lot smarter to not do what i did there if you're playing for a win but yeah good games not too bad in the next video i'll do the the final placement so you guys can see what rank i get but we'll end off on that for now 9 out of 10 matches played not too bad not too bad a lot of fun games so far yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this uh i can't wait to actually see if we can get top five in a leaderboard maybe even top one everything boy that'd be sick but yeah see you guys all next time i
