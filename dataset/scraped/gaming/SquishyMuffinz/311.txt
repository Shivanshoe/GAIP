mind blowing seriously thank you so much guys and hope you guys enjoy today's video you know guys I completely forgot to press the record button when I did the intro and I just realized it once I started the game so we're into another set of games for our road to grand champ without scoring for today finished off edge champion one division to you in the previous so hopefully we keep up the streak here we lost in a while my teammates gonna probably miss that one though I had a feeling based on how he was driving at that looks super super sketchy I don't know if frames are so droppy this scheme I get for this quick it a once so you have one more over room it's gonna be straight middle one my teammates gonna be there wasn't quite far enough up in the rotation but it's all good first touch good hit plate around one nice challenge for me I'm gonna go back here grab the pattern of pads in the way oh no thought I scored for a second we're good though our gear we're chillin matching my teammate played around 100 that's really bad we're good there play up to the wall hey it up again I would show anything nicely done it's around 2 again there's only one got to get for this ball so my team should have a free ball here there's no one to follow so that's gonna create a 1v1 dribble good flick from him to me a back flip so I got to be really careful here I know I said the previous don't take that from your teammate so I shouldn't get away for that but that was just super rock for wise it keeps popping up that that tip thingy my games glitching out right now or something my frames are spazzing out nice I'm going one of my teammates waited on that so I was gonna create an opportunity middle but one of them went without thinking that I would go but there's no way he's gonna score from the angle that he jumped at so you gotta try to think about before you go for the ball is it's possible to do anything with it or am I just wasting my positioning by going I see that he keeps popping up on the right side that my frames you like all over the place right now I hope it doesn't make the video look too bad kind of hard to play with my mind too much let him kind of panic throw this ball away to me yeah if I could follow us up off the wall it'd be good good I'm not gonna piss bombs and take their boost here the demo as well let me try to play the middle some reason my teammate wait but it's all good I prom I'm deke knew that I could even go for it again it's over two of them good job my teammates ago I handed up bumping to be shot look for the demo on me or the double flip reset pass only I could score that have been a spicy little play there it's over all of them to making it a shot close good try why does guys saying oMG how they kill him maybe you're gonna have it so long ago I got their boosts so that's more than get her now if that guy wasted a lot of abuses to try to kill me there have to kill on him I'll know her leg it now over here not like this or the right thing I just get my poof's it's all good he did it go for that works let's see if he gets the goal I don't want my games just having issues this game yes let me know if you guys had this glitch before whatever's happening to me I don't even know what it is but so yeah the thing on the right keeps popping out my frames are dropping like super hard let's go for a demo here I just turn on that to pressure there I did have to throw it away because my teammate was back a free ball easy ball to deal with should leave this for me nice a shitty game there we go I the game all around I'm not sure why it's doing that prior to restart my game there so if it is affecting the video you guys don't have to see it yeah I apologize for not pressing the record [ __ ] so you guys get him to an inch up for today but the MMRV where I was like 10 to 70 something they were up to 1097 after that win and that should bring us up to an extra division I think we got to Division 3 off that pretty sure I didn't see the animation or anything but I think we're up to Division three off that so yeah let's get the next one but really quick I'm just gonna restore my game alright for the last game which took like 30 minutes to find we got a bunch of 1km mr players in the team it's going someone wait did soulless and it is super dead though if you're cute at night I feel like that really should remove solo standard if I'm being honest like not enough people play it anymore if you look at the place already is only like a thousand people in it and that nighttime it's even worse I play this middle I didn't really want my teammate to do necessarily because it's a little bit risky but it's not a good pass to make I'll just kind of pop that stopped being patient with me they weren't gonna give it away so I wasn't trying to see if I can pop it up middle for my teammate killed one two three and go fifty boosts good patience that's fine horsemen hit a ride to my teammate side got a bump for I don't know how that's not a kill to be honest but it's fine didn't get scored under anything there we go they're super patient they're waiting on like much higher level stuff so you tell the people we're playing already getting better and better so I toss it down for a redirect to my teammate but it was stuff to be fair should come back to me on the force anything year October two and I got to kill that guy it touch to bring it up the wall obviously had this upward good some pressure again and three is literally just keeping it around them until they have no boots like here they're in a spot where they're gonna eventually give up a goal as long as my team keeps pressure because I see one of them are already trying to go for pads a lot trying to make up for the fact that they don't have any in the big boost right now so it's long to keep this ball in there it's gonna be weaker and weaker every time he's gonna have no [ __ ] to work with and we're getting kills as well so far my team doesn't make a big mistake here should really get a goal soon they're still low and they're going all in for this play trusting my team you on this touch I hit it around one I mean it's up the backward again for my team surprised he didn't like miss that thinking to go over there cuz I could have beat him to it nice touch she better go for this speed him off the wall beat him off the wall that's what I said don't quote me place forward on the corner I'm sitting you're free killa now nice I knew that he got middle eventually all you got to do is disrupt the the defense that can get there and like I said we still had the pressure they broke out very few times during that first half of the game didn't have many opportunities they have one shot I mean we only have two because I can't shoot on goal but we've had the ball in there half of the majority of the game for sure shuttle them here so I got the block which is good they have no threat on that now out of your back get some pads I'll get behind them he does get baggy just hit to the wall felt like four lanes around the opponent do you Canada to try to pass them there's so much challenging you like try your best just not to hit it into them so you don't get dumb stuff like that like the little things actually add up quite a lot you lose a 50 and sometimes that benchley gets you scored on the next 10 seconds so everything counts in rocket League every single touch location on that again hit in the one spot he wasn't that put that around that guy oh [ __ ] that forward good shot my teammate I got to go back now good job you in the way nice I got for this quick beat that guy to it okay I could have been really bad I'll shine I just have it plopped down in front of goal not quite there should be fun nice fall good job tough safe to make we got it give me a [ __ ] awaited lot super unlucky you should really go for a fifty that could die like that if you are lost but I got challenged only guy coming is gonna be a fifty at most if you're there so all you do is just fake fake to fifty and he's gonna give you the ball for free but we got it back there wasn't some spot to be in don't get me wrong where my teammate was there and again I could have even played a different I could have faked the second man but regardless I wouldn't have made it back in time so hard choice to make though and you don't have much time to make the choice should I meet this guy I heard one John so I handed over them nice you go back here SOT IBM good job my shitty game should be game so I'm gonna gotta control the ball you there's no real danger I don't need a panic there I'm in a good spot there we go got ourselves the Dubs we needed stayed alive it again my teammates played well they could have had quite a few more goals if they're in different positions but they still played well all around I think at least we finished off at 11:21 m-my we got a division up to a champion 1 division 4 so almost up the champ two and one step closer to grand champs so super productive video all round we actually gained like 50 MMR which is really solid so if we continue this way like five or six more videos already up to
