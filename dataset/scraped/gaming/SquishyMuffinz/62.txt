[Applause] it's a good day to be a gamer after two years of playing online in our houses we are finally playing in person we've got the teams all lined up and ready to go we've got the casters here just at the edge get it wrong camera get up and get loud it's game day welcome to the rocket league championship series fall major driven by ford let's talk about who is here because this i can't believe we're today in this this is the most international event we have ever had in the history of our esport we've most had four regions we have six here every one of these teams the best in rocket league the top dogs from the from all over the world i mean every single one of them is a storyline and of themselves question this weekend will be how does north america compare to europe because now we can actually settle the damn debate we don't have to sit on twitter and just throw missiles back at each other we can have the discussion and we can see who wins will europe and north america be the stronger region or will someone from oceania or australia come out and just annihilate everybody who knows what's actually going to happen but nrg versus era coming on your screens in just a moment our eternity will have to play out of their skulls in order to take down the big dogs ah man i you know i i don't know what to expect like there's so much that i you get expectations you have ideas of what could happen but then you go back and you start thinking about you know we haven't been on land in two years no like what does that throw into this uh what are these players feeling right now and these are not looking great these promising touches from nrg quickly get taken back era doing a very nice job of contesting a lot of the open looks guys starting to get these shots on net that one's on target and first the score is gonna be math from era eternity energy down zero to one 25 left on the clock i'm telling you man there's something weird about day ones of majors take the first game here in this best of five well well well interesting story right out the gate here a little bit of boost gonna try and take it low it looks like he's trying to get snipes to go high for it but doesn't fight he comes in able to make the save cross under the bar squishy there to finish it's only a matter of time finally they find what they've been looking for in game one justin will the double touch to the corner make it a triple all the way around and squishy is there to secure it on the opposite side just get started get the scoring going like what we saw with dig they did it quite nicely and all the opposite and a pinch a save and math will tie it up that one's going to ping-pong around a little bit of a little action here in front of the net matt tries to force it through but a great save crossbar over and matt coming back out of the net look for the shot and there's gonna be it no another goal line diving save from snipes keeps this game alive ot continues this is the strangest game number two for a major i think i've seen a long time it's just so it's it's just unexpected too the situation some of these saves like it it hasn't been like oh they're just oh there it is okay finally gonna go through justin finds the hole they eventually do break through the area eternity uh scramble fence is what i'm gonna call it because the defense isn't necessarily clean rotation every time we saw a save it was on the goal line last moment do or die have to make that touch and they just continued to find those saves back-to-back games in this series for a chance at a 2-1 lead repeatedly looking for that lower left corner too was nrg justin trying to come through get the solo play can't get it past math didn't have enough boost to rotate down and get to it in time and that one's just gonna fall in 11 seconds in garrett with the soft touch takes down game number three nrg is really just making their fans wait through this excruciating process and then they they show up in ot that's two ot's back to back where nrg have closed the deal 2-1 lead in the series and well that wasn't really an ot it was just kind of like everybody just shut up and play an extra 10 seconds threatening as it may be nrg looking poised for a first goal here in game four this one here gonna be on guards he brings it through the corner has some space nobody in front of him over snipes throws it up justin's there and that's the type of pass plays we're looking for a nice little give just a quick toss up from garrett here over the defender and justin always always ready to jump for just about any ball yeah they're looking to play them in that kind of man-to-man situation but they're also again it's their their field awareness is just a little bit higher it feels like they're finding the hole they're finding their way through the opponent more often than not just with little touches nothing crazy and again the boost expenditure on the aeroside each time they come down you'll see that they're doing you know almost self touches looking for a double touch off the backboard which turns into maybe i can get the read but not on this justin he'll solo his way through and uh a little 117 action for the day very fitting very fitting and with that nrg will win their first of the fall major nicely done all the way down to game four it looked a little bit shaky but with all that said it's a 3-1 win and well that's all you really need to secure it it's garrett the 3-0 and that's done nrg doing very nicely in their opening start here of the major and for fans cyberleaf breathe it's okay they won their opening match but all credit to error eternity for how they played that all the way to game four very easily could have been a five-game series let's talk about another team that has a very so two teams actually have very very good wins in general to be the last match of the day here for round two i am so pumped the general nrg going up against bds the two the the this is the story of rlcsx this is this is if we could have had an international finals that we would have been excited about in rlcsx this would have been these two teams and you can tell both teams really trying to get comfortable on the field find that rotation they're up against of course the juggernauts like you said and there's monkey moon to slip it under the defense for the first goal of the series love this play here from monkey moon extra pulls away from it and justin's left all by himself to try to get under that and justin took that 50 a little higher in for a treat ladies and gentlemen team bds versus nrg i can't get over this first few seconds here for nrg justin another 50 and gonna keep working towards bds territory here comes squishy if flippery said does he get it he had the follow up and it's in the back of the net squishy muffins the flippery set it's the first goal for nrg so much talk is about justin but look at that from squishy that was sick caught it off the ceiling got the flip reset right away it's justin a half or a midfield shot excuse me as a follow-up from garage he comes in extra back in the corner not the best touch and he got food she got two squishy on fire the accuracy is there the mechanics is there everything so far has been connecting guerchie left that shot squishy crashed in and found the perfect placement back to monkey moon here's a chance mark by eight gets the bump monkey boot comes back down and it saves off the crossbar for the next star collects the goal monkey moon doing so much work here you can see off the backboard mark by eight also took out the defender i thought this was just monkey moon doing so much work but no it's marked by eight getting the demo on the backboard that was crucial from squishy muffins to basically stall as much time as you possibly could and then every touch i mean on either side of the field it's just right back into the corner and it's hard it's hard it's hard to really get set up on offense when the play doesn't go the way you would oh this would be a boxer for monkey moon and bds get the first goal and i got to see this again it looked like there was a physical play from extra as he got the follow-up the touch off the backboard but then squishy was just a little bit late i'm not really sure what happened there energy just can't get comfortable a lot of these touches unanswered moving down the field finding themselves with that same issue that i was uh critiquing bds for where it's just one big clear nobody's there for a response and the boost is a factor check out monkey moon with this ridiculous shot monkey moon picks this one up got the pass back over to mark look at that shot right tough angle to hit that one off the post and take it away by garrett again but bds in full control in game number three mark keeps this one up back over to the corner more time off the clock it came out for free so justin takes it with three seconds day one has been crazy jorbi i don't really believe but there's definitely a chance off the corner justin he's had a rough game i'd say individually here in this series so far but maybe that goal will fill him with confidence i saw that back i believe it's something i don't know what i don't know what i saw that bounce go up and i was like this is it finally we've got something spicy extra up high challenging garrett's defense but it holds monkey moon cuts this one off oh my god justin mark wasn't expecting it and nobody got the touch and at what point do you not blame mark by because you expect justin of all players to get the touch and there he is to find contact he's been doing this all day long he does find the double tap and monkey moon secures the win for bds team bds take down nrg in four and nothing else winning goal he was flying all around the pitches like there were two of them you usually expect nrg to win those but i i would again i agree at peak i think i just we haven't seen it and i want to i anyone knows most of the desks usually in the rlcs are our energy fans they're guaranteed fans they they love uh that this guy is still so strong one thing endpoints really got going for it is nrg has faced a lot of talent in their time together they haven't faced a player quite like seiko the way he took over and dominated in the european split second to none in the region but hasn't been that sako here at land if he comes alive nrg gonna have a rough go of it zeko shot here saved away follow up brought right back in seiko shot score seiko the man we've all been hyping up grabbing the first goal in this best of five of the beautiful touch there from metzinaris from the side that's clinical good cut there i like the heads up nrg not rushing towards anything they can get control that'll be their first priority it is difficult though endpoints moving fast in the air squishy wide to try and set up justin but it's going to be garagey all alone at the back with mets norris bearing down on him nrg struggling to clear the zone for any appreciable amount of time justin up high got the read justin's back gets tied nrg answers back nicely look at this speed from justin how do you read this around in front justin lets it go garrett g for the win and the captain can't score follow-up saved away and squishy unable to end it there he said a few opportunities to put this game away in the second half and into overtime now justin good ball out to midfield but metzanoris ready quickly conserved his boost seiko now picked his spot almost scored here's mezza endpoint takes game one beautiful precision from metzinaris he had so many defenders from energy in the way garrett and justin had that entire left side covered he had to put it off the far post and he does metzinaris a minute 42 and they take it just a little bit quicker and those split seconds matter messinoris has seiko land offense is a thing too big demolition but she's still with the save seiko for relating wave what a pass what a play what a team the ot winner placed far right in the game two opener placed far right squishy trying to outlet for garrett g now seiko zako gonna take this himself and justin up there to meet him didn't let him get the shot off boom downfield justin's not gonna be able to get to this in time take over the challenge that was squishy taking it into his own hands far side and he scores squishy finally on the board hey just because your defense was struggling doesn't mean your offense has to as well good read from squishy he beats out relating wave he was close seiko shot trying to generate a rebound relating wave couldn't play that any further though as garrett wins this back to the endpoint half of the field down to a minute 10 to try and level this game at two goals a piece mezza drop that back for relating wave this is trouble seiko all alone and saved by the post now here goes seiko looking to take advantage of the nrg defense drop down for relating wave off the rebound mess senoris is there another clutch goal from mezza tied game almost a set up there from seiko's justin that actually cleared that one down center honestly hasn't been the hardest thing in this series but they were trailing justin big drive and immediately nrg answers as they continue to score in punches in game two good touch from squishy i like justin's speed that's what we want to see relating wave again trying to drop this in front and squishy has that clear too seiko near the mark easily dealt with by justin that's a great passo towards seiko didn't quite lead him far enough and now nrg will try to burn away the final 10 seconds garrett g almost reluctantly coming on to play that ball justin up high looking to score here this is what you want to see out of justin 1v3 get out of my way beautiful dunk those defenders had no chance at nrg take a two goal lead with two seconds left they're gonna tie up the series one to one assists have been a talking point for many of these series here at lan we've seen so many great individual efforts that's the first goal without an assist in this series justin making it happen all on his own to put that game away emphatically nrg ties the series relating wave clean win got seiko trailing behind this will angle downward and sent away by justin metza had to stay way back a little slow getting up the side wall and rg gonna make him pay it's just it again from squishy justin is gonna carry on his momentum from the first one great setup halfway mark endpoint sure are holding in but they've not been able to find any true threatening shots they've been stuck trying to poke from that midfield so nrg's definitely done a lot better job of making sure endpoint can't find an offense that they've certainly found their own offense and who is it but none other than justin again with the goal it's just not fair not at this point one win away from dispatching endpoint here in the third round man this was a different tale in game one we saw energy struggling on that defensive half not that easy but i i do think trying to take away those back corners from nrg that boost is going to be important and um looks like two minutes already passed it and all right up a goal ah i see we have decided to apply the all handicaps for nrg justin's so good we've given n4 to go we'll find out exactly who scored that in a moment as we are halfway through our fourth game a game that endpoint has to win to avoid dropping to one and two actually just by process of elimination i'll tell you it's probably seiko i think it's seiko why wouldn't it be here i mean that's the same and that will seal it for endpoint they go to game five yeah i didn't expect this one to be a quick series in all honesty you talked about this being a coin flip you're absolutely right and we're seeing that going to a game five now justin's picked up the pace endpoint has at least quieted justin for a game now we go to champions field does mezza have the ice canseco come alive his shot is through sitting on the goal line then how many goal line situations have we seen at the sweden major seiko comes down and finishes this one off by himself and this is why endpoint is looking so good they got a solid team with a solid point man in seiko where she to the heaven he's got garrett g all the way across his shot on the money and we're immediately tied up in five this has been a battle of justin versus seiko but justin doesn't want all the credit beautiful pass but garrett g good clear this might be an old goal it is dangerously close to the net what a save by relating wave remember that touch that set this up as endpoint just barely gets out of trouble and then relating wave turns it into a goal if that ain't a counter attack i don't know what is beautiful touch from metsanaras to make sure that squishy had no idea how that was going to bounce out but that attacker was out of boost past the halfway mark nrg in game five still can't find that tying goal nrg has caught a few breaks here in game five they have not cashed in on those opportunities justin gonna take this through himself they're letting wave got a piece and this is just gonna find its way in metro norris couldn't catch up and justin ties the game from way downtown who got that demo on the far side i missed it but that opened up the defensive house it was squishy and garrett g over the top of relating wave and nrg can finally clear the zone had to be up quick was metro adjusted in the air and this water falls down this is dangerous end point for the lead it's seiko seiko versus justin is the story of this match back and forth endpoint taking the lead a minute left he's always there for the setup or the cleanup by the youngster seiko the rookie sensational here in game five even game four against nrg can end point pull it off with five seconds empty and garrett g comes through a small opening for a brief moment opens up on the endpoint defense and garrett g finds the only slot it could be put and ties it up 3-3 with three to go nrg's kickoffs have been lethal another opportunity relating with got it down this and does alpha went to overtime the omega in overtime as well game five on champions field stacks there is no way this could have been anything other than a game five over time this is incredible you are the best in the world going out of here in the third round one will be one win away from the top eight the other will be a loss away from being knocked out of the major it is a cruel cruel format most are justin couldn't get around on this seiko and mezza ken but that's pushed wide was a dangerous approach opportunity after opportunity there leaf endpoint probably having nrgs watching the series flash before their eyes what a clear by justin with relating wave coming down and now squishy lob up for justin no sir seiko the better of the two this time for a minute overtime both teams having scoring opportunities my hands are raised behind my head right now because this is as tense as it can get for either these teams a 2-1 record would be beautiful as you mentioned this swiss is unforgiving once you get to this stage straight win by garrett g conserve some boost as well now he's out and gonna have a tough time finding more metzanoris this is that off to the side justin brought it in front it's on the goal line but squishy could not finish the crossbar denies nrg justin thought about it he has to retreat thought the last moment it was deco that had him beat and now what a win by remembering wave and point off the steal by relating wave are now two and one it almost ends how it started squishy leaving the net just a little bit too soon opens up that lane for end point and they steal it away from justin and end point come out victorious in a game five over time we got one more to go between two teams we did not expect to be talking about at this stage vitality taking on nrg both teams sitting at one and two loser goes home this is crazy we need to beat energy because if we lose we are out of the tournament so of course we need to win we're gonna have to beat vitality and beat another team today if we want to go to the playoffs game i versus energy is to voltage a bit because it's not like this and to bump a lot at the end of the day like you can't overthink it you just have to play your game we feel really good today so i think today we are the best team we do feel pretty confident today uh we have to feel confident today like i was saying because if we lose any games we're actually out of the event already i think they might get a game or two off of us but with confidence and teamwork we can take it today we are gonna win fatality here just based off the strength of the performances that we've seen so far and already a shot coming out from nrg they thought it did they've had a tough run of swiss as well you don't go one and two in swiss without having some problems but justin make sure there's no problem on that goal immediately shouting nice as soon as that goal goes in as well justin starting off the scoring exactly how he wants to but that mistouch from fairy peak that's the assist that they needed they squeeze out a win they managed to get it that's the reason why they are here today and they didn't join tokyo birdie down in that note on three vitality need to run off that confidence know that they can beat these south american teams that have dominated previously but squishy right place right time goal number two that was a tough one for vitality to contend with that's a perfect bounce for squishy and alpha rushing back was hoping that fairy peak would get a decent clear out of it but it kicked out right on the opposite side of vitality right near the bottom kade up somewhere in the middle of the pack and despite the fact that alpha has done those brilliant brilliant performances it just means that he is going to have to be carrying from the top garrett g getting three for north america vitality lost a couple of wheels on this play that ball bounced right over kdop's boat right off of his hood position to steal the ball away from vitality as soon as they start to bear down on that blue net they're starting as they mean to go on and they are looking very mean justin what a fake my goodness what a dominant start from nrg like you said justin's starting off well that punch was squishy in the little stutter step from justin to get at rg the fourth goal pitches it across and you talk about alpha and his significance to this vitality roster it's not just at the land that alpha's been performing but all fall he has been putting vitality in a position to be in what does it matter i mean justin just can't stop scoring we've had half of the game nrg dismantling vitality we normally save that call for game number five if it's a 3-0 whatever we're two and a half minutes in jorbi fairy peak tips this one up and you're already thinking game with two minutes left you're already thinking nrg this is the best position you could possibly be in but if your vitality how do you stop this attack garrett g gets the sixth one they're smashing them what is happening this is vitality this is the season eight world championship grand finals and this is the performance from nrg never seen a more confident start than that against a former world champion against the only other world champions here in this tournament in sweden the general nrg kicking off this series by kicking vitality hard it's just that the defense from nrg was holding so firm and vitality saves were near non-existence that first minute looked promising from vitality in game one they had good passes in the attacking third and then it's a blunder from vitality justin gets a freebie heartbreaking if you're a vitality fan watching that one roll so devastatingly close but justin getting the dunk fairy pig watches it trickle into the orange net an rg one away from eliminating vitality i cannot overstate how much better that was from vitality though they may not have had quite as many shots only racking up six in total but the fact they did not get six owed i want to count that as a positive and meanwhile over here nrg and vitality two stalwart teams and it's nrg putting it in the back of the net gary g on top the most animated man at the moment as he goes up from his own half spends the boost gains a goal from it that's an investment that is going to pay dividends later on and a good 50 as well but vitality there's no immediate follow-up ready they gotta wait for squishy he pops it over k-dop forces alpha to make the play squishy again in front of the box he's got justin and he squeezes it through three defenders and rg just keeps scoring two nil minute one and it's just an error from fairy pig starts to go for the ball and then decides not to threading that needle through vitality for nrg 10 seconds left and it feels like it might be a victory and that's just the exclamation point on top of an incredible performance a perfect sweep for nrg nobody expected that to happen nobody saw this matchup and thought it would be anything less than brilliant from both sides with everything on the line nrg were the only team with any amount of pressure that they could deliver and they have utterly dismantled vitality i'm gonna use the word embarrassing because that was dreadful from vitality but i also want to lift up nlg because my god did they look good and who would have thought energy would be having to defend i'm having to fend off one more team here of course it had to be torsos it's got to be he's of course he's tweeted at him as well he's i think i remember the exact wording but he's called out garrett g he's 2-0 against him trying to go with three in a row i don't know the energy looked pretty phenomenal earlier on today beating ground zero would be would be huge for us getting top eight would be uh super important for for qualifying for worlds later down the line so it's uh it's pretty important and i'm the guy say of course i'm going to be puffing up i guess the names just because i beat him twice and then that's sort of sort of a bit of a name i guess no i don't think he's in my head you can keep the name the guarantee slayer you know it makes me feel special you know that someone cares so i like it gotta save the garrett play of 3-0 this ground zero squad has earned the respect and we might see some fireworks yes it would not be the first time and there is a decent amount of potential i mean they're right anfus has played well horsehacks has consistently been a top performer in the oceanic region and as well only bro open the door it's ground zero and it's none other than ampus that young gun coming out of oce off the side wall punching it dead center and rg gearing up on the attack the ground zero defense holding firm for now justin taking time around one leaves it for another garrett didn't want to commit everything to that play and that one's going to sneak in underneath the crossbar surprised that one got through uh so uncontested i mean expressed in torsos both just kind of following the ball here and express i think just read the spacing on that challenge a little differently they're playing pretty solid defense against an nrg that while not pressing i think as hard as we know they can they are making them uh really go through the paces i would say on defense and make sure that there's no gaps there in the fundamentals of it but nrg has been able to keep possession squishy flip reset air dribble that was amazing from squishy well it says make sure there's no gaps in the fundamentals can you defend the flippery set plus the extra touch not quite despite getting that first goal ground zero find themselves fighting from behind squishy to garrett a banger top shelf tough one to handle here for ampus you see this outlet pass here justin able to just straight beat torsos torsos thinking they've got justin on the ropes and that just shows you don't play enough against justin but again we see some nice set pieces off the kickoff from ground zero it's that type of attention to detail that it's going to take to beat a mechanically talented team like nrg oh jeez that's not even oh that is classic nrg attack right there beat the man squishy flip across justin bieber's house off the goal line garrett g keep away as they recover and then when they're finally out of option and you know they want it as johnny said it has not been a clean swiss stage for nrg justin making a clean save a real big opportunity here for torsos gonna deliver get him right back into the mix two goals down two minutes remaining and a nice quick goal uh go at the offense for ground zero here and that that play from ampus catching the ball in the corner dribbling it up a nice middle game there for nrg and if your torso is there you gotta deliver in that opportunity his nrg doesn't give you too many holes like that one as emphasis almost able to convert the flip reset now it's a race between squishy and garrett they're gonna go right out oh and he's gonna turn it in squishy out of booze seemingly out of options but the save comes down right at him torsos needed to keep that higher needed to get that out of the clutches of squishy muffins literally anywhere but where he put it rg move up 2-0 in the series not an easy one again i actually feel like ground zero to be honest played the better game here they definitely held a lot more pressure just able to give the ball a little tip oh nrg unable to break down ground zero what a stand the goal line stand from ground zero will it be enough the slow play shut down from justin pass over to squishy squishy shoots low he read the defense like a book you're absolutely right this was all about placement here you can see express just on the start of that replay rotating hard into the near post and you really have to value that communication and that approach on defense to not panic it's real easy to do against a team like nrg as oh why does it go in with nobody up for it we'll take another look on the replay you see express tipping it out and decided to stay on the back wall giving too much space only half of the equation you've got to be a complete team to beat him and the offense just hasn't been able to bring the arms to bear here under a minute left to play ground zero their defense holding up but they need some offense right away another shot will be good for nrg justin putting energy up three to nothing it looks like they have this one in the pack of cheese it's looking that way three up 48 seconds ground zero really have made them work for their meal though they had a rough start they got run through the ringer but in the end they fought through and made it past the swiss stage and into the playoffs and much like you see many teams qualifying here for the major doesn't really matter how you end up there and nrg kind of have the same route to make the playoffs tomorrow so an awkward run but it's done and they're through and that's all that counts and ground zero and of course justin clearly happened to give squishy a big hug he did play well yeah can you question the team chemistry from nrg this is this is juicy folks you got no idea what you're in for here versus semper complexity versus bds phase versus endpoint and sand rock gaming taking on the number one seed from north america nrg that that top side of the bracket is stacked with eu teams so i think we're pretty much guaranteed an eu team in the final bro i've you know johnny i'm supposed sad i'm so sad for you you you complexity is about to rinse the entire european lineup i would be that's all right because sandra's got a rid said hey so it works out honestly i don't like calling one team the best in a matchup like this i think it's it's too close to call to be honest might be the boring answer but i think genuinely they're an incredible team they match us in skill i think everyone knows that i'm a squishy fanboy i've been trying to play the way he does and i'm really looking forward to playing against him and yeah i can't wait to catch some dubs it's going to be a very hard match so at this point it's going to come down to how we play when we get on stage i want to beat an idea so badly uh because you know we don't we not only represent sandra gamer but also the region as a whole all right sorry i mean no no it's respectable it's respectful whenever you see someone predict against north america you suddenly seem like it's a it's a dig again it's like a part he's he's not a party but i respect it i i genuinely respect it this is a tough one even for me the you know i'm i watch the general nrg all the time like to the point where i call them the general i don't have to call them there you know i'm gonna need some help i'm gonna need some help we gotta call i gotta call in some help is there anyone around that can help me make this prediction exclamation point help oh daz can you hear me yeah i i hear you must yeah uh north america you know they're looking good now they're only two teams left and i gotta love my boys at nrg but right i saw a youtube video about sanerock page it was a really good video going sandrock on this one musty are you you're right sir oh well i think thank you musty appreciate you okay we're doing it i'm all in i guess let's go let's get in the final quarter finals sugar you speak for all of us here fans of great rocket league fans of teams that are i think some of the most popular in the world as well welcome to the most tight match of the day in my opinion although you know everybody knew that already and i think we all saw that youtube video by someone's gone so it's tough not to root against but justin dad said he's the person to rely on for nrg and he gets a hot start they've been waiting to play against justin and justin is gonna let them know that sometimes your dream should remain only that dominant in 5050s against g2 earlier in the tournament that's something that energy i've got to look out for but one thing that we've seen even in the other series is that now that we're on the final stage of this tournament the playoffs so shuts me up with a gorgeous goal if justin shot was a rocket this was something even further beyond senzo makes garrett merely a spectator booming clear from senzo squishy not the best first touch trk lying in wait and now it's slam rock gaming's turn at least there was temporarily there's the opportunity would have been covered nonetheless by senzo minute and a half gone what a great first game this has been and it has only been the first game you just wonder who's going to have that huge moment here's garagey simple shot saved by ahmad you've got to go simple sometimes now it sends those turn he's looking at one defender well done from the man on the recovery demo in him from behind helping out his goalkeeper uncanny speed still that's safe from ahmad he was up so quick he might have even pre-jumped that reading where that shot was coming in the srg defense on the goal line is sustaining all this pressure from nrg who's had a majority of the possession but still so closely match and now a chance for senzo gonna be shut down justin he's got targets downfield goes underneath okay by himself [Applause] [Music] game number one with a field full of all-stars justin first to pop off stanzill had to expect the double tap there from justin mickey well really our trip let me thank you by the air dribble as well but it was actually garrett following up with the top left finish that gives nrg the win oh team bump garrett if he had any more boost he still might be able to make something of this drops over to justin gaming will be disappointed at the lead up to this goal it looks like amma just wasn't paying attention to his teammates position trk completely out of boost try to roll the ball up the back wall it bounces off and that's all nrg needed but for sand rock what we're seeing is some really they're trying to go coming off a bit panicked and you can see it even on defense two go and justin will get another one for nrg justin really on farm today he's in the right position is that predator instinct arriving at the right time picks his spot as well ahmad he had a brilliant save earlier on in the tournament but i know even he can get around that i have seen from sam rockwear it really looks a bit toothless in offense that was the first one where nrg had times where they were under pressure but no real goal scoring opportunities he's really been on farm today and you know taser and putting it about as perhaps you know a player who can just dominate the series which i'm sure everyone would agree with but also a player that you're not really sure of this event now here is garrett chief drop him within what his favorite drk center's gonna be faster than he is oh man how much bruce has he got left he's also went up that's the shot back there is the goal i mean you can't blame sandrock for trying look at that first effort blocking out the shot but then that touchdown it doesn't get any better than that from nrg also they're doing a phenomenal job handling the solo plays and nrg this is them in championship form all these players have won a world championship garrett and justin oh hello joe sneaking this one in under the bar that is so much better from san rock and deft is your life oh my god senzo didn't need to put it behind squishy actually i think he did but you still seem to have it covered they need to do so much more here energy still backing off consistently sandra need to be careful not to overextend but energy look at them just looking for them i'm not gets a second for siderock that bump let's take another look at it garrett thinking he's gonna have a chance no way ahmad from the sky launching it down well if you're sick of the goal line defense be sure that there is chance for garrett g goes high here's the follow-up denied by sandra senzo being able to get up and block out the angle he couldn't get a touch on the ball but he blocked out the angle a lot over nrg oh yeah squishy trying to get another setup senzo again clogged the lane now we have a shot it's in two each and justin will do what took energy oh so very long to accomplish that was valiant by srg but well struck by justin predicting the pre-jump something sand rocker very known for in defense instead this is the one that he wants one gone oh already get the demo on one that's gonna leave over trk that was dangerous when you pop in that position you're potentially leaving your net open now no more pressure anymore what's a touch i mean not like he had many options energy still piled on oh what a demo squishy takes out the defender right as he's about to save the shot nrg giving sanrok a taste of their own medicine squishy on the prowl and see you later that was going to be another save nrg one game away from the suite and even in those last moments you're seeing how clinical squishy is with his touches defensively that time just trying to get that clock to hit zero it's chocked right that's how they're going to turn this one around but great to see energy on farm we have been a bit wishy-washy this weekend but the form continues good start by sandro come on with a goal steal to go one up a game for perhaps patting the stats a little bit coming in unite you take them just take your time and for me johnny oh wait a second that's actually going to be trickling yeah it is sensor i'll give him that he knew exactly that one but you know when you look at a game like this i think the 50 50 game you would typically give to sam rock but what nrg do better is they set the rules for that 50 every single time you are playing into them and squishy is playing nrg towards that semi-finals look at the formation from nrg squishy in the back pose denying the clear trk hitting a bit too far out into the middle and there's absolutely no way let's see what she's gonna miss from there senzo with the clear nobody's aim for he just wants to try and chase it down finally a little bit of breathing room for sam rock ahmad so trk garage sniping the ball out of mid-air not allowing anything to develop for cenrock gaming oh my justin being able to keep control of the ball like this when you've got people pre-jumping you miles ahead is simply unreal he really is on form at the moment another thing nrg have done so well is adapting to the duchess justin gets another one for them 2-1 to the general nrg garrett forcing a bad touch and justin beating out he's trying to turn around and get in the way of the ball trk spot senso tries to get there and squishy has been unbelievable this series once again far too big to get past what to save now 33 seconds for sandro they've created chances they haven't taken any of them nrg are denying them again and again now you're crk he walks it in sandrock tie the game and you can see justin trying to work with low boost he's side flipped to the wall trying to get another challenge on it but trk sniffing out the defense nicely picking it apart to send us to overtime sandro gaming hold on energy still want that sweep they do not want to give sandro any foothold in this series you know this is a dangerous team we start from complexity earlier against bds starting the comeback nrg don't want any of that oh a nice set but senzo will clear it out senzo trying to be a hero pass out off target i'm out now task with keeping the pressure on he's got no support for the time being he's just going to try and buy his team time get them back in position here's the shot gonna be high first one to it trk ahmad next up on the plate energy turning wisely when they can when they've got chances trying to keep the pressure on sand rock you haven't had the best players in this game that's what energy are looking for jrk leaves it senzo unable to guide the ball past garrett looking for the chance here instead testing trk who does pass with flying colors senzo has the ball go underneath him now the transition from squishy oh this could be it trk has to get a good stop rebound will come out oh backboard denied wonderfully by trk that is a big boom in the you saw a vod there wanting to take that shot yeah squishy knew better than to let him have one garrett looked like he was lining up so much momentum for that 50 but his tent pack the other way san rock providing resilience in the last stand i just saw our entire desk just lean back like a gust of wind and caught them off guards closer and closer could be edging towards the end of this series good pinch from senzo everybody from the general energy are back in position not the best touch muhammad trk gonna just chase down needs to keep this one going he's done exactly that not only was that a tough read but to get that second touch after boosting out that was massive to buy more time for sandrock okay midfield ahmad does win the chase oh okay leaving it is justin garrett by himself you can see the swarm of blue around oh we'll be so happy to see that in oh the grin on the ark is the face that's that you that roll into the open net that must have been the most nervous open that he's ever had to hit but he put it safely down the middle as you always should sandra gaming put one on the board small but vital win for san rock gaming it's going to slow energy down in the long run i mean you know senza knows there's no point throwing himself at a wild block from that range you might as well drive a higher demo big chance for srg denied by squishy another follow-up shot from trk and that one will make it one nil ah things are starting to get interesting sandrock awaken a weak shot and that was just what you said johnny just throw a shot in force the rebound and a quality goal you know sends us a regular and a long time subscriber to another famous rock league player jesse and he must have thought that so he's up against there it's not a squishy thing to do to save his own shot 45 seconds left stand right trying to hold on open that and then it goes off all of the hits senzo could have got this was the very worst of them and he had to react quickly because justin the speedy boy again being a thorn in the sign of sand rock gaming not going to get one this time against nrg another overtime and another chance for nrg to clutch that semi-final spot but san rock they've seen nrg bleed they know they can be beaten and you see the bloodbath out on the field demos from squishy he's been aggressive will that be the difference maker but they see they said they seen them believe they also just saw their live talk fly before their eyes that was not what sandra wanted to see so late rnrg moving into this ball senzo pass to himself doesn't get too much more but this might be the position who's there first against sarok they do not want to commit in those positions because their play that they want is a little bit cleaner than what they're getting i have to invest so much just to create a chance no one's there to finish it very often energy defending oh no brilliantly oh you're doing it and ahmad reads the fake very well comes back down garrett lands on his own touch here ahmad ceiling double out of defense happy to use mechanical plays to get the ball out of that end of the field as well big chance for garuchi again senzo's on the backboard waits for the bounce confidence for srg still a bit too long of a clear there from senzo boom ball back and forth a lot of times you see that happening when neither team wants to be that first one to take a risk garrett takes a shot almost in again sandrock barely escaping with their tournament lives i'm at called into action fast side pass nobody around from sarah you can see how this situation starts again they don't want to go for all the time of the second game ladies and gentlemen have got ourselves a real quarterfinal on our hands trk remember the name sandrock take two straight in ot and suddenly a series that looked inevitable for nrg is in the balance it's the ball away energy are just clearing at the moment waiting for that big pass into the middle there it is squishy i want to save trk pops it to the corner as well of course it's trk it's always trk the man has got no bounds to the saves that he can create yeah cedrock gaming maintain nil nil and i blinked and i missed it we've got a minute left oh see our kid can prove that they need up comes another shot payed to the other side you can see there's blue cars everywhere everybody's gone oh man he's got the time to set up can he find it no garrett is back on the field oh this is unrelenting from sandro nrg on the back foot they're holding on that's a brilliant 50 by justin buying energy sometime this has been devastating for nrg low boost trying to survive that double demo which was resulted in all this position and power and that would mean the pre-jump gonna give nrg a chance squishy oh oh but knocked by another still the attack going on trk has to get a good hit how comfortable oh my god every single time he let the ball bounce down before taking it take his time as well how much boost can central gaming hold on to now they're the ones feeling the pressure i don't want to go the easy way another ot is just seconds away energy with three seconds left he's that guy justin with a big time goal in our jeep how many times do they have to do it now look out for the sand rock kick-off strats they've got many in their back pocket what's it gonna be let's take a look then three seconds two seconds one second senzo has to avoid being hit he's still being headed that trk provides the assist can they keep this alive now still in the air but there it is huge dunk for nrg finish of the series that was a lot closer than i think it looked two games ago nrg guaranteed the n a versus eu grand final wow speechless gaming they did not make that easy for energy we are definitely a different team from the first time we faced him i think we've adapted more to like the the very physical gameplay it's important for us to win against energy so we can show that we're the best in north america to be honest going into this match of course i want to be in the final trying to beat eu but if faze is a better team i want the best best na team on the day representing na i'm confident that we will be energy in terms of just play style and how we've adapted over the the course of the season i think we're gonna match up a lot better than we did in the past first real chance of the game for nrg maybe getting a bit jumpy on offense but they do retain possession squishy in front actually loses the ball hard pass over to aj plays it slow and around the floor off the crossbar the ball still hanging around from the box another bump for first killer but guarantee gets the clear close call for nrg to be sure but i'm gonna have to expect a little more almost converted by elusion soft floater across the net and the bump on squishy is going to take him off it's just been back and forth for faze clan you can see they're taking shots every single angle you get presented one opportunity and then rotate back in to get another one and this has been faze clan just on slotting all these shots for nrg's defense good win in phases third to get them back to the blue half so time here for nrg but they can't wait too long squishy hard work there's just a downfield already look at this massive clear here from nrg i believe it was squishy he got under the ball absolutely dusted that defender and justin is cherry-picking all the way down the field it's a free shot for him big goal for nrg they had a couple of chances early couldn't convert they're finally on the board justin on the kickoff back over to garrett playing a hard kick over to justice and the shot denied by first killer but here comes squishy and rg have the lead you fail that one was gonna come out like you said turtle what a pass is right from garrett g it just absolutely freezes first killer forces him to stop that rotation of the net has to defend the potential to put it on target or think maybe i can go and get the bounce and that's why he hits the brakes faze clan pretty flat on offense i mean the first game against endpoint they were hitting him with some of the quickest passes i think we've seen all tournament long that time fizzled out a bit and nrg with massive clears i'm take it out on an air dribble waste a little extra time make sure again they get ready for phase coming out and that play actually started from the white right side of the wall and then again in the corner face clan come alive where were nrg that is a great question okay there's two as justin they both double committed in the midfield and justin i understand the logic of him wanting to go for it and they try to make use of it unfortunately for them they don't get a shot on net it looked threatening but garrett g along with the nrg squad do hold on and you do find yourself in kind of an interesting position here oh aj with the big muscles on that one how did he squeeze through this i don't understand the follow-up i didn't even get a flip reset this man just held down the boost and it worked face clamp bounce back so easily here they haven't even lost a game one yet in their series they just lost to nrg the first time and then they bounced back in a wonderful way haven't even let one in oh oh double tap it looked a little bit awkward at first but he made the most of it getting nrg on the board asking you shall receive i was waiting for it yeah well this time justin's got a little extra space to work with and what a touch on the backboard faze you know stop the nrg attack this kickoff first killer tries to protect the rock but he lost it justin gets two devastating here for the defense you see first killer he's trying to get that soft lift so he can take it out on an air driver oh comes down just a little low on the car goes out real flat so he can't get behind nrg have certainly looked like they were in championship form against san rock and while there's been some tough sequences at times on defense able to battle back and get the tying goal now guaranteed from justin nrg three unanswered cleared so much space here on this push up the pitch justin gets into the corner forces aj to make a touch and immediately cuts towards the goal line to put the pressure on the goalies they both have to die yeah it's been we've got one strong push up the field and we've converted it yeah and phase with a minute here very likely they can find themselves pushing to find an equalizer it's been big misses from both sides we saw first first killer earlier but then a couple a couple of miss touches from nlp as well aj go face clap tie it up it looked like this was an initial fake you could see aj took this ball into the air got the flip reset justin has to respect it and aj broke everybody's axle now jorbi i talked a lot about the indicators for nrg and what you need to expect we need to look forward to know they're doing well in the pitch it's the same for aj on the other side the shooting percentage speaking of shooting percentage and accuracy this one from squishy in the corner you simply cannot doubt squishy this weekend he has been popping off for nrg he steals the ball away in the corner and hits the wide angle banger nrg will take forbidden temple they were just so passive at the end you saw gary g on his perspective he was staying in net waiting he was even getting harassed but he didn't care he had boost he could remain in the net keep it slow and make sure they secure this one closing it out two to nothing in the series absolutely you're gonna have a little time here this one's gonna get you into the corner we've got four minutes might as well go on but aj he is the indicator for phase class there's so many 50 50s if aj is striking well and the shooting percentage is up for him that is when face cleaner are at their best against endpoint he was shooting i believe 40 shooting accuracy every time i talk about accuracy squishy comes in and it's a nailer oh this is big from nrg pick getting the big bump jump takes first killer out of the play and elusion tried to recover but that shot was just too well placed and that was a tough pass to defend faze will keep possession but can they get another quality opportunity that's a tight rotation and squishy and garrett work to keep that ball away elusion he left them to all drop first killer why oh nets you got a little worried here you're thinking man nrg is having to work real hard to get around all this pressure and then finally a window and you're thinking oh no but you can only go so far and be unlucky they were gonna figure out a way to get the save from nrg but face then they have the recovery the rotation comes through but you've already got this nrg offense to deal with oh phase they had a good pass but nrg says they could do one a little better look at this pass from squishy to justin it's not even fair i mean if squishy takes that shot almost certainly gets the bloater and good save from illusion but now here's your question for faze there you go you need that nice strong clear there it is hold on to it here you have to find a way to keep nrg locked into their own hats aj delivers for faith aj you mad man the 50-50 absolutely demolished the defender and then aj the shooting accuracy oh gosh i don't even know how you get around that ball that far show a crack in their armor but it doesn't work out potential for overtime here for phase and this is a real chance to make a big difference that passed likely behind guarantee they're like forget ot make them work for it faze try to send everybody at this ball and they get punished for it both illusion and asian go first killer gets deleted and nrg take the lead there's just so many moving parts to that play but a match point this shouldn't be happening aj looks insane did we see the shot that he had how do nrg keep on pulling off these close wins with barely any few seconds left nrg are really trying to one-up that other semi-final performance to really make you think about who's going to win that ball or win that but first killer he's got something to say this match is not all uh let him cook him why don't you illusion that's a great challenge and first killer such a good understanding of where that play was developing cutting out nice and early to the right and then just turns it into a nice little yeah i saw it happening i saw it happening 100 gary g the shot was there but fortunately faze clan the defense has found their footing level of speed you cannot intercept it oh we got it for free okay and i'm so glad aj is deep back there i was like so surprised to see faze just let justin continue to push gonna find its way into the back of the net for first killer and nrg pull off on this play it's a great pop from first killer what is that she's racing back to net that flick from first killer went straight to the ceiling there was like no accuracy just like i'm gonna i'm gonna flip this as hard as i possibly can and hope something works out then you get the fake from i believe it was aj in the midfield and then don't you have to respect it another good start for phase oh and now oh my god that good start away squishy right off the kickoff what okay so first killer gets his own touch off the ceiling squishy says yeah i'd do it too but i make it a little easier it's a little easier he got greedy he uh i don't discredit what first killer was trying to do there but it definitely was a risky play squishy a little bit of space nrg pushing forward and i have to let that one drop aj back over to first traffic he's got the goal all on garrett g here going for this challenge in the corner and he just doesn't have the right read the transition comes too quick and squishy's thinking oh it's going to be hard and you can already tell from the line from first killers taking that ball with the smash off the backboard i just don't think he got the power behind it here's justin kind of create an opportunity for nrg garrett gets a free look that bump put both phase players on the back wall both illusion and first killer oh what a fake big 50 in front justin hard shot from squishy they do no chance anastasia they do this so often nrg know how to be selfless know when to go for the 50 50 and know how to set each other up for success what are you supposed to do there is first killer just jump and pray for first killer phase they've been able to respond a couple of times now to nrg but the longer the series goes the more what america feels like what an nrg top slot top floor top slot this is ridiculous the 50 50s have shifted the rolls have been reversed nrg they're winning every challenge oh man and first killer he's not really playing that too poorly to be honest now's the time to convert now's where you send the house you need everyone to step up here for phase any kind of opportunity anything you can do to break past this nrg defense they need to try it something has to break this nrg line passing front and a big first killer can they get the transition no not the best touch first kill will make the most of it off the ceiling and guarantee is going to take it squishy so fast up to the ball he's got the first shot he's got the second touch squishy muffin puts nrg on by two the last thing that you want to do is give squishy muffins on land some space off the backboard because he's gonna make you look silly could feel it coming 15 seconds for faze they need to score with time left garrett g up high again first killer got him out of the way but it's a big clear and more time off the clock for nrg they could do a victory lap the time off the clock the ball in the net energy to the grand final you had to put him down finish it with an exclamation point you can't go in the montage there was one second on the clock but honestly what a series from nrg turtle i mean it's just been a roller coaster of emotions we if we want to look at the history so far in this tournament for nrg they started off in horrible shape but they bounce back and they do it in style we got the bracket this is how the teams got here you see the three spots after that final there they had to win two best of seven so get your marathon shoes on we're heading in it's time to meet bds it feels great to be in the grand finals feels unreal just to play against one of the best teams in the world it feels good to be in a lan since two years to see everyone every players every team that you play against online nobody got the touch and at what point do you not blame mark bailey because you expect justin of all players to get the touch and there he is to find contact the games were very intense a lot of matches a lot of stress and uh yeah they were good games [Music] i think we found a great motivation during this major as a team so we are definitely happy with the result i'm just also very happy to to play energy in the finals it's kind of like a dream coming true like playing the best of the best in the finals i think it's very good to have a eu versus na finals everyone is waiting for it so i think it's gonna be a good match [Music] it feels amazing to be in the finals it's been so long since we've had a land and you know two years and the first one back we ended up making it this far it's just something that you can't even explain it's just a great feeling of excitement the competition has surprised me a lot we had to adjust after our first few matches and it feels like we've caught up but the level is the highest it's ever been for sure [Music] i feel like our journey was honestly the weirdest one i've ever had in atlanta in the beginning it was a little bit shaky for three of the best land players that ever played this game it's you know not expected but the experience didn't play as much of a factor as we thought it would so i think that it's just been a odd experience but it's something that we have to kind of ease back into and we've done a good job at that facing off against bds is something that my whole team has wanted for a while i think we wanted to play them on opening in a really hype matchup like this you know if they made the finals they're definitely the best representative for europe and i think we're definitely the best right now in na nrg are clicking like a well-oiled machine right now and it's nrg putting it in the back of the net our first time versus bds wasn't it wasn't so hot so hopefully we can surprise him this time and uh and take him in the final so we're gonna give her all and they hold on bds they have had some good chances you even saw that pass opportunity to extra out in the middle the pass barely didn't come a few shot chances where we didn't see bds connect will that hold up justin continues to haunt the dreams of every opponent he faces in ot does this remind you of anything james or is that the goals that white nrg their world championship justin always the threat waiting downfield and he receives the pass required to give nrg game number one wow it's just scripted this whole land seems scripted we've got the dreamcast final it's the same shot i was thinking the same thing this is i've seen this before garrett's a nice monkey in the corner rebound nrg's defense is completely solid at the moment bds unable to find a way through just it straight over to monkey moon that's a good clear marked by eight shows his own just an impression of second and midfield now it's monkey man top corner and there you have it monkey moon getting started and that is a much needed goal and a beautiful setup from mark by eight putting that bounce off the ceiling i want to finish as well another chance for nrg awkward for bds mark's gonna try and just get behind this ball he's done well there squishy's actually in reverse as well as and now suddenly it's a difficult position for nrg to handle they've got to control this everybody on the back foot there mark it's going to drop dangerously monkeybone doubles up they have not controlled it they needed to get somebody round to the back post here but look they're all at the near post they're all stuck in one position and when it comes across squishy's just not able to defend that angle squishy self-set wants to see if monkeyman will make a mistake and also don't expect me to say monkey moves minimal mistake all too often and this whole game has been nrg just being a bit off even going back to that garage read off the backboard squishy slow out and that it now monkey moan putting in another getting a hat trick what a game for bds what a response i'm so impressed by the regain ability of all these playoff teams we start phase two against the endpoint we should actually start pointing against faze as well rlcs season x they just kept going but they haven't had a win yet this season and you know they want to avoid that storyline that when it really matters bds crumbles after winning every rlcs x major falling in the championship to vitality now they're going to give it up here but still have quite the padding yeah you can see the 2v1 situation develop very quickly squishy charge down monkey moon had to make a decision does he want to try and cover the infield pass or did he think justin was going to take the shot you know re regain in the next game but at least they'll have that one to point back to saying we can't break down this bds team and maybe we'll see some fireworks another shot coming in awkward save rebound out oh just enough do you believe 11 seconds on the clock a roar from our talon in the studio we've always got a packed house over there and they are watching what all of you are overwatching 11 seconds in nrg well they've got a bit of a history of this sort of situation that's a back right kick off for energy justin's there the bomb justin's first touch sends him to the side wall that's gonna waste a lot of time it's in field energy unable to get the goal but it's still in the air mark no boost the 50s good and bds survived but that went from a comfortable win to a bit of a scary ending for bds in in energy that is what you want really when you look at these two teams i don't think that's the what's happening here well how often do we say that we have to cast so many bds grand finals and so often do we come out thinking oh hey the other team just didn't show up oh bbs are so good i'm making you look slow mark by eight has got the pace and this is how the last game started bds whittling down the defense that one off the post even a strange bounce there you saw that hit the post coming straight out have shown it's just a crazy level of shot stopping ability this event but bds are hitting them with the sheer volume of shots and at some point it doesn't matter how good you are at saving but hold on a second that's the mystery from bds jazz falling goalkeeper guest in the way there is no chance you could ever see that coming jump hope save a quiet add to that heartbreaker for nrg unbelievable bds the goal line stopped and mark reading that off the backboard again squishy coming up just short this bds team after game one have come alive bds you know their defense has been looking good but overall shogun the amount of time they've spent in nrg's half has it's been impressive i was expecting nrg to be able to bring out a bit more offense so far even in their game win bds had a lot of the momentum this is where the experience of energy is going to come in big ass that's the set and there's no chance extra a valiant attempt but nowhere near it with that last touch by justin is impossible to predict look at that popping it past monkey moon and squishy is there you need to be second man has to be there especially final minute energy still behind by one but once again just like the last game they are making a comeback squishy with time as well there's [Applause] and i'm having a bit of trouble reading whose name was this but i'm going to guess what was it just oh it's justin i can't believe it's justin i can because he continues to do it over and over again then we've got overtime the second overtime would you have it any other way team bds and the generatorg just as fairly matched as we were hoping they were going to be now justin put squishy under a bit of pressure but squishy does not fold under it mark by eight that's good for his team this is where bds are so good at stealing that boost putting your team in bad spots but equally james we know oh god extra has got bds a 2-1 lead extra to himself up the sidewall garagey in no man's land and bds take two straight at this point you've got to be thinking is it time for that timeout i have no doubt that energy can bounce back mentally but it's all bds when we talk about the pressure in these games and bds got to be asking themselves why can't this just be easy we're up by three last night we're up by two this time around and still the general rg are putting that pressure on go for it in offense they've got to go sooner because they look fantastic when they get into the other team's half and they start challenging earlier following up each other's passes and especially justin in the corners and along the sidewalk we've been seeing him in those dribble positions faking out defenders making chances and he does it again justin is a difference maker if you're new to rocket league esports well you know it more than anyone else just yet so much respect whenever he gets on the ball and when he hits it that clean guess what you have to give him that respect and he and now another chance what will he do that's great defense mark doing what bds failed to do on the first play there closing down justin you cannot give him any chances and immediately they score extra once again what a grand final he's having i watched extra's face after that goal went in nothing instead ahead they've got a job that they've got to do a raw from them nothing else because they know that nrg are going to be so difficult to break down but one each that quickly that's huge and we've now seen every player from team bds have their moment will that be enough for them it seems so mark by eight gets there way before energy would expect to get i mean they're probably thinking okay when's he gonna be here eight change his name to seven onliners nah bds are everywhere online offline and all over utopia outpacing nrg and james you made mention of it these slow starts are the end of nrg at the moment they've got to figure this out both teams are fighting with their demons here that's a double commit squishy we have options that option is justin tends to be the best option in rocket league again bds i've decided no more of this infield they're just gonna outpace everybody and extra has got a goal it's just crazy bds every single time they're just spotting the openings on the backboard wherever it is forcing bad saves and look at the timing of the arrival for extra flip reset from monkey moon garagey able to just guide the ball away from him energy have had numerous opportunities for the infield pass they have been aiming for it as well sound at the pace marked by eight he's got garrett bullied and no chance to recover in time and mark by eight he hit a crazy shot against faze in the corner now monkey moon does it look at this angle you don't even see the defender garrett looking through that transparent post expecting to be able to block it they're gonna need something they need fresh ideas i know what they've got it's chalked again that's definitely shocked this time oh it might be extra fits in a double on an undefended net three nil nrg i've got a long way back extra using up the boost no doubt in his mind whatsoever where that ball is gonna be bouncing i've never seen extra like this this is ridiculous does this feel we used to talk all the time last season johnny when we got through you know so many of the grand finals that bds1 and i don't describe it to you the same way it felt like the other team they were playing it started off well okay okay and then okay and then it fell then it felt like the other team got broken part way through nrg well not wanting to be broken just yet but bds see it just as well as they do always available for it and that's such a crucial block from monkey moon interception after interception look at the play in the middle of the box by monkey moon energy near the goal now it's always the same from nrg nothing comes easy for them nothing goes easy against them seven seconds for one goal and you see garrett didn't even he didn't flip there he completely psyched out the defense waiting until the letting that ball really come to him garrow sets up has he got anyone around it's off the wall who's there first there is squishy off the backboard one more time follow up nobody there yes i've got the first set wow bds take down an energy in style they're halfway there like i said 4-1 that would seem beside the field squishy unable to outpace this started off a little bit more bds pace but nrg they're being dragged into the fire fight yet again starting to feel like that wasteland game magpie over to extra they were in a fire fight and guess who's got more ammunition that's just insane bds find a way through that time the crossbar bounce works for them and impenetrable defense but my goodness did energy try once again it's just too little too late are bds a step too far or can the general get them back in and that question shogun that's about to be answered we're closing in on what could be the final series and it just might be with monkey moon opening things up with a goal they just don't get it wrong every single time the ball comes to the near post the timing is impeccable there is just it was saved by justin it was he's in a 1v2 there mark really slamming the ball into the backboard as hard as he can speaking of oh my goodness this denied what a play nrg connecting it in the final third but now we're right away to the other end it's monkey moon he scores just like that one into the other bds double up on energy monkey moon tore the tires loose from energy this is just unreal to see from bds even the biggest fan of eu even the biggest fan of bds cannot possibly have imagined the series to be so one-sided nrg need to do something and they need to do it as soon as possible oh there's another block up go squishy finally the post will be nice to energy but this is the margins nrg's having to work with you see mark by eight in that monkey moon and that off the post it has to go in and energy have some hope is for them to get dominated in a grand finals and bds are putting a stamp on this so far well you know they say that you learn the most from your losses bds have finally taken some they didn't really get many of those in rlcs season x really it might have been the best thing that could have happened to them they lose and they faced the trials and the tribulation now they look even better than ever it's almost the reverse of what we got from them in season x where they were peaking all the way for the season when the pressure finally was on for them to get the big win they dropped off now it's the opposite they're peaking at the right time justin needs to peek for nrg and this is what nrg need finally a lead i don't even remember the last time we had one for nrg and that is the type of plays it takes zero reaction time you see the reactions files from the players on nrg there it is haven't seen that noel that is brilliant to see that's just as important as putting it together on the field now here come energy again oh that's a great save by extra again to fight to get into the corner and actually the smiling assassins want this series they refuse to give this up justin how can you do that when you're this up against it nrg are hunting desperate for this next goal they do not want energy to have this easy but gary can't get them that second goal well just like last series they are up in the anti-gear they're trying to play aggressively it didn't work in the last series but they've decided that wasn't a strategical misplay we just have to execute better and you know for a moment i was wondering is this the fall major finals or is this the 14th style event with nrg going crazy and squishy getting another goal for nrg they actually figure shocked and that's the most dangerous thing that's ever happened nrg smiles everywhere and greg and keeps saying it when a team is having fun they are at their most dangerous energy somehow i don't know how they managed to do it they are having fun out there night and day all of a sudden we see something that we have not seen since the very start of this i feel like game one okay we can say that nrg we're putting it together but since then and i mean game one of the first series all bds on his bds again but unlike the other bds goals we are seeing energy react with comms smiles they are gonna try and stay positive here will that be enough against the bds monster uh i don't know because that pass the lovely finesse from monkey moon not marked by eight maybe but for how long shogun that's the question well hopefully till the end of the series that's what we all want to see yes hopefully in 10 games time in this series off the backboard this is unbelievable gareth center straight down the middle of justin to the double jab training pack look at the placement with the finishing touch a long time to go in the game but energy back up by two i said that this was everything bds have been fighting for for two years but for energy this is sunday market wants to get his team back in this nrg is this going to be the most talked about smile of the history of esports you do wonder seeing nrg make these adjustments watching the earlier games it looked like there was no way to break the code of bds and somehow nrg have elevated their gameplay and it's no secret justin has been what a save by garrett the last man was demo garrett slotted in but extra starts the shot bottom left one goal game again i'm so curious to see this from garrett's point of view because yes he was up against the entire time but could he have just jumped no he couldn't and that's the second time this game we've seen bds with a cute little pass out to the middle setting up their teammate now will we see a set piece in our g oh i love that they've tried that that's what those that are still smart from nrg they've been going for the back right back live kick off now they're fake switching it up that's the power of the comms it's a pair of positivity you've gotten scored on well it's an opportunity we've got a kickoff to work with now but nrg fans at home will think why could this not have been easy have we scored three and it isn't gonna be enough two minutes and twelve bds are level look at this though still smiles from nrg i mean that defense is not something i'd be smiling about regularly before they were laughing now it's just a smile and before you know it it might be something else johnny energy even with bds bds with a late surge garrett and nrg need this game it's obviously been all spun and games for them but we cannot understate that reverse sweep does not happen and it does not happen at this level squishy flip reset over the top and monkey moon helps out extra and gets rid of the ball you know it's that early challenge from bds that's what's forced squishy's hand a bit sooner than he wanted another one monkey moon just ran out of boost and couldn't get that final touch on the ball but a great job energy as well forcing him to get that last touch and that makes it so much easier for the goalkeeper knock bait whoa okay that's a lot of trust in the crossbar now you've got trust in the top squishy pops it to the side justin didn't get the boost quick enough but he has got squishy back in the midfield instead he looks good by himself that's going to cause a little bit of disarray for team bds but as always bds works so well within that chaos yes for boost start there but mark runs all the way down takes nrgs in the meantime squishy looking for the solo play doesn't connect with the flick after the reset like he wanted to gives bds a bit of time to get away to have jumped here but bds recoveries are going to get them out of that problem without any issues it just takes one of those players to line up on the goal line and it will be a scramble for energy to get there quick enough justin with squishy available isn't there in time but garrett keeping the opportunities available to the team and we've seen the adjustments come out from nrg they've been released to go for these solo plays again handled by bds we've seen how bds steps up to these one-on-one plays coming out from nrg energy fans your team needs this right now off the wall mark is the quicker of everybody plays it to the corner is this gonna be bds's opportunity they've got nobody available to take a shot so many chances for nrg none have gone in and now here comes bds with the last minute push last second push goes middle bump coming in it's the monkey moon shots on target off the border notes how's that in the background there's another setup squishy has to get rid of the ball zero seconds and now we go through overtime i don't know you heard that you can't even see monkey moon laughing about it in his player gives the players this is one of the most intense moments bds moving ahead in this game winning in overtime that would all but seal this series back into the midfield justin takes his time lines up the opportunity can the king of clutch come up for nrg monkey moon turns wait he can't get that needs the help 5050s again doing work for bds they're buying so much time for themselves by just forcing the challenge early straight to monkey moon he will have marked by eight just chasing down garrett had to be quick enough he was more than quick enough look for the block against extra that's a nice spot for to find the ball in now off the wall blue car swarming around energy are trying they're really attacking that near post they don't want to give bds time but still they go goal evades them drops down squishy squishy that 100 boost isn't available now to the team garrett reset follows up and monkey moon will not fall for any of these traps they've gone for it over and over again it was working early but bds has caught on to these tactics from nrg now the show the double commit it's loose for extra where's the follow extra finding the setup mark b as always attacking pressuring deviling the defense but now we gotta get the other side of the field pass back to garrett where is justin couldn't get there in time double tap on the backboard and the ball pushed over to the corner nrg going with all three they're trying everything they're going out on their shield if they're gonna lose this monkey moon tries to make it so demo landing by squishy relieves the pressure now nrg on the counter attack that's a good 50. a bounce will sneak by justin but garrett picking it right back up monkey clears back to the midfield bump on the back line but there's still so many players swimming around one player gone justin has to try and take control that's nice and early so they can take advantage of that demo midfield nobody from nrg want to go space for energy now who decided to back away full boost on everybody the low boost offense early cuts of the rotation did not work now they're dropping back waiting for it bds to hit the ball to them and this game is being played like it is the last one you know this is that swing game energy have to get it to they come captain america stands up and puts energy on his shield energy are back in this and not a moment too late you really feel like that was the game that they must win energy have got some ridiculous comeback potential but together three or four in a row rather after losing i think seven straight would have been a tough ask are they gonna start to question themselves that is the first real question that's going to be asked of them in this series ever since they lost that first game they have been unbeaten by nrg and now it's going to be up to the lads over on bdx and nrg just need to keep pressuring and that's what we're talking about suddenly monkeyman are in position how often have we been able to say that in this entire set just realizing when they're losing a challenge very nice save there by mark as well deflecting the ball towards a teammate but when they realize they're getting beaten to the ball they lean back slightly they turn what was it attempted beat an attempted 50 into a blocking touch and all these deflections they seem to be going into random directions but bds are controlling those they're hitting it into safe places and now center ball comes in it's still on the goal line it's a miss for both players it fakes out the defender and extra finishes it off and you can see more smiles from nrg it was a panic you see squishy side flipping and garrett the shot slow and actually throwing him off that was not the most beautiful goal that we've seen i think energy will be questioning like why do they go for some of these balls usually bds would just say because we can that is really their motto because we can and all the recovery is coming in another long shot this time it is an nrg defender off the line and it's not only yes we can but yes we will bds they take it gary did not see that one coming still all smiles for nrg they want the comeback over to the wall pops out justin realizes that he's got played back to his own chronicles like this 100 booster pop up it's not going to be kind enough to him oh my oh yes look around justin he can't believe it but everybody in the house well else in the world knew that when gareth got it he's so lethal one four six kph what a screamer by guaranty i've ran out of boost in that defensive play 23 on squishy nothing on justin and garrett but pads they have done well to escape that wrath of bds and that backboard read could have ended it right there for bds they're giving nrg a chance john rebound low and no good the defense holds strong why can't any of these games just be simple we've got another overtime on our hands another one that lig desperately needs oh that's not the best [Applause] one more time but lrg will recover well finally bds make a mistake in offense that would have been a goal earlier in the series but now the crossbar on nrg's team uh garrett takes too much time there's the cell [Applause] the ice by mark what a play by monkey moon holds the dodge for as long as possible pre-flip to center and squishy didn't see it coming and bds have three championship points overtime has proved to be the death of nrg bds in a key game nrg showing life showing guts in the previous game very often you can tell how well a player is playing how well they're feeling about their play by how clean their touches are and that was an end-to-end corner to far corner boomer have a clear by all of the dds that's capitalizes on it bds looks shaky in the first minute and it seems almost impossible such a long road ahead of nrg but they've taken the first step monkey moon does he want the infield oh he ends up missing it who's their first garrett couldn't get there before extra who recovered the play just in time and now it's trickling to oh extra saves his teammate turns around and then does the unthinkable he just shoots nobody thought they were gonna hit the ball straight at them justin couldn't read the fights but that's the hardest points to read you don't know if it's going up left right or anywhere and it goes right towards extra you saw extra waiting to the last moment to jump but he jumped just in time to avoid a demo garrett g was coming in trying to shut that play down expertly timed from extra drops wow show me a better pass you're not gonna find one take your chance and take it in bds are looking at the stockholm major oh extra he never fails to give you more than you asked for three minutes bds three minutes for everything you waited for to come true nrg want to take it away from them though and they've got to start stepping up oh gee the turnaround by garrett just snipes it past he makes a run down the line here and just beats extra to the punch that's the extra who's been really the difference in this game garrett has scored again and you're 100 right johnny that first game and that last game this very well could be and you're seeing how difficult it's going to be for bds to put it away justin can't get the ball past extra not many can squishy a little bit of a fumble on his own side of the field back that puts bds right back into prime position to set themselves up but outpaced but for one of the first times that we've seen always available for the recovery monkey moon takes the shot garrett g with squishy on the far side he's got two players to aim for but he can also go by himself should he want to squishy takes that option [Applause] and a worldwide sigh is hard garrett trying to fight squishy guts him no everything from energy is just being thrown forward what a pass towards justin the shot matches it top left upper 90 justin to keep nrg's hopes in it they're gonna have to hold bds off for a minute 50 but this is what nrg have to do we saw them making the solo plays that opened up the field that keeps bds in net and it's presenting that midfield option which one will nrg take it doesn't matter because right now they're in the home stretch of this one have no doubts about it nrg have been creating their chances the question has been can they finish them now they've got a lead how long are they waiting for that off the backboard garrett extra straight in the position he wanted if that bounced anywhere else oh that was a two-goal lead well justin getting fancy with it that's gonna be tough to read but also tough to execute and bds are following up with pressure energy able to slow the game down now justin looking for demos looking for redirects any opportunity to make this harder for bds back down to extra realize that the backboard was his only option garrett twisting tony there is monkey moon [Applause] [Music] do they miss rarely one minutes ago monkey moon snipes the bottom corner against two pre-jumping defenders they all think he's going high monkey moon shoots slow there's that vision and we've seen that vision over and over from bds that lower corner never safe squishy thought he had it covered but monkey moon snipes it out and now we've got less than 60 seconds left before yet another overtime squishy clears can he get the follow-up extra try to pop it over the top of him couldn't quite do so much right into the path of garrett who wants to get to this one first monkey move both teams setting themselves up what a passover and now nrg can set themselves up for a goal scoring chance energy trying to draw bds in with these passes and hit them with that hardcore bds or sitting back they don't want to fall for that that midfield option always around for energy it was taken away from the start of the series they've re-established it and this is when the going gets tough for both teams we'll find out what they're made of marked by eight from the backboard squishy clears extra unable to cover that initially so nrg are gonna have a chance to try and shut this down and set themselves up defensive positioning by both teams cannot attack is the main source of goals when you're doing that but over time looms and here it is over time whatever else bds one goal away from winning the stockholm major justin over the top of one three players though it's always so difficult to get past through the smoke the shot on targets perfect pre-jump by bds they're being tested in ot already over to extra just putting garrett under a little bit of pressure pop up squishy off the backboard can you find the set what a clear that is bds pulling clears out of nowhere here and now it's their first chance to attack extra to monkey moon and the bar denies nrg and now just unable to get a valuable clear and you saw justin with that slight mishit that set up the opportunity for bds will we see the nerves finally get to nrg this is their last life justin takes it down couldn't get the fake couldn't get the challenge back into the midfield mark with extra we've seen this before but the nrg also know what it takes to defend that play passing in defense from nrg they're looking for that clear over the top of bds who are sitting so so deep they've not done this a lot this series they've been pressuring now they're going to try and go all the way the long ball game against nrg extra leaves will he live to regret that one gareth sets up it's a little bit of a calamity on the goal line but vds work through it justin past one needs the support now coming down that left-hand side squishy midfield quite easy for monkeyman to deal with pds still managing that boost to perfection energy have been half looking for infield passes but no one's been there waiting for it bds patient one goal away from winning the entire thing they are not rushing this justin perhaps the best goal scorer in rlcs history in the biggest moments nrg need one now and i don't want to let this position go justin to garrett garrett look for it as close as you can get without scoring both teams hit the exact same spot of the goal and we are still in ot energy fighting for their lives back out again nrg are so ready for this they will not let peter yes have this for free and they took their swings in rg so much time in the bds half but now it's bds's turn mark monkey moon with mark by is monkey moon now moves on off the backboard squishy pops up bites his team tie power energy keeping soku so much composure under this much pressure the boost is looking phenomenal both teams have iced in overtime so far and they are so close to winning at either end there's been moments where surely this overtime's over but not quite yet monkey mode for mark extra goes as well team bs still happy for those double commit plays even during the clutch situation and mark almost found the ultimate snipe what a dodge by justin and again getting the ball clear to a safe location we passed three minutes of overtime and still nrg are denying bds that win that they've been waiting for garrett awaits the infield extra more than ready for the shot and there it's the composure again from nrg squishy catching that ball going for the pass now getting a demo is it enough for nrg to work with oh is it half squishy finishes it off it's not over yet everyone at home strap it and get ready we've got game six on the way bds unable to do it at the first try they've got two more and they put a lot into that game they played well nrg played better and like any good video game you get three lives team bds just saw the first one disappear not only are they smiling but also the gameplay speaks volumes but specifically extra stops in this game his clears in this game have relieved so much pressure for bds likely even saving a goal keeping this even right now we only have two minutes left bds with a chance oh justin trying to give them none deft as you like justin steps up how many more of these have he got in him snipe this top corner forces two players to commit but still energy are denying the goal monkey moon wanted to trust mark by eight mcmahon [Applause] bds didn't get it the first try they were stone cold no reaction no a reaction is definitely visible nrg refused to lose barring something crazy on the kickoff which has not happened we are going to game seven and then nrg are one goal away from dying there's no way this is happening right now nrg i thought it was over but maybe it's far from it champions field and with the way this series has gone if we go to another series all bets are off i miss this oh this is so much fun ford energy are driving us towards that third series justin can't quite find it off the setup here's monkey moon back over to mud by eight what a start that would have been huge denied by squishy sending it halfway and some bds still wanting to finish this as safely as possible they've missed their chance to throw everything and the kitchen sink at nrg now they really just have to commit to that same playstyle that has not worked for two games now monkey moon with mark shot gonna be too high garrett couldn't collect the ball however this is gonna be the pace to expect who can get that first goal and will we see more shots going high that was what crippled bds in the last game good looks clanging them off the crossbar they will need that accuracy in order to take this title mark by a with the drop and extra couldn't get there in time monkey moon just salvages the play tries to get his team to rotate back into position no counter attack available for nrg getting great control by energy as well they are just buying so much time in these back corners waiting for bds to commit before flipping over a minute gone already and james said that bds shooting doesn't look as deadly as it once did we wanted to know whether or not both these teams would be able to step up neither team across either series has used a timeout they're both so happy with what they've brought to the field i'm super happy with what they brought to the field now the bounce out extra takes his time he's got boost to keep this play going realizes squishy's gonna be late he can keep this now justin however keeps the play out but so many players will commit initially nrg will be in retrieval mode this is testing for bds so many denials from nrg and after denying two games already that devil on their shoulder that i talked about right now is probably several because how can you avoid thinking that the inevitable series three is coming when so many shots miss when so many saves come through nrg keep winning there's these lower corners have been the golden spot for it for bds they continue to find him so you see squishy airborne and that all extra had to do was put that on target and he slotted it two minutes 53 seconds left bds has been fighting from behind for quite some time now will they rise to the occasion monkey moon almost found the setup nrg they've been here before they've made these comebacks happen have they got another one ready to pounce extra for me has just been outstanding he has been that guy in this final [Music] here he comes again but justin beats him nrg still looking phenomenal mechanically gareth back out justin's around another stop as well nrg have to feel what bds did in the last game and that was almost the exact same situation shogun and now nrg behind you've got switching trying to work to justin but out of reach what a pass that was for once energy not ready for it infield has been a great option for them this entire time final two minutes energy are the ones who need a goal to keep this championship alive monkey moon only have to squishy he sets it up to extra two now bds lead by two it's been a while since i could say that and it's extra again monkey moon finding him you saw the challenge come in but it wasn't enough bds finding those finesse passes right in front of net at the best time possible energy need to blitz the last two minutes of this game two goals needed an extra one potentially in overtime after that they are very much up against this but if any team can it is this one i mean it proved resilient but now this is the toughest situation they faced time is getting away from them and they're not just looking for one goal squishy booming clear with justin it's what's worked so often in the past but bds are not a team from the past they are the new generation looking for a new opportunity to prevent itself present itself and take it there's justin backed up the squishy oh what a save bds are playing this out brilliantly they're forcing energy to play as fast as they can are not sitting back that double commit though from bds that's allowed nrg to get some bomb the big save from justin this has to be it energy they have to get one now shogun yeah off the kickoff they have done magic before but don't know if they've got it again squishy over to the wall monkey moon chases him down squishy can keep going though he's long balls he's high clears are killing nrg bds wasting so much time garrett takes it low monkey moon will not be fooled he sees the trophy or the medals right in front of him justin needs that support it's not there energy they're moving in close they know now is the time they have to commit there's no point defending at this stage that finish line within sight monkey moon a chance to close it out final 10 seconds garrett and justin look for the setup oh that is that should do it bds are no longer the best team online in europe they lay claim to the best team offline in the world [Music] pay them the respect they deserve bds have proved everyone wrong and i think just as much as that they've proved it to themselves what a performance by all three players beating nrg twice in a row and credit to nrg we thought it was over a long time ago and they made it a battle they put on a show they showed us what they're capable of but it wasn't enough bds they showed us that they are the best team in the world class from nrg more than worthy to be any champion it is fitting the bds beat them to claim that title in europe after two years of no lance if you are going to beat a team to cement yourself nrg have always been exactly that enjoy it boys drink it in you waited for this
