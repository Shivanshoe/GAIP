one of you guys are the absolute best thank you for all the support on this channel hope you guys enjoyed today's video yo what's up guys so i got quite a few things to talk about for today as you can see the menu looks completely different than what you're used to seeing there was a brand new update that was released by sonics not too long ago and they're prepping for free to play which comes out tomorrow i believe so there's a bunch of things i'm going to go over for today the first i'll start with is the creator code feature so as you can see at the top right it says supporting squishy muffins if you guys want to support me directly pretty much go to your item shop which updates every like two days i believe it is every day every two days something like that and if you go to the top right it says change support press whatever button that may be if you press that and then you type in the creator code squishy muffins and that'll support me for 14 days under my code and if you want to just always support me just keep putting it in every 14 days and it'll support me always so whatever you buy in the shop i'll get a portion of whatever you end up purchasing and it supports me directly and it helps me out a lot so if you guys want to do that and support me as an extra thank you for you know all the content over the years that'd be fantastic and i'd absolutely appreciate that more than you guys know uh so yeah the code is squishy muffins i'll leave it in the comment section as well so you guys get the spelling right um but it's not just squishy don't use just squishy that's not connected to me the creator code for me for epic games uh is squishy muffins that's what it'll be if you guys want to support me so thank you for that if you decide that you want to do that and whatever you buy like i said a portion of it will go directly to me which is awesome it's an awesome feature that they added for you know fans being able to support the creators so that's the first thing they added out of this update as you see the menu is a little bit different now in the garage it's set up a little bit different the titles aren't here the titles aren't set under profile you'll see stats under career now in here you see all my stats um these aren't exactly like perfectly um up to date because i think at one point all my stats got reset so this isn't fully accurate if you guys are wondering what my stats were i think like two years ago my stuff reset completely this is between two years and now but yeah that's pretty much where the stats are hidden now they're hidden under career that's where league rankings are hidden as well leaderboards and lead wrecking so here's what i want to get onto next there are new ranks guys so it says that i'm grand champ one right now but right now nobody can actually reach the highest level of supersonic legend this is before free to play drops so no one's actually able to reach it yet the update's not fully in effect but they added the new ranks into the game but no one's actually able to reach higher than grain type one right now um but i'm assuming that supersonic legend will probably be top hundred if i had to guess it's probably gonna be like top hundred and then grandchild one two and three will be like i'm guessing 1500 mmr will be grand champ one then the 1600 or 1700 will be grandchild 2 then 1800 and 1900 will be grand champ 3. i'm guessing it'll be 15 16 17 and then anything above that until top 100 is just grand champ 3 and then only top 100 will be supersonic legend i hope that's the case that'd be sick uh we'll see we haven't had any more information on that but this is the new top rank so i'll probably be doing a road to supersonic legend uh series instead of a road to grand champ because supersonic edition is a new high that you want to reach so i'll probably be doing something like that and i'll be going through each rank trying to play to the strengths of the rank trying to play to the level of the rank um instead of just trying to beat everyone as badly as i can i try to play to the level of the bronzes to the level of silvers golds platinums diamonds champs grand champs and then try to make it supersonic legend that way and try to teach you guys as much as i can throughout each rank if you guys want to see me do that i did a series like that recently uh where i played to the bronze level silver gold etc let me know and i'll do that for super sonic legend i think it was a lot of fun i think you guys learned a lot from it so i'm going to do it again but that's my idea for this uh for when it comes out i want to try to start a series like that so yeah super sonic legend is the uh the next highest ranked the new rank they released all right so now we're on to another new thing if you go click play there's a lot of uh different stuff here so now it looks quite different than it did before i'm not honestly fond of the new ui honestly i don't like it as much as i liked it before training is over here now and there's all of this stuff there's a brand new tutorial as soon as you start up the game as soon as you first get the game now which is cool you can't actually play it afterward but uh free play is here now it's a little bit harder to get to custom games like private matches are over here now also a little bit harder to get to them before so i'm not 100 a fan of the ui i think it'll just take some time to get used to but the newest feature is tournaments that's a new thing that they they fixed quite a bit it wasn't good before uh but they definitely fixed it i don't know why some other regions in south america still hold on you go here tournament schedule region us east oh this is not working okay well it says it says use now but it keeps glitching back to south america anyway um normally you'd be able to see the the tournaments that are available and then the top three weekly placements i think maybe it's glitch right now because it's not like set up properly it's not done yet before the actual update drops but there'll be three available tournaments here that are scheduled you're playing them you place as well as you possibly can and then if you place well you get rewards with those rewards you can get drop so you press this i already did it i used um 20 000 credits twice to get the rarest possible stuff and painted as well that's actually my banner right now it's one of the rewards to show you guys in a second but you get a certain amount of this currency this tournament currency for placing well in these schedule tournaments which aren't showing right now but normally there will be tournaments and then you'll get a top three weekly placements and you'll get uh rewards based off that but you get uh this currency and then you can buy yourself rewards so you gotta preview rewards and these are all the rewards i know this these colors on my car don't look good hold on let me switch to a better looking car here see if you have a better idea let's do this one maybe that'll look nice here so i can preview the rewards better for you guys it looks kind of better but you can see like the idea of how these decals look at least but there's a lot of new decals in here new wheels um the gold explosion looks really nice i'll show you guys that in a sec this banner or the this avatar board is nice the new banner is pretty nice this banner is really nice i like that one a lot this is the one i got i got painted yellow i believe it looks pretty clean this is like the nicest trail i've seen i think like it's for your supersonic trail lines looks really nice when it turns um the wheels are okay i got this this one in sky blue that's what i'm currently using uh this is nice these wheels are clean as well i'm not crazy fan of these boost is too big i probably just use alpha boost not a fan of those wheels it's all right looking i don't really like these crazy looking wheels though i don't like this either this is the new decal um in my opinion the only way this decal would look nice is if you do this go to hold on where is it do this put this to the darkest black darkest black go back the only thing i could see making this decal look good is those colors yeah see that's the only way i can see the decal being nice but that's the decal and these two gold clothes are nice the digi globe and this one's the best one in my opinion i think it looks super cool looks super clean so yeah those are the rewards for the tournaments right now but i think these are like kind of like filler rewards for now like i don't i think they'll be releasing new ones every week or something like that or maybe like every month or something i don't they haven't released anything but i doubt those are going to be like always there those are gonna switch out every now and then um so yeah this tournament feature is really cool it gives you something on the side outside of rank to work toward and you get a lot of extra cool items because of it and it's a good experience as well and it's fun playing tournaments like that are high pressure and stuff like that so they actually revamp tournaments to make it more important and not just like a community-based thing so it's more competitive now and they'll fix that better i believe when uh the update fully drops and free to play comes out tomorrow so yeah looking forward to that and outside of that stuff everything else is pretty much the same when you queue for rank now uh it looks like this actually tells your mmr going into it which is nice um like i said you can't get higher than grand champ one right now before this update it's not possible uh if you're a grandchild before it just says grand champ now we're going to have one for everybody even if you're number one leaderboards i asked i believe justin he was like number five on three's leaderboards or number three or something and he was also grand champ one he's like pretty much 2500 mmr so it doesn't matter what your mmr is right now you can't possibly get supersonic legend before this update drops fully so this is what it looks like right now you can still cue multiple things a lot of people don't realize that but if you press um see triangle at the bottom left says multiple selection press triangle and you can cue one two and three instead of just one thing they also remove solo standards completely the season ends in 18 hours as you can see when you when i'm recording this guys the season is going to end very very soon so yeah you can still cue multiple things and there's no more solo standard i think that's a good move on their part no one really played soul sander was really dead i did wrote a grand shape of soul standard without scoring i try to do that to see if i can be a really good team player and it was one of the most stressful things to do just finding a game was so hard this fighting game was like the hardest thing to do so i don't blame them for taking it out it was really dead it had like a peak 2 000 players top so it was a good idea on their part but that's pretty much it for the update guys a lot of new things but yeah the the biggest thing for like the community like for the content creators and stuff like that they did is definitely the creator code stuff that's really good in-game wise i think that tournaments is huge for the community in general um and outside of that like for competitive queuing i think the fact that the governor's soul standard is really good they listen to the community for sure and all the extra items that they're going to be adding to tournaments is really really cool really good to look forward to but yeah guys that's going to be it for today's video thank you so much for all the support on the channel i'll be releasing uh two videos a beginner's guide to rocket league trying to help you guys get started off for anyone who's joining the game through free to play um i'm gonna
