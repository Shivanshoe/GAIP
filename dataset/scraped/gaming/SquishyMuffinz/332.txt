a brand new video I appreciate y'all the support you guys have been showing me is insane I can't thank you guys enough enjoy the video yo what's up guys in the last video we finished off at champion 3 Division 2 at 1436 MMR I'm pretty sure grand champ in 2 V 2 is 15 15 mm are from not mistaken it's not 1500 on the dot I think it's 15 15 to be exact so we are probably I'd say two more videos away this one and one or more if we win every single game but we could run into some god-tier champ 3 sunos so let's get into it and let's see what we come up against and see what we can learn from today we got speedy our team gets retrack maniac on air I'm gonna call defending I could heat up on this corner one just a little bit try to react what happens oh I forgot to change my name this isn't good hope no one recognizes me cuz there's only been a couple of videos out once I could set aside my team I just got a kill so I'm gonna try to swing wide and pass this to him you won't expect the pass probably there we go that was a really good kill open up a lot of space for me and a lot of options I can either shoot that ball which is probably expecting or I can go for the past middle it was really good positioning for my teammate as well it's really good job for him to be there I like that a lot I'll try to look for my team in again I'll pass across so you're ready seeing people will position way more for passes middle which is really good I got I'm gonna try passes back to my team and I see he's back he's not middle so try to set him up for a chance at goal give him a couple of good passing opportunities good try take control of the boost here I'll take this back now I'll leave it for him there we go another you pass over to my teammate good trying that so I gotta wait I'm gonna fake challenging and try to force out the ball for free and I can stay with and now you took the boost position you should go rotate behind me there which I popped it over that guy get try maybe double it's better if I to me goes outside a ground there and then tried to jump up for that again he's trying to flow for that aerial it's gonna be really awkward for him to hit how's it that Dutch yeah I should have got more on big play to get my teammate really involved with the offensive for this game already got him a lot of opportunities I try to take some shots myself now just pop this one on goal by too fast for him so the ball is rolling like that toward the place where you want to shoot it just single jump either single jump or backflip into it as soon as you make contact backflip instantly give you more power that's the tip for that when it's rolling away from you you can't flip into that ball if you flip into it's gonna roll I'm gonna have an easy save so your single jump or double jump on there then hit this around this guy gonna give me a free chance on a goal here I'll just drive it in nice and easy so one big tip in terms of when you're trying to like one B to dribble or even 1v3 dribble which you shouldn't be doing too often if you have the space for it there is no no harm in it try to keep the ball with you don't flick it away early if you can get by one player with without having a flick or anything like do one quick little cut in and get about one that's perfect so that's what you wanted to you I'm gonna go for a bump here see this works first out a worse touch at least I know I can do much of that but yeah I try to not flick the ball away for as long as possible are you going for wore me to plays let me get by the first guy for free pretty much is how I always look at it I'll show you another example when I can but it's not hard at all like if you break it down and you don't over think am I to me [ __ ] let me bring that back there's no point of panicking and rushing that touch bug I kill you should use me there cuz I'm wide open like that's where I've been passed to my team in a lot I tried to go for just I'm a shot should I deal with that so I'm gonna fake this probably gonna panic again I got by one for doing absolutely nothing and I can you try to fake him there my teammates should be able to come in for shot Joe it's exactly what I was talking about like I didn't do anything to get by that guy but I faked him out still had full ball control I had one guy to get by I made him get a bad touch to the poor my teammate can just finish it off nice and easy try stay on this ball I want all this away still looking good on bouche my team is gonna take this probably so I'll wait should I follow this one up it's not gonna be in but see me tough my teammate good save I say behind me XD it's a 50/50 I want to be able to help Mom in a fake challenge here force the panic my teammate can do something as well try to beat him maybe the guy shot Oh close my team is up as well I was gonna 50 it's fine I'll try to get a kill here open up some space gonna have a bang so I'll leave that for my teammate let's hit around I have a lot of space I know I killed the other guy pop it up i soothe a deer he missed teammates kind of panicking as well try to just keep faking see what he does I might have overdone it with the fakes I tried to see how much a bit panic is it rush like that obviously I could shoot it but I'm trying to get a grasp of how a ring like this rank would react to a situation like that but it well you played it passive my team is going for a bump so I didn't panic super hard or anything I've spotted being got out of it wall obviously I could have just shot it that's to play there they were white up and go about testing the waters 10 minutes time here your job to control that you want to take your time in a spot like that where no one's challenging you always gonna be the best player try the delay this move downfield nice you gave me the ball here so one way for my teammate you just grab boost again I'm check it by this first scare without actually wasting the ball or wasting possession I couldn't do that so I'll just hit it to the side take took like both backwards I'm pretty sure I probably shouldn't have done fine Helen to some of the [ __ ] from the first get away that alright again he's panicking a lot of the times when I self control the ball but at least it's still getting decent touches with it that's the the decent part but he should be letting his teammate control her more in the spots for sure seen a lot of the same same mistakes maybe one more touch to decide here I'm wide open on the side maybe I gave him an option a positioning across the passes the tab is slow so I think against a higher ranked opponent they would have read that pretty easily because he was going directly toward like where I was he was facing me the whole time you want to swing out wide there give yourself options so you can either bang a shot on goal or pass across really quick and they won't know which one like I did for the first pass and there he was just super obvious that he was gonna go toward me but it was just the lack of being able to read it on the the defenders in there so we got 7c Bushnell so not that many but we still got a division up the chain through there right 14:53 now not to bask into the next one pretty solid first game might even be two more episodes after this I don't know it depends how quick we gain point from this point on but uh pretty solid stuff and I think that was pretty good pretty good game to showcase like how the defenses in these ranks and you could tell it's getting better it's getting a lot better than before but it's still a lot of holes especially at the end there him not being him to read that pass I'm very surprised sitting it was like super choreographed oh you could tell you is going straight toward me with that when you should have tried to give himself more options but again that's just that's just a lack of experience that uh that you notice at this rank guys assume yeah I came to the next game and let's see how it goes so we got ourselves against actually all low fourteen hundred players I wasn't looking at by my car but to that kickoff Salma screwed up actually not super high fourteen hundred nicely the highest-ranked here my teammate started off with the banger that was good positioning from him see how he comes out wide they it gives me an option to pass and then he hits the the redirect wall best thing there though is that he gave me that option so I have it if I need to use it and they have to be worried about that option I'm shot a fake there we go I got by the first guy for free like I was talking about how much I pass this off to the side I'm gonna be go for a bump there obviously got a better pass or even it's just a shot off the dribble but I want to use my teammates more and again I gave him that option good job to look for me there like I said if you are positioned in a spot like that where you can get a shot off the pass they have to be worried about you even if you're not using that play like he can go for a solo play there but they're gonna be worried about me that's the good thing about positioning there they don't even need to use you and it's still through it try to just stay in front of this ball here good 50s I could go for a shot try one I guess not on target but least to give my team that opportunity I was late to that and I got a bad touch time to go with the backboard I'm try to block them nothing boots like a head back I'll try to hold on to my full boost here there you go good beat and for those empty net it's just the tip I mean if you have a lot of time just get above the ball as much as possible just get it fast be above the ball that way you don't sky it cuz when I was starting out for the first couple hundred hours and have empty Nets I would just hit it at crossbar and because I was just trying to boom it for some reason when you should really just be trying your absolute best to just get that shot on target my teammates were really solid by the way he's giving me a lot of opportunities so he's playing well lowest-ranking here it seems like the most solid player and of all of them yeah I got a saying for empty and I should try to get above the ball as much as possible some main tip I'd give you don't worry about the placement just worry about getting it low and fast you could beat the returning defender this guy's giving up alright I think at this point you just let them one be one or I don't know if the play is to make them four feet or let them all be one year but this guy gave up already he's mad I guess I'll go have fun with them in goal you can expect it'll be one people like you to make the world a better place all just from their mountain oh not even any mountain did at least let me have some fun I don't know I could with this I mean it was it was still a winnable game he started doing this when there is a three gold de France I'm pretty sure it's 300 when he started getting this so definitely a very bad mentality and this is a player who's only something his own growth I feel like if you're somebody's doing this tactical bumps they're just holding them down and go yeah you only only stunting your own growth as a player if you're someone who's gonna have that mentality you know I mean what do you gain in a situation like this where you're losing and you just give up do you really gain the keys back I try to just get the song full thank you good touch him again like I have a lot of space here I know but I just needed not bang this super high so I just trying to get above the ball as much as I could what's still getting power on it you're above it the ball is gonna only go below where your tip of your car is whereas if you're below it you don't really have the same level of control nice I hope you guys forfeit it seems getting out of hand like I kind of ruined it though it would have been a better game for sure but I mean throughout this entire run to Grand Chairman we've seen considering we've already put like less than 30 games I think it's been less than 30 games so far we've seen so many toxic players well like way too many and it it's it's pretty bad but even then if you compare this game to a game like csgo like it doesn't even come close so there's a way you're talking to people in a game like that obviously but still a man like there is no reason to have that mentality if you're playing to improve already playing to have fun being toxic is it's never too the way to go and I'm every I don't know I just don't see what you gain from your wasting everyone's time in the lobby as well like why I don't know I don't get it and this is someone who's obviously put a decent amount of time into this game if they're if they're champ three like then obviously put a decent amount of time into this game right and then the second the game starts going badly they just give up and I guarantee you he he typed some like shit-talking words just teammate before all this as well even though there's really nothing they could have done I mean they could have defended better but regardless there probably had scored on most of the situation's early on in this game that what he gonna do games are wash unfortunately my teammate was really solder I I do like his positioning and I think we should play one more game just because this game was not to create this but yeah well there is his off time here wait what did you say your words hurt so much can't explain yeah he's probably a trash talking room right now as well I don't know why people like that man I really don't get it but I was gonna say thank you guys so much for all the support man like seriously yeah I can't believe the amount of growth that the channel has seen over the last little bit and honestly can't thank you guys enough it's been crazy to look at everything I mean there's so many of you guys that have been saying you were watching my content for a long time didn't even realize that you weren't so then you sub that I'm seeing all of you guys finally into sub button cuz the numbers going up crazy quick lately and it's crazy to think that like before even half the year is done we might even reach a million subs which is it's so crazy to me that before the start of this year like it was projected that I would reach a million subs like five years from now I my current grow three and that's just crazy that we sped that up so much quicker it's all thanks to you guys thank you so much for making it possible I want to say in that I can't wait to get the series after this one started cuz there's so much so much so much so much content that I want to get out to you guys that I think you'll enjoy so much like especially the series I'm gonna do immediately after this I can't wait to announce what it is like I really can't wait I think you guys will love it I haven't even tested it out it's a completely original idea I haven't tested it out yet but I think it's gonna be a really good idea and I think you guys are gonna love it so I can't wait to get around to that and I'm I've just got like this huge spike in motivation for content and what I want to do for this channel so you guys so much for for being part of that seriously every single you guys who's been subscribed to me for the entirety of my like seven year YouTube career I've been doing YouTube since way before rocket league but no one really watched me back then I had like 2000 subscribers back then which is still like it was crazy to me back then but looking at where we got to now it's like damn like that's it's nuts man how long we'll be doing this right so everyone that's been here for that entire journey thank you and everyone who's joining along in the journey too helping us reach a million and beyond I appreciate y'all thank you so much for being a part of it I hope you guys will continue to enjoy all the content that I put out your way but yeah I apologize for that game on his behalf on the other team I didn't wanna say his name to give him attention but all guys for that game and his bad behavior but a really good job for my teammate he played really well we kind of party effort I don't think I should though I should stick to stick to the roots of this series trying to get to grand champs solo queued my teammates really good like I think he's really good for this rank so I don't really want to cure them I think that's slightly unfair advantage because you're not gonna find a teammate that's I saw the same and I also don't know if he's super sold or if they were just like not good together at all I think he was playing well in all honesty so I don't wanna I don't report it with him that's against the whole point of the series the solo queue and he is solid I'm not gonna find a chain of three I sell two same every single time so we're better off to just go alone but for play one more game for today and we're 1470 MMR after that we got 16 points so yeah we're getting about 16 to 17 points a game right now it's pretty solid that should mean that I'm guessing within the next five wins we'd reach beyond shame if we win every single one so let's uh let's get into the next and see if we can add and there's sixteen seventeen points to that and also see what we can learn out of the game as well alright so we're planning it's a higher higher champ three now I should be shooting on that ball probably but it's fun everyone in here is also champ three one of them time for an air dribble good read for my teammate we got a question mark profile so my teammate might might possibly be a smurf we'll see nice touch from him TV chefs on the wall - trustus hit I shouldn't trust it I guess almost followed up though I miss the right play to trust that but I don't think you were still consistent nothing throws every single time they probably hit it like 200 210 put three out of ten times just depends on how awkward it is I guess plus one more time he's go get a jump on this it's us decide I mean not the best but you got the job done which I hit this there I like to follow it up one more it's fun getting quite reach buddy go for some get middle it's challenge I don't have a space here so I'm gonna go with the left wall with this am I trying to kill time look at my teammate middle give him a good pass get fifty better wait on this I'll pop this up my look and I'm gonna just try it the other backboard see they do he misses I go for a double she go for a double touch data see if it worked didn't have a touchy so wait middle kind of pre position for that I know his face so much I do use it here I'll never come to me again I got him out of the play just by a single jump there and now I have a one-on-one I'm giving myself a 1 B 1 and I can get that by the last guy very easily like that's what I was mentioning in the first game of this video sign please Oh does he know does he know it's me that tells much thing in the first game of this video is that sorry oh he's on to him what do I say I'm saying like the to be one dribbles and stuff shot I get one person on the play for free right without having to throw away your position or throwing away the ball early that's exactly what we did there trying to get away of that you miss which is fine I had a bump on one alright so I know I was faced here I'm gonna look at my team on the left side I pass off to him trying to use a teammate some more and this episode to see how ready they are for passing stuff cuz in earlier ranks they weren't ready for passes pretty much at all it's very rare you saw someone being ready ready go for the bump to help him out but good quite run for the flip reset I like to see that I'm gonna say I don't know what you're talking about with that such point by the way I don't know what to say do ya laughs when I go oh you missed so people are still flying was that the the hiring I was a little rank one lower rank c3 but it's still so up they're still not quite comfortable with the sound control when the ball goes over your head I feel like I keep stop stopping my sentence and bothering me so I'm thinking about so many things alright no wait here once I know that it's okay to go for I'll just hit underground that guy he jumped a little bit too far bond I can go back now take some pads here tried to go off the top there just cuz I had some time like I know that shots gonna be high listen the upper half of the goal and it's much easier to have control over how you're gonna bang the ball away when you go up that way that's why I originally started doing that notice it would be very useful if you can throw it in the right times I'll fake this a shot here oh I went for the path I don't you think oh yeah I'm going to try to try pass this middle here my team in an option if he wants to go that's fine I'll actually get patient I like that he waited on that because he wasn't in a position to shoot quite yet I'm trying to push out for his touch here I'm a look I know I have space I'm trying to just toss a shot on wall don't you throw away that ball really if he was challenging me aggressively though that's when I would flick that early so it's all dependent on what they do obviously hello YouTube hello oopsy I'm looking my teammate he's on the right side pass it over to him good try that's a good dunk for them jump to it to read that I really like that he read that there so I was talking about in one of the previous games they weren't reading the passage that were obvious there's pretty obvious pass but I wanted to use my teammate he's positioning for which I like as well I like to see that a little bit wide and my tummy is far back so heats up the backboard for him even though I could shoot want to give him an option to shoot as well I could probably get that on target if I like really wanted to but it's definitely tougher Sean I think it's best bet to that back but especially playing high ranked plays they're gonna be ready for the immediate shot I thought the backboard is definitely gonna be more awkward for them to deal with I'm gonna stay on the right side if I team wants to use me oftentimes I noticed too is if you pass your teammate a couple times showed the game they're gonna look for you as well if no one passes like if you don't pass at all they're not gonna pass but I've noticed no one wants to be the first to pass what I often noticed in soloqueue I pass them well look on the right side you open for the pass shudders go for that in case the opponent wants I would have beat him to it I'm a free jump you missed yeah people still definitely like aerial control and I don't know if I should play like one or two games well in grand champ just to see if there's a difference at a low grand champ but I could tell people still lack like aerial control and ability to read the game you know this strength dropping a heart is a cool need but yeah after that we finished off at champy three Division four so maybe it is 1500 I don't know to be honest but we'll leave that for the next video because regardless if it is 1500 if it's 15 15 if you win two games gaining 15 plus a game we'll be at a grand champ regardless after next video so well we'll do that and maybe I'll play even one more set of two games after that just to see how low Grand Champions is but yeah hope you guys enjoyed I think we learned a lot out of this this set of games here especially when it comes to like TV one dribbles that's a big tip guys if you are looking to do TV one three one dribbles try to get the ball with you for as long as possible don't throw it away for as long as you possibly can that's the ultimate tip in terms of trying to dribble out a whole team which you should be doing too often only when you absolutely have to obviously or if your teammates not there and support with you that's what your option is at that point to try to go alone that's a big tip for that and in terms of just positioning for your teammate give them that option if they don't want to use you they don't need to use you but it's still threatened to the team but yeah that's gonna be it for today's video guys I hope you enjoyed I can't wait to get this series over with and give you guys the rest of the tips in terms of reaching grand champ for yourself and after that getting to the next one the next series which I'm super hype about like I've been talking about but we're worried about that when it comes yeah guys before I say bye thank you so much again for all the support I appreciate y'all so
