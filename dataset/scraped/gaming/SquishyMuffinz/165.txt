yo guys but today we're gonna be using this beautiful looking merc we have on all the alpha items and beta items equipped we got the the beautiful alpha wheels on we got the alpha boost on with the output cap and the beta nugget all on so it's gonna look quite clean and for today we're gonna be playing with this pretty looking car in where is it extra mode we're gonna be using it in snow day which is right here i actually haven't really played snow day for a video i haven't played sony for a video in probably a year now it's been a very long time and it's probably my least favorite game but a lot of you guys are asking please do a snow day video because i've been doing drop shot videos i'm doing hoops videos here and there so this is my first snowy video in a while i'm gonna be using the the merc for it so we'll see what we can do so you can get some dubs it's gonna be fun and i also have a suggestion for you guys everyone that's watching this video right now if you guys are subscribed i appreciate that if not make sure to hit the subscribe button also if you guys are subscribed already tell someone that you know that's not subscribed to the channel hit the subscribe button let's do an experiment to see how many new subs we can get in one day but yeah i appreciate you thank you for all the support as always again the video for today hopefully we can get some dubs in snow day and start off our placements right hopefully mark will carry us let's see how it goes all right i can't wait to see how this goes i'm actually not sure what to expect it's been so long i i've not played this mode in forever it feels like but i know that for like kickoffs and 50 50s on the ground you have to just drive into it i do know that i knew i know some stuff about it but i'm definitely not pro level in uh in this mode maybe i am i don't know maybe i have more skill in this mode than i think i'm away middle though i'm trying to use the same ideas that i use in normal gameplay it's got a ceiling shotting with the puck okay playing already some some pros here this guy's bumping me try to arrow for this don't really know wow that's not how wow that what not how i expected the the puck to bounce there try to fit this on the wall not bad this guy's chasing me i wonder if this is a game plan it's not going to work though because i have absolute gods on my team when it comes to this game mode this guy is just slotting it from the ceiling what a read wait what this guy's crazy fan the squirrel what a read i love everyone just starts typing as soon as the goal goes in let me know if you guys want me to start like cutting down my videos to like strictly goals if you guys don't want like the entire gameplay commentary i know i've always done it that way where i've always showed you the whole gameplay but you guys want me to just cut down goals and like good saves and like the important stuff i could do that and play more games and maybe it would be more entertaining for you guys to watch um but it's completely up to you guys really i don't mind i could show like the close calls like the near miss shots um just the important stuff you know kind of cuts out the in between back and forth ping pong stuff that you guys might not like to see so let me know down below if you guys would like to see me try to do a little bit more editing in terms of the games and show you guys just the the more entertaining parts instead of you know the entire game i like to show the entire game for learning purposes i'd say it's a lot to learn from right it's a a thing that i would have loved to have when i was a player coming up having a pro talk through their entire thought process for 800 plus videos i've already done and show you everything you have so much to learn from right you have infinite infinite content to learn from usher snow day video yesterday i think it means a drop shot but um yeah you just have infinite content right so for me it's something i would have loved that as a player coming up but um you know you guys let me know if you want to see me just edit it to show more the entertaining parts instead i could definitely do that or if you guys want to see me just keep doing the same thing i'm sure a lot of you og guys would love to see me just you know maintain the same kind of video i've always done because a lot to learn from i'll have a lot to learn from right but uh it's completely up to you guys let me know you had a merc kind of clean not gonna lie this thing feels like a big golden brick of happiness try to go for this i'm not confident in my reads at all in this mode i think bumps on the back wall on this motor op though you hit it around the corner you just go for some bumps nice good place though try hard man big kickoff win wait for jean here yeah i think that would be weird though i'm not like thinking about it how weird that would be i'm not showing you guys a full game i've never done that before i've always showed you guys everything that's what a lot of youtubers do it's it is better for like people in general to like cut down to the most entertaining parts that are showing the whole game but i've always tried to have this channel out there for you guys for like learning purposes more than anything right obviously i try to be entertaining as well but learning has always been my number one thing on this channel it might change in the future um when it comes down to like you know little things like making more for fun videos but uh learning's always been one of my main priorities on the channel obviously entertaining is in general what i'm trying to do but i'm not trying to be like over the top yelling about stuff you guys know that already um but yeah let me just let me know down below if you guys want to see me do that kind of stuff editing more of the important parts of the game let's even get a play here again roll around the side go for the demo i think that's like the most op strat in this i've already kind of figured it out oh my gosh what a pinch i can't read it the puck is way too hard to read i i seriously applaud anyone who's able to read this thing consistently i feel like the bounces are different every time i don't even know where this is going to go it's going to go out it's going to stick to the wall that's hard to tell silly shot can i save good read give me a 50 50. take these mid boost pads just going to back up into the ball here should give my teammate a free ball do you make sure to follow we get past from us to be honest not bad at all doctor respect i just realized his name is dr disrespect good guy version bang that forward oh i don't think that's possible i don't think there's a way that you can bang that forward fast off the wall wow like how does that even go that way also so you guys can feel like you somewhat learned something in this video uh a really good tip for boost management that i've been kind of like trying to actively think about over the last like two three weeks has helped me out a lot to make sure i have boost still is when you're going around the map in general even if you're going for any kind of challenge make sure when you land you save about 20 to 30 boost that way you can recover to the next big boost in midfield wherever it may be in your back corners and get that boost a lot quicker so make sure you always have about 20 to 30 boost after you go for a challenge it's a really good rule to try to have in the back of your head helps you out a lot there will be times where your r on zero boost for a little bit like right there you stole my mid boost but in general when you get a boost i mean when you're addressing and going for a big challenge make sure you have boost to recover after the fact like right here might try to pass this middle i still have this 20 boost to do something and go back after it so don't use that extra boost use it to actually recover when you hit the ground but yeah good play for my teammates to be there well played well played all right good first game let's get into the next one we're at diamond rank right now so we're playing diamonds in this somehow but uh yeah let's keep on playing see if we can get another win see how it goes all right my teammates got some sick names we got marshall fart and we got bill nye alrighty playing against polsky american gene i think we had gene in the last game i'm not sure if he was on my team or not early remember demos are nuts in this mode too merc is a good demo car i think that might have been just like an old era of rocket league where the mercs were always the demo i don't know if that's still a thing to be honest but it used to definitely be that way when there's less cars in the game anytime you ran into a merc you knew that guy was about to demo you for five minutes straight so i'm gonna try it i'm gonna be a demomane i could see it being open this because the ball kinda has to roll in a lot maybe i should always play this maybe this is just a strat in every game mode oh shot should i get some pads here when i demo like that though i always have no boost to work with oh trying to get a feel how to dribble this puck but i don't know how possible it is to actually go down the field with it i haven't really free played with a puck before okay let's see we can do here we have time on the wall put it around one not bad we got bumped a little bit unfortunate unlucky she'll take my time here white middle always gonna do is hit this middle so by the way it should be okay didn't get the block but he didn't actually make contact on it so both ended up faking each other pretty much there it is oh on my back one never mind my teammate oh i was about to sauce them up i could tell i'm not really playing like a very good team player in this but i don't know how to to be fair i just like oh my positioning what i gotta flip you said i didn't know you can do that i gotta put yourself off the puck imagine i score flippy stay with the [ __ ] oh my gosh i'm gonna kill me okay one more let's go firm up the spawn no i misread it try to follow my teammates touch here i'll go back now good 50. oh the read uh see it doesn't bounce out a lot of the time it just stays on the wall some those double taps are so hard it feels such a game a chance on the double tap sometimes that's fine it's okay miss for us because we can still just see it just stays on the wall off the bounce trying to play it around them but it's a lot harder than it looks because of that right there it's a good fake for us i can actually play this to the ceiling potentially middle close good pass from us try to go for this control on the wall ah she keep going for the ceiling shots i think ceiling shots are good in this but again i can't really tell what a banger of a shot for me we pinched it i know that you can like ground pinch pretty easily in this as well wait what i keep positioning really well for the 50s the 50s always go up middle when two people go for the ball it's not that hard to read it very rarely goes up the wall try to just drive into this one stay on the ball here same thing another drive challenge what else can you do really the options are so limited in this it feels like all right it's gonna be huge i'm making a huge play here oh i really wanted to get a good scoop on that maybe get a little air dribble out of it good save for martial fart all right yeah we're good oh good control uh might be a goal caught us out unfortunate how's your control though to get the ball out right there we actually air dribbled the puck for a little bit it's fine we got this i believe teammates should go for this works very confusing but it worked didn't play this to the wall looks like oh my god all right teammate don't panic and we're good around two of them to go up the wall try to control this on the wall close oh oh my god what did we just do what did we just do double jump went to the ceiling hit it three times flicked it over the last guy back what did we just do alrighty well that made the whole video worth it that one goal keep it up no i can't i don't know how to dribble this thing all right good goal though to finish it off for sure hope you guys enjoyed the video have yourself a wonderful day or night over the times when you may be watching this like i said tell a friend tell a family member about the channel get a friend to subscribe to see how many new subs you can get today yeah appreciate you guys have yourself a good one
