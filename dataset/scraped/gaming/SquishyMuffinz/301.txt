brand new video thank you so much for all support guys you guys have been absolutely incredible I seriously cannot thank you enough and hope you guys enjoyed today's video and the remainder of this see yogas up guys in the last video we finished off at champion 3 Division 3 at 1265 MMR so if we get two wins two or three wins today we'll get into green camp already so hopefully we can get those dubs let's get into the game hopefully we had some solid teammates yet again and I see we can keep this streak alive and we won so many games in a row this is finally the final stretch two grand champ so let's get it done let's go I want a pretty big win streak here so surprised not giving us like a crazy hard game but it might give us one now this might be the one that's hard to win we'll see everything here is around 1200 anymore nice shot to move forward there shot close I'll just go quick should I beat this guy so I gotta do you really to the ball gotta be careful got a kill 1 which is good we'll have some space nice place wait a minute it seems insane to put off the wall go back now once up should be the place downfield my teammate to redirect or the pass no way what seems feeling it off the backboard should be easy for my teammates clothes okay they're all panic mode not quite the speed we need on that shot but it was a good attempt I'm lucky I got 50 by our own teammate oh no to be in but they should have get some pads here shall I keep playing solid we're getting opportunities they'll come right away wait for our team you behind this here get to the side to the side again or a tree inset good touchdown field I'll just go for this real quick I'll leave everything is back both going toward our side anyways you're gonna have a little bit possession just leave it there should I do clothes for my teammate I'll likely to what's position aggressive it there because if I did miss I was gonna be really good for us gonna try I should have yeah I trusted him to be there again kid going wrong obviously he's not there hey hi I should be cool nice joke those worked really well they all expect a shot you hit it high lofty off the backboard if someone's gonna be ready for it these are all super solid or plenteous as well hopefully we can hold onto this Lee this will be huge man if you can get two wins today that should be GC in the bag alright this again off the back nice and floaty nice finish let's go to this series kind of height though like what are your winning and everyone's actually they're four shots they should be there for it's super high I should really like it it's a fun challenge in that aspect where things aren't going well no one's really there for anything it's definitely rough I think once you get to this rank it's a lot more enjoyable gotta watch that demo down this we gotta try to hit it around everyone he's jumping as well so I'll just hit it around that guy she's gonna finish it off dude let's go get finishes from from Patrick really well done that is what I like to see this should get us a good chunk of points where 1265 if you get like ten ten to fifteen points in this I'll be massive but still focus on the game because they could definitely still come back gotta be careful stuff like this definitely spooky hit it around second I don't want to score that in here obviously but I think I can get the redirect its absolute best case scenario I just flop this middle honey was gonna be there that's fine it was worth a shot teammates weren't quite ready yet or one of them got killed I think I'm not sure I'll remember keeping it in coming up for the demo on that guy keeping a lot of pressure now trying to keep pressure you again I'm gonna go back sorry teammate itself a lot of  got the corner as well good job to keep that in single down that's not gonna play middle the redirect close you try Patrick was kind of waiting on my team is shot which is a good idea there you trusted him she doesn't wait for that he just goes for the shot directly off maybe probably be cool it's all good they're really long be sure good challenge team it's not quite middle yet so I'll try to be in a spot where I can kind of support never happens around one around two and a sec Rowley oh I couldn't get the second touch nice follow-up job it's me okay for this quick I like to try to get two touches on um bowls like this pop it up I think that guy was ready I should've left it for him what's rule unless you're like higher grand champ you're not quite ready for the follow up such like that when we're touch from Patrick nice exactly what I just didn't hit it around though that's good straight middle off of that gonna bang that'd be careful off the backward nice and easy finish I've seen him score these place how's the sweet spot really good game all around I'm really proud of my teammates what they they're pulling off this game good shots we're ready for all my passes so I like to see I'm saying behind should be the game it's gonna fake nice I got the kill as well let's go that's huge how you boys did we get from this let's see that could be a massive game you got 15 points oh you're up to 1280 I think one more game one more game guys I should be granted one more game let's go or champy three Division four off of that one more game and I think four grand chips let's get into the last game what could be the last game of the series let's get into it see how it goes hopefully we get one of the same guys on our team hopefully it's patchy like I was banging shouts let's go dude no way we can't win this there's nothing this you're playing memory and flight and the make is score there's no way when this or LCS Pro and we we have no way of scoring so we gotta hope that his teammates mess up really bad they're not gonna hold on somehow but it's gonna be a very hard man we had to lower mm our players as well it's gonna be all over the backboard yeah I don't know about this King yeah this is not gonna this is not gonna work this is not gonna work he is the higher air more players he's no CS pro as well as me of course but the problem is I can't score it and my teammates are clearly worse than his this is bad not the game we wanted at all well see we can do though I have faith not much of it I'm starting to have none of it at all but I do have faith we're gonna need some really lucky goals here I'm gonna gang legitimate goals I messed up my photo signing out the corner I yeah I don't know he's probably gonna keep cubics old sinner sinners don't even win without being able to score especially this time when the game thinks that I'm a higher mark player than him because he doesn't play this game mode but I can't actually hit the ball so I'm useless so the game makes it unfair to begin what content adds that element it's even harder well it's not over yet not quite yet nice I just hope he gets to aggro keep its aren't around to help yeah they're gonna be too slow in those battles to shoot every single time just you took forever and this is the match be fun can't believe it no way please no you gotta finish those men that's wide open that's good you may do you mate please dude we gotta be more aggro it's so hard man I just wish I could score I had somebody opportunity once you know boost it's fun so you have beat see miss came so close twice now little bro it's over yeah I'm actually down to forfeit we're out within this game I don't know man I don't even want to queue another one cuz we're not gonna we're gonna keep finding games there's impossible to win against him so it's not even worth playing them I think we end it there and I'll come back to another day try to get two grand champ another day but that's fine we'll take the one from when we division down back to the division 3 but it's all good I think we still were still positive a point or two after that but that was that was just not a winnable game it will never be a winnable game when them Amar's like the game thinks that I'm a better player than memory because of Miami Mar being higher so that's gonna give him the better teammates and I can't score so I can't even use the skill that I have so just gonna be on the middle game or on the board there's no way my teammates are slower than him him alone he could literally one be three so it wasn't really winnable game it's all good though no big deal I'm gonna end it there for now and in the next video I'm gonna queue at a different time so gonna have to deal with that the whole situation of this happening and hopefully we don't run into someone who just makes it impossible to win because in all honesty it will be impossible if he just runs it a pro player every single time but yeah guys I hope you guys enjoyed the video for today in the next one we should should be able to get into grand champ we should get back up to you know the 1280 ish mainevent more wind will get us into grand champs so two wins in the next video will get us there have yourself wonderful day or night with but ominous whatever you guys are watching this like comment stopping to see you guys all in the next one I love y'all peace
