you notice up guys so this video is gonna be a little bit different be my first ever top ten type of videos this is my top 10 favorite goals on my time from c9 in the our LCS these are all our LCS goals not a single one is from another land all our estate related so these are all in my personal opinion my top 10 favorite goals in order are the ones I like least to the most but there's so many goals to pick from I that's a lot out but these are the ones in my opinion that were the most impactful and looking back on everything they meant the most to me in my career so far before I do hit into that though I wanted to say thank you so much for all the support on a channel Rama so 800 thousand subscribers thank you so much making that a possibility if you do enjoy this video and my content in general make sure you do hit the subscribe button if you're not subscribed already I appreciate every single one of you guys but his head straight into the video alright guys so number 10 is from this most recent season of our LCS verse energy esports which is my current team now but this is when they had a terrible policy of course and pretty much what happened was when into overtime I was three minutes long it was super intense super sweaty and I ended up pulling through with a double tap to secure our first game of the best-of-five series and this was massive we're trying to stay in LCS because my team was struggling as a unit so we're having a tough time we really need this win and this is a pretty impactful double touch I'm looking back on it this is a pretty big one for me and I really do enjoy watching this one back I think it brings back good memories with the squad and how important this win was you know we're all trying our absolute hardest to win this to make sure we can secure a spot in our LCS and have it at least a chance at playoffs so yeah let me put the clip for you guys this is number time and torment couldn't read it off the backboard that was a golden opportunity now squeeze what a blame Oh squishy this is exactly what you expect from squishy muffins perfectly placed into the corner the defender the middle of the net absolutely dazzle my squishy shot and cloud9 take the first game against NRG Wow alright so for number nine this is one of the cheekiest gold I think I've got in our LCS the first fake was so nice a little power slide make the defender think I'm going full speed that I turn away pop it up and get that little flick on the side it's just so nice to look at I love the way that could react to it as Quinn is such a good caster in my opinion honestly the way you hype out every single play it really really like made you smile I don't know because you just can't tell how much he enjoyed rocket League like just he was so passionate about the game and sometimes he would fumble overs where he'd shave but he was always super passionate about the game and absolutely loved listening to him like I said this is number nine and it was against out of style my ex teammate Latinos any other team and yeah enjoy oh I need to put on the goal don't squish you with a thing past one can he get it past Johnny as well little play from squishy 404 cloud nine this is just such wait who is she that powers fight it is so good it's so good so clean hyper number eight this one is against we don't girls in our season six lower bracket roundness is on the lower bracket finals match to head into the grand finals so this is a massive momentum boost in my opinion we're getting somebody to go like this and obviously that momentum is massive for any team on line when you get good goals like that just brings the team spirit up like massively it's honestly so hard to explain how much getting a really good goal can help you out but this goal was huge in that way I think and there's a lot of other double taps that did a similar thing for us in terms of boosting our confidence and boosting our morale so I'll just played a clip for you guys but it was a really good redirect I'll begin makes beautiful pass so let's just head into the collateral quick go demolish on offense it'll spawn in the back you heard them on the desk talking about a woman gimmick tag-team the fourth one not very often do I genuinely have no clue it goes bad to happen what on earth swifty the pace he had in his car but he was still able to predict that get underneath it not overshoot it Shore goes up and it looks like they're not stopping for number seven we got ourselves a nice little lumpy three clutch to tie up the game with very little time left on the clock and we go on to win this game as well it was a pretty huge play this is a super impactful one and to me they have tackled ones are worth more than any kind of cool goal is to be honest is a huge one for us in terms of momentum so I'll just play the clip for you guys but it was a1 b3 around all three defenders and it was just this is a really cool moment looks - for this the crowd went crazy like I felt the whole energy of the stadium it really just revitalized me because I wasn't feeling good this whole whole weekend at that RLC I was a super sick I had a bladder infection and it was not looking good for me I was not healthy at all and that really kind of just brought the energy back enemy the whole crowd just lifted me up so I just played a cup for you guys but super happy about this one created but it wasn't enough now squishy air dribble pass into the middle [Applause] squit she with the time all the flip just to get behind the center and drana key didn't even know what to do with that fall at tap hole is rotating back in the net he's expecting this gripper of a shot into the middle lower left-hand side and wish she just goes right over his head brilliant execution alright this next one comes against Space Station in the most recent season of all CS and they were in my opinion considered the best team in na by most people I would say and this is a very hard shot to hit against a very good defense so I'll just let it go for you guys which is the super tight angle double touch I was just trying to get it as fast as possible over the first guy and I was able to follow it up and get a really good shot over the next so yeah I'll just put a clip real quick v norman sets us up squishy now through the air onto the back were looking for the double tap drops it down there squishy muffins starting off hot squishy has been the shining white for cloud nine for this whole season and this one oh use this boost perfectly that was a picturesque double tap it does not get better than that all right for number five we've got an incredibly tight angle table touches against TT we absolutely needed this win for our top two hopes to stay alive and it's tied up the game for us I'll just play the clip not much to say about it besides it was just a really good goal and honestly didn't expect it to go in so I'll just play it I hope you guys enjoy cloud 9 though they answer with some pressure just can't come away with anything yet but this time they're finding each other in the middle of the that might be the shot of the season for squishy muffins an impossible angle to keep their top two hopes alive squishy is nuts alright for number four we got ourselves a beautiful little irritable into a flip reset I think this might actually be the first superset or else it's like I'm pretty sure it is I'm like 99% sure it's the first would be said ROC of slant which obviously makes this go a lot better but we end up hitting one later on in the tournament which you may or may not see later on this list we'll see might be a little bit less boiler but yeah this one was one of my favorites from our Lestat season 6 and also season 6 obviously won that championship and nothing but good memories with the team there got to make sure we include more from from that land so take a look at it it's just a beautiful pass from torment I believe into a air dribble flip reset don't Norma gets this one away squishies airborne keeping it here in the midfield giving himself options he's got oh my goodness slippery set off the defender he pinches it if there's ever a player to do it it's going to be squishy he gets it he bounces up he gets the dunk with the flip reset right at a game three squishy for number three we got ourselves the flip reset from season six they ended up being finished off by torment so I technically didn't score it but the ball was 99% in it so we'll count it and huge momentum swinging in a game like this you need to get as many goals as possible as early as possible try to hold on to it and yeah this goal is massive and tore great job and put it away it was actually not gonna be in if he wasn't there to nudge it in so let's take a look at the clip you guys have seen this one before I'm sure if you saw my world championship run yeah now when it off to the side cloud9 mounting an assault Squiggy pounces to it [Applause] there's never stage too big for the most talented mechanical players there is in this game for number two this is probably my favorite double touch ever in a competitive environment that I've hit I fit a lot of double touches in terms of like lands and just tournaments in general but this one the crowd man it was like unmatched I've never I've never felt that feeling from the crowd outside of one other goal which you guys may or may not see the number one spot but the crowd was absolutely insane for this shot and it was one of the best films ever to hit this so I'll just play it I don't know how many you guys have seen this one but one of my favorite goals I've ever scored and feel bluie punches that towards the Box squishy meets him gimmicky right in front back to squishy squishy off the back [Applause] all right for number one spot a lot of you guys know exactly what the skull is could've beat solidus play it for you and he's no introduction here's the number one goal in my opinion from my c9 career on him moment the player to invent the shiny I hope you enjoyed this list it's been a lot of fun looking back on old goals with the boys from c9 but yeah we have a new journey to start so hopefully we'll hit more and more amazing goals with Justin a gear in the future yeah it's been a lot of fun guys I hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is when you're watching this like comment subscribe to see you guys all in the next one I love y'all peace you
