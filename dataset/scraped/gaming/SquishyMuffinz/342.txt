yodelling guys before we start this video I like to quickly say that we are on the road to 1 million subscribers right now we are trying to be the second drakul youtuber to reach 1 mil and we can definitely do that but I need all you guys that aren't currently subscribed to go down below the channel right now press the subscribe button press the bell next to the subscribe button so you're always notified when I upload a brand new video and let's make this dream a reality let's get that one mill plaque by the end of the year let's go guys I love y'all enjoy the video please yo what's up guys so for today's video we're playing our first games of the brand new road to grain champ a series that we're doing this will be in 2b - since the majority guy said you wanted it in twos and I guess twos is the most popular mode so that makes sense I currently preferred playing 3s over 2 but for learning purposes and the fact that most people play to use I guess this would be the most beneficial for you guys so to start off I haven't done anything yet this is a brand new account I will be using back and smart I think that way I can use items like a gold rush and you know cristianos don't have to buy christiana they're just using through there but yeah I'll also be using that so you guys can see the MMR if the players are playing so we know kind of what rank threat I don't really know like what bronze MMR is or silver MMR but we'll figure it out as we go along as we see ranks and stuff like that but yeah like I said but today we're playing placements but before we do that let's get into our options I haven't changed it yet but since we're starting off in bronze why not talk about settings that we should change if we are in bronze so let's start off I like to go to my audio settings I already turned down the music cause it was way too loud so that's the only thing I've changed I'm gonna lower voice for up to 0 and be volume others I use at 0 as well crowd volume 0 I'd have my game volume at around I'd say this volume is good I can kind of hear but it's not too loud I don't like it means a lot of so distracting for a video I can have as all the lowest performance performance high performance and then light shafts off whether it affects off and for max FPS just just obviously put the 250 if your computer can't handle 250 put it to the maximum that it can't handle that way you're not stuttering too much in-game so if your computer can only do like one 60 FPS put it to like 150 that way it never fluctuates that's probably your best bet but yeah if you can do 250 PC go for 250 for audio like etc did that interface I used to have this on default but I change this to 140 about two seasons ago to or LCS seasons ago so easily 144 that that just makes the the name play bigger for name plate mode we like to have a son always visible that way no matter where they are on the field we see their name plate that way we know where they're at all times pretty much match notifications I'm gonna do time updates only I just prefer it that way connection quality indicators yes clever load off I'm gonna force default team colors even though doesn't matter so rocket IDs I'm gonna say no notifications yes for notifications no excuse me I use that default ball cam indicator I turn this off I use my ball here although you should leave your ball a lot I think it's useful outside of that that's all the studies that used for there for controls I have my dead zone currently at 0.1 I'd say put this between anywhere between 0.1 and 0.05 I would say that's the most common 0.05 to 0.1 there is no quote unquote best setting it's all preference really but most people use between that range I'd say for dodges own iu 0 point 60 I'd say people use between 0.15 and 0.75 that's normally the range that means 0.6 C that's what about is used for steering sense BG 1.3 right now I wasn't 1.2 for a long time but I upped my control that's on 0.1 so I'm also gonna my sense by it point one as well I don't think that mathematically works out to be the same but it just feels good that's what I'm using so 1.3 0.3 0.1 0.6 C those are my settings for that for ball camera you wanna have that toggle very few people use hold unless they play the old game which is a supersonic acrobatic rocket-powered battle course the only reason why you'll see anyone using hold ball cam as if they put the old one for camera settings right now I'm on 110 to 70 100 negative 370 stiffness it's almost better I use 4 to 6 anywhere between there there's what I matter too much just how faster camera moves in vs. with what I have that off I like to when I'm pushing right look right when I pushing left look let inverse rulers does the opposite so just turn that off for gameplay I love all sure level cross platforms I leave it on for the entirety of the road to grade ship everything else seems good alright so I think we're good here unless proposed to change this are we gonna put all stats okay so yeah that's somebody's for that and for my car real quick for my boost I need these mile for reward guys you know me I need it for wheels I'm gonna use em I'm gonna use cristianos I think for my wheels actually mouth wheels I have elf wheels on my man account like I actually have them and I use them quite a bit and I've been using them so I want to keep that the same I've been using I think obtrusive my blonde I think it's not oh yeah often octane shoes there you go all right so it's it for my my car settings now for my where is it ranked I'm gonna do show player MMR on scoreboard and where else Rose feels show more it appears to ended it match I'll do POV goalie plays as well I think that's probably the best bit alright we're good and I think we're good for that so that's gonna be that I'm just gonna change some of my paint settings but outside of that we're gonna cue for our two V two games for competitive we currently have 100 mm or so we started 100 MMR I didn't even know that so that's a pretty cool thing learn something new every day I guess hey guys sorry about the lengthy intro but before we get in I'm gonna try to match the skill level at which we're playing answer we're playing bronze players I'm not gonna be reeling I'm not gonna be going for like wall hits and stuff like that I try to match exactly what the other players are doing I just have to think like a pro would and try to position like a pro would so you guys can see that all you need is positioning to get yourself up in ranks honestly you don't really need mechanics too much it's more so just positioning and trying to be in the right position and being aware of what's gonna happen next so I'm gonna try to talk through that throughout these games I'm not sure what to expect to be honest I've played in bronze in a very very long time since the last time I did a road to Grand shape and when I did that I was kind of just trying to to win as much as possible I'm trying to just get through the ranks quick that was my whole challenge last time I did this but this time when we go on with the educational approach but yeah so let's get into the games and let's see how these go let's go alright so we got our first game they have a hundred and forty MMR so I'm assuming that this is bronze and we have a wrap of capital is 429 MMR so our teammates gonna be nuts compared to these days and there's split screening I think so I'm not gonna be too much boost here again the kick off already I could tell it's locking let's go try to hit it away from him like I say I'm not gonna Ariel just gonna play as if I'm I'm in this rank they're ready both panicking it comes in it just just pounds it up I love it already I can't go up the wall for this let's stay on the ground like I am in bronze oh no can we get back to this he's got a two good dude I didn't use my boost more I'm overly bronzing it did my name is Kevin right now cuz I don't want people to know this is a road to grand champ thing cuz they're gonna play differently here they're gonna get upset I'm gonna drop him a new problem yeah I need to play a little bit a little bit faster I don't want to overly do it here so for this team it's just bumping me he doesn't trust me at all I can see how this will be tough in like platt need let me hit that their city ties over the area I can't go for this ball that are just the way try to control this this is a problem like I know bronzes can't control a ball like that so I don't really know like the extent in which I should try to play like a prawn decides is really tough for me cuz I'm try to limit my own skill set so it's a lot harder than it looks to be honest to play worse than you're used to but we're gonna see what we can do here it's more about trying to be in the right position than anything but then again I know my mechanics can make up for a bad positioning so it's something that I'm just not very used to I don't need to panic here as long as I stay in front of that ball now we should go just drive it home like I said I don't want to do anything too crazy but a bronze could normally just drive that in like he doesn't need to dribble that I'm just trying to block the angle yeah don't actually have gold rush or gold stones on right now guys it's just back this month let me know if I'm if I'm playing too hard here in the comments is all new to me like I said you just missed that I'm just gonna get my teammates and very bad positions it's full game so far that's what obviously you can expect that that's a big thing in bronze knee like I feel like team a should left that for me but I shouldn't be even trying to touch this ball I get you're just try that ball as much as possible she hit that there let's see what happens see that as I'm curious okay both of them panicked you can honestly like if you're in this rink just hit the ball high and just see what they do like just just gonna pop in all this see what they do here nice try for my teammate they're both panicking so hard like I'm not even near the ball alright it's fine yeah I don't have to go for his balls I'm just faking the seat by not even going my hit this up the wall see it does t make it try teammates I don't think my teammates bronze I think you might be in silver already we're gonna pop out there so you this oh ok so honestly I feel like if you're in bronze and you like you just started playing the game focus on just being able to hit the ball on target like if you can chip it up like that on target that is all you need play it off the backboard someone's gonna miss I would say just try to get comfortable try to get comfortable with your your power slide button if you can quickly turn and just drive it to a ball to pop it on target that's huge nice right teammate see the dust here it's part not gonna be able to go with the wall here he's not confident in himself yet wait for it to bounce it's gonna go close for a fake challenge I can't jump for this ball might do a bronze aerial oh I see that goes in oh my god bronze area I'm doing too good at bronzer girls right now I gotta stop dude this is actually like really interesting to see how much people miss in this Frank I guarantee you the eyes against the silver you'll see huge difference what's gonna leave that there the suit it does speaking at that pop that over them was interesting I'm not doing anything crazy oh I'm literally just driving around if you're if you're solid enough to be able to like just hit the ball forward where you want to then you're good to go dude I didn't want to score that to be honest so hit up around them there I could just wait it's probably to get fake by that I'm shy fig this again I'll pass this middle for my teammate see you this good try he's in the right spot looks so fun I can't I'm not used to feeling missing this much so just seeing it just like it's crazy what passed out we're doing again okay he's going fairy ball it's fine see this off the corner this do they do other sin right you never go wrong under centering the ball on bronze I'm gonna be that forum team a can go for this huge challenge dude if she was challenged from Rapa kappa still hold on from rapper kappa hey nice dude big aerials alright also let me know if you guys want to see all of the postman games that's that's another thing i don't know if you guys gonna see every single place begin I have no problem recording them all so if you want to see any of these games right I just literally like trying hard the whole time I can do what am i doing with my dad were there anything sorry I went autopilot mode I was about a treasured rule across the map that was just like I'm in normal ranked youtuber mode just talking to you guys and going for some stupid rule alright hits off the wall yeah if you guys want to see me play a game like actually try my my heartis in one of these earlier ranks just to see how it end up I could do that for the memes but I don't know one bit too much kind of people get upset but you don't need much in this rank outsider just being able to hit the ball fast and on target so if you can just get good at hitting the ball fast on every touch when you're in this rank like early on you'll get out of this rank so quick and then it just comes down to being able to position so that's just like if someone's going toward the ball back off and be ready for where their touch was gonna go like he's going to wear this ball here I doesn't come to me here imma leave that ball from because gonna hit it to me over here like it's just being able to react to to what they're doing I don't want to area for that go for the donkey there we go thank you rapper kappa also guys the office is my favorite show so that's why Kevin is my profile picture I was gonna make it something that was it wrote to grant chip and I wasn't sure what and I was like why not look at Kevin can't go for this ball popping okay my TV messed me up a lot this year so I already notice a huge lack of trust but that's that's obviously gonna be expected this really I got five hundred and nineteen points for winning one game what I didn't know what a rank that put me at I just got way way more points I thought what okay so those guys are bronze one they were literally the lowest rank that you can get I got five hundred and nineteen points I got put above rapper Kappa I don't know what rank that put me in but that is a huge boost holy all right let's get into the next one see if we can keep it up in our bronze way so we got 619 MMR now so it's games up next what I'm playing someone with way what I'm playing somebody with negative 44 MMR and this other guy has 22 MMR Wow my team is 194 I'm just gonna this up corner to sue they do alrighty so it seems that the most effective strap if you're still playing at the bronze players it's just to use the corners like just banging off the corner roll it up the corner whatever you use the corners no one's comfortable enough to go for the ball that's bouncing in an awkward spot yet so use the corners hit the ball fast those are the the best tips I could give you so I'd say practice in and free play like I already have a free net here for one so I'll just shoot it on target I'll say practice in free play just hitting the ball as fast as possible literally just hit the ball as a banger every single time but that's only thing you really should be practicing and try to be able to have some sort of sense of where the ball is going to end up when you hit it a certain way like I don't know just trying to learn the basic basic mechanics of the game but that's really all you need for for bronze obviously it's a basic rank char learn the basic mechanics Academy that's all you need so here I'm just reversing easy easy touch I want try to put it over to my teammates side yeah just pop it middle let's see if he goes for this ball nice good 50 nice I didn't use any boots there you also guys when you grab a boots just hold onto and so you need it that's a huge huge tip as well don't just waste your boots at all times hold on to the hundred boots till you actually need to use it W wonders especially in this rank where everyone doesn't really know how to play it they're not fully comfortable escapes out the wall I could shoot understand that off the wall see what they do I don't want to just score everything I'm just headed around him hit around to there they both panic team's gonna miss it's fine hit it off the wall look how much like damage of doing just hitting it around I mean like awkward spots I don't even need to try to shoot these balls or going to fake that okay I got bomb dude it is very interesting to see the people people just try to go for the ball in this ring they don't try to read where it's going to end up that's the biggest problem that's why these players are struggling to read these balls I'm not even hitting fast it's because they're trying to go forward the ball is now forward my cars about hit the ball look at that good pass my teammate really good job from him and then nice little fake they obviously I had a free goal that's just that's just showing like wide wide open that off of just to hit off the corner and that's all you need it's a really good touch for my teammate and I should just pretend to go for the ball that was good though that he got faked by that it's kind of a good thing because you're trying to read where the ball is gonna end up bronze Arial yeah I suck in our bronzer I probably with maybe funny though kind of a good idea for video I don't know actually it was a good idea I think people would get mad their point against but like you play like like a bronze on purpose for the first like half of the game and then at the end you just start like tryharding you go for like the whole touches and stuff like you just whip out a random a random like ceiling shot double or something just to see what they do this is console players anyway so wouldn't be able to see their reaction hit up the wall from a teammate I feel like I'm still playing above bronze rank right now and I don't want to be but I don't know how to play worse than this I'm tired of just tone down everything I normally do to make it so that I kind of blend in with this rank but I just don't know how I don't know I don't know how to be worse than this but it's not bad because I don't think we'll be playing this rank for too long I [ __ ] off the wall huge it's gonna bounce middle to probably both gonna miss is awkward antsy made it illegal yeah like you you really don't need to do much this guy's got a good understanding of how to play against bronze you could tell bangs it off the wall that's a good touch like I said then had to hit bangers like that all he did was drive into it obviously if you flip into the ball at the point of contact he goes faster but that situation just driving it's it's perfectly fine again this guy's really good at those wide open goal he's doing a good job just playing it up the corner then the defense is really just lacking that's all I'm really interested to see how like in silver this changes I like the defensive everything changes nice touch I just pop this here soo did you nice [ __ ] put around him again he wasn't trying to block where I was going you just blocked where the ball was good save I'll throw another one on target if they both missed this I'll just pop this up see what they do see if they can get that it's a little high a little awkward good patience look how they're both panicking every time I do this nice stories holding it down he is playing wall they both panicked every time I every time I did one for a little chip like that you don't need to do anything special at all in this ring I don't think there are very many of you guys that watch me that are still stuck in bronze but if there are and you guys just started playing trust me just give it about like you know good to three hours in free play I'm gonna hit the ball fast learn how I get decent decent small touches to the left or right whenever you'd like and you're good to go you don't need anything special at all nice touch from fiery boot can they get that I see clothes you tried to gather it close push B I think this will just be pretty boring for you guys if I was like full sweating just trying to get every single possible we probably wouldn't buy a stupid amount every single game everybody wouldn't watch stupid amount playing like this I just dunno how to start off these red green chips I want to show you guys every single game but I really don't want to just full sweat like in a game I jump for this as probably go off the wall I just want to keep popping in the high to see what they do is they react to a little bit different every single time I could jump for that as well but I don't really want to sin to play middle C what they do with that nice the players move it to my teammate he backed off check up this again then his challenge her story well done the legend himself did I can't go at the wall too high too high for me no all right everyone's panicking that's it if you learn how not to panic early on that's gonna be a huge asset for you man you've been in granddad like the rank I play every single day people panic on really really dumb stuff they probably shouldn't panic for it okay my teammates played it gets me better nice touch huge huge huge huge I think my teammate kind of just messing around now we really have a huge lead yeah I'll probably keep it to two games per video I don't want to make these go on too long whip out a random double tap to tie can't score I'm bronze off' I'd hum Brahms are [ __ ] I went for two of those and I missed both how how I'm fully bronze a fight now I don't know how to Ariel anymore I actually just got on and started recording this so I literally have it won for an Ariel all day it's kind of sad kind of sad to think about but yeah I'm gonna only record those to you for today let me know down below if you guys enjoyed it but yeah I'm trying my best to try to play as evenly as possible with them and you know trying to limit my skill set so that's fair to some extent although we're still winning 13 to do but I'm just trying to be in the right positions I don't think I did anything too crazy or anything out of the realm of what a bronze would do it's just that bronzes don't have the consistency that I have on the ground in terms of you know being able to hit the ball where I want to and being able to challenge how it wants you and being able to read the plate like that so really guys if you're in this rank what are we playing some more plasma games in this rank obviously but if you are in this rank the main things you should work on age is hitting the ball fast trying to read the play and that's pretty much all you need we got 39 MMR for that so we finish out the video at 6:58 MMR after our second placement game and I believe grand champ is 1500 into v2 I believe so we are gaining a pretty good amount of points you might even finish off our placement games at over 1k points I think we'll see we'll see we're going up I'm not sure but yeah really good start to the series I hope you guys enjoyed like I said let me know down below what you
