what's up guys did we play some threesome today with garrett and sosa should be some good games let's get straight into it see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right the first game got ourselves rhett tito and mobsie what's what a game i do recognize everybody in here i think me and garrett are both around top 10 leaderboards for uh four three so we'll see how this goes every game is gonna be a sweaty one i think bound to be how it goes i put it around one put out the wall can't let it go for this but garrett should have i can go back now nice shot from garrett close not gonna be there quite yet i'll just wait for his next touch couldn't quite beat him but i should be okay forget it in theory hard for them to get a powerful shot when the ball is coming at them with power as well you can't really return the same power that the ball is coming at you with you can only kind of have it most of the time it's a good kind of rule of thumb when someone's coming at you with a shot if the ball is coming at them fast don't expect them to be able to get a perfect shot and don't pre-jump like they will because most of the time they can't i should have this hit around one missed the boost it's kind of unfortunate shouldn't be in gotta pass over to garrett not a bad idea should be okay even though i got over one it's gonna be easy about forget to clean cleanup wait for that so tessa does here i gotta wait and be a little bit patient on this right to the side again should be okay processor we got to go to one of these counter attacks here you have this reason to have the ball on the corner like that i full control of what i do with it for the next like two seconds every time in that situation not a bad spot to be in at all very good dunk from sosa unlucky and i'm getting beat to that ball from behind i'll just try and try to be annoying here doesn't need to be perfect fifth or anything it's just keep the ball in make them have to do something don't give them free real estate so to speak nice good job from so so there took a thrust to control took a nice shot able to slot it after should be him again here had to beat him get past the middle killed last back i'm gonna rotate behind here back right boost you'll probably have a big clear sec so i can go for this you can't go for a double it should be fun and garrett should have a free ball to clean up for quite a while here our third is rotating back pretty wide like pretty deep as well so we have a lot of see how much space he has to actually make a good touch on the ball this is a lot further back a lot of situations you can go back here now your gear does should be fun i'm gonna wait for a shot again i'll go now try to make social's life easier even if it gets over me it's fine most of the time i force them to make a touch they didn't want just by challenging early kill one here before going all the way back kind of makes him have to be in a little bit of a panic unlucky i think he tried to pass back to me it wasn't a bad idea it's a good idea to pass the first one though if i landed in a better spot maybe i could have passed it back it should be easy for sosa here take our time on that challenge oops it wrote all the way back here he's gonna beat me most likely can't really challenge see what he does gonna be dead here garrett might have passed back i'm not sure doesn't know what he did put it over the yard side nice pinch downfield it's going to make their iteration much more difficult for the time being almost pushed into a bad spot there but end up working out nice good play until i get this left side all right there we go good first game against the next one stephen keep it up get back to my dubs for today let's see how it goes all right playing the same people even get back to the back dubs here the chief from gear let him get the boost as well i can rotate back for the back left i play the pi see what they do with that maybe kill one as well see you guys there's a lot of time on the ball not a bad touch at all see if society can get a touch on this to be able to nice pass to garrett we're trying to pinch didn't realize this was coming in there i probably wouldn't win again but ends up working out start from from garrett little my points are ready let's go yeah i think the last game you did 90 or something but that goes to show how dumb the point system is you're doing a lot of work one system is not everything and you guys shouldn't think of the point system like it is everything it really doesn't matter nice pass from sosa well done all right back left here i really thought that was in i don't know why it seemed like it was in so much good touch over to sosa i can get to the back boost as well right for the ceiling touch nice pass back says it can have this most likely i can't really go for this quite yet right to the corner now at 50. my back here gotta wait for a potential shot nice how many boosts here back a fake jump try to get a block there it's not really what i wanted to be okay there for a little bit should have this found my boost for now the pass from garrett nice good play got to get this right side i'm allowed to panic a little bit so guy does hear the solo play essentially a flip nice kind of an awkward situation because i wasn't sure if i can get a up shot out of it so i just waited but i think garrett yeah garrett landed on the guy that i thought i would have had to beat so i went quick to it for no reason but it's hard to know that in the moment obviously because i didn't see that i was so tunnel visioned on the ball i found it pretty much everything blocked we got over me sosa was still back waiting wait for tito here last back for a little bit good job just stay grounded there's awkward situation so picture might have helped a bit they might have thought i was gonna challenge not too sure how much it did help but i might have challenge from them tried to bump the guy that had a chance at saving it but i ended up missing but it was the right idea for sure i'll make that last guy back the only guy that could have actually made a play on that to save the ball so well played fun games two really quick back-to-back games i don't have a lot of time to record more but as i mentioned last video guys let me know if you want to see one twos or threes for road super sonic legend
