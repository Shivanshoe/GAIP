oh you up for that again you should never really be up for that be teammates like it you're dribbling try to be fast and it's probably a goal seeing as positioning it's not great you know what you want to sit in goal on those either I'll take the last thing you want to be when someone's dribbling at you there's never a good outcome when you do that but again he was left in that one-on-one situation that should really be happening off the wall something some of you a little bit closer but it's fun we still get to clean up the ball pretty easily go for this just shot with him we have a lot of pressure I had a lot of shot opportunities coming through put at the curve rolled down nicely no one on the team was there to challenge so good job for my teammate to be there just gotta be careful now I'm gonna try to play smarter not giving too many opportunities here ball like this way for the bounce down scale for 50 teammates not back yet so I got away on this okay well my teammates could probably go to wide open net plays off the corner he's up for that it's fun actually would have eventually went in I think it's like I didn't get to it if you missed or something play off the ceiling give this back corner here that's my teammate that sort of wall to him you should be able to hit that off the wall middle team it might be there in time I'll let him go first so I get the fall out touch I watch I play the last back here they're more passive so I can deal with most of this and they won't have to deal with these hard walls shouldn't be in I spy a little bit good job good finish there we go went off some solid defense all we need to do good job for my teammate to be there as well I'm gonna cheat on this Papa's to the ceiling number one it's gonna be a tough spot there any doubt with that well no it's just fun I didn't need a panic that's fun oh wait what dude what my god I was gonna go for the boost I wasn't paying attention I I might be expecting too much it seems like car control I don't I teammates right now but I could score this did I be a montage clip I'm just gonna hit it over one of another alright well we talked about this in the comment section if they do happen to score off of a touchdown I'm just trying to pass middle and I obviously didn't try to score it then you know it's fun we'll leave it you guys said that we can leave it so it's only fair because what if people just start trying to only ball the entire time because they know it to me I mean I can't really stop that so like we won't count that obviously had to try to score it you just don't vote no big deal play it to him for I fake them so hard oh my god they bumped into each other I wish I didn't scored that I was actually the same has some funny dude oh my god that fake they both panic so hard they bumped each other out of the way and then my team and I'm wide open that so perfect usage of that but yeah we division up the division for one more win and we're up to champ so hopefully we can get it in our video off on a good note we're 1045 MMR so it's getting to the last game and hopefully we get ourselves another note let's go we have risky for the biscuit our team that's good we need some risk takers and we have pitbull himself so hopefully we can we could take the W and our plenty that's one of the dudes from the last game so yeah the pings I don't know like I guess no one plays so centered in other regions so a lot of the placement other regions are playing and us East it's probably what it is got their boost she's good for pressure you wanna take the boost when you can but again don't take yourself super fighter position to do so want to do it absolutely necessary nobody do much on this ball so it's good that my teacher took that for me I took my boost but this is the time that should take to get some pads here say I'm in an awkward spot see me still gonna play a little bit you guys look solid at their mechanics so far from what I see most guys seem pretty solid I'm gonna back off here let the touch this not gonna be too dangerous I'm gonna play this off the ball one more time here just close your middle close I also kind of want to see how ready people are for like direct passes to them not getting high ranked trust my team no one's going quite yet but it's fun fine block the angle I saw sixty bits to work with as well so we're chillin I got this one full I'm gonna go for this - oh good my teeny one as well I knew that that ball regardless was gonna force the ball to my team it was worse than my others he may went but again I could have waited as well so wasn't a funnel for that no boost oh it's the big fish but we're good only bad part is it kind of makes us get stuck even harder because they got one of our boots off of that so we're kind of stuck having to grab pads here around one close team it's your turn Austin let's go risk it for the biscuit big plays yeah it's gonna feel so nice in there like trihard right a great shape after this and threes being able to score what everybody want so many chances we could shoot this year's we're trying to be good team player I go for the balls I need to go for take their boost try kilos gone the way back or bumping let's actually get to the lady I'm a really long time there we go free goal because of me he would he would have been back but I was tossing him around good job for my team creating a little play there so I like to seek and we're starting off on a really good note this game 200 up already I want to get quite a tit on the wall this is close to and this guy's also closer that's my cuter just wait so everyone's gonna have a touch I take the boost just back off good job my teammate I'll be behind I mean you should go for this ball no reason not to pop it off the backboard go for two bumps said okay like everyone get some bad social standard new boom I missed shot I got too quick to that and need to again it's a peds they're not I'm gonna go for this ball they can they have no shot attempt afterward they just off the backboard and I killed the other guy here we go wide open that's the plate never fails hit it around to there just go straight for the other guy and there we go let's go this what I like to see camp 1 div 2 already we're up to 10 72 mm our super solid stuff all round if we can keep this winning streak up what we've done this year in no time we are teammates bugs super solid that game all credit to them of course and yeah hope you guys enjoyed I'll see you guys all in the next one have yourself a wonderful day or night whenever tavernas when you're watching this video I appreciate y'all and all the support you guys have been showing me that you guys are insane as always and yeah I'll see you guys on the next one like comment subscribe and peace you
