closer and closer every day and it's thanks to you guys so thank you so much enjoy today's video love you yo what's up guys gonna be playing some more tuesday with gimmick should be some banger games again let's get into it see if we can get some dubs and see how it goes all right plenty it's alright and salado for the first game so these are two uh pretty solid players they're both up there in terms of their uh mechanics and skill in general so they're both good be a good game beating that touch because games kind of stuck on their side there so i'm trying to play this smart good bump from gimmick good try at least it's not gonna be in it'll be fine he's up for that you make sure to have a free ball 1v1 another 1v1 you just slice them up over and over again nice i'll be mid now it's a good amount of boost just waiting oh if i didn't get bumped there i think that's probably a goal good try from gimmick i try to pressure it quick should be good that's fine there's no real danger quite yet you could just control it nice there's a lot of what twos is now just controlling the ball over and over again and if you guys have been watching my videos lately you'll see that it's a lot of what it has been there'll be an occasional like passing pill you have to defend their shot like they have to defend gotta go back for this one it's a little bit awkward now should have though over one try to pass the gimmick to play from him i didn't pass perfectly so he wasn't able to shoot straight off of it could have been better for me should have been better for me i should say i know right away that it was bad gimmick should have this if he does it's pretty big all right they like to go instantly it's actually good for us i think it's gonna give us a lot of opportunities like that in this game i'll let them go for this no danger of letting me hit that at all so i just make it as weird as possible for them killed one which is good they're just barely getting back to these touches that end up being goals but we have a lot more of the pressure round one good challenge for gimmick like we have all the pressure here they haven't even got another half for a while we just got to get a good shooting opportunity that's the main thing that's fine like those challenges i'm not even worried about them winning because eventually just goes to my team anyway if he can bait this for me it'd be good all he needs to do make him do something like show his hand early uh i went for the placement on the shot let him say that's a gimmick should be okay yeah a lot of these hits don't have danger to them so you you shouldn't act like they do you shouldn't react in like a panicky way right you try to control the ball when you can patience is honestly everything nowadays at the highest level like the more patient you can play the more opportunities will just come your way off of just straight up patience there's nothing to panic about i need such as really even though it does seem like they have a lot of pressure right now over one killed him and there we go we created a good opportunity there by using our time and no part during that was it like a close save or like a really difficult save not i don't need to use my available good challenge it's gonna way back i'm really far away here but i don't need to be close it's good i don't have any boost now but still not a bad play that we're making here trying to give me the ball for free nice you gonna have one more maybe that's fine try to just get in the way of this 52 of them gonna fake here give me get the ball nice take my time on the wall let's get 50. i'm gonna fake this same situation i don't need to dive full speed at that even though it might potentially be a swan opportunity i don't need to die full speed with that we have a goal lead here no point in risking it you make should be okay here i got one for a bump but it's not a crazy dangerous spot to be in unlucky yeah it was it wasn't lucky lucky on their part a little bit but that happens we honestly played all that game out pretty well they didn't have any opportunities up to the very last moment even then probably shouldn't have went in it was unlucky on our part a little bit so i played across the gimmick side he has space there so you can make something out of it it's gonna fake again free bought a gimmick off the fake kind of works out as a has a pass got his boost there should be okay your patience there's two of them all right they're just faking oh i thought i caught him out there thought maybe he moved out too far should be okay for a game you should try to help me not quite the power i wanted if i got the perfect touch on that i think that's a goal i'm not sure though there we go good play from game to get there yeah that was a sweaty game uh honestly there was really no danger at the end there if the challenge from gimmick was like it didn't go the way it did obviously because if he had challenged it properly even if it got behind him not that he even challenged it bad i think it was unlucky the way it pinched him but if that just got around him i have a free save um if you fit these out to the left or right it's fine i can follow it up easily you know there's really no downside to it the only way that goes in is if exactly what happened happened which is like a one out of ten thing that won't happen very often there's not much i can do about that i said it's pre-jump there which isn't going to be a smart move because there's so many other options that i have to cover right but anyway good first game against the next one stephen keep it up let go they go they kind of expected that these guys are the highest mmr players on right now they're both 22 2300 mmr so let's even get the back-to-back win here try to play this off to the left side the gimmick is gimmicks waiting which is a smart play you should be able to get to that nice get the boost first trying to fake him should be easy save there we go oh my what a save i actually got the perfect flick there and he still got there i figured if i challenge that it's gonna go off the wall pretty fast i mean it is a little risky in some ways but most situations gonna be fine it's a good 50. it's not just a 1v1 not a bad idea on the flick okay i'm not there though i moved out i was on me i should have been there i don't even know if he's trying to do that to be honest it looked like he was trying to flick and he messed up so he's like okay i'll just go for the bump and i guess it worked but slightly started unlucky in a way but it's still a good play from him not sure if he was going for that if he's going for that really good job but if not still good job it worked you recovered out of it i'm gonna toss a shot let me get that one now there we go good play let's get patience i know i didn't need to touch that ball on the way out there and gimmicks coming in he's gonna take his time on that he's not just gonna hit it away for no reason you know it's okay to slow down sometimes you don't always have to be going full speed it's not what makes you a faster player just driving full speed always it's not what it is being fast is about positioning right and being smart about what you decide to go for i'm gonna fake this i'm gonna try to give gimmick a free ball here should be okay you gotta have a lot of trust in your team when it comes to baiting out balls and high level play that's why solo queueing these days is a little bit harder than it used to be because it is hard to have the same trust like for me personally it's hard to have the same trust in a social teammate than i would in a pro right or else i wouldn't approve sorry you guys know what i mean i'm trying to say that i hope i hope i'm not butchering what i'm trying to say but when you're baiting like that you do leave them in a vulnerable position for a second but it is going to give them a free ball but you have to trust them i'm making the save and then getting a good control out of it that's the the sketchy part about it shouldn't went for that but i got the bump so you're not gonna be able to follow at least not well i could bump this guy now left 15 minutes on 1v1 all right you still do so challenging give me somehow i don't know how that guy was still challenging gimmick i'm not gonna lie i didn't see i just assumed it'd be a 1v1 i actually want to see what happened doesn't even show that guy landed having no boost so i figured if i challenge or if i bump the last guy back you must have a free free goal most likely because other guy just landed no boost that guy's getting bumped it's going to be one point situation should be a goal but didn't happen how i expected it to that's fine trying to kill him now you make shibuya to beat this guy to the ball feels quick nice gonna wait for his touch now all the pressure on him to get a good 50 year i'm just going to leave it i don't even want a 50mm i'd rather wait waste his boost i get a free bot of it in the end i touched a round one it might be a goal for them i don't think i can get back it's okay though it was an awkward spot for giving it only thing you could have done different there was just fake challenge probably but hard to know that guy's gonna beat him all good tough spot to be in i don't think it was a terrible touch from us either off the wall there it's fine free ball for gim gonna be a 101 for a bit good 50. could have went right away i probably should have in hindsight but ah it's unlucky i didn't want to touch the ball trying to just go for the bump it would have been a goal i don't know if i can get back gotta remember one that's pretty good shot now good try no boost you oh it's just internet okay good save from gaming i don't know like slightly unlucky things are happening but we're putting ourselves in weird spots which is like leading to those things if that makes sense i see a fake though i know i didn't need to go quick to the second one there's no way his team is going to be full rushing that he's not going to be expecting his first teammate to get beat there so i need to go straight away kind of use that fake to my advantage so they go here help gimmick if it's around me it's actually better because it's straight to him i'm trying to force out you know almost all of his options give him only one option that's just to bang it to my teammate or not hit the ball he's gonna have a boom here giving us away he's lost back for a little bit so should be okay though he's a lot of time now he probably knows that so he's gonna just dribble good fakes over one gimmick has another free ball nice all right we can score here they're constantly playing reactionary off what we're doing so we have a lot of opportunities to get a goal potential goal here just hit a good touch here should be okay with a 50 close almost just straight in off that honestly really good 50. all right for the back to back epic overtime that was next level so we like to see the most epic finisher of the video back to back wins with the best goal you've ever seen just a simple cheat so just a empty net that's the beauty of cheating in twos if you do it properly and the kickoff goes properly for you of course yeah that's gonna be all this guys i hope you enjoyed having yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is when you're watching this like comment subscribe and i'll see you guys on the next one i love y'all peace you
