yo what's up guys so a lot of you guys actually asked me to do this when i mentioned that we won the major so today we're gonna be going over the final game of the rlcs x major this was the game to win it all this was game six so we ended up winning the series four to two i'm gonna be going over the little things you're gonna see examples of like the nerves you might experience when it comes down to a major final or a huge tournament like this something that means so much uh for the whole season the nerves that you'll see throughout it and it's all pretty natural stuff that'll happen you'll definitely be able to see examples of like the nerves coming into play and on some mistakes here and there even from me someone has played for a very long time people like garrett everyone makes mistakes in a situation like this comes down to who can make the least of them uh but yeah when i get into it i'm gonna try to explain the situations and my thought process the best i can i'll try to stay on my pov um but yeah that's pretty much it we ended up a little bit backstory guys this is actually the second series so this is a double elimination bracket so how that works is if you lose once you drop down to a lower bracket and you can fight your way back up but you have to win two series in the grand finals if you lost early if you didn't lose early you have two lives when it comes down to the grand finals so we didn't lose early our bracket ended up looking like playing against version one which is my old team so gimmick torment and calm is the replacement they got for me and um we ended up beating them and a game five is actually close game five we actually did water come back there then our second series uh which ended up already being the winner semifinals was against space station we won that four to two i believe and then we played against envy to make the grand finals and we won that four to two as well um so that's an envy down to the lowers and that sent ssg down to lowers as well so since rogue actually had lost first round and their side of the bracket they dropped down to play g2 who also lost first round they ended up beating g2 game five they swept the peeps who's a top five team they swept space station gaming who we actually beat in the upper bracket like i said they also swept envy so they went 12-0 they went 12-0 to make the grand finals they lose a single game on championship sunday they were looking like a very very tough opponent we came in first series and we won a game i think the second game we actually took a game right away so that was huge to stop their momentum because they're coming off a 12-game win streak winning two 4-0 sweeps over the other two top teams in north america so they're absolutely destroying the opponents today on this day they're playing insanely well first killer especially looking like the best player in a lot of the series he played but yeah this is gonna be the last game of the second bracket so we ended up losing the first bracket uh game seven by one goal it went down to the second series where we had to fight all the way down to this game six ot like i said the reason we had two lives and they beat us once but we were able to win the tournament is because we had not lost early on in the tournament they lost first day of the tournament we had not lost so we made it to the end with an extra life we lost our extra life so we're on the same level as them at that point both having one loss and it came down to this final series whoever wins this takes it all and whoever loses it goes home so it's the end of the game no more talking just wanted to explain how that works for you guys that don't understand how double limb works and how we got to this point but his team played extremely well to get to here like i said beating the other two top teams in north america by a mile they look by far the best team in those series so let's get into this last game and there will be mistakes here and there but it's natural and uh something to be ashamed of and you learn a lot from mistakes especially in a big close series like this so let's uh get straight into the game here it's on kick off can i have gear going for this one shut off the bat always turn toward net if you're someone who goes for back boost on kickoff like that always turns more than that right here it looks like i miss but i'm jumping for this ball i would have this my touch would be intended to go off the back wall but i see garrett on my left side and i see no one on my right side justin calls that he has this so that's my cue to leave it i stop boosting immediately as soon as he calls it his back wall gets a good clear downfield and i saw a full boost now in this situation so because i didn't go for that ball i have full boost the ball is downfield my team's actually in a much better position now because i'll let justin go for this that's how good like communication can be in a situation like that get us in a better position off the bat i'm just kind of killing time there i know that ball's not gonna lead to anything crazy but it's not always about scoring in threes a lot of the time it's about hitting the ball an awkward spot for the team especially if you're on your side still you're not gonna get a shot across the field to go straight in a lot of time you're just trying to make it awkward for the opponent that's from justin so here i have two options and in a situation i know shooting is never gonna be a goal but there is a chance to get a bad save to the right side i know geared somewhere toward my right i don't know exactly where but always somewhere to my right so if i get a shot that makes them make a mistake here that's the best case scenario i could also try to pass this like straight across but i do see first color underneath me his pathing probably ends up going right toward where this pass would end up it's kind of right in front of where gear it is so the pass comes down to where it is it gets cut off by first at first probably has a little bit of boost here 31 yeah you can definitely get away with this way of this if i pass so it's a good idea for me not to pass it and i was kind of aware that first would probably had a touch on that so good idea just to shoot and again if they get a bad save on this even just this touch was good because look at turn look at the position he's in actually doesn't end up very good for him he's landing in front of the ball here first killer has to go for the straight away he's gonna dunk his own teammates so it's actually good for us i think we kind of we ended up on top there we end up with the ball out of all this i still end up getting back to and getting possession that was a good play it's a good shot to make that one decision for me that micro decision ended up working out much better because had i passed that and it got cut out it would have been really bad it's a good touch from turin it kills a lot of time this is the mistake from me here so i actually misread this i thought it was going to go out more and i was trying to pass to the right side where i think justin was yes i was trying to pass downfield to the right side i thought i was going to come out uh down this way off the bounce and i was going to pass it justin but i didn't so i had to react last second and flip toward the ball try to stay on that's a good 50 actually not bad at all again wins the next challenge so a good set of challenge wednesday first is doing this all weekend long catching these awkward balls in this corner and just flicking over one it's good to an extent and he's a fast player so you can get by a second as you can see you got by another just me there i could have waited and been a little bit more patient especially that was lost back but that's kind of what first is really good at you can't be too mad at yourself for a mistake like this especially because it did make him throw the ball away and garrett's gonna have a little bit of an easier time dealing with this ball now he didn't have a lot of options by that time it was well played by garrett good boom from gear i to get pads here just someone for a double so he gave me some time not a bad idea so i was going for a bump on the back wall guy trying to bump first off the ball not give him a chance to hit it but i'm not getting bumped off of it myself the bank from gary could follow from justin i go back well just in case she doesn't get beat both my teammates committed for the fifth day so i have to be a little patient i'm not going to dive on it i know he's just trying to beat me that's really well played from us we can get another 50 on this this is like one of those mistakes that happened in these like high pressure moments garrett thought that maybe he can take this ball and hit it around sirocco from his perspective probably or like 150 but he probably should have just left it obviously because i'm in front of him and i have a pretty clear 50 on the ball if he waits justin probably has a free touchdown field gary will be back in a safe position then it wouldn't be any really risk there wouldn't really be any risk to it in that situation but it's a thing that happens quite often to be honest and you can't be too like super over analyzy about something like that it's a very small mistake and there's much worse that can happen trust me it's not a bad thing at all justin's up for this though and first is up for a touch and first he knows that justin's lost back here so i bet you he's just aiming for a beat he is he's aiming for a beat off the ceiling and justin smartly so hits it around them it doesn't go for anything too crazy hits it over to me actually gives me a lot of time on the ball here and honestly if i assess the situation better and took a little bit more time i could have dribbled although turok would probably go for a demo on me here i could have distributed it but it's fine that's not bad because again puts pressure on them and look how bad this take off from toronto is you can tell off the bat i think i called this really early that he missed because i can tell from his his path where the ball is gonna be bad and he missed we didn't get a goal out of it but it's a good try and it caused a lot of pressure on them because justin gets another shot straight off the bat sorry from pausing a lot guys i want to just cover as much as i can so in this situation first hits it toward the wall i get a good first touch to control i'm not just going to hit one hit middle because taroko's watching i can see him watching it so i tell garrett to wait i actually if you guys watch the comments video the energy released uh which i can link down below um i actually tell garrett to wait here i don't want him to jump and make two of us get out of the place so i try to take this myself and just get a 50 50 that goes over to rocco's head so i forced out the player that would have been middle to cut out the pass and now gives garrett a free ball so ultimately he does the same thing we get the ball except there's no threat of it being cut out and now we're gonna have full boost putting behind as well very good demo from garrett they're very good like micro decisions so far very small decisions are making a big difference yeah first it's trying to control a lot out of his corner what he was doing the whole weekend he's a very good once player so you know he's gonna get by one or two players almost every time he does that that's a smart thing again this might look bad you don't understand how threes works but i know one's up for this no that one's up for this and i see first time i left so my whole goal here is to block more of the left side of the ball and just try to go and make him do something i make him do something here i also get the bump on him which stops any chance of getting a double on this and now my team has a free ball and we know two of them are committed to this play adjusting it passes me on the wall and he gets dunked which is a little bit unfortunate but gary still gets the ball in the end if i get the bump here it's a goal hitting quite though really well played from first very smart but it's okay don't get it twisted getting beat on a ball like i got beep to back there is not bad at all if you're first man and you're giving your team a free ball don't ever be afraid to look dumb and get beat if it's not a risky situation to get beat in that's a little bit unlucky so here it might look weird but i was going for a demo on first because again you don't want to leave i see the situation i need to work on the left i don't want to leave him a chance to pass so i'm trying to demo in a way where it's not going to give him a chance to get to the right side of the ball and in doing that when justin challenges this actually hits into me which is a little bit unlucky i was able to get a good touch so again make them have to get an awkward touch it's a lot of trying to make the other team just not feel comfortable good job to turn around control here try to control it on my side get another 50 middle it's a very smart 50. as long as we don't hit too far toward the opponent we're good damn it's unlucky i remember this school this is slightly unlucky so garrett actually had pretty much everything blocked i just got by him the gears pov actually like pretty good preflip to get there it just hit like the much much more favorable part of the ball for sirocco so a little unfortunate but you can't be upset about something like that the 50 50 goal and if you look at the scoreboard so far this game you can see that they only have one shot we already have five shots and it felt like we had almost all the pressure so that's something that i had actually brought up again in between that goal like don't worry about it we got this they've only gotten one shot so far over half the game so we're doing much better than them so far it's a good bump from us kind of like a trade bump where you both end up in the same bad position but it wasn't bad good idea to pass across stroke is an awkward spot it creates a lot of pressure on him well justin to go alone here because i didn't have much boost but once i saw his coming toward me just hit it off the wall in awkward spot yet again kind of what i like to do quite a bit just hit it in a weird spot make things awkward hit it off the wall again for my team i know i can't shoot off that but i know someone's middle and these are actually really good passes even at high level it might look weird these are really good passes like super hard to read for them because they can't tell if it's a pinch of cross and justin actually probably would have scored this it's recorded then he gets it she get blocked that's a really really good block well full time from him good job from us to just keep us in play here garrett tried to shoot off this i think it just hits into me would have been a really good shot me just turning there forces that touch to the side my presence alone often gonna be enough any player turning just to keep pressure like that is always gonna be enough that's a really good touch from first so this is columns again i'm turning toward this ball i'm about to shoot this on that shooting wouldn't really do much to the answer goes in goal but it would cause a bad touch probably to the right side again then garrett could follow it up and keep pressure like that but garrett calls me off i let him have it he has a double could be a shot if he gets this angle it's a goal first killer is falling from up there turquoise up so you know you beat stroker here i didn't actually pay attention to the fact that first career landed back wall so he lands really quick recovers and he gets to beat on me now i'm stuck with no boost a little bit because i committed to that ball which i probably shouldn't have done but it's hard to know the first chosen to land there good for such a game i think it's all game really well first touches on the wall to control kill a lot of time killing about four or five seconds every time i do that you don't want to kill time when you have a gold disadvantage but not a bad idea to do that to let your team get boost um so we got to go to this situation go back here again all right first touch of control good pre-flip got a good air dribble justin was middle and he ended up doing kind of the same thing he hit it up the wall to himself got a good pre-flip touch turn did not make touchy water probably low boost we got a lot of pressure yeah eat zero zero boost because all the pressure we had he was the man that needed to make the touch and gear was ready just lurking as well played from garrett 48 seconds left tied 1-1 this point is probably gonna come down to one big mistake it's what you're probably thinking and i actually probably could have scored this this is a tough shot to get especially in the moments i didn't expect it to be open to be honest i missed time i flipped by literally like a half second probably and it would have been a skimming just straight in if you look at this angle actually looks like it's gonna go in right but it's just too slow so i missed on my flip by probably like less than a half a second and it would have been a goal would have been the the winner probably of the whole major what happens i just gotta rotate back regain gonna be quite a few close misses at the end of this game guys and uh one of them was one of them from me actually really upset me in the moment but you can't think about that it's a good block from us again good transition play i know i can't really shoot that they're both waiting ground they're gonna have to save on that garrett misses so we have to rotate back quick get some pads here play it over to garrett's side on the wall or just inside sorry really good touch to control that and a good follow-up as well hold on i'm justin getting pads here again play this off the ceiling in zero seconds so in a situation i see both of the players i saw first even pre-jump there so i don't have to go for a shot here why would i go for a shot i need backward touch there's no point fight this back wall turns there he's gonna bang it right if i hit this sword net versus there he's gonna control it and i'm gonna leave my teammate in a 1v1 so i'm hit straight ceiling there's no way they can keep it up it's gonna be ot for us to try to close it out here nice from garrett good touch toward me for dressing i can't pull it up though i know that's gonna wait getting good touches from first try to get something crazy this actually would have been a really good shot trying to drift and double jump right here and get this ball shot into the top corner it looks like but look where i am and i kind of blocked that that angle off there's no way he could have got this ball past me had the whole goal angle blocked such a tight angle to get right it would have been an insane shot you can see the idea he had the drift shot at the end there would have been insane uh be careful the mid pass all right is the classic setup someone's air dribbling is that every high level team does know something's air dribbling put a body up doesn't matter if it gets over me i'm not much boost but it's enough to at least bump him get him out the way and now we get two people out of the play here for one challenge very good follow-up challenge from gary i got bumped out by flip toward the boost which is huge because that first has to back off there's no mid boost either so actually forces first to go all the way back which is huge because he's probably the biggest threat in the day so any chance we can get him off the ball is a good thing all right this was actually the scariest moment of this whole game for me um so i die right and it honestly looks like it's in my net i'm not gonna lie the way this ball is dropping i know i have this obviously but first comes out of absolutely nowhere kills me buildings in my net and then someone else dies and the ball's just being shot so i don't know if justin would have had this or not i'm not gonna lie he can't see anything he actually can't see a thing so if turin shot this wall i mean justin jumped really well actually he actually was super patient on this and timed it really well i want to see the whole pov of this so i'm up for this he knows i have it but i get killed it looks like it's in it's not in then garrett also dies you can't see a thing man that's the scariest scary situation to be in but we got out of it we gotta do well all because turn wasn't able to slot that perfectly but even if he did justin was there it doesn't have the whole night blocked justin played that perfectly to be honest in that situation good touchdown field and that kills a lot of time for us now i bet you my whole team is able to get boost let's see all right justin didn't get it but garrett did have full boost now and guerra's next up the challenge that's more than enough in that situation to be honest and girl wins the challenge too which is going to allow me to get a boost so he did enough to get the whole team in a better position play the top left side good hit down give me justin's ball i should rotate out here should be justin ball again that's fine garrett should have this across to me most likely okay i went back in there that's fine actually it's safer play there to go back in net now stay for the pass it's a very good pass back to garrett there look for gear in a situation like this is huge especially in a high pressure situation like a final like this very very huge very very huge to win the whole game those are the plays you need to look for let's counter attacks this is the one that if you look at it for face value it looks like i just should have whipped which i did but at the same time like i should have scored this at the same time in my head i don't know how much boost turn has so in my head i'm trying to get above this ball because i think turns gonna be able to turn right it looks like turin is in net and it looks like it's gonna be able in my opinion like in my view that's what i thought i thought you should be able to turn here to the left and jump up and hit this to the left side so i try to get above that right try to get above the potential block but turn actually i watch this back i didn't realize he had zero so he had no boost so this literally was a free goal i didn't know this so in my head i jumped really quick to this thinking i needed to block the guy and net because these guys are so you have to understand how quick these guys are to challenge everything so first this is a good example look how quick it was to challenge justin's first touch here immediately bumps justin out the way right i just think turns gonna be up for this every time and he never went so you can see i get picked out by the fact that he didn't go so in my head i made that harder than needed to be but he did go it just looked like he's going to have a touch on her right in a situation like this in hindsight obviously on inside his 2020 like i should just be going for the ball and if it gets 50 to get 50 right trying too hard to get the goal straight up here and overthinking the fact that he might have a boost so you know it is what it is mistakes like that happen i have to regain super quick for this because something very sketchy happens in the next five seconds so i thought we literally i thought we just got scored on right here not gonna lie so justin shoots this so straight off that miss i'm still in my head like man i should have scored that for sure i shouldn't have expected him to hit it right i'm thinking like that like man why did i think he was going to get there i should just should have shot it now justin shoots this first gets a very good half flip last second save garrett's coming out of the net and hits toward on that and i have to rush back to this and turn to the other side so i'm low boost saving all my boost here i turn get back to it and i'm just killing time pretending like i have more boost i grab the mid and get back now even that forget good job to just chill now a lot of crazy stuff going on good speed from justin another amazing to save man they're playing really good on defense good pinch from us causing a lot of pressure on them now this is a very scary moment justin has to win this raid he has to and he does it's a very scary moment and he still has control of the ball too put off the back wall this is something i don't want to shoot again me shooting this does nothing for us at all it actually does nothing if i shoot as well first it's in that there is nothing i can shoot in the situation that'll go straight in the only thing that can maybe go in here if i get above this ball maybe pass it to the right but look at look at garrett he's half flipping out if i pass this to the right that also leaves first and it won't be one scared and i and this is all happening in columns really quick i know that i have no past middle so i just go for the back wall touch make it as awkward as possible i don't want to waste any boost on that as well i just want to get back quick save my booster return back and now look i have the ball again because of the touch i made so if i went for a different touch i wouldn't have had the ball i eventually got the ball back when a huge 50 off the air dribble justin gets a good touch to himself passes down and that's the game all because i didn't go for a shot on that one ball it's crazy but this one decision actually makes the biggest difference in the grand scheme of things the fact that i didn't go for like the selfish play of trying to score this goal and trying to be the hero in this situation is actually a game changer because again there is no shot i can shoot here that goes in i i know there's no shadow extruder that goes in so i'm just playing off the back wall and it just causes so much pressure and i can turn again here another good play not going for the shot here i'm not trying to score i'm trying to play into a position where it's better for my team i gotta touch off the wall follow it up i see one up i go for the 50. i win the 50. now it's justin's turn to go slows down really well gets one soft touch to himself touches one more down around the other guy that was gonna challenge and garrett waits patiently midfield for all of that so garrett's view of the entire thing from back here off the 50 justin soft touch to himself pass down and there's the finish beautiful stuff i was played to perfection if you go to first killer pov here the harder it was to actually get out of that situation no boost tries to go for the corner thinks it's fine justin makes the perfect play and he has to pre-jump far he has to pre-jump far and garrett plays in the perfect spot and there you go there we have it major champions off a very sweaty game with mistakes on both sides but that's what happens man these guys are playing insane they're playing probably the best rocket they've ever played and we were able to take them down so that's a huge thing and we did a lot to adapt the series very proud of the team always a fun time uh playing and learning new things with justin and gary i love i love those ooze man it's honestly such a blessing with them such a blessing and uh hopefully there's many more things to come many more wins to come and uh yeah hope you guys enjoyed if you guys have any other ideas and any other videos you guys want to see me make in terms of like replay stuff like this or just fun videos in general i'm down i might have a video coming pretty soon with musty so look out for that should be a fun one that's going to be more of a creative one and i'll see you guys all in the next one love you like
