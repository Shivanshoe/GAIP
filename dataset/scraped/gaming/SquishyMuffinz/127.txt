yo what's up guys so we got super sonic legend in threes we got super sonic legend and twos i believe we're even top 50 in both of those leaderboards we are 50th and 15th in threes right now so all that's left now is to get it in 1v1 like i said i do in a past video i'm gonna do my last two placements today and we'll see where we get placed at let's see how it goes all right we got a good match up here to start we found this game instantly this is a once player from a very long time ago he still plays one so i'm sure he's gonna be very good very experienced been playing since when i started playing way back definitely going to be a uh a good match here i was gonna play we had a lot of time we had full control of the ball controls all in our hands there we make a good play we need a goal of it it's actually a well-timed challenge from him we just did good to get it over him it's a very tough thing for him to actually get away from first i played it to my corner boost instead of trying to shoot but it's fine the challenge got the demo on him just flicks it does put some pressure on him with some shots here there for the bounce another shot all right i guess i'll take it my plan was for him to have to hit it to the corner and then he'd be able to land and get his boost repeat the process but i mean we'll uh we'll take it he made a mistake there he got it back anyway it's kickoff goal i gotta remember to save my boost honking off we have to do it because in threes i don't really do it much again i didn't do it but i don't mind it for that kickoff i did a corner boost here let's try to get a flip get his boost here another shadow of this i don't really want a challenge yet so he does it's the last moment he's stuck in my net now he's in a position where he has to go back quickly we'll use a job to get in the way of that anne's got a flick over me i don't even know how he got that over me to be honest i was well played for him i think he's just gonna be super aggressive though because i played him for probably at least 20 to 30 times since i've like gotten this game and he knows i like to have my space in one so i'm gonna try to make sure i don't have any of that i also just got on by the way guys so forgive me if i'm a little bit rusty i'm also trying to catch the dove though take a slow here good challenge don't think i can actually get back to this unfortunately we have three minutes left though that's fine we've got a lot of opportunities to score to be honest we're just making mistakes not too big of a deal that is to win this game get more boost to me again the problem will kick off for me right now not saving my boost this is making situations a little bit more awkward than i need to be to get down from him obviously not much i can do at that point once i die three minutes though a lot of opportunity for a lot to happen here let's say from him her first touch here should be able to get back to that wait for the ball to bounce once quick shot i could say from him i go for a quick again good save again just camping goal line there just smart actually pretty good touch from us even though i wanted to go up the wall ended up working out not too bad for the bounce here probably just going to go for this again you don't want to give me space like i was talking about take my time here ceiling save again probably in a vehicle it almost feels like he wants me to play in them so i'll put a little bit different it's taking a lot of time so i'm gonna try to go for more air drip bumps it's not really challenging he's trying to play off like empty nets and counter attack stuff like that so i try to play a little bit different should i adapt to him a little bit here it's almost like he wants to display defense right now that's what it looks like at least just fine we can adapt for that stuff time the game is far from over it's 1v1 anyway it's always going to be an element of like randomness to it because it's 1v1 there's no teammates there's no one to like have a system when it comes to challenging and there's no one to pass to and stuff like that so it's always going to be a little bit of an element of randomness to it of course see what does off that it's fine i still have possession here trying to go quick there there we go we have a minute left now middle left try to be careful on a challenge let's try to eliminate the randomness aspect to it and when he's giving me a lot of space like that he's wanting me to play it into him try to take opportunities a little bit better a little bit too hard there should be fine there if we get this boost in the next one gotta watch the bumps the main thing here really good challenge should be able to convert 54 seconds 54 seconds and we got the lead back we tied it all up put the remainder of this game out tomorrow we should be able to catch the win here see he's playing defense here this is the situation that i've been making a mistake here because i first came on i've been playing once much i'm letting him bait me in when i should let him have to play the ball back into me i think it's a smarter play and now i have the ball back and we're in a very very good position moving downfield there see what it does it's only good spot here see who does again what a fake jump cause the ball's above his head here he has to panic a bit pretty good spot to be in here maybe i could snipe this ended up missing i went for the bottom corner the only spot that i had to open debate the flick from him barely able to get back to that was a good first bait on the flick but he's very quick to jump for the second ball every time so i should beat that again a second time i think if i was able to play him a bunch of times in a row i'd definitely be able to adapt to how he plays he likes to do the same thing over and over again it looks like i don't think it's gonna be fast enough to go in wasn't even on target see what he does here i'm gonna try to bait here get close make him do something it's fine i don't have any boost here but he has to retreat a bit take a shot make him hit to the side get the boost from him see if he does here cause he's gonna have a touch probably again move up a bit here try to bait something out from him he's running all these engagements because he ends up winning the next boost every time something i definitely have to be careful of here don't let that get out of hand it's a very good drive challenge and we got it back we ended up coming back in a game that felt like we probably shouldn't have been able to win to be honest we were playing we were playing pretty bad today i was very like rusty first game on like i said heather you just woke up hopped on decided to do my placements and we ended up coming back from that so that's pretty big that's one out of our two placements it's okay everyone has rough games i had a rough game there happens definitely happens and we still getting the win over someone who's very very good at ones and a high ssl in one so we'll definitely take that again to the next one though we have one more game left see if we get the dubs see i guess all right playing rapid i don't plays a lot of ones gonna be sweaty for our final placement game here running into a fellow a player definitely don't have room to play bad here so let's try to clean up the mistakes for making last game try to learn from them that's all you can do start every game with the intention of playing better than you did the last game and you'll always improve right that mindset let's start so far two goal lead isn't much though in one so you have to stay focused gotta stay confident gotta stay solid you think that you've won a game off like two goal lead very early on is the moment they're gonna come back same goes the other way around as well if you think you lost when you're only two goals down then chances are coming back are going to be very low as well not much i can do there didn't have the boost he had all the advantage in this situation it's a good save on the first one though i feel like he's going to go for a lot of air dribble bumps i'm going to be ready for it might be fast enough i think we caught him out we did i thought i like doing that big kick off baited him all the way into my corner i still have 30 boosts i can get a powerful enough shot from there if i hit it right gotta win the mid boost here we have full control of this ball if we play it well try very tough save very very tough safe to get back to definitely playing better after the warm-up game nothing playing better but you can still win this for sure so we gotta stay solid here plays a lot of ones so you got to watch the kickoffs for sure when you're playing someone who's very good at ones you gotta watch the kickoffs that's normally what makes them a very good ones player you're gonna possession off kickoff you have a free 1v1 attempt every single time if you get possession every time so something you got to try to mix up so you don't give them comfortability on kickoffs and give them possession i'll kick off a challenge from him probably the better you go touch this back gotta watch the demo here so i'll play to get around that almost no way scoring off the angle is very tough very very tough one actually to go out of i make a weight on this if he goes just fine again if he scores us he can have it to be honest like that's just a good shot at that point that's that's the way i see that if he doesn't score and i can score off a bit beautiful if he scores it you know he can have it deserves a goal there and i'm in that if it's saveable i'll save it right no boost guess hit it back it's fine with me it's fine all right should be a little boost here so all you can really do is stay near the ball i don't mind challenging that you got my corner boost here to watch demo so i stopped randomly we have full ball control here so let's take our time see what he does i'm gonna pop this off back oh and then my fake jump gonna be above him he's gonna panic it's fine should be okay play to my corner just gotta watch the demo safe to the side again i still have 30 boost so good boost conservation there play it around i'm here i'm not going for a goal in a situation i know i can't score trying to play for the boost good 50 i can play it back to mid boost now looks like a shot to he does gonna have to go panic a little bit take our time on the finish putting the ball in very difficult spots for him and he's uh gonna have to panic in a lot of the situations they're putting him in it's normal to panic i think it's a really good 50 for us because we get possession after and the boost do that there because he has to go for the touch here no choice on his goal line that means i can get a free demo maybe get a shot here it's very tough i'm going to fake this one good read from him didn't even panic or anything all right this is awkward situation i was putting him in but i'm trying to deal with it in like a calm way before we clean up the danger some drive challenges to that get some pads here very awkward spot to get out of here because there's an air drill bump potentially or a flip and either way it's gonna be tough for me to get a situation well good patience dodge the bump there i'm gonna save my boost here i don't wanna waste all of it i can get even a 50 on this maybe unfortunate i don't even know how that went over me to be honest i don't think he was trying to do what he did there he was trying to 50 me and the ball went up somehow so i went on the ground here try to save my boost go on the ground see how the ball like went up it like pinched on the ground upward over me i don't think he was attempting to do that he's trying to 50 me sure he'll take it i doubt he was going for that just be annoying here put pressure four go lead here 40 seconds so if i could just be annoying stay on this ball as much as possible don't give him too much room he's gonna have a free solo play attempt here i'll pre-jump ceiling go down to the ground now it's a good save i'm going to fake him here good challenge she has no choice but to just early challenge over and over again so if i just kill the last 20 seconds here we should win this we still have a three goal buffering in case you got to be careful in a situation like this though because it's very very awkward for me yeah we got to be careful on kickoff here that's why it's so hard because i don't know what he's doing honestly it's just like if he just sits there probably wins that engagement to be honest and i have to do a lot to get out of that and be safe all right and we won the game off that played to the side wall and it should be game nothing you can do oh point though fun match see what we get off that finished both of our placements first one was sketchy definitely a sketchy game second one i feel like we had control majority of the game even though i got closer to the end and there we go we got ssl so you guys so in all three playlists secured it we got sell straight off of our placement games they're 1469 that's huge and yeah we're top 50 we're number 15 and threes are now top 50 and twos and we'll try to get up there on leaderboards and ones as well get up there in all of them we hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you guys are watching this apologies for the little bit of uh rustiness in the first game like i said it was my first two games on and i ended up getting both wins but uh not as clean as i would like them to be but wins a win then i mean you guys sell some matters see you guys the next one i love y'all peace how could i trust you when you hurt me so
