yo what's up guys good to be playing some threes for today we're actually almost at the number one spot right now in 3v3 we are at 2100 and number one is 21.21 so we're actually 21 points away so potentially if we win both games we'll get pretty close to number one i don't know if we can get number one today we'll see that let's get into it let's see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right we got a 21st game here we got ourselves drop shad and remy these are actually uh south american players as you can see are also sex major champion they won the major in south america it's a very good players for sure they're not actually in the nrlcs sam has its own uh own league so the any teams don't actually play these guys but they play ranked all the time against us they're very good we never played these guys in nrlcs though waiting for ajax there i fought on myself passed ours he actually pre-jumped that that's kind of crazy very very tough thing to pre-jump tough thing to read up early again looks like the pattern like the challenge oh you don't like to give you that space it could actually be a good situation for us here let's shoot quick see what comes of it big challenge martial on the wall uh he went for the pass i feel like i was able to score it but lilly's maybe going for a shot there not a bad idea either though i shouldn't try to pass that one middle that was a bad idea look for arsenal forward maybe it could be good placement was gonna try bumped one out nobody followed us up i'm just gonna go all the way back here if he flicks it's actually good for us we get 50. got bumped unfortunate not too big a video though ours doesn't lose this challenge we're chilling still time for us which is smart have dodged that bump there should be fast enough there we go they play from arsenal took my time there didn't want to bang it away arsenal took his time got past two of them pretty much so i did the exact same thing took my time waiting for the very last moment to take the shot and that's gonna be a goal every single time you just can't react to that as a defender especially i don't want to bring this up but especially on the ping that they have to deal with it's like a hundred and thirty 140 most of the time very tough thing to defend right they're on 140 paying 160 actually on one of them so definitely the downside but they want good practice and playing any rank is definitely good practice can't blame them for wanting to play on that ping and honestly nothing but respect for playing as well as they do on that ping gotta stay on this good 50. i'd be scorebook i'm gonna wait though it's a good opportunity to play patient on hoping arson would go as soon as i saw that he wouldn't go that's why i tried to kind of make up for it there we go i tried to go in quick for the shot there not sure if art's trying to pass me or not but it works either way it's the right idea they're in a very rough situation it would have been good no matter what even if i couldn't get the goal out of that it's a good pop good try good idea oh i really want to get the pinch there the pinch middle would have been crazy i'm gonna cook for this gonna be really hard for him to beat me low 50 probably just a goal there we go the right play to make good leave as well from ajax right here about to hit that away he just jumped over the ball which made it probably really awkward for them to read right smart play from him for sure put some pads here nice from ajax gotta be patient here in a fake challenge ours isn't back yet but i made him jump early which is good 250s which is really good there two challenge wins pretty much also should have it's gonna play downfield now they're gonna have an awkward touch on this i'm gonna force touch out by driving up it's a good opportunity for us yet again forcing some bad touches but not also not wasting my position that's the big thing there i don't want to waste my position and i want to force out a touch that they're not going to be comfortable making think again i'm going to force them do something really good challenges on the wall rotate behind arsenal here stay on this ball almost almost crazy gonna be a goal for them probably oh good i think ajax just have a little bit of fun with it he like pre-jumped my um my flippy set there ours got dunked a little bit it's all good though have a good lead here not a huge lead but it's a good one back to middle instead of shooting was a bad idea all right almost could have been bad didn't even see what happened there not gonna lie like the way first one second looking for the bump all right a little unnecessary from arsenal there but we'll definitely we'll definitely take it regardless pretty sure it was in i don't think i get our dribble i'll take my time last guy back i bumped them i think it was going to be barred down probably in not sure the world will never know good first game though regardless should be a good amount of points you guys are all very good players let's go take a look what we gain for that arsenal's not even sl he's actually grand champ one somehow but we're playing all ssls they're all high sells take a look at um where we gain five points five points not bad to be honest might not even pass justin here if you only gain five points per game we're only going to gain a few per game because we're so high up pretty normal but let's even get a little dub here finish the back-to-back wins okay got to start trying to slide off marshall there and the bump attempt is smart there but i have to play patient obviously i don't know if the bump's going to come through play over the arsenal side good idea for a pinch actually could have been a goal directly off the pinch if you hit it perfectly obviously a very tough thing to do but there's a world where that's possible nice a challenge win got bumped off again gotta play a little bit patient here i think this biscuit is about to take it should have one more touch and a flip here play it off the arse play it back down the middle really good soft touches here it's actually really crazy play that was insane to be honest we had so much space on the field instead of throwing it away every single time we played it back down to each other which is something that not a lot of people would do in those situations so it's kind of crazy considering we had no communication and all three of us did that there it's the best way to play that out for sure good challenge for him i try to take my time go for an air dribble really well done from him am i imagine somebody on the top corner of that it's a good read i don't have any boost here got two pads try to stand as far back and fall whatever's going to happen next even though i don't really know what's going to happen next it's not a dodgers bump it's fine though look him out on top there played a situation pretty well it should be okay for ajax it's a crazy shot here still should be fun really good challenge that was like a very risky challenge to be honest his third man there just kind of floated up and trusted himself really hard other kind of confidence though definitely go for something like that not a bad idea would have been a very dangerous situation for them had he not what's smart what most would say is risky and situation is actually the best thing you probably could have done i don't blame them crs here always relying on for the the weird soft touches not gonna be in should be fine other guys too far back should be fine again a little bit wide a shot here that was again very very fast very aggressive play there's no hesitation at all coming from them right now it's gonna be a tough game normally i have a little bit of a a window to take my time on that ball but instantly going for that one and they're working out really well for them right down to ajax should we keep arsenal here if he doesn't go might be a little bit risky that's so crazy to me man so again another situation where most people wouldn't go for this both of his teammates just committed they're stuck falling for a very long time and a third man instantly up goes takes a shot gets to go out of it shouldn't really be a goal in that situation to be honest but ends up coming out to be one so i don't think they're complaining that's for sure but in most situations that should be something that you get punished for not rewarded for it you know that's the beauty broccoli though you never know man things that might appear to be risky don't actually turn out to be risky sometimes there's not to be the right play gotta go with your instinct and that's why if you overthink little situations too hard oftentimes you get left in a a spot where you're confused and you're just sitting there having wish you went with your instinct instinct will carry you in this game man i'm telling you especially if you played a long time nothing knows better than your intuition your instinct it's gonna be good from arsenal probably there it is exactly what i'm saying that instinct right i'm sitting there waiting middle i know he's probably gonna be able to do something with it i'm not gonna go back because i look out of position right but i think it's right that's when i'm gonna do it if i think it's right that's what's right you gotta trust that in that moment that's the one tip no one's gonna tell you that's the the most obvious thing that you should know but most people don't know and don't follow trust your gut i can't tell you guys the amount of times like in school on tests i had the right answer i erased it looking back i was like damn i should have sworn i got it's the case in rocket league too that's almost always right first instinct first thing you think to do is almost always right if i get behind arsenal here right off the left i think much space is on the left right everyone was on the right side for a moment there don't have any boost here but there's only one guy up only one threat in this play if i flick that i have any boost here really gonna get some pads should be fine try to go back off he gets beat here again should be fine get this boost something arsenal can bump him maybe but i think he's going for redirect if i'd known that obviously i went for pass probably not a bad touch from ajax can we help ours here best i can do with how much speed that ball is coming at me oh my gosh i almost just floated in that's crazy gonna be interesting over time either a crazy goal or something awful no in between let someone take this from me nice they don't want to keep air drilling now it's kind of pointless to do so good challenge from arsenal can always rely on them to win those for one more touch middle but effect this there we go so i'll play i have no option high i have no option low let's go for the dead 50 hope for the best kind of fake the high touch backed off last second well but very well played all right good to back-to-back wednesday take a look where we're at on the leaderboards after that played the same uh south american major champion duo over again so we got another five points so we're three off justin we're 11 off of uh the number one spot so again in the next video probably hope you guys enjoyed having us have a wonderful day or night whatever time those you guys are watching this like comment and
