a hundred thousand subscribers now which is just nuts to think about thank you for making that a possibility and hope you guys enjoy today's video love y'all yo sup guys gonna be queuing some twos fourth day just gonna be solo queueing see even get some good games and we're at 20 to 49 MMR so we're almost top 20 I believe yeah we're almost top 20 we're actually getting really close top 10 so not bad at all let's into the game so you can get some dubs let's see how it goes alright we got a solid love you for shooting here you got alpha cap in skills and Brennan's everyone in here is our lowest level so it'll be a sweaty one for sure he's always you baby back and forth past forward there yeah I can shoot there yeah so I like the past side just because I can keep I can keep myself grounded well he could force pressure by going for it so that guy's make a bad hit off the wall that I could follow up if I think it's safe to do so if not then I was back off with my teaming to get back it's really no downside to it unless I messed up really badly pretty much oh shut up place at bottom corner won't ever way to score that there a limit to make it that booze and he could turn nice all right good thing you didn't bump me cuz might have been bad but never in a pretty good spot actually down the defensive the decent block I mean bump though so I'll have to play a little bit more passive here should be fine there I cut a hole into my boost for whenever I need to go for this there we go how's he gonna play cut him up a little bit take our time get touched below one I saw you went hard and then I hit around the other I'm looking to challenge and that all came from holding on server boosters only had 14 left after all that so it's good to try to hold on to as much of your boost as possible I've said this before in previous videos my honest is one of the most important tips when you're trying to become a better and higher level player holding on to a boost as long as possible not wasting in spots where you don't need to waste it like right here I don't need to waste anybody's going back just flip nothing happening that I need to waste my movies for right try to save it until you absentee to use it like right now I should use it because the dangerous spot you can go challenge me so I gotta be ready which I controlled when Tim is not back yet so I want to shower wait for me to get back and then go Fairplay closed took two out of the play and I can get full boost again so it's really good to make it follow up shutter shoot close pumps one out to be really good if I today can get a good hit back middle yeah that's fine should get that corner from him and then that guy's to back off so it's kind of like well be warned in this sense twos you beat one guy and you could secure the next boosts and normally you gotta keep the possession because of the boost I have to kind of back off not because he got my booster but I could challenge my teammate let's make his life easier now is it easy touch to the corner it's gonna watch the mid pass here little awkward because we're both watching mid happens up so I'm trying to kill time my teammates going for mid boost I don't want to panic for this ball I have a lot of space here they're not challenging me yet so that's fun he has to kill their only thing I can go bad is if he gets bumped but it seems to be fun I'm getting bumped so I sit down get a lot of time for my teammate to get back there same situation try to play for your teammates always it's really awkward I should I hope he's not gonna hit it honestly I might to make it the first shot is perfect in that scenario I'm not saving it so I might as well hope for the Miss and trust my teammates you touch and then we got a free goal out of it as well because they all over committed for that play that's a very low percentage and if it goes in we still have a goal buffer so again what's the big deal just risking him having to hit an impossible shot a very difficult shot that's fine did he cut off for his teammate does he get play from him help his teammate out we're still in a really good spot yeah I'm not gonna go for this stuff I'll let him get behind me again it's always a safer play to dunk me probably oh it's fun team it should be back and a good spot should be fine as well nice just holding on to boost here shiny get full it's like a playoff the next play soccer perfect ever happens gonna fake you again nobody for my tunes to get behind me but I can make something happy for it it's not he'll being a better spot to come in right if you rush too early and spots like that most of time that just makes you in a really bad situation right you don't want to put yourself in a bad situation you go wait an extra second and have a better outcome that's definite what you should do I'm just trying to go for bumps a force a little bit of a panic out of them I guess that's fun hit around one play go up the wall let's get a fake room God by me for free pretty much my faking out of smart tries hit this middle it's fine good job my team it to go back you realize that the passes cut off and there's too risky to stay again no real threat I just checked behind me I have a lot of time gonna take this [ __ ] so you can't get it everybody yeah I was a little I don't know it was awkward I should have taken the boost maybe but I had a feeling I think it would have been in a good spot to stop that kind of just assumed wrong I didn't think there was any real danger of it going over me pretty much trying to block blow I can get back now get behind him that's gonna be tough to stop oh good though I destroy as I have 10 shots this game I'm about to me go so I could play more defense at the end of this yeah back there on that flip reset semester challenge like way earlier before the flippy even comes in pretty much so much should be up for that Center bump him off the ball be annoying nice little down there fight a lot I made it so much more awkward so it was a good thing to do trying to kill there we go and if he goes should I have a fifty as well so he put it out pretty smart I think there was a lot of situations that game where you know we killed time for it seems to get behind this but you got to do in soloqueue cubes especially and that's a very solid lobby I think we just put smart all around the goals I did get was kind of just us not being on the same page and we're not challenging the balls we should be challenging as a unit like we're not forcing the balls are properly for each other like I went for the booster to shut us with a [ __ ] from him yeah coming in my teammate wasn't on the back wall to get an easy touch he was on the ground so I made it super awkward for him because I made a miss play there so all right let's get the nice game though good first one for sure see if we can keep it up and get to back-to-back wins let's go all right so we got a rematch for the last few you definitely still go either way I think it definitely definitely won this it's kind of random honestly to just feel that way a lot of the time I always feels a little bit random challenged my teammate any other guys Dave carries back how are you good let it fake the first aerial ready for my teammate to spawn and then I thought you decide how does the goal is a lot of it there's a bunch up there early they have to respect that I can hit that ball over their head right so they both probably backed off cuz I jumped there and about eventually against my teammate being able to follow up getting a good touch there that's why when people say ones are poor and they aren't important but you have to learn how to play with a teammate if you learn to bait the ball free teammate and just play around the wall that's one of the most important underrated skills and feel like that and boost management together and get your grand show so I got a fake front seam in here not back yet not gonna fit that to the corner I could take his boots it's perfect I can't so I'll go back winning that boots battle there would be huge probably got a goal for us honestly but a killing one this guy has to kind of force a play here but I can still make it awkward for him again just making them back off cutter bump this guy he jumps oh he's gonna have the ball so I have to try to get in the way but maybe I should my for a redirect instead or just a hit off backward or better for my teammate good patience you sitting on the right side here now I know I have some space here so should be over to my teammate good try get some pads not gonna waste any boost here cuz he's killing time for me the same thing I was doing for him using for me which is really good there I played this over dome good save really good job him to going back well they're all right he's going back so I'm flip there so that flip is pretty much my green light to go for that ball that's how much I'm telling me I'm not going at that point that's how I take it at least over one I'm not to go for this again that I could just leave now he's coming in good amount of boosts you could do something with them and all the way back there get for this you know it's over me should be back hit the ceiling not some one-on-one my teammate oh if I killed other guy slippery said let's say earlier patience everyone's really smart with defense now they always wait to the very last moment here for the ball I see like I was really good for him like a year ago that's probably a goal every time because they wouldn't go on the back wall that wouldn't be a good spot for it that's good for us horse out of touch County yes so I'm blocking the angle day same situation I was trying to block the angle you tried to hit it over me or estimating it hit the decide obviously so wasn't a bad idea from him the only problem was his teammate was also falling out for a long time and that was situation I was kind of talking about before but you don't want to go for a play until your teammates fully back and they good spot sort of covered right try to get that touch over me but it's not gonna really gain much they could have just waited for my touch to the wall cuz I have to I have to hit it at weight right on target so he could have played it safer for sure and I wouldn't I got them scored on well they got to go anyway good save really good reaction honestly thought I was past him for a sec it's gonna be tough for my team to stop imagine I landed on that like I just landed right under and I can just dribble it up I was really really awkward the only way you could have say that as if he saved his foot jump one time save his foot woulda maybe 50 to the corner because he'd double jump the other a week 50 on it it's hard though I wanted to know you could take that nice I saw Bruce Lee completely even though I had 80 I went to probably once I saw they backed off for my a gerbil so I decided just leave it I knew we'd have a free shot and obviously I would have been a little bit risky if he didn't trust me to leave that for him but he knew I had full boost and I stopped boosting for him so you must have known that I'm always leaving that ball Passover time again nice I don't have to go for this again write to me it's not back only bad part is I could get bumped to you and that's what I got to be careful of such plate as passionate as possible tunas behind me now that's fine now he's in a good spot to follow even if I get done no she can't dribble this even if I get dunked it's fine there's no downside to it make a play going forward and there's no risk oh there we go there works there we go alright she really saw a game - they're sweaty very intense games really good lobbies all are lowest level players yeah hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful date or night with timers when you're watching this like comment subscribe and I see you guys all in the next one I love y'all
