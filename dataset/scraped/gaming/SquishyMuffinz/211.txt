lot but you happen to not be subscribed please do check underneath the video right now and press the sub button if you're not enjoy the video guys yo what's up guys we got supersonic legend and once in the last video now we're going to be grounding our two's games we're not going to get super sonic collection in this video but we'll be getting some dubs hopefully let's get straight into it see if we can get some dubs let's see how it goes all right the first game we got ourselves satyu against iris and somber all right gonna be a tough one i do recognize all the players in a slobby obviously sathu is a pro player so it's good that we got the luck of the draw with that two pros on the same team but the players are playing against our higher mmr grand champs from last season so it's not going to be easy by any means let's try to play smart maintain a boost when you have it so let me plays downfield we can over one i'm just going to leave that now if you get to touch it's fine it's over to my teammate get it from sethi it's gonna way back here full boost i just wait on back wall there's no threat here yet at least i could stay on this over one exactly as a free ball now it's good to pop those because not only does it get over one player but it doesn't just pass the ball over to the team you kind of keep possession in your in your team's hands i'm trying to bait this ball out if it's over me actually a good thing trying to give that to my teammate for free and we gotta go out of it there we go so my mindset in challenging that ball there i just slowed down next to him try to match the same speed as the ball helps a ton that's a good play from sethi match the same speed as the ball helps a ton when you're trying to challenge like that because even if that ball gets past you which is the whole point of what i'm doing there goes straight to your team man it's not it's not a bad thing there's no negative side of getting flicked there even though some people might think that it's not bad whatsoever just toss a shot on goal there force him to have to play to the side i'm gonna wait a sec just don't want him to hit this away that's fine i can go for it now good bumps shout out my teammate out try to play in a spot that he can kind of follow it up that way it's not too far into the opponent's half good hit i'm not gonna go actually i can go now i think he messed up his recovery a little bit so it gives me a chance to challenge i'll grab some pads here get some extra boost should be southeast ball to challenge if not i can get it nice touch i'll shut us down this it's fine not a big deal if i got beat there because again i'm not committing to a play just trying to stay on the ball trying to keep possession is the the main name of the game in uh in two two especially and threes of course as well but in two's possession is almost everything it's fun i have a 1v1 situation go for the bump here get safe from him good job to dodge the the path of my bump there gonna fake this i want to hit this turtle side i get this back now i got the boost as well it's huge so i got both boots from that guy and i hit it back to my teammates so that's a win there i'd say in that situation unlucky that's at the end of bumping me there gonna be over though i'll take time in the air over one like a block this would be good if not it's fine i can just go back now get the mid-right boost should be southeastern challenge good challenge good touch back as well it's especially good because i have the ball we got to play out of it there we go that's kind of the whole idea of twos right you're always trying to challenge that your teammate gets the ball you don't want to challenge in a way where you're you're being super aggressive it gives the opponents the ball over and over again good fake challenge from him good way that should get back into play there you go back wall try to back off now get this lineup pads on the way back should have around 60 boost time all the way back here that's a good play from them good pass i shouldn't have challenged it off the bat that was fine with saturday to lose that but he landed really well there i didn't expect him to land so well good positioning from somber there to finish that off i should have played it more patiently though definitely wasn't a super dangerous situation but we gotta go back anyway off kick off quite fortunate but we'll take it good kick off from sathya so that's the only downside of cheating as close as he did there the opponent cheated close and the guy that went for kickoff lost super hard that's just a really tough position to get out of at that point after it's over your head so what i would recommend is if you are cheating like that in twos make sure you are cheating a little bit further back than where the chaos actually takes place because you can't actually react if that pops over your head like that so kind of be a little bit safer on sheet because even though the chaos was bad you could still avoid that if you're the cheater yeah let's get into the next game see if we can keep it up probably gonna play two more games for today since that one was a pretty quick forfeit yeah let's get into the next see what happens let's see how it goes all right for the second game we got ourselves iris from the last game against hezzie and noah so let's see how this goes i don't recognize the player's another team really but we'll see i'm sure it's not going to be easy one by any means always sweaty games these days and ranked respond back right you play for my teammate give me a free ball might be able to score off of it there we go i had a lot of time on the ball there i was really good even though it didn't look like much for my teammate that was a really good uh play there good challenge to give me a lot of time on the ball to make sure he knows i'm not going for it play safe here on the kickoff [Music] that bounced up pretty well for us like my green light to challenge that at that point i'm trying to go for the double flip reset it's a good try i'll bump on you i'll just get out now slow down the second guy his follow-up's gonna be a little bit messed up now yeah i knew that bump was gonna be dangerous i should have played a little bit better saw him coming at me i just had a little bit of a brain fart didn't react to it the best way nice challenge for my teammate i'm gonna hold on to my boost here it's my green light to go for that good challenges the follow-up good try on the shot i'll turn on this try to control this down over one i'll just there in case he misses i can take his other boost now maybe back middle with speed here ended up missing but it's okay it happens went a little bit quicker than i needed to honestly it was a free net if i just took my time the guy on the ground was kind of flat-footed so he couldn't challenge it but that happens sometimes you expect him to be ready for it we ended up getting the goal anyway the main thing is just always being in the position that it's going to be best for your teammate you know the position they're going to expect you to be in you want to always try to be there and i always try to be there with boost so make sure you are saving your boost when you can don't waste it just for the sake of wasting it it's a good block timmy [ __ ] this forward should be in i'll just speed it up for the points for the hat trick i was there on the left side just in case he decided to pass to me if we needed to speed that ball up a little bit quicker than the defender um or you know just to be there to make sure it doesn't miss but uh either way you want to try to help your teammate like i said even a position that's as obvious of a goal as that i try to be in a good spot i'm gonna try to back off here take the boost if i can help him out here with the bump that'd be good look at trying the dribble actually really weird looking dribble but it was good pop this up once that's a good block i couldn't even see him the whole time time this challenge really well there should be over a lot of time on the ball here so let's use your wall pass over to my teammate oh my god it's a little bit unlucky he pre-jumped the original pass and then landed on the the receiving end of it try to go for the bump would have been a good play good save i can't help though good try a little bit unfortunate they're turning a lot there on our side so hard to get out when players are being that aggressive but that's very all in from them very all in mindset i feel like it's because they're down goals they're trying to be as aggressive as possible not a bad thing whatsoever but could have definitely got them scored on if it didn't go their way those challenges i ended up missing that i wasn't expecting something i should have maybe been more ready for or been in a position where i can react to that situation you want to always shut a position so you're ready for your worst case and best case scenario right you don't always want to be expecting absolute best case scenario at all times like me turning toward that ball expecting to miss would have been me just praying that he misses and expecting best case scenario you want to be ready and like in a position where you can react to if he misses you're there if he doesn't miss you're also there you know what i mean good ceiling shot from my teammate as well should be back here full boost good play off the ceiling he's using the ceiling a lot right now he's feeling the ceiling try to bait out his touch here we go again don't even need to challenge my teammate against the ball for free i'm gonna fake that i'm gonna just pop this on goal see what they do i love it dude it's the most like me looking shot i faked the first one good bump for my teammate it's a safer play to do that too because my teammate can now like rap all the way back around there's really no downside to doing that [Music] good place for my teammate he's playing well give me a lot of free balls this guy is weird oh oh do it to him wait he kind of did it to him though i'm not even gonna lie those are stalls it's actually a really good shot that's tough to do i can't do that with stahls that's funny they're talking trash and hit them with a double flippery set with stalls damn all right good two games let's get into the last game the first one was really quick so i'm gonna play one more scene to the last one let's see if we can keep it up let go let go all right for last game playing against saucy and astro we have kokika on our team everyone in here has the tournament tag i have it too but i feel like i don't want to use it because people can like pretty easily impersonate me like that i want to stick to the world champ one so no one can pretend to be me and say stupid stuff and make you guys think i'm saying stupid stuff so i get a lot of like tweets at me saying that there's like someone named squishy saying dumb stuff and they have like some grand champ tag on i want people to think that it's me ever you know obviously i'd never say stupid stuff in general but i always wear the tag the world champ tags you guys know if it's me or not it's the world champ tag then it's me only other people it could be is tormek gimmick or sad junior all those three guys have it because sad was our our sub at the time and subs got it but yeah let's focus here so i pop that middle see what he does wait for the bounce here try to control this over one i'm going to take the mid left boost now just hold on to 100 behind he's gonna have that probably i'm just gonna wait go up the wall here around him pinch oh the idea was there something for my teammate now he has no chance to air dribble bump him which is huge because that could be an automatic goal obviously if he gets it right behind you with 20 boost right back wall i'm gonna fake that should be okay hold on to my boost here again it's fine as well good challenge for him that helped his teammate a ton there that was a really scary spot to be in trying to bait this ball up for my teammate good work hit this off the left wall try to keep possession of this it's fine again i'm just gonna sit out of this if he messes up his airdrop it's mine if it's over me then my teammate can get debate this again i know it probably looks weird like never really going for the ball trying to give my teammate a ball every time but that's how i've always kind of played tried to be the support player a lot on previous teams and my current team as well is how i try to play i try to just be purely support and even though the ball does get past me quite a bit like this it's a very smart way to play in general in twos because it gives your team the ball right possession is everything over one player trying to create some pressure by going for the bump there good patience for my teammate i should be back in time even worse case scenario on the 50 if he loses it nice play i go for the bump i don't see where you went to be honest i have no idea what the other guy when he must have challenged like super quick or something i didn't see him i turned off my ball cam hey bump [Music] 250 here should be my ball the pace in general of this game has been very slow and like based around what everyone else is doing like no one's playing off of straight like what they think they should do it's always straight like let's just play as patient as possible or try to react after but the patience has worked so far done well they haven't really had many chances to score at least very dangerous ones trying to control that but it works teammate just bumped me out the way he said give me the ball let me show you how it's done this off the wall figure out the wall again team i went for that so i got to be a little bit careful but i have full boost here it should be dangerous try to control this almost over two would have been pretty nice i have to be ready for the bump just in case i almost got the two flip resets back to back would have been clean nice i had a funny he'd get that hit so i turned around early gonna pop that there and leave it it's gonna make it awkward for both defenders i'm gonna create a good amount of pressure for a bit here teammates should go for this gonna help me out nice should have one more he's playing patient with full boost back here worst case scenario i'll have boost i can defend whatever they send my way this weight right wall here come back now it'll just chill have full boost there's no real danger should be a free goal as well i'm gonna just troll though overtime did we do it oh teammate didn't want to do it i would have been down not gonna lie all right good games even though that one was super close at the end there's still good games we got the dub got a nice little preset good place in general hope you guys enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time it is when you're watching this like comment subscribe and see us on the next one i love you peace you
