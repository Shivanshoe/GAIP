yo what's up guys gonna be playing twos or threes for today for one of the next videos i'll try to do 1v1 games i'm not sure when i'll do it but i'll try to do some ongoing games and one of the next videos um but i do want to um see how the voice that is in twos and threes i'm not even sure if mine's working to be honest i might have changed some settings for it but we'll see if people are using it let's get into some games i can actually just hear him away that's so weird that's actually so weird i can hear his buttons clicking i don't think mine's on i think i have on push talk and i'll have a push talk button that's so weird so weird to like hear someone it's like i'm in a voice chat with them but i'm not wait is my game chat on oh my bad oh oh i mean if you do you want to calm or not uh no i have a i have all chat because i like i'm going to disrecall some people and i don't know that's anything yeah i don't know daniel just started saying some dumb  and i better reply and then i saw like my mic light up and that's actually funny i don't know if you guys can hear the talking that well but that's so funny to me i i gotta get it i gotta get it so uh oh i jumped as well i gotta fix it so they can hear me as well if i can talk to them sometimes nice all right i'm gonna i'm gonna turn up my mic for the rest of the game oh wait you do wait wait wait wait hold up what's up with your mic does it just like not work on rocket league oh that's dumb yeah because i think when i when i tried it earlier today yeah i saw you like join the i saw like it said like squishy join the chain chat and i just did not know if you're gonna talk or not and then i realized my thing was on too when i tried it earlier today it uh i guess this video is not even me talking i'm gonna turn this off i've just been listening okay i can finally talk i was just trying to listen to him but when i i tried it earlier today and it didn't like the mic thing was lighting up for me but no no sound was coming through apparently when i tried it so i gotta fix it my steam settings it's some problem with my mic or something but that's very very interesting to hear someone like that it's very different for sure very not used to uh like just hearing some of the buttons when you float in like the voice that's so clear but it'll be some fun videos i think like some good content for you guys when i get it properly set up i should have had it set up for this video but i didn't realize people would actually be using it like this i thought no one would be using it to be honest well this isn't a good log by the way this is like all very very solid players like astronaut they're on a pretty solid team so tough lobby i assume they're calming as well yeah it's very very cool though they finally fixed it i'm actually very happy about that because i think content in general will be a lot more enjoyable for you guys it will be more calming and less of me being able to tell you guys like what you should be doing but i still think it's cool i think it's a a good addition from them gonna leave it's a good bump attempt actually it looks really smart didn't touch one more really good shot it's pop just gonna leave off that pop probably has a double off this oath likes to be a mechanical like fast player most of the time so you can expect when you know you know someone plays like that when they go up quick they're looking for that double most of the time they're looking for some sort of flippy set or just any kind of mechanical play like you kind of expect it something here probably flip reset basically exactly i was talking about he likes to do those every time they have control of the ball they're going to try to make a play like that same thing here trying to play it around them so you can't look for the open space like on challenges like that that's all i like to do if someone's coming toward me with an editable there's always going to be like a a weaker that's a really good freedom i try to like shoot late there's always going to be a weaker part of their drill or a weaker part of their play and that's when you want to take advantage of it so i hit it into that space try to show an example that's how like you can defend even the best um you know solo plays like individual efforts just look for that like there's always a weak spot no matter what the play is always a weak spot whatever he does here i'll try to show you guys an example she's not forced to go wide see that's like the opening that i was talking about take advantage of it well my teammate it's a really good challenge see that one spot he could hit it around him was to the left so and i know that as well so that's thing high level becomes just knowing what everyone else is probably going to do with the ball and taking advantage of it that's pretty much what it becomes so like here knowing that you probably will have another pop here something like that like being ready for what could happen is very important i think it's just about reading the game in advance the highest level let's pass it well done again like a little bit of trust there for me like moving forward preemptively it gets me that goal very good past my teammates let's play it uh very solid that whole game yeah i'm kind of sad that my mics aren't right now i'm gonna i'm gonna definitely try to get it fixed but i tested it earlier i don't know if maybe there maybe it could have been them that was messed up because i didn't try even to supposed to talk with him i don't think i had even had it bound anymore just just so it didn't push through white noise let me see where is it push talk it's not even bouncing anything right now because earlier apparently it was just pushing white noise and it wasn't pushing my voice so i don't want to accidentally push the talk i might get a fix for next video though for sure that way you guys can actually have like a full game interaction with somebody it's kind of funny to to think about that in this game in ranked because something that you'll see in cs go you'll see in valorem and it really does add to the experience if that game didn't have voice comms it'd be pretty hard to to make content for it but i feel like the voice comes make the content itself most of the time like it makes it enjoyable to watch so let me know what you guys want because obviously my channel has always been like uh informative stuff about the game like trying to teach you as much as i can giving you my knowledge and um you know obviously if there's voice chat there's gonna be less for you guys to hear of my thoughts because i'm gonna be talking to somebody else so let me know what you guys think really balance as well i could do a bit of both exact same match so he's probably he's probably gonna turn off the mic again i can hear his controller right now so funny i don't know i find that so funny just as little control like his his keys lacking it's so different man you guys have to understand seven years of playing this game and the voice shots never functioned this is so weird that it actually is now it's like a weeks back i can't and he's just talking to people on discord without knowing that i can hear him that's a good shot i love them you know 1v1 for a while all right i kind of forgot to have my chat on i'm going to close it again we own these though yeah i've been working for a while so the legislation's always hard you got to kind of either commit and uh you know you get a lucky challenge and it works out or you wait and get the save that's how i was going for the second option the committing option there could work but he had full control of the ball like the whole time open for a while if you can get a good touch good play i was getting a bum so i had to go extra high that's why i don't know if you guys saw the way i aired for that i jumped extra high at the start instead of just like a regular hit forward i tried to get it above them all just pay attention to the play again very simple stuff like that but that's the kind of stuff that definitely does win you games doing that well i still think the simple stuff is what separates the really good shot on that separates the players still top level you can do the simple stuff the best find dodge the bump there really good challenge has to stall now that your pass back should be fine gonna have touched around me nice maybe air dribble here yes control i'm gonna insert command on that because last time i didn't do it i fake challenge trying to switch it up a bit i can have a touch here i shouldn't have flipped it through that probably like that kind of counts as full committing i don't think pokemon is very smart most of the time in twos but it's fine should be okay there's not much of a play on that shouldn't have thought it was a pass and then i realized he just gone solo after good flight to himself he should kill time for me here good job now i can just wait for him to recover that's the best bet over both maybe a shot they had a blocked i think as well that was in so actually better it wasn't gonna have a follow-up should be okay for flitz oh i guess read it let's save you try no problem you have a lot of time to read this but you know the balls over your head it's behind you you're not sure if they're up for it so it's a hard one one of the ones that um it's very easy to overthink it i think in that situation let's play it around the fake let me get a bump on him force this play to be bad and it also helps me rotate back quicker so really no downside to it i say i jump too as well so it might be bad yeah got bumped off of it only bad part about the safety mate is it just go straight back out to the second man it was a good first day but i feel like if it is awkward maybe leave it for the guy behind you but it is so close to the net that it's also hard to differentiate if you should leave it or not i don't know if that makes sense but it's so close to net that if you leave it it could definitely go wrong sometimes it might not be worth it nice i'll do a play keep it extra close maybe a minute left we can do this first step is really good around the first guy kept it close second guy was never going to full challenge i know that he's going to play patient for first man to rotate back so i was taking advantage of that try to play behind him i thought he maybe pre-jumped that's what i was hoping for so i shot it there but didn't work out how i thought gonna roll it back to himself i actually messed up i got the bump as well okay perfect yeah you got a bad um mad first touch i just took advantage try to get a shot quick good comeback though nice i played over to the right side pops up again over him it's gonna be really hard for him they just back off now i should go let's say done that's a huge win if he wins it i sit down again nice really job this is super solid honestly like this is a look at the top eight in this split right now my crew and uh doing a really good job playing them they're good twos players it's good 70 seconds left not over yet oh it's over flitz is crazy right now alrighty i'll get the voice chat sorted out for next video for sure for you guys i think it's something in my steam tanks probably is like the default device i should be using isn't it right it's probably because i have stuff set up weird for my my streaming settings or something probably what it is but i'll play the flip it's really all done hope you guys enjoyed have yourself on upload day or night whatever time this is watching this like comment subscribe to see us all in the next one olivia peace you
