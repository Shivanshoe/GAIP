yo what's up guys so i recorded two videos of these guys with garrett and kenobi i decided why not let's do one more with them so i'll have three videos with these dudes if you guys wanna watch the previous ones you can find that on my recent uploads of course uh but yeah it's gonna be the last video with these two guys for a little bit so let's get in to the game today should be some good ones let's see how it goes all right first game playing against falcon kippah and the paranormal paddy hours alrighty i'm just gonna go back here nice challenge from garrett good job it was an awkward situation because you had to be careful of that that air dribble that he could maybe go for those good patients from us good touch for him you got the under me it's a hard thing to do place that perfectly underneath me there when i'm challenging that it touches from crow oh that would've been such a good goal i did that softer i think toward the ceiling so i wonder where that would have been a goal get some pads here collect a lot of boosting pads try to just get a 50 on this doesn't need to be anything crazy it just keeps pressuring good touch from garrett it gives crow a lot of time on the ball i bumped the rotate back so he's going to be alone for a bit that little bump makes a huge difference in the grand scheme of things he's like half a second later than he would normally be in rotation and his touches maybe for the next little bit or slightly later than it would normally be right so something like that although it doesn't seem like it in the grand scheme of things it makes a big difference right he's gonna have a bang here i actually missed i swear dude and ranked too many people with these tactical fakes it's a pro players nightmare we're used to everyone hitting the ball always and then people just whiffing so much play back to garrett kenobi i think went with me so i made a little bit awkward there oh the triple fake how's he gonna play definitely play the video i think i don't know if we're gonna top that that was really nice 1v3 play i try to go for the bump he didn't jump right away which is good because i had the bump covered if he doesn't jump there gary gets the next ball right so it's not bad at all crow can hit that's the garrett side it's not too dangerous taking all my boost butt good thing there's pads all over the field you might actually get to get touched on this you got to be careful it could be dangerous i'm going to go for it nice and quick grab we should have this middle to garrett gonna fake this good demo good play from garrett to slow down there can i have one more off back wall there we go good play good shots nice little bouncer from kenobi there get underneath the defender try to go for this hit out the water myself off the wall again it's fine i was dunking most of the angles there on the ball so the only option you really had was it to my teammates which is good that's why those blocks are good to go for even if it takes out of the place sometimes it eliminates a big option that the opponent has the job can get if i can get the double there i get it if not gear it's up for the the easy shot at the end there so it works all options covered i don't mind letting him get that touch over the crow it's not going to be anything too tough either rolls it at him or he chips it at him either way it's not going to get past him push up middle here if he wants to use me dude i could i couldn't get it ended up being so low to the ground and no one was challenging that have been the the least exciting pre-jump play i think i've ever seen nice from crow good bait bit of the guy in wall should be 1v1 for garrett now he's going to score that every single time if you give him the space and the last guy back couldn't really do much about it to be honest is a good good flip reset it's a good try actually on the safe but let's play one more good first game for today we got a really good goal in that uh that solo play past the whole team but yeah let's get the next one to even keep it up let go let it go all right playing against i think the exact same team pretty sure so let's see we can get another w back to back hit us off the back wall hit ceiling here good try i should have stealing more just direct like straight up i think it would have been the better play way to cross the back wall waiting for his touch gary can hit this to me oh my god it should see see a pass from gate almost a tilter yeah it was it happened so much to me where it goes crossbar posted out all the time to me i don't know why just have to pre-jump that and give it a free ball wait for the kenobi touch here should have this i'll be back with a good amount of boost as well not a bad situation at all for us it's a good block follow-up block it might be bad now yeah and kenobi might have touched it away i'm not sure what happened it looked like credibly touched away from gears dunk day i think i couldn't tell something weird happened that's all good play this to garrett's side oh he pre-jumped i didn't realize he pre-jumped i was playing the the banger pass i bumped could be bad temporarily nice patience i'm not going to stay too far up here's awkward read i like to wait for these no one was even close for that i honestly could have dribbled i should have used my stick so i can see how much time i had i knew no one was close but i didn't think people were that far i don't know if that makes sense what i just said but i'm sticking with it good job from crow gave garrett a free ball day again losing that challenge isn't a bad thing i thought i don't mind giving him this touch here or that touch it's fine because ends up giving us the ball regardless right not a bad thing whatsoever nice and ultimately from letting them have the ball back there we still have possession right as long as you have someone far enough back losing a challenge like that is never a bad thing nice touch i'm gonna go for a demo here i think oh if i got that boost it's huge actually massive your solo play try work for the bounce here if i put a mid to try as soon as i control that i decided to just keep boosting through it try to get it over one of them it's a good attempt to go down oh if i went down on the ceiling well there it would have been really good there we go just place the low play from garrett hit that in the spot where it's going to make them both panic let me go back here back leftist nice we might have this i'm gonna wait ended up missing i'll tell you man the the fakes calculated fakes let me just go straight up i didn't see him i'm gonna pop that up i don't need to go for a shot there realistically the shot's not gonna be in so it's not a bad thing to just try to pop that up to keep pressure i did really well here let's go for a straight up shot out of that should i play this back to garrett i had to play it as soft as i possibly could because i don't want to accidentally own gold there obviously that's a tough thing to do to play that just the right amount of power that one too was a tough one to play the right on my power go fast to it but still down at the end so my teammates can score it right that's a tough thing to find the in between on let's get it from them might have a touch on this for garrett you have this to my side i think he kind of has to that'll do just top bends it all right it's gonna be here for this one guys i hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time is when you're watching this like comment subscribe and see you guys on the next one i love y'all you
