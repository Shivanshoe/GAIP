this milestone so if you're one of the people that want to see me reach it please go down below right now if you're not going to subscribe press subscribe button and press the bell shows notified when I upload a video enjoy the video guys love ya yo guys in the last video we finished off at champion Tube division once we're at 1308 mm RBA exactly a hundred and ninety two mm are away from grand champ right now that's not too many games away for what in every single game that's not too far at all probably like three or four more episodes of rugby grand champ and we'll be there so I'm pretty excited to see what we run into in the next couple of episodes like these lobbies are gonna be pretty interesting and we'll see the increase especially in champ 3 how close it is to two low grand champs so yeah let's get into it let's see what we can do damn so we're not playing any champ teams yet this is still champ ones hopefully the next game we do at least might have to play two more games after son just to see I have a good representation of what the champs he looks like early but that was a good read actually somehow these are better champ ones in the previous already like no one was reading stuff off the backboard like that quite yet and my teammate take it touch scatman is feeling it dude I'll wait for the bounce off the wall he's never gonna touch though back off gonna have one more stop back off again I know I can't be up to any of those balls and like I said in the last one if they're closer to the ball than you are you're not gonna be them to the challenge I go for the [ __ ] here trust my team I shouldn't have trusted my team as much as I did but it's okay it's okay mistakes for me dude mistakes were made scammin left whaaaat alrighty that was like a rage quit so I have to want me to was actually rage quit yeah I mean my bad for believe it you could hit the ball huh why is he mad at me for that dude alright we're going we're going sweaty boat for the one we two here only two is too cheap ones here I'm touched I don't any Boosh is the hard part hardest part of like Warby teaser 1 p3 just managing your boost on G just try not to get bump like that is he's really going that hard for bumps and it won't be to you my man's stealing shot enemy we're playing go to chant plays and of course it the will be to them save wise guys so much better than other che players you played so weird one more touch there we go alright this dude this way I got a sweat back bro I got it I got a do it he's known for bumps and stuff I don't want me to there's gonna be knowing I could tell is gonna be annoying I thought just one more time she'd bait in one of them touch them him he almost killed me I gotta watch out about the bumps near the most annoying part of this okay wrap around this ball I know that I'm gently for the beach it's fine I'll let them shoot this another baby touch but oh wait they gotta watch out for the pumps bad they're both go for Bob sup sleepy load number one good save I can get it unfortunately a super-focused it feels weird cuz like I'm still out trying to go like too hard but like I water win so I don't know is I'm trying to find like an awkward balance of the two where it's not super obvious son of a smurf but at the same time it's like I also want to really win this because these guys are just go pumps it will feature other fake to kick off like a control I asked to play I feel terrible you just say it's gotta keep saving everything dude I like that's in there we go guys everywhere man these are the best best champ players that we've played by four so far and of course my teammate leaves instantly you take the beach most likely it's like a shot a bang this think I might've caught him off guard again D it still works it still works like a charm if you're good enough to go ahead and just get banished from anywhere man people just don't expect I'll really catch a double against sweatiest chance right now this is quality content no do you offer for the pinch cookie whoopsie pinch a touch from him trying to Bobby still duty came we're for the boost here there we go so it's kind of quiet there striving to absolute best not to get shot why is he so bad that this is actually such good content much kind of happy let that happen surely I don't lose to kickoff goals though this is quality cost to them and I I can't complain Thank You scatman for leave it on me for not believing in me because I had too much trust in you got the weight on that I take the boots actually if you mess it up his touch I'll turn on this CD does but the boost here another bang every shot there we go I'm just gonna put a sad face just to see what he does oh but as you talking to his teammate I think you might be talking to just teammate I thought it was calling me back I thought he's mad at me for beating them Oh watch out the bump oh I'm chained dashing back my first touch gonna be bad first touch again probably not great another 50/50 here I'm taking the boost I think it's back oh my god how do I get out of that it's so bad for sure you there's no way this guy's not yes right now I don't afflict you there's no way I don't have a flip off that there's no way wow that's a hundred percent flip oh I guess I hit T really on my front wheels dude this guy's so mad at it steaming I thought he was mad at me I thought he was calling me bad out of just pure salt it touch alright so we got that over with yeah sky man definitely shouldn't have left on me maybe he was having a bad day a previous rank games and then you just figured all I have another eighty teammate you just goes for mid beach for no reason whatsoever I mean while he was off the wall did I definitely at that for a just missed five saves though at least I'm not a bum hahaha you wish you were me but you're trashed if it's okay l'm ow it's a fortnight channel hold on you want to be me so bad that's so bum me okay I'm not saying that word literally a are word original idea can't even insult me you have a four day channel I don't have to that's beeps enough right never he has a fortnight channel CDs Jim you're nuts alright so we got that out the way very very interesting I really did think that uh he was calling me bad naughty to case hundred ninety two UK well done good for him very very proud of that that guy and good on him for not really trash talking too much I hope he wasn't the one who said you want to be me I really hope he wasn't the one who said that cuz that's little egotistical just just just in the slightest but either way pretty solid game all-round scatman made us have to won't be too because he was mad for some reason um you know that mistake goes both ways they got a scored on like I said it's more of me being like used to higher ranks and I have the trust that someone's doing it they hit forward but if you're trying to be safe you shouldn't really be doing that you should go rotate back to goal so it is a mistake on both of us the bigger mistake is him just rage pudding after that obviously but we won the war me too and obviously I didn't learn much from that but I hope you enjoy the content is that are changing for me at least hobo's entertaining for you guys as well but ya can't be too division 2 we got 22 points out of that and the sad part is we were too lost so many points if we lost that won't be - I know we would have for sure so hopefully we play can't two players down but yeah let's get into the the next game alright so we're playing with I'm pretty sure that's actually a diamond 3 player or a champ one player and we have everyone else as champ - Xander Slavic try to stay on this ball almost own gold so I got the booster rotated out here I should better reach back it's not gonna boost anymore somebody full speed I need to panic that either flick it over one which I flick it over the second team I can touch this forward I'll shoot if you can fine I'll get around this ball good challenge from the opponent there I'd really good so our first real taste of up champ - now plug it one more time here just to popped out the back my girlfriend double even though I probably could have I know my team is gonna want to go for that so I don't want to get in his way wait back here I'll play this off to the left side I see my teammates over there so you can follow that up at least good touch your job to recognize that I was gonna pass that as well hey I was a good little pre flip off the wall and that's what teammates a lot more aware of what's gonna happen like he was ready to turn on that ball as well and that's uh pretty like weird flip to his so he was actually ready for me to hit something like that which is really good that's a good shots my teammates pretty solid I mean so far champ two looks a lot more so like I can already tell the difference it's pretty interesting to see like it's a super visible difference like right away look at this touch from that guy that's perfect to me my teammate panting guys exactly what I was talking about good powerful shot as well I know that guy's gonna get beats that come closer that was that rule I was telling you guys about earlier if you're close to the ball you're gonna win the challenge most of the time do further you're probably not gonna win it so don't go for it now just me getting it on sorry get there it's a good job you on the wall for that not the best sit down and see me was already but good read for my teammate good second touch just a fake challenge I know I'm last back here so again I can't really push too far forward for this my teammates not behind me to support so I'll wait for my pass to the left good shot good try I passed it right here does it be a challenge I went for the bump that's fine I got mid mr. cross y'all gonna kind of rotate or across from teammate is I got these closer so I can't challenge that ball quite yet hey that to the side my team is on just to see if you turn but he couldn't good fifty you try on that I'm gonna city panics yeah I just wanted to see how you would deal with the ball like that like he's gonna expect me to be close there so I'm not gonna panic so that there's no reason to I'll wait for his touch if anything I could obviously instantly go for but if he's gonna get a touch that pop straight up then you know I could just react to that one anyway What did he say I didn't get to read it I know where your champ to budge it felt like what we to in your bear so see that's not what I've tried to do but I just don't I can't find a good balance of of the two men I really can't such a hard thing to find a balance of like going too hard or going just to the right amount and I like in this rackets we're excited know everyone's kind of capable putting the ball well so I try to hit the ball well as well and it's like I'm doing too much because it's just muscle memory if I'm in a position to do something I'm gonna do what's probably best for that position most of the time so it's all muscle memory it's very hard to break out of that for me I'm trying my best though I I didn't mean to make you feel like I was just won't be chewing but either way tgd let's get to the next one and it's gonna be the last video and we should end up super super close to camp 3 after that probably finish it like 1370 something with 1351 right now so let's queue up for the next one and I see if we can finish off the video with another alright this is a Justin you got a champ three on our team this would be fun to see ya and almost a champ to another team he was a season 11 grand champ he would see the 10 grand champ on our team and then we got the champ one as well almost champ to be another team but they're heading Ariel's teammates champ you like I said just got champ 3 so let's see what we see out of him already like a lot more consistent popped it up there and I'll leave again I'm gonna make sure I follow those two rules bomb blasts back there closer to the bow I'm not gonna go he's closer I'll react to it good decent 50 my teammate can go for this I don't want to cut him off here it's fine unlucky very unlucky I didn't want to touch that again to be honest like I probably shouldn't even know what his last bag for that but at the same time I wasn't trying to touch that boy kind of sit into him slightly unlucky Knoll honesty how did he cross to my teammate here he wasn't ready didn't grab the boost might be in might also be wide but it's still fast enough to to mess that guy up but I was talking that crossed my teammate was and I notice that there's still a lack of just being able to read the gameplay like it's got just reached j-3 and he sees that I'm going toward the ball of speed and he's not ready to turn for booster turn for the ball day you should kind of use your open space and recognize where everyone is on the field and you even do that there that's a big mistake I already already see quite a few times out of these players and again the lack of like be able to read the gameplay like look what and the boys this here he was on the wall and this is he's going at the bullet speed here it's gonna chip off the wall he should know that and he's just kind of defending the wall instead of defending the goal so he should be saying like around near post in the goal there we're saying closed posted a go at least on the wall nobody can save some like that it's not that hard of a shot to save it wasn't a good position to save it he's closer so we it's awkward so away for the fans to come down he has to come to me there I know that so there's no reason for me to panic oh wait again I'm last back for a while my teammates stuck right there so I made a challenge this ball and give beat where I can take it back I know my team is gonna grab the cross boost I'll touch it one more time Stover this guy it's wide open now here we go yeah a lot of a lot of two's is about dealing with when your last back and the best way possible surely what it is if you're in a position where you see your teammate just landed on their side don't dive in for a challenge because what's that challenge really gonna do for you you gotta ask yourself that my challenge is ball what's gonna come of it so you got another example in a sec I can go for this even though my teammates on that side I know I easily beat that guy to that ball there we go that's the one scenario when you should go is when the balls coming toward me I'm closer in that spot so I'm gonna go that's my green light the challenge I know I'm close to the wall it's coming toward me I have momentum they don't so I know I can win that ball and I can also get a shot at that my team can go now wait middle if you can get anything for me all right he's there for luck boost so I'm gonna fake challenge first he still has his focus shoulders Bollier so I'm trying to let him give that back to me I'm not even challenged I'm just fake challenging so he does like I'm 50 this it's more than enough good team they can go I'll try to play off his touch here got a bump on him that's good close my teammate I'll hit that around I'm grabbing the boost as well close good save though he didn't panic I was really good in the last game someone was paying me that that was the high ranked player didn't paying for that ball oh yeah almost out you're nothing crazy can't meet anyone as well in their problem fighting so if you have another but again ease closer so I'm gonna beat up the touch here I'll shake the ball back for free you got there grab the boost good touch Timmy can grab this for free nice oh wait he's closer so wait for shot that's my teammate there's your really really good aerial there nicely done he pre flipped off the wall to touch that around him that's kind of what I've been doing is well kind of try to use those free foot touches around them not doing anything throw to the top but like I said champ others can't do it it's just a lot of consistency in doing it some go up so pre jump that I'll show you this down gonna come off the wall enough good pay just write to me throw I do like that he went back there nice touch nice just leave free goal but want to see if I team you're gonna go for the solo play wait for shot you're not gonna panic cuz it's probably gonna be a fast shot from that angle nice touch and again team it's going up the right corner with my ID I'm gonna shot I headed middle here you see didn't create a play of some sort close I could kill one here that opens up some space getting quite killing by at the palm places to the wall see what they do I put off left to my teammate it's perfect his space now if he bangs just good one more looks like I think its back so my teammates still in there half I know that killing time for this point didn't quite because they got bumped yeah again mighty Mississippi had a lot of like 1pt situations where I have to take it back or I had to put myself in a weird spot and if I didn't get bumped that would have had that still like I would have known to get it across but his issue is he's going for a lot of balls where there is really no advantage to going for that challenge he's just going forward because he feels as if it's the right way that he should be going for it but he could just fake challenge a lot of the balls that he's going for and get the ball for free without losing his position and that wouldn't that wouldn't leave me in war me too because he's still there to back me up but I find at least like five or six one with situations just came that was the one time that I couldn't quite get out of it cuz I got bumped a little down the wall again he's kind of stuck in there half here still time to make a nice tea should have this forward one more goal I believe alright I think we're gonna call it they're both Serie end up my - I played pretty solid I can't complain this few mistakes here there it's merely this challenging which every single person this rank is an issue a challenging even grand champ you see it a lot yeah he was champ through those two champ threes in that Lobby we got up to champion to Division four off that were 13th at 73 in the next video we reached champ 3 so we're getting so close to grand chef now yeah hope you guys enjoyed and thank you for all the support
