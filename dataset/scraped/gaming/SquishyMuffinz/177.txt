yo what's up guys gonna be playing some threes games today with first killer and sosa should be some good games before we get into it i just wanted to say that i finally upgraded my mic setup so my mic should sound a lot better now there should be no background noise and i should actually sound like a youtuber who has a million subscribers hopefully you guys will enjoy that more in terms of quality yeah let's get into the video see if we get some dubs let's see how it goes all right for the first game we're playing against a rep kj and dot should be interesting rep has e girls hit me up in his name as well i'm repping the anime profile pic right now we actually all are oh no imagine running into a three-man anime pick squadron oh no i'm gonna say anime pick power i didn't realize we all had one it actually looks kind of kind of intimidating low key i know like fps is like cs if you run into an anime pick you know you're about to get one tap for a whole 60 minutes straight i don't think it's to the same extent in rocket league but definitely a thing in cs it feels like at least it passed from first though all right easy gold tap inside to save my boost and be in a good position it does wonders plug in this left side match him first you always rely on him to get some sort of play out of his solo play here try to tap it around them continue it did go but i think he thought i was just going to touch that one off the back wall that's not on him i want me to make a better pass there i think nice play close on the shot it's a little bit tough i'm gonna let him touch this again gonna be better for my teammates ago most likely i don't want to just dive and lose the challenge see if he does here's a really awkward spot let's go for the bump that makes my team a free ball same situation there go for a bump again this one's even a better position wait back while here waiting as long as possible any situations is good just minimizes their options right the closer to get to the back wall like they have to make a move they have to actually make something happen gonna be a bad touchscreen he's gonna run out of boost pretty soon here there's no choice but to fit that's how to put on the wall see what he does not gonna wait backwall hasn't hit it high and it's gonna be easy touch to the side deal with that nice and patient out of a rough situation pretty easily there i'm not going to go for this let them panic a little bit too close to the defenders actually try to go for that right if i say midfield in a spot where if it does spill out to me i can go wait left wall where i should have this and have us across now most likely can't go for this let's also go it's fine there's really no danger in a lot of these situations just just playing patient and waiting the right time to go for the ball let him touch that again i can wait right side for a counter attack it's fine stay in goal here if he gets a good shot he's gonna be in but it's a good play for him to be honest you gotta just hope in that situation that he doesn't get a perfect shot which he ended up doing but it's okay if it goes in you know respect you earned it should i get this middle you're trying to pinch yeah i just got too much of my wheels on the ball to be honest couldn't get like a powerful pinch out of that don't touch this ended up missing i got faked by that but it's fine teammates should be back free save play it left side into space for sure going what a touch all right double that's crazy oh that was actually crazy i wanted to finish off the team play a bumped one first of all i bumped two yes tried to recover here messed up so suspicious didn't think he could get back i don't blame him didn't look like he could try to put his left side i saw first there oh he was going backward okay should have known should have known nice good boom that first actually loves just sitting back while it feels like wow i keep trying to read what they're doing and they're just missing and it's working a little bit unfortunate should have been more patient there i think tried to hard to read where such would go instead of just playing where the ball is instead if your first man there i think he's better just play where the ball is or where it's going to go just pre-position don't re-jump should be a goal nice got it back though pretty good first game let's even keep it up on your full boost try to save your boost if you get your corner boost like don't waste it straight away you don't need to waste your boost when you're moving around the field it's more so about making sure you have that boost when you need it right so if you're not doing anything useful with your boost don't use it it's the best way i can explain that if you know where near the ball you know where near the play then just slowly boost up to where to play but grab some pads on your way and it'll be better than you know just wasting your boost toward the ball you don't really need to waste your boost a lot of time like right here i can only remove the field just grabbing pads and it's probably more useful than if i were to boost and look the ball comes at the same time and i arrive at the ball when i actually should instead of being too close and having to back off right nice good pass from sosa well done very good game some little mistakes here and there but good play regardless and a lot of it in threes comes down to boost management that's something that you just have to focus on really hard when you're playing threes is always making sure you're using your boost when it's necessary and always making sure you have boost when you need it right so yeah let's get into the next game stephen keep it up get back to back dubs for today but very good first game getting closer and closer to the supersonic legend every single game i really played that much threes this season so i got to keep playing i'm going to keep grinding probably trying to get top three i think garrett and justin are both top two right now in threes i've been playing mainly ones and twos this season so far so i'm gonna try to get top three with but yeah get the next game let's even get some more dubs see how it goes all right we got a much sweatier game for the last game we have blaze salado and tool here recognize all these players and they're all very solid so we'll see we'll see if we can be done here so you should have this nice kind of block i don't know if that was worth to go with him there i mean we won the 50 but didn't really accomplish as much as i would have liked to there it's a good that's a really good one go straight middle and it's open that beautiful but i get nothing for it because first killer stolen so i according to the game i've done nothing this game even though that 50 got a sickle the beauty of the the point system gotta love it very good chief from first killer good job i got this back boost here save my full boost like i mentioned last game that way when this ball comes to me i have the resources to actually do stuff with it but i go for the bump for my team not a bad touch from first only issue is because i went for the bump there says i can't actually commit as third man it's a little bit too risky and get us it got us counter attacked on as well so it's a little bit risky but again that's something that if we're in calms obviously that's never going to be a goal because he knows i'm going for the bump you can go slowly take a free shot on goal so it would have been a goal most likely if you waited but that's hard thing to know obviously if you're not in comms i don't blame them at all very difficult and the shot itself wasn't a bad idea it's a good bump from two on the way back all right i knew i heard someone jump i should've went quicker i hesitate on those sometimes thinking the person that's like blind in my vision that i can't see at all um is not going to go but then end up going it always catches me off guard i go for the bump here kill one let me check the other guy here if i can it's a fine trade i'll take that we still have pressure it's a good thing one's on our side still all right 67 boost here just wait gonna run out of options in a second getting bumped first got bumped too funny he has time now he knows that take my time here play one more off the back wall good patience everyone just wait to back wall now on those so you have to try to be extra creative and pretend that you have no boost a lot of the time russell just won't work see everyone just sitting back ball makes those double taps so much harder to actually get a good plan so i feel like now the meta is low-key like just to take a bad shot there just a shot that forces out a touch rather than a back wall here because the back will hit they can actually generate power out of and get to go clear out of whereas a shot there would be very hard for them to get anything out of right take a shot like i was talking about now they have to make a bad touch and i can go for a demo or a bump make it awkward i should turn on this just to keep this in doesn't even need to be a shot just hit it back well it's fine i'm fine if he controls that as well still kills time we still have pressure as long as sosa wins this ball and now this can turn into a good thing here there we go that's what i was talking about in that situation i could have went for a double tap but instead i went for a shot it's gonna force it or awkward touch then that leads to chain reaction and touches that they're not going to be very favored in as long as we just keep in our midfield pressure we're going to win the next challenge over and over again so it's not a bad play at all from us and we slowly but surely secured the goal out of it here wait for the play from first it's fine teammates should be there should be able to boom this try to wait middle just in case you got the pass off it was hard though it was a hard pass to actually get a good touch on that's fine don't want to challenge that a bad spot rather my teammate get let's tell us to turn here on the wall okay i'm gonna be next up looks like can't actually get a save on that but it's fine getting tossed by my team but it's okay i think we both got confused me and first both thought the other person was there now i got rammed that's okay a little bit unlucky the kickoff before left here if he wants to use me pass this across if you want quick enough potentially to go which is very tough to have the speed to even get there for that nice get past him first well done well done look at double tap i think he was trying to shoot it or something it looked like but i had the idea of what he was going for you can kind of tell just by the path he was jumping at the ball let's say from sosa right here left side if he wants to use me here's one more it looks like waiting for the bounce that's fine i don't really care if he gets touched because most likely it's not gonna be anything too crazy i'm gonna be able to deal with it pretty easily middle eventually nice very good job it come back a couple of weird goals both games but it happens reigns can be that way sometimes it could be a little bit weird hard to read try to shoot behind them good try from first how the angle he was going at the ball there's a favorable one for sure should be a dunk should be a goal there there we go that's a good aggression to go for that actually be confident in the challenge that we can win the challenge and good double to finish it off as well not playing too bad these games nice good goal again i think they're gonna forfeit off that yeah they did all right two solid games hope you guys enjoyed those have yourself a wonderful day or
