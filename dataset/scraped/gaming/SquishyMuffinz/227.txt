before we get into the video guys as you know we are on the road to 1 million subscribers and i just wanted to say thank you so much for all the support so far on our road to one meal because we're currently at 854 ish thousand subscribers which is ridiculous and we are within 150k of our goal so we need around like 2k subs a day to reach before the end of the year comfortably so if you guys do want to help me along that road please make sure you do hit that subscribe button if you enjoy my content i appreciate y'all much love enjoy the video yo what is up guys going to be playing some games today with garrett g and aj should be some good ones i'll be on fennec for today let's get into it let's see if we can get some dubs all right for the first campaign against crow duck and josh's squash all right hi i'm our lobby found the game really quick so let's see how it goes let me get some pads behind aj's are ready up for that is there a ball to go for maybe a double try to place it there we go good shot top bins it's good that he misses a double there honestly because if he doesn't you know most of the time it's not going to be in it's gonna go down and up and then be on back wall for it so it kind of fix all of them to have to be ready for the potential shot should have been a goal for me really right there it's a good attempt it's not quite what i wanted but not bad either no boost trying it around them play it to the side before i get bumped i'll jump quick off the ceiling so i could be middle for my teammate here he does want to use me which he ended up doing stay right side good pass from garrett good job to use this there so hit this right side and when i say that it means i'm just trying to position myself more to the left of the ball and it's probably going to get the ball pushed over to the right side that's all it is it's not a crazy hard thing to do but you'll get better and better at it with time and experience in general you'll definitely get better at losing it on purpose where you want try to go for the bump in there i didn't get it but it's fine he held on to all of our boost if he can get a pass right here i can try to follow let me go for the double there we go good play another fake there from aj i think it wasn't exactly what he wanted again he was going for that flip reset but just because he he could have that flipper stand they don't know it's enough to scare them off the play and they have to play a little bit different i sort of have the most unlucky spawns man i always spawn in front of my teammates nice touch i'm in the middle for aj's hit here he's gonna have that first i'll just wait probably there's one more off the ceiling i don't want to go for that i like garrett get a double i'll stay back here full so keep into the side the aj hit off wall another good hit off the corner and garrett with the shot good try the ground pinch almost came in clutch there it's gonna be over me probably actually it works pretty well i would have liked to have got a better hit on that but it's okay the fake oh it was all in the fake almost worked let me go back quick here i have no use on the side of the field right now it's better to go back as quick as i can try to play off whatever's going to happen next good hit off the wall should be a shot good shot good goal hold on a lot of pressure they don't have a lot of ways to defend the things we're doing we're playing very fast we're making it really awkward for them i don't know what the half was i don't know why i was so messed up i saw him missing there we go good play air drop to the ceiling jumped off the ceiling got the double tap off the backboard got it over one there that's gonna be the first game done probably only have time for one more even though that was a forfeit i have been pretty tight on time lately and i've been focusing on lcs so the extra time that i have a recording is a lot less than usual but i'm still trying to get the same amount of videos out to you guys um but yeah we'll play one more for today that was a really good game [ __ ] off the bat a lot of good goals in there um but yeah thank you so much all support guys you know i always try to get as much content out to you guys as possible while still playing professionally and it's a hard thing to do it's it's harder than it sounds to do i don't have a crazy amount of time in the day and i do want to spend time with family i don't want to tell my girlfriend stuff like that so it is hard you know take time on the side of practicing all day screaming time of family time with my girlfriend stuff like that it is hard to have time for the youtube side of things especially because i also stream three hours a day so i'm trying my best to get videos out to you guys as much as possible and i still have been keeping up my streak of every other day uploading but uh yeah sometimes it will be shorter videos and i hope you guys alright with that i hope you guys just appreciate you know the work i'm trying to put in for you yeah well i tried to try to get the weird read to just bang it away but didn't quite get it yeah i seriously appreciate showing all the support you showed to the channel it's crazy to me shadows controls up the wall i went for the high dunk go for the corner boost here garrett's gonna just hit us on the wall they'll both have the aj can turn which is good i'm not gonna be there quite yet but it's fine i can go over this now take a shot on goal make them both waist boost they both double committed for that pretty big for us can't go for that one out gary got a huge dunk though holy that was nuts he was a little bit late to that but actually helped him yeah i do want to start up another like road to grand champ series and another like i want to start i want to also start like a more creative series on the side as well where it's not just all the same kind of video over and over again like road to grand champ series are good but i've done them a lot i want to do something that's like super creative i did want to do like that pro vs seven bronzes or um pro vs like five silvers provers two grand champs i wanted to do videos like that on a side series just to see like how we can do against different ranks and stuff like that be a good experiment but i'm not sure for video ideas so let me know down below what kind of series you guys you think you'd love to see and i'll i'll try to start working on it and i'll uh start planning for some time in the future to get it done i'm also trying to work on my one mil montage i gotta start working on that because it is coming up pretty close it might actually be by the end of the year the one mil montage so let's see how things go we still gotta reach one meal obviously not sure when that's gonna be but i am working on it that's something that i have to take time outside to do as well that's what i mean by i am limited on time i try my best to give you guys as much content as possible you guys have always been here supporting me so i feel like i gotta keep giving you guys as much as i can i've always uh i've always appreciated all the support you guys showed me on here wait for aj's touch probably is one more i didn't think that guy would miss or i would have probably just pre-jumped that that's okay garrett can get this it's a good fake actually really smart fake good touch from lion blaze there just clear the double tap danger out the way aj loves to try to control those it's really good but if you do mess it up in a spot like that like you just did it can definitely get very dangerous something you have to be very like precise on every single touch every little irrigable touch you make in front of your goalie that has to be perfect you're also going to get your team in a very sticky situation not the best kickoff should be okay though both my teammates were back i'm just trying to fake this guy get the ball out to the guy in the back wall put that back middle it should be okay this should be okay as long as aj can get to the touch here will be fun time to control two of them committed on that one for the demo which didn't really do much i spawned back with more boost than i had before and we're probably gonna go out of it in a second if i get a good touch here couldn't quite get as much i wanted but it was still good none of that was bad being demoted is actually good because forces out that second player that wouldn't have actually went for that ball if he wasn't going for that demo trying to keep it in play here don't gotta go for a shot [ __ ] off the bat it's just to kind of make him panic a little bit that was a big miss for me tried too hard to read the the quick down bounce and that i'm missing it if i can go back there i wouldn't turn early there wasn't any pressure really they weren't going to challenge me it's more just me like losing focus for a second trying to go too quick to a ball that i didn't need to go too quick too should be good for us aj's a lot of time on this ball now he's very good with it probably get this pass over to me i've trusted him to do that i wanted to hold him to my flip to the very end there but they're gonna be there so it's fine triple coming out of that which is huge i thought aj might turn on this he's still on the watch a little bit of a confusing situation for me i'm not sure if he will go or not oh imagine the scenes the angle on that pin should have been nuts get off the wall it's like here we go next now they're forced to hit that away my head caused a lot of a lot of panic there near their goal which is what you want to do in those situations that is really good for us i have a feeling i can sense it the next like five seconds are gonna be juicy gargantuan nevermind i missed i'm just making mistakes this game but it's okay as long as you get the dub it's what matters pre-jumped all right that's something you'll only see in ranked you'll like never see that happen in the tournament like 10 seconds left no one no one doesn't care that much in a tournament let them keep it up is your second goal incoming for us no nevermind i wanted to keep up there i'll go back he's gonna beat me here see what i can do under one try to get under two close i guess that's from again i got his boost which is huge if i get a kill here that's massive good the guy on the backboard has no boost it's gonna be a bad touch every single time hey there's a lot of speed coming on this and they're in a very bad spot now both of them panicking over and over again and it's gonna eventually be a goal all from that blue steel and demo it kind of created a lot of chaos in there defensive third that was a good game i did make some some mistakes there i shouldn't have made obviously but either way i feel like i said a lot of stuff in this game that you guys need to hear so even though i didn't play that good it's more of me just talking to you guys and having a chance to like you know thank you for always watching my videos and understand that sometimes they will be a little bit shorter than i like them to be but i always
