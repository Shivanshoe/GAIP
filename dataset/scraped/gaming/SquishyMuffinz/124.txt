guys we got a 20 game here off the bat we got blank scene toroko and kinsey out of team this car is very thin guys very very thin the first thing i'll i'll say about it it's probably the most thin car in the game even worse than batmobile the pancake-ness of it so it's not my card type for sure not my style i'm going to octane obviously but let's see what we can do gonna have control still this i play patiently got a good block on them put this in good try it's fine baited out the touch for my team it's a good thing to do in two just drive up don't have to commit bait the flick assuming doing that a lot in twos very smart thing to do with it is what most people do these days this is the safest thing to do in most situations it's like a shot and i did it to my teammate again very tough spot for them to be in and get out of dropping them on the back wall though back of the net should be back with full boost here i don't feel confident in this car by any means feels like a lot like the battle but i actually don't know what hitboxes is it feels a lot like the batmobile to me that's what i feel when i'm using it probably dominance though if i had to guess i don't know if they do cars um but that would be a hitbox i'm not sure good fake smart every patient here this is the situation where i should bait his jumps i better jump early and i just have to make the save ended up not doing anything which should be fine put this forward now to my teammate should be shootable he's quick take a little bit too long to go for the shot that's okay hard spot to shoot quick off of to be honest yeah almost a possible situation to get up unless i ends the challenge but even if i enter challenge he's gonna have a shot around me he had full control in a good spot to do do anything you wanted to really put that ball take the boost from him a little more here good demo have some space now there we go same situation he was put in very very tough spot to get out of right you have to call the bluff of the other person almost perfectly and you know we're both very used to those situations happening a lot and it's still extremely difficult to get out of this just shows how how tough those are to really escape that's very unfortunate that's about as unfortunate as it gets to be on he started trying to block him goes perfectly back into our side i'm not a fan of the plankness of this car to be honest so challenges early when the left side put away under him here so i'm going to bait this touch over me hopefully i can leave you bring this one i like the idea there a fake purse damn we kind of went crazy kind of like crazy that's the plankness of the car it's a good first fake over the second guy and then use the rest of our busy pass to third well there's only two guys on the field but you know what i mean you get the point i'm in 3v3 mode always i save got the beat which is big i can't really fall off the shot good challenge you got two minutes left here we're tied up i don't know who's going to win this to be honest right close got a challenge as well though you have a flip right to the side get the boost that's it done uh i was kind of scorable is very tough to score but it was horrible let him hit it away there's a flip here so we got to be a little bit patient hit it around him which is good give my teammate a 1v1 now huge block can't follow it up but i could fake the second touch then go back and i bumped rocco into our half very far which is really good i'm going to leave him in a good position to get her go another touch you would have wanted there you could tell you're trying to get more of a controlled touch couldn't quite wrap around the ball enough for it it's a bad idea though take more time here good demo good job to help his teammate looks really smart oh my god that was kind of crazy i think you got to flip off the 50. yeah you got to flip off the 5050 jump to the wall insane let him hit this away again baiting out for my team team should have a free ball back wall almost always best thing to do unless unless you can't follow up the next touch if you got a double off the back wall there would have been perfect that's what i thought he was doing until i pushed up a little bit should be fine i'm gonna go for him wait back wall now my team has a low touch we should be fine here nice everything covered should be a goal you missed but it's okay i'm not gonna commit on this he wants the boost probably play for the boost play for the challenge hold on i gotta be careful here another one more situation hit it off the wall hit around the other guy off the wall again should be my teammate's ball now going back over here you can't do much on this ball all i have to do is wait and i can play it around the second guy as well there we go well played role play all right good first game i thought so far as the car feels like absolute pancake you could tell just how thin it is when i go sideways like that um not a big fan so far not gonna lie i mean if you're a big fan of formula one i'm sure you're gonna love this car but in terms of how it feels uh not a crazy big fan of it so far so let's see let's see how we feel in the last game and we'll go from there all right this is the sweaty one atomic and soroco two very very um very good rlcs players and we have mile on our team he's not in rlcs but he's not bad just gonna be a very very tough one to win on the f1 car if we're octane i'm sure we could win this but on f1 i'm not that confident but we'll see very tough situation got over there won't be one for a long time those spots in twos you want to try to leave your teammate in spots where they don't have the 1v1 or 1v2 for a long time that's best case scenario it's never never good to be in that position i have to be careful that there was a chance he could shoot that so i had to back off for a moment 50s i think both of them there which is good you should be able to clean this up do something with it hopefully i snipe i did i i winnable winnable i'm locked in i'm locked in this is a very very sweaty game man mile's not bad by any means he's just not you know kuroko or atomic level but he's very very good regardless just gonna be i don't know what that was to be honest but just gonna be a sweaty game here 100 let me sweat a game and fakes 50 a little bit boost left over here really good save well done i try to place it behind him i think he would kind of like pre-drive to the other side of the net expecting the far post banger there actually played it well again played it behind him but he actually got back to it somehow nothing i could do the boost level is too low that's tough that's tough tough situation to be in to be honest come on quick on the wall only they could have done there differently to help me out would be like the fake challenge let the ball come down a bit you know you're not wasting your position again i don't get left in like a a 2 1 situation which is always best case scenario if you don't leave your teammate in 2v1 best thing you could have done there probably what i would have done is just fake go back down because you don't throw yourself away that's okay that happens especially against players like this they both want you to to do that kind of thing back here should be wide all right let's take a shot from circle the bounce was so awful for me if it went up like just straight up it would have been really easy for me to get back i to went back to the net though hindsight's obviously 20 20 in that demonstration but i go back to that i cover every possible bad thing that can happen there a snipe that's a that's a flat car shot if i've ever seen one the fly car shot right there it's rolling at you you just bang top corner only with the flat cards now i don't think you could do it without paying not gonna lie you can but it's not as easy that's for sure let's say from atomic got both the jump which is big i played it over them let him hit this away oh you got the boost that kind of sucks gonna beat the flick though nice so me not diving there is really good because again i gotta stay back i was not ready for that i got out there i gotta stay back and also i can like i bait the flag off for my team obviously but i get to help my team actually deal with the next shot as well which is huge instead of just diving one time and not being able to help again you know any boost here such a weird way this game is going right now like i'm in a lot of really weird situations but we're getting out of them so it's okay oh any boost here it should go for me somehow somehow he didn't get a piece of it i don't know how he was on the ground the ball was on the ground and somehow i didn't get a piece i kind of want to see so that's fine actually everything covered there should be no way that goes in but he wasn't really blocking the net which is the problem five back goal and he is like the ground area there's really no way that they could score there most scenarios but he just messed up his challenge a little bit try to bait him off the roof ah tough spot tough spot look out time yeah there's always going to be a funny game because i'm like 15th on leaderboard right now so the solo queue games are gonna get uh very tough very very tough to win there's nobody around the time where i start to queue with people because once you're really high on memoir and you solo queue you get people that are slightly lower and you play against a very high mmore so it gets pretty it's pretty sweaty it's a winnable though this game it's gonna need a miracle i played around them ah no way i could have got really any more power on that we could try they have good pressure here maybe you can get a goal ah that should be the end of that play did i touch got over one 25 seconds doable he gets this ah yeah tough tough stuff got demo there was going to be a goal as well played from them yeah i'll put i'll play to them obviously i knew from the start it's going to be almost impossible to win especially on the flag car i have not i'm not confident at all on on flat cars but we still really well honestly we could have won we literally really still could have won that game there was that one that last goal like at the 50 goal that goes the other way right we score we have the lead or we're tied i mean so he'll go very different there but yeah either way good games fun games the car in my opinion i wouldn't use it i don't think this car is insane no i normally do like this new car is insane titles i would not do that for this car because i don't think it is insane um but yeah is this new car insane question mark i don't know you guys have to find out for yourself but i don't think it is personally but yeah appreciate y'all watching i love you guys thank you for all the support as always and see you on the next one love you peace [Music] how could i trust you when you hurt me
