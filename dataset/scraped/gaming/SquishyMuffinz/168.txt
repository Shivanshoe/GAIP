so you never miss one and yeah hope you guys enjoyed today's video yo what's up guys gonna be playing some tuesday with garrett it should be some good games let's get straight into it see if we can get some dubs see how it goes all right for the first game we got ourselves against j russ and luke gonna be a sweaty game gonna cheat here i think garrett might have forgotten that he's a kickoff man because a lot of times in the rank people do left goes in that situation almost a goal a good attempt it's going to be a solo play here from j ross and he's a once player so this is always going to be a tough situation to stop and yeah there's gonna get score on that situation but that's normally what's gonna happen when you're playing a once player in 2v2 right saw that in the last video you're playing against first kill you don't want to give someone like that space on the ball that's why threes kind of nullifies what they're able to do because if you challenge properly and you use each other properly you're not going to have very many options okay he's gonna wait here i can go back wall no boost okay can just deal with the easy cleanup try to shoot low i try to shoot in a way they wouldn't expect it didn't work out though they went for another solo play here you guys can control 1v1 for a while just push up a little bit too close there i'm gonna make it clear go back baits out the ball for gear pretty easily also leads to an empty net as well that's the beauty of like those fake challenges right when you're betting out the ball for your team a lot of the time you'll give them a free ball and all they have to do is clean it up and then two is that free ball also leads to 1v1 which is even better round one there later another one maybe a demo as well look at track take the mid boost here intercept can be a free goal as well more than likely there we go good job to turn there you capitalize on that i think he's calling for back left he is you're trying to play get to go for a shot here close on the shot good turn midfield okay he's going for me just good gonna help me out quite a bit in that situation and a low shot there's always gonna be best bet in that situation like guys on back boys gonna be watching anything high up you shoot that high up you're pretty much giving him a free dribble at that point you got to think of the the back wall as another ground you're going to give someone the ball like that when they're on the back ball you know it's almost easier for them to deal with that than it would be you know a low shot they have to do a lot more work to deal with the low shot from that position close play to the corner i don't want to go for a shot there honestly he's waiting back well that's the smarter play there let's get back kills a lot of time for him and in doing that we actually have more pressure now i actually don't want in the past i'd rather him control himself go for the boost here actually missed it but that's fine should be okay for garrett i said i'm gonna take this back through it's gonna be a little bit awkward for a second maybe i could sneak attack go for a bump or something close good attempt from us i better bump garrett there gonna probably be a goal against us i turned anybody didn't expect me to turn i think i think i bumped him something happened there couldn't exactly tell what it was but i know i messed them up obviously you want to aim to not mess up your team as much as possible right so i feel like you're messing up probably change a little bit of what you're doing almost good almost got a free go out of that try to get the boost here closing the block i still have 40 boost here mid so i'll just stay middle i should have a double on that so from get close i could try again there should be in good aggression good challenge wednesday i that's well done it's good to me to turn there and not let them have a free 1v1 dribble right if i can cut up that play at the source which is right there i might as well do that instead of letting you have a free reign of the field and the ball right over one try to bump this last guy try to play it back to him there's a lot of space in the ball now gonna open up some opportunities for a little bit i'm gonna be there so i don't want to go quite yet play this to the wall put this to myself there's no choice but to low dribble that and it's going to be a good 50 for garrett there try to fake challenge here make him give away the ball as soon as he does i can go back it's gonna be garrett's ball for free there we go good block from us good rotation gonna be even a potential free goal for us as well and it is good shot from garrett and sheep behind you i like to cheat on those instead of going for back boost i feel like cheating you have a lot more that you're covering whereas when you go for a back boost there kind of open quite a few things up to danger and chance you want to be a little bit more careful and cheat on those and twos i'd say it's okay to go for back boost because somebody is already cheating he's gonna control this nice there we go all right good first game let's get to the next one stephen keep it up and get it back to back double probably played them again because they're probably the highest mmr players on right now so let's get into the next one let's even keep it up get another dub let's see how it goes all right plenty of shock and torment for the last one it's gonna be a very 50 50 heavy game for sure we'll see what we can do here playing these players is always a 50 50 battle very good at challenging and they know how to challenge properly so it gives them an advantage gotta flick one pretty much flicks two and doing that close one for the safe shot where it wasn't going extremely fast at it torment always always pulls the save up you guys remember torment on c9 he does not miss the easy save that's for sure garrett might be able to get back to this can be tough though are you missed as well open up some space for him i'm gonna give him a 1v1 good fake on the big clear actually really smart almost a goal as well out of that so we'll play from him wait for shock let him touch this that's fine i'll do that for garrett now nice gear can go again most likely not in but close you try again no problem good block from us you have to hit it around how to go for the bump there's a right idea really good block from garrett can't go quite yet but again i could try to bait this out to make it easier for garrett that's what i'm going to do try to control this in the corner i don't have much boost here but still a good spot to try to control that should be gareth's ball again let me go for another double so it's actually better i leave that to be honest like i missed but honestly thinking that's like the better play there to not hit that just gives my teammate a much better ball right because it's up to be in a much better position blocking the angle there totally didn't decide to go there this is how i pretty much expected this game to to fan out a bunch of 50s a lot of slow playing in the corner somewhat called boring gameplay and it can be at times but definitely the best way to play out these situations i think more often than not what about unfortunate there played it over one and garrett was in a spot where he couldn't really recover and get back they just waited extra patient played over one there pretty well i messed that up tried to fake the past mid instead of going for the obvious pass but maybe the past was the play there often not people stopped that pass that's why i wanted to wait and not pass instead a little bit unlucky have a lot of time to come back though two minutes an absolute eternity in rocket league these guys play super grounded very um very sweaty play style to play against in ranked but yeah dude you gotta do to get the dubs these days right there we go the aggression will pay off there we'll take it a 16 very winnable is up close let's get a play from us get attempts 1v1 now here in torment post crossbar is definitely not on our side this game but it's okay definitely one of those games you have to work a lot harder than you should for the goals farmer going really edgar there pretty good idea from him could be a 1v1 nice shot from garrett hold on good placement on the flick took a lot of time there that's smart right you don't have anyone near you for a while so taking that time and dribbling that ball is a really good thing to do i think couldn't beat them to that boost especially ability at the last one i'm surprised they even tried to go for that not gonna lie that's actually really good for gate i'd say more often than not should be over to gear anyway to get baked from us here go one more time just try to make something out of it huge beat from us keep it up oh that was almost insane almost crazy zero second goal cheat on this played over one day tommy should have the next ball i'll just go back now should be garrett's to deal with pretty easily because he lost control of it good challengement for us let me go back here gary could turn to midfield i thought he's going back to mid boost so played over one i know i can't control that ball there's so much raid on it right this is one that you should take time on there for sure so possession got the boost out of that as well it's pretty good one for the bump on the mid guy it's gonna help us out quite a bit boom it downfield a little shock just panic a little bit here good 50 wins for us let him go alone here one's up for this gotta play in a patient way where it can't go that badly for us i'm gonna save my boost here gotta go for the fake as close good attempt really awkward for shock to deal with yes i'll waste some boost here and try to control it i can get his corner try to bump one they're both going to be very awkward off of that get this to the side maybe get a follow-up double gotta take the other corner boost here it's a good play from them try to slow down they're getting that pressure quite a bit so taking their time there is very smart thing to do it's a big challenge performance good kill from us i thought to go for another challenge on shock there but you should have this to the side pretty easily again once the ball's out of the opponent's hands there it makes it a lot easier for a challenge to come through there force the play nicely done again any kind of aggression there any kind of presence really does just force them to panic a little bit wait for garrett to get behind me once i do then give him a free ball again just by stopping all you gotta do there is stop a little bit behind the ball and he's gonna panic a little bit should be okay for us decent challenge again garrett gets the next touch every time there that's it done winning goal here good challenges from garrett i have 100 boost pretty good situation he had a counter attack here trying to help gear it out we're going to do anything with the ball we gotta flick backward and we're dead but that's fine put a lot of time dribbling that ball backwards nice control from get feels like they have no offense here like they can't really do much there's really no no downside to how we're playing this out i think oh my god what i went for not knowing if garrett was there or not and i think i got bumped into it i don't know we'll take it that's a that's a big dub all right my game also liked really hard for some reason it it made a sound but uh yeah good game there we ended up coming back from the two goal deficit wow gary finishes six six six points geez okay let's send you officers guys i hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night whatever time this you guys may be
