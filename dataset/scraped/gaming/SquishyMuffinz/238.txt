more games today with gimmick and magic berry play 2 and the last one and they're really good so let's get into them let's even get some more wins for today let's see how it goes all right the first thing i'm playing is md 22 9 and benny all right can you make a fk audio for the kickoff for him it's fine though just blocking the goal had a pinch with them close it's a good attempt let him go if i get to set ceiling it's actually really good for gimmick probably close i'll just leave now it's actually really good to kill i'll try to keep my boost here don't want to waste it there we go my teammates are nuts what the heck making plays that was a really good play good pass good shot nice nice good job i wasn't sure if was going to be there in time i was trying to beat that first guy to the ball that was my whole goal there one jumping and if i can get that to gimmick that was a plus i didn't think i was going to be able to shoot off a bit i was going to go for a 50 if gimmick wasn't there you want to kind of have like all the situations planned out in your head before you even go for a ball i'd like to at least i was hoping that'd be a ceiling pinch hold onto my boost here because you got that one try to stay in a spot that i can kind of follow up if i need to nice from gimmick that's huge a beagle nicely done baited them in really well i haven't had to do much this game but that's the beauty of three sometimes you just fill in the gaps where you need to be teammates can do the work for you yeah i've been practicing a lot of threes lately playing a lot of threes ranked obviously because rlss coming up soon and i i want to feel as good as i possibly can for my team and i want to do as well as we can right so i'm doing really well in tournaments and stuff but i got to keep improving myself individually can never be happy with how good you think you're at you never want to get you know complacent or feel like you're you're doing well you want to always feel like you can improve on things but i think at least i think i have a lot more i can improve on i'm trying to actively focus on those things that i play and these videos actually kind of help me do that because i talk about what i'm doing a lot i'm going to go for this gimmick's going behind me that's my cue even if i fake that's fine it should be okay for him gotta control something back well my teams aren't back yet so i'm just trying to make the situation better by controlling that i'm trying to get a flip reset and following it up but couldn't quite get it nice one gimmick it's gonna be a bad shot if anything play it high i try to get this mid left boost do that for gimmick i saw him already i didn't want to mess him up i'm gonna leave that he's gonna have a boom that's fine force me hit it to my teammate that's fine as well like there's really no reason for me to panic to that ball or try to force the 50 50. not much can go wrong there play this back should be okay can't shoot again go straight to my teammate perfect situation for us do that for magic bears gonna be up oh my god what how'd they even go down it looked like he was gonna hit it out to me oh my gosh she's kind of nuts okay well that's pretty nutty it's probably the title of the video that's a good ass shot all right let's get into the next game see if we can keep it up and get the back to back i didn't have to do much that game but teammates are putting on a highlight reel so we'll take it let's get into the next one see if we can keep it up let's go let go before we get into the next game guys i wanted to show you this insane clip that i hit in ranked i think it was two or three days ago but it was an absolute banger it was a double flipper set into a pre-flip air dribble over two pro players i was playing as reynolds and satu but it was a really solid goal and i really want to show you guys this so take a look i made a little edit for you guys i hope you enjoy it and then after this quick clip we'll get into the next game [Music] tonight all right last game playing against bon vie joe yang and wet and loose all right it's pretty pretty cool name wet and loose nice and magic good start really got a lot of pressure off kick off you get this 50. not away here though face off left side oh i thought magic be a little bit closer ended up being a bad touch getting a little too hopeful on that pass there nice control from gimmick oh almost at the block let's get a pass just like it's a tough one to get across but i actually did a really good job of it magic should have good speed try to go for this quick hit it down got the bump on one which is really good but give me the last for a while here good challenge well done i like the confidence there just to go for that oh almost the pre-flip into the air dribble i just leave it better wait here he's gonna have one more probably try to stay on this ball close it's actually a really good try i almost got over all of them and i slowed down a lot from my teammates it's especially good because magic got killed i'm pretty sure good block 44 boost y'all try to stay close that full now close cut it into gimmick nice play was a good touch too can't really be super close for that though nice gimmick nice play trusted my fifth year it was really good for him to be close i need to rush in on that i wanted to spell out for my teammate right so i'm trying to get that someone behind me but somewhat middle is walks i know there's always going to be someone behind me high level games and gimmick was exactly where i expected him to be and he got a really good finish out of that try to get the boomer flick there i messed it up though it's a good try nice wait for magic here let him go jimmy's going to be there for that across to me oh my god i got destroyed she went for that it's actually really good for us that down right the gimmick there we go should i just boom that see he does there we go i was gonna play i didn't need to address that i want to get the boost wait for him to get a bad shot and i can just play off of it after i thought that was a better play not the best kickoff but it's not bad either teammates still get the ball off that nice maybe a double didn't have that one more time let him hit i don't need to address for these really no reason to let them panic hear him up for this i'm just let him hit it there yeah gimmick stole it of course the classic you come super early but i heard him behind me that's fine that's my last one anyway for the video so good timing try to just block that out believe that now it should be whoever's behind me see what they do now give me capacity on the right we'll take that you may got the pass back to me there did you almost gimbal them is actually almost perfect all right there we go that's going to be awesome guys i hope you enjoyed have yourself a wonderful day or night with the timers when you're watching this like comment and
