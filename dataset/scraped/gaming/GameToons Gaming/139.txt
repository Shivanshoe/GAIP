all right everybody we're back again for another game tunes gaming the bungas mod thing [Applause] and i recently played a game that i really like called friday night funking so we're gonna do a friday night funkin mod but it's not friday you guys are probably wondering what all the powers are right absolutely yes i'm wondering okay so you get three of them okay the first one is hitting a high note which means that you send out musical notes killing your crewmates within close proximity to you it kills a bunch of them because you really hit that piercing like the whitney houston kind of level high note the next one is mike toss so you take out a sick mic and then you get to throw it at your enemies just clonking them right in the head i'm gonna throw one right at the gentleman if i get to be the imposter and then the final one is you're gonna bring out a boom box so you you have to press a button to summon the boom box the location is determined by wherever you want to put it but it slows down all the enemies within the range of the boom boombox they hear the cool hip-hop beats so let's do it everyone yeah yeah yeah yeah hey gentlemen hey buddy how you doing you've never called me buddy before that's us we're best friends play i don't know what you're talking about no you've never called me buddy ever oh oh oh oh god [Applause] whoa chapstick i just can't stop being funky fresh oh i mean i finally made it out of there hey poopy farts you're not you're not the killer are you um yeah oh no oh my gosh you guys hey joe my friend oh no it's the two cheaters oh then it's fine wait they were from the cheaters lobby it's a whole thing never mind what was player doing in the cheaters lobby it's a whole thing i don't want to get into it right now where did you find these people gentlemen how did they die i want to know the specifics i found them in the hallway i found their bodies and there was a there was a big uh what's it called this uh boombox they're playing it's like their dead bodies were gyrating in joy still it was quite the macabre showing so did you see who killed him unfortunately i did not because of my view distance wasn't big enough i saw the musical notes but that was it yeah well i'm going to skip this vote then because it sounds like nobody knows anything does anybody know how to do that purple rock test we'll have to all keep our eyes peeled you know especially those of us that need monocles assistance you know keep your ears open for music everyone wait wait you guys have ears so the sabotage if i do it right in the middle here that would be hilarious oh actually oh my god this is amazing this is an amazing setup right here all right come on are we even going to make it in time oh geez oh no we're slow down
