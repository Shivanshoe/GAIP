[Music] hi friends as some of you might know maya is little scared of vacuums so in today's video we will do a fun challenge with maya and our new robot vacuum cleaner this challenge will have many levels in which we will test maya and see if she can overcome her fear when it comes to food we want to thank wyomi for sending us their alpha s9 robot vacuum cleaner as you can see here we've been using it since almost a month now and are so happy with it the robot is very strong and vacuums all kinds of dirt including pet hair it's a real life saver for pet owners with its mopping function it can vacuum and mop the floor at the same time which is awesome after cleaning the vacuum returns to its station and automatically disposes the dirt by itself it also comes with an app which creates a map of your home and gives you full control over the robot for example you can set up a cleaning time plan or you can block certain areas let's block maya's sleeping area [Music] if you're interested in the alpha s9 visit the links down below in the description box to buy it or for more information alright let's start with the challenge now in the first level we start off easy the robot vacuum cleaner is turned off and we will put some snacks on top of it to see if maya would dare to take them [Music] now the second level will be similar we will put some snacks on top of the robot again but this time we'll make it harder by turning it on [Music] do do [Music] do do the next level will be different because we will place some snags in between them on the floor and we will first turn the vacuum on and then see if maya will be brave enough to take the snacks before the vacuum takes them [Music] as we all know maya is somewhat of a vacuum herself when it comes to food so for the final level we let maya race against a robot to see who is the true vacuum master and who will take the crown [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you
