she always has to have some kitty food so boo likes eggs too that's his favorite he has to have one for breakfast every morning all right what do you think boo so they have to go around and do this every day and we're not even doing all the animals right now just but we are doing a bunch so very important part of the daily process whether it's rainy and cold and when it gets cold because they're in florida most of these are exotics like they have to go to not not a lot but when it does get cold they have to go to some pretty extreme measures to keep everybody warm and safe tiffany uh what are
