out to use food yeah it was a lot of fun and one one other real quick thing i've seen you some comments i'm trying to adjust it guys somebody has made a youtube page and it's they're they're literally replying to all these comments and it's saying monkey boo official it's not us if you don't have a check mark beside it it's not on youtube facebook or instagram it is not monkey boot so you guys can tell that person actually reported as a fake account i don't know why this person is doing this but he's literally going to reply to people in the comments like he's me sarah jenkins said that happened to me yeah sarah you can go and tell that guy so the other people could see it that like i think i blocked him from the page but if you can still see those comments let them know like that is that that is not us well i have monkey boo with a check mark beside it why would we do official monkey booth right right so daniel is helping us out today today's his first date he's one of our new editors and camera people everybody say hi to daniel daniel i don't think you're zooming in and i'm going to close enough to just where you're at everybody wants to see boo they tuned in to watch monkey blue not me but for real you got to stay on board bye guys like yeah that's better all right we got to get your tail oh and his backside oh yeah nice and clean oh yeah so yeah that's not us guys doing those comments sorry about that sorry that person is impersonating me they weren't really saying anything rude but i guess they just need some friends i don't know maybe their mom didn't hug them enough with hotmail but sorry buddy i just tried to spice it up for you a little bit dude someone asked how was uh florida uh florida was good other than the car accident if you guys didn't i did a facebook live uh you guys want to see the aftermath of it and the truck may be totaled it may not we're not sure uh according to the the body shops did the estimates they said it was totaled the insurance company says it's not so that's what we're dealing with right now but the good thing is is because they left me sitting out there they didn't they first they told me i didn't even have insurance and i was like i showed them i mean i was i was on the phone with them i was reading my policy number the dates on it i was like it's good and they basically they never even sent anybody out for me so i called my insurance agent and told them i was like did you see the facebook live from directly because you have a lot of views and a lot of comments i was like you could tell this insurance company if they jerk me around on monkey boo's truck i was like they don't have a problem taking my money once a year when i pay for my insurance like i want my benefits i won't boost truck big strong i'll win it oh we got a 1999 donation tina balanger thank you tina we just met we hung out with you over the weekend didn't we so anyway so the insurance company is they're just trying to they're just kind of trying to play low ball but the good thing is i called my insurance agent today and he knows all about monkey boom and i was like i don't think these people realize i was like because they said that i didn't even call on saturday night and i saw i sent a screenshot of a 50 one of the phone calls a 50 minute phone call to my insurance company and i told them i was like uh so they said i didn't talk to him and she's like wow she goes oh my goodness this is this is not good i was like right so i called the main guy at the office and told him i know you have a contact with this insurance company if you're selling their insurance and i was like you better tell them that i promise if they try to jerk me and monkey boo around on this because it seems like they're really going to i will make a video telling everything how they've done us how they left us sitting out there from one o'clock until five in the morning and then come to find out i did have roadside and i had i had to fend for myself luckily the officer that came out to the scene had a buddy that that had a wrecker service and he come out and uh pulled me out so yeah so about the wreck if you guys want to hear what happened i got off one of the extra ramps in orlando on the toll roads my maps were showing to keep circling to the right those are pretty well paid roads it's 55 60 65. we got um i think it's another five dollar donation from kt mack thank you kt so thank you kaity thank you katie so but anyway so i was coming off the exit ramp that i was supposed to and my maps was showing me to keep circling to the right and i i glanced down to my map so i was like i keep circling right and i looked up and i was like uh the circles ended and it was i come to a crossroads what not a crossroad but a like a t-bone like there was a road but it was a it wasn't a new paved road and i was actually supposed to be turning left there but my maps didn't show and when i realized that i had ran out the road i was about 30 feet from where the stop sign should have been and so i had i was already kind of going to the right so i had to make a hard right 90 degree right from like 30 feet away doing about 45 or 50 miles an hour i had slowed down some if i would have made that right my truck would have rolled it probably would have been real bad on me luckily booing the guys wasn't with me but everything's the truck will get fixed or we'll get a new truck booze like i've been thinking about maybe a nice range rover what do you think boo you want to range over we'll keep the truck into the range rover maybe we'll see but anyway we'll get it worked out yeah sure but but i told the insurance company that monkey boot fans wouldn't come for him on their their facebook page they're going to make this right like i i actually had to flex monkey boo on them i was like man this ain't right i was like this is messed up so i hope everybody's having a good day um i wasn't sore i hope everybody got to meet uncle jeff he had a good time with us he enjoyed meeting everybody he was when he leaves he's like when people surely love dude and i was like yeah they they love him there was some really really i don't know if they want me to say their names but i know there was a couple fans who made some really nice donations to the care foundation that was very very nice guys thank you very much we had a pretty decent turnout that was fun um got to meet everybody it was so cool to meet everybody uh and see see what everybody looks like uh tina was tina ballinger was there and uh oh my gosh betty vickers and there's just so many people like i know you guys are going why can't you remember my name pete erica hart was there she come both days a lot of people come both days and that was it was really awesome because i had to wait on triple a sunday morning so we were a couple hours late and everybody waited on us and it was really awesome and then boo went into the zone it was a super good looking boot he's like i loved on everybody and said hey to him and i shook hands with some people it was a fun time right dude yeah five dollars where is it from um i can't remember the name the comments are going to this lisa ramsey thank you lisa say thank you it's like how expensive truck pay for i'll probably help out a little bit we're going to start the monkey boo truck gofundme i'm just kidding i would never do that so we want to do a live bath video so now that i have daniel here we'll be doing lot some lot lots more videos um monkey mila's channel will be launching there's a really cool video going up tomorrow on the care foundations page of monkey mila meeting her first girl monkey ever uh rosie the monkey from the care foundation it's a really cute video it's on their youtube page go check it out subscribe to it uh we i like they film the videos and i kind of handle it being boo promoted for them and stuff they're they're all just like everybody else they're all part of the monkey boot crew the reason i work with them because all their most of their animals are former pets and that's where they'll always be at and it's people that's bought exotic pets not just monkeys crocodiles cobras uh that they just don't realize what you're getting yourself into right boo he's like cobras are crazy so we also posted a video today right of guys i touched a a savage uh burmese python that hates people it really wants to kill a person and i went into the room with kristen and uh she fed the frozen rabbit and the snake wrapped around it so we were able to go in she had to clean up the cage but i actually went in there with that that's on the care foundation page today i'll put it on blue's instagram you guys will love it it was it was terrifying because this snake's big enough if it like i don't think it could eat you but it could definitely kill you and kristen even talks about it at the beginning of the video that the snake always wants to try to get her in fact when we were we didn't show it on the video but as we were opening the door uncle jeff was standing outside looking at the glass and as we started opening the door he's like that snake's coming towards the door um i'm pretty sure that snake's about eight or nine feet long 200 pounds so yeah big snake who's having this strawberry strawberry strawberry is your neighborhood who knows that song and we won't finish it strawberry strawberry in the neighborhood if i'm pronouncing it right you got to be careful everybody have you say something crazy like i'm just going to say mike i'm not i'm not saying nothing about swinging their hand okay that was really cool somebody's like oh we've got a rookie on here we're going to make it safe don't know they'll have they'll they'll say something and when you read it you know it won't sound like what you did what you say won't you know i'm saying he'll trick you like that the surface i don't know if you know that it seems like a kingdom three times in a row surfer kingdom surfer kingdom kingdom saving you sofa kingdom so for kingdom so for kingdom you know what now listen to what you're saying yeah so for suffocating sofa
