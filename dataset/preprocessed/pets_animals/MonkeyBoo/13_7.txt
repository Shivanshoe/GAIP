monkey what you checking my pockets i got nothing for you i didn't get treats this time no treats no so we have really missed you guys um i've had a lot of really nice messages and emails you know just saying hey just want to check on you guys we're all good i was like i got i just i was actually sick for [Music] almost two weeks and the first week i couldn't hear out of my right ear and like i would either talk too quiet or too loud um and the second week it was my left ear and it was weird like i couldn't hear out of my ears so the uh i and i never really had i wouldn't have my test i think everybody on facebook knows that uh but yeah it just lasted for a while and um you know december's a really busy month and with the videos and stuff and everything that we do and i was like you know we'll take a couple more days and i like really like over the weekend i really spent the weekend by myself with the monkeys just hanging out like me and just me and the monkeys no pressure of the camera i'm having one of my infamous allergy attacks it'll go away in just a few minutes i promise but uh me and the monkeys no no camera we didn't have to video anything and none of the monkeys got sick i you know i was telling everybody on another one i actually quarantined myself from them like i was still having to feed and take care of but i was sanitized and wearing gloves and not wearing a mask because there for a few days i wasn't sure what would have been after i got my test and i knew it was whatever was going on like i think i had like a mild flu maybe it wasn't i never had all like the congestion of a cold just southern cold symptoms you know i'm i'm you guys might wanna just might find this funny when i was uh when i went and had my covered test and i was driving home before i got results i was thinking about that and i was like 49 and i'm single would i rather be waiting on the results of a common test or a pregnancy test and it took me about 1.2 seconds to go oh yeah i'm definitely going to roll with the dice with the common test on that one i love kids but you know i don't want no more they they grow up and then they're all grown right you know happy thank you for

mail and stuff she's been watching this for a long time i'm glad i caught your comment judy there's comments coming through like crazy on more on this one but on both of them i need to get out the other phone and bust out onto another platform triple triple platform so the audio is good on both of them everybody can hear me good i love doing this double live videos this is too too cool where's monkey boo boo hey all right so normally when i'm live like this i'll go over and showed up and show boo and mila or whoever's the other two that's not with me but they uh like i got two cameras set up here so i can only take one so we're just going to go this and uh boo boo or meal will be live tomorrow night we're we're going to start doing a lot of live videos at night it'll eventually turn into like three nights a week but for a while probably through the end of the year we're going to do lives like as many nights as we possibly can and even during the day especially once it gets closer to the holidays and everybody's out of school and you know on vacation from work and all that good stuff yes oh yeah and them numbers right here on youtube trust me monkey boo has been around uh don't make me pull the million subscriber we have two and a half million subscribers we are about to flip this around so definitely share it please share the youtube videos guys if you have twitter or put them in your instagram story we always put the youtube videos with the link in our instagram stories so if you want to uh go on the uploaded videos so if you want to go to instagram and then share those to your story appreciate it like i have like it's kind of got to the point where i've got to show youtube that a lot of people love us and a lot of people want to watch us and that could have been a ghost i had no idea what that noise was did you guys hear that happy's like what the crap man but yeah so like i'm i'm gonna reach out to my fans and say hey guys please help us out and i got both audiences watching here this is the best time to ask this question i know you guys have seen like the subscriptions and stuff like that um i want to do something like that that's it's videos that all you can see and i want to keep it very very cheap and there's other perks that come with it but like how do you would you guys feel about it because there'll still be regular clothes i'm not gonna make people pay to watch my videos but we are thinking about doing a patreon account for all three monkeys together um you know like and it'll be there'll be stuff that you can't see their videos basically there's videos and maybe even live streams and stuff like that that you can't see on facebook or youtube that like this is only it's just for the patreon people so it's a little more personal a little more interactive i'm sorry sorry about that but guys please leave some leave some comments so i know who like how you feel about that you know like this everything we're doing now will still be there and we're really like lisa give her a hand she's not here she actually just left a little while ago um my assistant lisa if you guys don't remember youtube audience probably don't uh her her car was stolen and the idiot literally parked right up at the church right beside her house after he had been out stealing and her and her husband confronted him and lisa got run over two times she was she had to be airlifted from this we have a pretty good hospital well where she lives at they have a pretty good hospital and she had to be airlifted to charlotte to because it was really serious and uh but she's okay now she's all healed up and everything's good how old is blue boo is 12 years old this is happy he's three so everybody say i'll tell these to look at the comments so everybody say we're glad you're doing better she helps out lisa is the cleaning lady she does great at it literally the last thing she did before she left the house was made sure my kitchen was spotless it's awesome i would if i was on one camera i would take you guys in all right party cloud opportunities happy you are too much cute i feel you on the ears and one like an auctioneer i realize it stay well boot crew thank you very much thank you for the stars over here on facebook you guys are amazing those are like for the youtube audience i'll explain you you guys know what the super chat is that's when people send donations in and i know i've only been reading those comments but they're coming it's hard to see them but my god laura lambert i see you adrian i see you and i'm glad i'm glad to be back and naji i see you like david like i'm just i'm not just acknowledging the people that are sending money i don't want anybody to think that that's not what it's about i'm not asking anybody to send us anything if you don't guys do thank you very much one of the moderators or that that's actually monkey boo will probably tell you thank you but you know it's uh i just had a camera realization but it's you know this i do this to to make people happy yeah if i make people happy if we make fun videos if we're having fun we'll do this people will come and watch you guys will continue to watch so my camera realization i just had so i don't have to do this and i like i have to go back and forth like i'm looking at a teleprompter i'm not going to say any names or anything but i just don't want to look like somebody like that going back and forth i think i need to put the camera side by side and that way i can look straight ahead keep happening i got two i kind of got like two side angles right now i thought that was the way to go but like i'm bouncing back and forth i'm talking to you guys i'm talking to you guys i'm talking to you guys i'm talking to you guys what's cool is you guys can go on facebook later and youtube and play these videos simultaneously let's see how that works out uh no it wouldn't be nowhere near twenty dollars for the patreon like like five dollars a month we have a we have a lot of followers i'm sure a lot of people would do it and like like and they do have different tiers like a 20 tier like you're getting like a you're probably if you did like like for example or something like that this is i've seen other people do it like you say if if we had a 20 tier and you committed to it for a whole year um you'll probably get a live one-on-one video by yourself i mean just little stuff like that i mean like i'm not saying for sure that's what it would be but that's kind of what patreon is all about it's the same as if you guys are have ever paid attention to youtube subscriptions but that's just something that we've we thought about doing and this is it's not really awesome guys like yeah it'll bring in more revenue for the monkeys but there's there's things we're going to do to put the monkeys out there even more and and it takes money to so a lot of that's a lot of stuff we do these trips and stuff with three monkeys you guys have no idea traveling with three monkeys it's it can be expensive like we do fine with it i have no problem with that we're not we're not happy we're doing okay he's like daddy be for real man [Music] so anyway so life is really good i'm super excited about december um i need some ideas for christmas giveaways um i'm definitely gonna do a christmas giveaway on hold on just a second guys i'm gonna do a nasty not nasty like good nasty in a good way christmas giveaway on youtube i don't know guys um just because i want to spike my audience back up i don't like there's a lot
