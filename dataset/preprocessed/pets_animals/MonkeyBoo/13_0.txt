tina that's t-980 say thank you tina well it ain't really so much that i have monkeys sometimes it's because of that um i just have like i've been doing youtube for a long time my son's a successful youtuber so like i've dealt with trolls thank you michael if you have a brother would you make them a monkey yeah exactly i have my no that's my uncle jeff he says that now but yeah like with the size audiences that i've had over the years on and i used to do comedy videos i've actually worked with mtv true tv and i'm i'm getting ready to start doing some more comedy stuff of my own but it's not really the same stuff that i show would show on the monkey videos so to speak but being like with the size audience and stuff i had like it's hard to rattle me with a comment you know what i'm saying like like it's so it's like okay i don't know how long you've been uh create or influence or how big your following is but i'll give you a little piece of advice if you've got 100 comments on a video right and you've got 50 positive and 50 50 negative it's a lot easier you can go through and say thank you love you too thanks for watching and you can respond to those 50 positive videos in the time that it takes to respond to four or five of those negative videos man don't even pay attention to the negative videos you know and if they say if you know if you if you've got loyal fans they'll defend you to those people you don't have to defend yourself to them they'll do it for you my fans like if somebody really says something on facebook one they either get banned or even worse i reply back to them and say it's like how much attention do you want now my verified account just replied back to you have fun with your little crappy comment that you just left and now you know sometimes i'll chime back in after 300 replies to mine like have you enjoyed your attention because you asked for it so but yeah that's uh like that's just just stay away from the negative comments don't don't sweat them bro i promise it's not worth it just just pay attention to people the people that like your stuff man i've been doing youtube since alone for a long just got taken time me because i had a video i had a video with 41 million views or some dogs at a dog show they wouldn't even buy dogs was it a copyright idea i mean was it a copyright did somebody else have the same video or something or they do edit the video sometimes sometimes but i don't i don't give out any advice on getting a monkey i don't encourage i tell people watch my videos we do meet and greets you can come hang out with my monkeys and there's ways to do that i don't if somebody can afford to even think about buying a monkey they can easily pay to come to where we're going to be at and hang out with my monkeys and see like this is 24 7. this is what i do having a monkey is not a pet bro it's more it is more commitment than marriage promise i mean i've seen i've actually seen monkeys i've seen monkeys cause divorces i've seen a monkey cause a divorce because one person decided they didn't want to do it no more and the other one did and then two years later the one that got the divorce because they wanted to keep the monkey ends up getting rid of it i got i've seen i've been doing this a long time i like monkey this is my girl monkey mila here this is monkey boo's girlfriend but make no mistake about when you when it comes to monkeys on the internet and all that monkey boo is the goat you can look at his youtube channel and stuff like the numbers speak for himself boo's been around for a long time yeah
