something hope you could put fuel in the rv for trips with monkey boot crew thank you yes like there's been times pumping gas and rv i'm pretty sure the rv has looked at me and was like this is some tasty gas like it drinks it has a 75 gallon gas tank so which is almost triple the size of one of my big monkey boots big truck so that was very nice thank you very much joanne that was very nice to interact with you when i messaged her on facebook i think she thought i was a spammer at first so that was uh that was really cool thank you very much all right this is from deanna siegmann and conover nc that's not very far from us see what it says here dear monkey booze owner my name is deanna sigman i live in north carolina i'm gonna ask you some questions okay here you go no monkey new q and a we didn't work because we're just about done we got a couple more letters how was monkey boo when you got it monkey boo was just a few weeks old when we got him does he sleep in a crate like a dog does i know they have big enclosures or they sleep with me all the monkeys do uh or does he sleep with you in your bed yes and i do not there's no wife does he see sometimes the i usually just sleep with one monkey at a time though whatever music says for me sometimes why does blue not wear a diaper boot does wear a diaper i don't know there's older videos maybe when he's outside um um have you so but yeah blue where's the doctor i'm happy he has a diaper on right now too have you ever potty trained him uh i've seen all my monkeys use a toilet except happy mila has done it before and blue has done it but it's something they won't do every time when i got blue okay we're not gonna get into how i don't i don't encourage anybody to get a monkey so that's that's more towards encouraging that like guys just live vicariously through my monkeys and if you do that i promise i'll post lots and lots of videos i'd rather do that than you get a monkey because it's just so much work you guys have no idea yeah now see see diana we don't we do not advise or encourage anyone to get a monkey as a pet um [Music] all right so she i answered a few of the questions but the other questions about getting a pet monkey like i'm we don't pass that anymore like first off i'm not even licensed to do that i'm licensed to exhibit my monkeys and show them and do the things we do with them and that's really all i can do um so sorry about that but it's okay we're not mad all right this is from calista ravilla down in south florida i think we had a letter from a while ago let's see
