memories from alexis and princess the cat well thank you alexis and princess the cat mila is a princess too right boo hi monkey boo i love your videos that you and your pet human do all the most

can and alexis sent an email so thank you very much alexis merry christmas to you and your family happy new year to you guys all right we've got some boxes here oh goodness boo i know who this is from i know who it's from who's it from who is it who is it from do you know who can you tell me can you tell me can you tell me look it's from nadine rhodey and there's some honey roasted peanuts have to check the ingredients they can normally had to have a small amount of these at a time but they can't have a couple and they love them nadine so you guys want to hear a cool story about nadine and her ex-husband her ex-husband is actually the one who showed her monkey blue videos what three or four years ago i don't know the whole story but it was christmas time and i think probably maybe a small roll boo played in getting them back together so they have been split up uh i'm not gonna get into their personal business i don't even know the whole story um oh i see where somebody said they live a lot longer in captivity if you feed them right and take care of them you can't feed them junk there's some other monkeys that eat a lot of junk food that is bad bad bad guys cannot do that sugar and stuff like that cotton candy marshmallows my monkeys don't even have a clue what any of that tastes like it's very frustrating when i see people because a lot of times i know they're doing it just to get views like man just make cute videos and make people happy and make them feel good if you the views will come if you're if you're making good content what like and that applies to any platform um youtube facebook instagram anybody that's an aspiring wants to be some type of influencer or do some kind of entertainment and when you're when you post your videos if they don't make you laugh or smile or or if you don't learn you know if you can't see where people can learn something from like you're probably not doing it right just yeah like i said i just don't i don't like to see some of the other monkeys eating a lot of junk food and i would advise everybody if you see those monkeys eating junk in other videos other plants i don't even even if it's on another platform call them out on it say why is your monkey marshmallows why are you feeding that monkey cookies capuchin monkeys are prone to die more prone to diabetes than people are and that's like one of the top three or four leading causes of death i'm pretty sure so it's very important their diet is so so important you know you have a you have a monkey that you do videos with and everybody loves it you got to keep it healthy i got three of them when they get a very strict diet mostly vegetables and monkey biscuits right boo yeah all right we got a box here let's see what it says oh this is from molly martin and
