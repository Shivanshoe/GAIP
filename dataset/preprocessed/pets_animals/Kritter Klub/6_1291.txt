Why is a white tiger coming out of the water? LOL White tiger 'Odin' which loves diving Ever seen a white tiger like this? But usually, tigers hate going in the water This one even hunts in the water Wow!! What a cool white tiger! Fantastic swimmer! Wonderful swimmer~ It's very mild in front of the zookeeper When it drinks milk Acts like a baby And it's 3m tall! When Odin was about a year and a half old, he saw a meat down the bottom of the pool, as he saw it right away, he went right down to get it As soon as Odin dives Eats the meat How does it eat in the water when there's no smell? If the zookeeper throws a piece of meat Looks around for the food Uses its front paws to eat it Even folds its ears to prevent water going inside Don't you guys think that I'm a genius?
