Henlo~ Jeez I'm not flirting you Listen to our grandma Grandma : There are 8 of this doggos Look at Beakgu's 5 dem pretty puppies I know right Our puppies Who make me smile We da cutest. Duh Excpet for her!! Her smile goes away Hecc.. She's weird these days. That's why I've been stressed out Makes me sad Look (avoids) Avoids again Flustered grandma She's a stray dog, and she came to my house and gave birth to puppies She never let me touch her.. Dunno what to do Guess it's been 3 years That she's never allowed anyone to touch her. Being so expensive Upon approaching Baekgu doggo gets far away But Don't get me wrong I don't hate her ofc When seeing her eyes, my affection towards her grows Food of love I prepared several meals for her To see if she can eat this or that Even though I bought so many for her, she still doesn't open up How can I make her open up? Look how many I got for her And old proverb says One good turn Deserves another, but.. Do you have any idea how many tasty ones I've got you? Well... smh Don't just shake your head Baekgu, this doggo Never does the grandma a favor Come here, get your treats Nah! Enuff is enuff As the grandma goes out Baekgu comes in Whoa.. Someone might misunderstand her I feel so betrayed by her.. Talk with eyes I'm in a bad mood So I'm gonna ride a bicycle Where is she going? Gotta follow her.. It's dangerous to leave your lady alone! Looks like they love each other Imma wait for you outside, grandma Q. How is she usually? When her owner is not around her, she always stays next to the bicycle I'm waiting. +_+ Are you a real push-pull expert? As the background music is changed Baekgu looks like a legit loyal dog When I go somewhere, she follows Sometimes I say bad words cuz it gets on my nerves Even though she talks bad like that She's really good to her / Of course! Once again Gives hand to be nice Omg Drives me crazy.. Baekgu, don't make me confuse Make up your mind plz -_-
Stay tuned for part 2!
