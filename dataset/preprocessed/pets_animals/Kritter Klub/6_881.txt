This dog is so skinny to the point its bones are showing Doberman Seungki It eats some of its friend's food eats everything on the plate But why is Seunki so skinny? He greets his owner Owner: My neighbours complained a lot because Seungki used to bark all the time So I had to keep him at my mother's house Is Seungki sick or something? Vet: The cause is not clear, but it can't assimilate nutrients from food I think it's a psychological problem Owner: I'm just going to take him back to my house The woman feels sorry for Seungki After 2 weeks Seungki looks way healthier I think Seungki feels relieved because he came back It was stressful for Seungki to live in a strange environment Seungki, always stay healthy from now on! :D
