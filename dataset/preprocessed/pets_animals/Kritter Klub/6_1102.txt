The crews' tough job.. Kick with deadly claws OMG~~~ So scary.. Change of the plans, retreat! Phew.. Meanwhile, he trips lol Oops It's not an ostrich, but.. The scariest bird in the world - 'Cassowary' "These are one of the few species left, that are descendants of dinosaurs" Hm.. Seems to look like a dinosaur in Jurassic park tho.. The head shape resembles of a Pachycephhlosaurus However, it doesn't have wings(meaning that it can't fly)? Instead of wings they have these claws which may bring humans death (shivers..) Thought those were dinosaur feet If they kick a cow or a horse, they can pierce right through their stomachs
[stab..] How dangerous and deadly they are.. Cassowary : Lemme show you what I got Jump They can jump up to 2 meters leap Gulp Do you not chew?! Can you still feel the taste?! uhhh... The fruit's seeds are released without any damage and grows again Their nicknames are the farmers of the wild Cassowary with a threatening look : What? You have a problem?!! >:0 [Editor's Note : Kritter Klub subscribers.. it's time to RUN AWAY!!!]
