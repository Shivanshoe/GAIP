Whenever he sees chickens his wild instincts revive You better surrender, chicken! "Running away as fast as your tail feathers would fall out" perfectly describe this situation..? (KKONGJI)
(Tail) (Boksil, no..!) That cray doggo! My body isn't big enough to handle my instinct Boksil's owner : Oh my, where does he keep going Oh my~~ My Boksil That Boksil.. is messing around here Shouting out "Oh my" 100 times Oh my~~Oh my, are you here to catch em again! One day.. Imma take revenge.. When he's freed~ he just smashes dem chickens~ What's left is You gotta get spanked more, why did you catch the chickens again Nagging big times and Boksil is grounded Boksil, do you know whose chickens are they? Pastor Pastor(The chickens' owner) : He's watching out for an opportunity The chickens are the pastor's precious babies.. Dad.. We just knocked on the door of heaven.. Because of Boksil who escapes even when being tied up Apologies.. Boksil killed chickens So I went to Daejeon province and bought 2 chickens as apology Not knowing her efforts, Boksil opens the door! She wore white shoes as well Where Boksil heads to is the front yard of the church! Oh my, Boksil!!! Fortunately Stopped her before she messes with the chickens Boksil, I told you to stay at home Why did you come out~ It's tough since we should protect the chickens as well as the dog My chickens can't live feeling anxious all the time Have you heard of an old saying "Put yourself in another's shoes?" For each other's freedom Next to the dog chasing after the chickens Bring the chickens who chase after the dog! Oh my It's 17 vs 1 Bring it on!!! By the attack of an overwhelming number of chickens Save meh ;( I reflect on my faults.. From now on Even when the chickens are ahead of me I'm so done man... She doesn't go! Aww, good boi.. "Don't catch the chickens from now on~" Will do my best ma'am..
