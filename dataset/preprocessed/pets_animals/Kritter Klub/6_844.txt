Lemmeow Meet Cats For You Today I climbed to the top of a mountain to I meet feral cats living around here instead of you guys Hello? It took 1.5 hours to climb up to meet you (Yep, the cat didn't ask and wonder at all) To survive on the top where there's a lack of food they need to be a bit friendly When the sun is too hot, they take a rest in the shade behind a hiker's back Could they get something to eat if waiting like this? They even eat yummy walnut bread given by hikers Can't eat more even if they want to Kitty, there're only cherry tomatoes there As hikers bump into cute feral cats living in the mountain, they share affection with cats, giving the leftover gimbap(Korean roll) If good people climb up sometime, they can eat yummy food and even share water with each other Slurp slurp In the harsh world of feral cats, They need to learn how to wait Smacking lips I ate all now, meow~ Thinking of cats, 'fish' pops up in our head Would these feral cats like fish? Treats for cats, candlefish My pet cat loves candlefish though Eats so well as expected Nope, doesn't really eat.... Shake the dust off You wanted to eat cherry tomato just before tho ;(( It's been a while since they take a nap on a full stomach Dunno why you guys live in a high place but hope your lives are (always) full of warmth just like summer days foreign
