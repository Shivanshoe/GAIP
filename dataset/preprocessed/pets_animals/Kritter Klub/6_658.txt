Just like luck to get a hole in one A doggie (roaming) Super Likey appears suddenly..? (Excuse me..) (Sir, nice shot~) She sometimes appears once. to throw a ball.. hehe.. Look, there she is in the bunker right now! Who are you..? Special gallery, Hwindoong Since a few months ago the dog who's been roaming around the golf course.. Golf club staff :  I guess the dog has some reason to walk around We're curious as well, but.. (Looks around) "Hwindoong~" "I found her! Hwindoong~" "Hwindoong~ Come here~" (Me..?) (Ignoring af) The closer we get, the further she runs away Golf club staff :  That's why we're not trying to go closer to her but just watching each other in a far distance Being wary of people, the dog walks around the golf course
(Practicing social distancing) In this place where there's no food to eat Searching the dog satisfies her hunger by eating the leftovers Is there any reason why he can't leave the golf course Golf club staff : See the suckling marks on her breast The crew : Then her puppies must be somewhere? Golf club staff : Yeah, they must be somewhere Somewhere.. We don't know where they're though Traces of birth but the puppies are not seen.. The crew possessed by Heidi's spirit : Hwindoong, where are you going, huh? What? (Block the sender) Hwindoong's logged out;; Wonder if her puppies are safe.. Chasing after the dog but she disappears shortly.. (In the golf course) Find Hwindoong! I found the dog Hole number two here! Hwindoong was found over the hill where people barely pass by And.. her puppies where found there But Golf club staff :  If only they had been found sooner.. If only we had found them yesterday.. Hwindoong watches the whole situation from a far distance What happened to Hwindoong and her puppies..? What happened to Hwindoong and her puppies..?
