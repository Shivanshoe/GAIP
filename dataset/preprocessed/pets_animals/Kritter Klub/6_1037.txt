First attempt Second attempt 1, 2, 3 leggo Action! I'm outta here Twirls? Whoa look at that land Time to meet my lovaa Jelly met eyes with Hana outside And fell in love Ever since then, they started playing together every day No you let go first. No, you~ I find it sweet how they play together But they break everything in the house It's so hard on me FOOD We'll use what we have Jelly, I'm sorry to go this far But what else can I do? The type of father who you can't miss a curfew with The Power of Love LITERALLY Against All Odds Since you can't keep them apart When Jelly hears the sound You're giving a signal that now is play time Let's go on your date It's my first time bringing Jelly on a leash here We'll set times for dates And hope they live happily ever after
