Eat a lot 10 earthworms per one chick Big eaters the chick triplet It wasn't always easy to take care of them What I hate most is an earthworm. I'm deadly serious I'm only doing this as a mom 'cause they eat My precious babies Mother birds feed their chicks instead of feeding on themselves by flying hundreds and thousands time Like their mother, I'm doing my best to feed them You gotta fall asleep when you're feeling full What kind of birds are my chicks? Expert : The most common bird living in S.Korea is Pale Thrush The chick triplet turns out to be Summer bird Pale Thrush Expert : It's amazing how she nursed such a little chick to this big Pheasants and chicks who can eat on their own don't need an assistant But for the pale thrush, someone has to put prey into their mouth She must have nursed and cared a lot to raise them this big Today the bird triplet goes out for the first time~! Expert : They usually feed on earthworms under the leaves if you put them here and let them eat, it'd be still awkward but they'll eat anyway The pale thrush will get older someday Practicing how to find prey on their own Good job! Did I do well? Expert : If the time comes when they can find prey on their own They'll slowly leave people If I don't see them one day, I'll assume that they left I'll feel bad but it's their way of living Once you go back to nature Don't forget about your hooman mom's love
