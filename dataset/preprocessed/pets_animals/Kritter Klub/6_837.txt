Kkachil~! Squawking Step step step Kkachil~! Wasn't sure about its gender But anyway, I went, "You're Kkachil from now on" I've been calling him Kkachil from then on I still call him Kkachil till now 8 months ago Kkachil, the magpie has been Mister's best friend ever since (Playing with soil is a must for his bestie) I can't find it with my eyes Hurry up and find it (It's here, man) I'm wearing glasses
because of you I never wore glasses in my life But I bought one because of this dude Pick pick #Playingwithsoild_withKkachil #Pickingupalarva I didn't know what Kkachil would like to eat Then I dug the ground and gave a larva, then Kkachil loved it And Kkachil ate it so gladly Eat this Nom nom The mister is the only one who's feeding you, man But.. Maybe 'cause Kkachil is still a baby? Looks somehow uncomfortable If I say this the upper part of a beak Kkachil doesn't have the lower one Unlike other magpies, Kkachil doesn't have the lower beak Moreover, Lost all tail feathers..! It wasn't severe to the point where he lost all feathers But it's gotten worse since one or two months ago The skin is red and there're bites on it I guess there has been a territorial fight where other magpies attack Kkachil Kkachil is an outsider Even Kkachil's mom doesn't come to see it So we brought Kkachil and fed it for the first time Perhaps Kkachil was abandoned because he was weak But still Thanks to the mister Kkachil makes it through today as well Squawking These rascals Hey, aren't you leaving? / Really? 'Do you know how much I love ya?' Anyway Drinking water here Splash (Moping) What are you doing now, mister? The amount of poops he let out is enormous "It stinks" Heartbroken SHOOKED
