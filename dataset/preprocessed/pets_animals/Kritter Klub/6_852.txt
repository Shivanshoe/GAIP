Upon hearing the grandpa's voice Baeksang comes back his senses What's up? Stay calm Don't know why such docile Baeksang starts acting abnormally It's been a year since I brought him home He was fine when he was young, but as he grew bigger he began biting his tail off and spinning over and over.. It drives me crazy From six months ago, Baeksang who's been well began harming himself I can't stop him once it begins.. He might harm people in that case Look at him, he's doing it again His abnormal behavior begins again Baeksang, come here Once he turns crazy, he gets to calm himself down after a while Baeksang harassing himself cruelly.. Looking quite exhausted Grandpa had no choice but to watch him.. Owner : There's a hospital in the city I have to drive there, but I don't have a car And I also can't afford to rent it A veterinarian hospital is in a few hours away from home and he's not financially stable.. I prescribed medicine for him twice, but they didn't work Grandpa went to the hospital and received medicine for the dog Due to his continuous abnormal behavior, however, the wound didn't  heal Every day, however, grandpa doesn't forget to sterilize him As if he knows the grandpa's efforts and affection Baeksang keeps trying to stay with his grandpa That evening, when Baeksang has come back to his senses Grandpa works on the farm Baeksang who was resting starts harming himself again Grandpa hurriedly comes back home and tries to stop him He's my only dog.. I don't know what to do But grandpa can't give him up To stay with Baeksang more longer, Decide to get help from an expert While the specialist's watching him, Baeksang begins acting abnormally again What's the cause? Expert : Dogs living in a rural area and being tied in a 1 meter rope show compulsive behavior in a certain pattern In his case, it's pretty severe The severe compulsive disorder makes them harm themselves physically Such as biting off their tail or damaging a certain part of their skin These are all connected to self-harming, compulsive disorder His abnormal behavior one of the self-harming symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Such symptoms appear to those living in confined areas Maybe there's a problem with where he lives? You see that he walks around in circles It shows that he's been stressed in a confined area Being tied up in a short leash, Baeksang has lived in a small space The farthest distance he can go He could only roam within it.. His frustration has shown as self-harming behaviors One should learn how to control in their lives For dogs, smelling is one of the ways to do so But for those who're tied like Baeksang They're limited to relieve stress and express their instincts Smelling is a basic instinct of dogs A failure of satisfying such desire must have triggered the problem Grandpa hasn't learned how to walk the dog yet or never have walked the dog before Humans go to school to learn right For dogs, they need to go out and smell for learning The time when you think you're late is the earliest Baeksang finally takes a step out to the world for the first time Maybe he could set himself free from his confined world while learning new things Strangely, however, Baeksang walks in the same spot Dogs usually walk forward while smelling at ease But Baeksang keeps spinning All he experienced was spinning in the same spot while being tipped up That's why he keeps spinning around the same spot right now He's lived within a diameter He doesn't know what to do in his first outing Baeksang needs to learn how to smell To move forward to a broad world, learning how to smell is very important Stand still where the treats are until he finds them by smelling As they lure him to find the treats, Baeksang, slowly and carefully, takes a step Breathing the smell of the grass deeply, he even pees to mark He doesn't act weirdly while strolling He's doing great, right? Him walking straight while smelling the grass indicates that he became comfortably psychologically and relieved stress Grandma who only knew that dogs should be tied up feels something new while walking him PD : How do you feel about walking him? Nice, slowly! Grandma is sorry that she couldn't understand him so far She promises she'll do her best for him Expert : If he gets to experience a lot, he'll no longer harm himself The crew decided to help them more Baeksang is transferred to the hospital and gets his wound treated Vet : The skin damage is very severe to the point where we have to graft his skin from the back The results of testing to check if he has any infectious diseases are fine The damaged skin area is pretty large that it could lead to a severe problem If he wasn't sterilized or didn't take medicine it could've been worse than now but thanks to his grandpa's efforts, the things weren't getting worse Thanks to the grandpa a serious infection could be prevented Surgery began We could pull the skin from his back to treat the wound without grafting the skin it went so well that he'll have no problem recovering As grandpa visits him in a recovery room the dog stands up and goes near him Hope he heals mind as his body is healed Hope he's healthy Not getting sick anymore? / Yes While he's recovering Enlarge the space for him Wish he roams around the yard freely Forget about the pain in the past and live in a wider world
