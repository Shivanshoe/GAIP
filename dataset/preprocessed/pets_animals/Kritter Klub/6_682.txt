Jjajang, who was kind, and fond of people Came back with a sorry sight Jjajang's guardian : When my husband came to work at noon, he went, 'Can't see Jjajang around, can't find him' So I was looking for him all afternoon Jjajang, lost for seven hours (Where Jjajang lives) Was found from a factory (Where Jjajang was found) From miles away from where he lived The person who found Jjajang : It's was after 10, I guess? I came outside around that time and found him there He looked horrified at that time, made me absolutely speechless The trace of 'that day' Still lives on the very scene In what condition, is Jjajang into? Jjajang shrieking in pain Vet : This low jaw here has a hole in it Dr. Park, we should bring him for a CT scan right now. He's in such a bad shape atm Protruded eyes And wrecked jaw bones For only a one-year-old Jjajang, The pain he should endure is just unimaginable How are the test results Vet : As far as I see from the scan, from both nasal bone side and upper jaw bone, There were a few fracture-lines found Multiple fractures found on the face, as well as the dislocation of the lower jaw bone, zygomatic fracture, And lower jaw joint fracture are diagnosed, for now Simply put, His face is entirely collapsed Ah, this won't be easy First, to prevent any infection Decided to quickly carry out disinfection What's happened here? / Guess it came after the fracture Looking at the CT scan, they all looked connected somehow? Reckon it came out along with the dislocation Can you raise the anesthetics? Wounds are worse than everyone expected Should just extract the eyeball, coz it's all melted down, even the eye tissue What has happened to this tiny, little puppy.. Vet : While I was scanning CT, thought it'd be a car accident, but As I've seen the CT results, There were some man-made strikes acted upon him In the case of a car accident, it usually causes ruptures at the hip or stomach And causes traumatic wounds, yet Wounds are specifically concentrated on the head Intentional violence is speculated Shall Jjajang's pain stop?
