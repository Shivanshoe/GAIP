Gu-seul, you are really pretty hahahahahah Can dogs laugh too? Yes they can, they can even also roar with laughter But according to this video, the dog starts laughing when it receives a sign, so it's trained to laugh It's not an actual laugh Dogs laugh by making noises? This is the noise It's a cheerful noise than breathing sound According to an experiment, if we let a dog hear it Aggressive dogs stop fighting with other dogs and the dogs which are always nervous become calmer So experiment results show that laughing sound makes the dogs feel better These dogs always fight with each other Once they got into a very fierce fight and I couldn't stop them One of the dogs could have been killed so I don't let them stay together Would the laughing sound make them less aggressivge? Now they regain their inner peace I guess dogs will start laughing if we make them happy This is a sound of a dog laughing Make your pet(s) listen to this sound too :)
