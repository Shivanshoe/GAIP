Dog Geumsook who can't walk properly It's hard for Geumsook whenever she sees an obstacle But Geumsook never gives up What's happened to Geumsook? Ever since Geumsook was a puppy, her forelegs were stuck together The owner(woman) took care of Geumsook like her own baby She trained Geumsook so she can get up properly Geumsook started to use her hind legs and now she can walk with two legs! Owner: The vet told me she won't be able to live long But I'm glad that she's still alive Geumsook was able to walk, thanks to the owner But Geumsook is always home Owner: I don't like how people stare at Geumsook 
so I don't take her out for a walk.. It seems like Geumsook wants to go out since she's lingering around the front door So the owner brought her outside! As the woman puts her on the floor Geumsook is so brave going around all alone A soft floor for Geumsook Owner: I want you to be healthy forever
