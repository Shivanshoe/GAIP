(A bird wearing a sock?) (Tada!) It looks like a bird of prey I don't know for sure (Force-feeding?) (Looks like gummy worms) Ouch! (Puts the sock on again) If I cover its eyes, it calms down Can you fly? Let's try (hopping instead) It's the Korean buzzard (stay strong) There's a fracture in its arm If we don't conduct surgery, it won't be able to use its wings It must've hurt a lot Eat up, and get better I hope it's able to fly soon
