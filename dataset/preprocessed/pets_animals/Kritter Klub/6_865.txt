Omg! What are these~? Puppies which are only 5 days old However The color of the fur is weird! Completely green Green puppy "Nokdol" No matter how much the owner cleans it It's the first green dog in Korea! I'm 90 years old and I've been raising dogs since I was 19 years old but I've never seen a green dog in my life before Who's your daddy? The father is white Nokdol's aunt and grandma This is so interesting~ It's a mutation It looks like someone dyed its fur Owner: I didn't do anything to it Why is Nokdol green? Vet: I've never heard of a dog being born with green fur in Korea Fetus                                Placenta The placenta fell off so the amniotic fluid went into the mother dog's womb and made the puppy's fur green Vet: It's surprising how the puppy was born alive. Anyway, it's a very rare case Green dog "Hulk" in Brazil Green dog "Wasabi" in America The world's third green dog "Nokdol" It's so healthy Nokdol~ hope you grow up well
