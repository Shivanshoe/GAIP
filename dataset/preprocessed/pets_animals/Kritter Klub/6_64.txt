The world that I see is just this much Sweetheart~ A narrow gap about a handspan I am under a container box Baby, come out for a second and have food Only after everyone’s gone (Peeks) Peeks out her head She quickly bites a piece and hides under the container again A moment later No one’s here? She peeks back out again How long of a time has she spent time under the container? The messy, tangled fur allows us to guess those times Even in a slight noise (Dashes) she is startled tremendously TwT Town resident: She’s pitiful... so pitiful Town resident: Probably been abandoned, in my opinion What could be her story to lock herself away under the container that is so cramped and full of garbage A moment later < Let’s eat~ < Baby, let’s eat~ (Wary) As if they’re used to it, they change up the water and clean the surroundings Production crew: Do you change it like this all the time? Informant: Yes, every morning and evening Every day, twice a day, morning and evening they’ve been taking care of her for ‘two months’ Looking at her reminds me of the munchkins back at home and yeah. It overlaps The couple is raising 3 abandoned dogs Perhaps that’s why.. They can’t keep their eyes off this fella roaming around in pitiful condition < See you tomorrow~ < Baby, eat well and drink water, too~ Promising for tomorrow’s morning and says their farewell That night Still under the container she’s keeping her place but as if she’s uncomfortable, she tosses and turns.. But at that moment..! (Stealthily) Dark shadows gathering around the container Holding her breath hides deeper..! (Strides) To be continued in part 2 (released tonight!)
