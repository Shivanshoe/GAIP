Back then, We removed lumps from shark’s fins and made prosthetic eye for an eyeless crocodile A Kritter Klub Original series Animal Hospital for Tiny Animals The first patient at the Animal Hospital for Tiny Animals Whose white stripe is charming Name:  Asoon (Fat-tailed gecko) Guardian: Asson Eats well and has chubby tail so she seems healthy Choi Young Min, Vet: We’ll know if we take an X-ray Feels something in the stomach Asoon: There's something Inside meh.. In the stomach, there’s an egg Vet: Check out the size of the egg! Asoon: Please take that out.. Asoon’s symptom is egg binding PD: Does she need surgery? Choi Young Min, Vet: I think we need to open up the belly and take it out The egg is too big An unfertilized egg didn’t come out The reason, why even the guardian didn’t know of it, was because Choi Young Min, Vet: Reptiles, they don’t have any behavioral change (even when sick) So if we notices something a little late then sometimes that's already too late If the movement is a bit weird it’s important to have check fast Going to anaesthesize now Another concerning matter is Choi Young Min, Vet: We’re concerned about the condition inside the stomach, because If the egg breaks inside the stomach, there’s something inside We don’t know where the contents are right now, so I’m worried that it might have been attached to somewhere So we’re going to open up first If the egg broke It can become a serious problem (Asoon: Anesthesize meh) Surgery begins Asoon is tiny sized Hence, more careful hands (Sound of Asoon’s blood circulating) and the egg came out! It’s huge TwT By stitching up the incised part Surgery ends! Living with a humongous egg as big as her stomach must have been..
(Asoon’s weight, 40g) (Weight of the egg, 5g) Choi Young Min,Vet: Previously in the X-ray, it seemed as if the egg was broken The egg did break The contents inside the egg covered the egg again If it was broken into the stomach, it would have been dangerous with peritonitis Fortunately, it was covering the surroundings She was alive “You were destined to live, destined to live” Asoon, you look like you’re healthier than ever! Afterward What Asoon is eating now Cricket powder + medicine Asoon is doing well :)
