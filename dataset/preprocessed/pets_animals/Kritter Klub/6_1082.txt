A white dog's severely wary of a strange production crew to him But he can't barely move He can finally relieve by the owner's touch As my wish for him to get better soon, I named him 'Gijeok' (Which means a miracle in English) Gijeok, you understand your name? After he had an accident, His whole body's paralyzed Owner : He still has a surgical scar It's about a span long, his spine was broken Due to a spine fracture He can't move the lower part of his body at all He's able to stand on his front legs, But they're getting stiffened.. Why do you close your paws, it hurts Open it like this No matter how hard he tries to get him up His body's stiffened already When I try to open his paws, the muscles get rigid Still a little baby Gijeok.. What happened to him before? I'm working as a patrol in expressways Someone asked me to clean up a dead body The owner who's working as a patrol This spot Gijeok was found in the middle of the highway where vehicles run fast I guess I found him at this spot The dog was hit by cars everywhere and was rolling over everywhere It looked like a white teddy bear was rolling over the road after hit by running cars Gijeok was getting hit by a car when he was found When I moved him to the side road, He was dead Everyone didn't expect that he'd survive When I held his paws to move him away He couldn't close his eyes all the way Gijeok struggled to let people know that he's alive To save him, The mister send him to the stray dog shelter I went to see him on my day off About 3 to 4 days later Then I found bedsore on his back because nobody turned him over His skin was festered with flies flying over him So I adopted him and took him to the hospital The guardian regrets the choice he made back then Seeing him whose condition had gotten worse, He blamed himself for making a wrong decision His spine was broken like this Surgery to set a broken spine together Thanks to people who heard about Gijeok and volunteered to help As tough days have gone Gijeo could lead a new life You want some meal? Although Gijeok isn't able to eat on his own Good boy~ The owner's just grateful that he survived.. If he turns his head to the side, it means that he doesn't want to eat Now it's time to drink water From A to Z Gijeok is being nursed and cared which makes him look so comfortable But He starts barking Is something going on with him? Time to pee~ You wanted to pee :) Owner : You know the hose for urination in the hospital I heard that if you use the hose for urination the function of urinating slowly fades away It was hard at first But the owner takes good care of him without difficulties The owner's singing a lullaby for him I can see him changing day by day There was no fur at all, but now new fur grows I feel great when I see new fur coming in on different spots Small changes of Gijeok are a great hope for the owner There's a great supporter next to the owner Wife : He often couldn't sleep Sometimes he had to go to work after 2 or 3 hours of sleeping I had to feed him during his short spare time He'd been like that with red eyes and I felt bad for him But it's what he likes to do I have no choice but to help him Massaging for rehabilitation therapy Owner : The doctor said he won't be able to move due to stiffened muscles if he doesn't get a massage He can endure the massage on the right side He doesn't even try to pose for the massage on his left side The dog suffers a lot when the owner gives a massage on his left side of the body which's severely paralyzed It's heartbreaking to watch him in pain But he trusts that Gijeok will improve as must as he makes efforts So the owner can't skip a day for rehabilitation therapy At first, he just wanted to save him But now, he's determined to make him stand up on his own Beautiful weather on one fine day How's his condition? / He's good The reason why the owner's feeling good is.. Let's do it again~ He feels ticklish when I tickle him There's a change! He also flinches a bit as well Hope the mister's miraculous love brings another miracle <3
