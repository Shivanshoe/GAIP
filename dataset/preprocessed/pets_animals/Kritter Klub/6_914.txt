My name is Jjong Strolling as usual No That stone.. is smiling at me. When birds fly away, dogs usually chase after them When this fella sees a stone Going wild, moving forward..!! Dashing bruh Jjong, You know this stone? Quite a cool farewell for being clingy before Jumping Grinning Why are you coming out from there~ Leggo!! You were cool for sure.. (But this mouth wasn't cool tho) As if the stone is a tongue in her mouth.. Look at her so smooth Drink water and get back to your senses Go... I'm dead serious She gives zero ef when she has a stone even when there's water or anything The stone is only in her mind Hell yeah Let's see.. If food is out of her sight too Meal? Right here FAKE Only second to a stone hot pot Stone mixed rice on another level She has to protect the stone, but also wants to eat at the same time.. It's hard for me to know too hehe If you could know Jjong! Ah, gimme!! Wasn't polite Sigh.. Gimme LOL Okay.. Imma back off so you take care Door shut Bye!~ Perhaps Jjong is.. obsessed over a stone.. to draw attention from her guardian..? 3,4 ! Nice, we got the sad scene Jjong.. You do live well after I backed off..? Beep Nice to have him back.. But her hiding the stone first is on another level The stone comes first before her guardian Gimme! It's not a sound effect huh?? not here Can't believe you fall for this Not there~ Can a toy be a substitute? Nope Not funny Worst Where's my stone Enough is enough.
