This one's name is Navi Looks like he's calling someone But then Crying from the bushes is a cat 'Norang' Navi's giving her a signal to come down Upon hearing Navi's voice as if she's relieved Norang walks down to him But The cat drags her weak, hind legs Norang struggles to drag her hind legs to get closer to Navi How are they related? They always stay together Stay each other's side even when it rains Have no idea how they're related But Navi Protects Norang lives with a disability on the streets By her side Perhaps Norang might get anxious Navi stays alerted even more and embraces her tightly Just like one of the fairy tales The cats share the warmth It's amazing how Navi protects Norang Seems like he understands his sick friend That's why they can rely on to each other At the moment when they're about to sleep in peace An uninvited guest has come At the appearance of a strange cat, Navi holds Norang in his arms tightly After the strange cat gets away from them Navi follows the cat and give warnings to stay away from them Then he returns and sits next to Norang PD : Are they siblings? No they're not I'm sure because I used to feed Navi since she was young 6 months ago, the lady found Navi for the first time Navi was a kitten at that time But Norang wasn't with Navi She's a newbie Other cats would eat when I feed them But she runs away Her legs were fine But I found her legs were injured 3 weeks ago The lady found Norang was hurt Navi hid Norang at this spot while he was rained on at this bushes What happened to Norang? Is there anyone who knows about Norang? Resident : There're lots of cats always Cats severely fight to take food They try to take it first when food is given because they have to survive on the streets Lots of stray cats are living in this street they often fight to secure their own territory Norang, however, who came here recently can not help but fall behind the other cats Perhaps she was injured after a fight with cats If not, Maybe she was hit by a car while strolling around because it's dangerous as cars often pass by Food is everywhere because the apartments are nearby Cats usually take food here Perhaps she was hit by a car when she was crossing the road to find food Then Navi who was passing by might have found Navi who was hit by a car One thing for sure is that Navi takes care of sick Norang A heartwarming friendship of the two.. Honestly, they're better than humans It's hard to find someone who stays next to you when you're having a tough time People leave instead If Norang was alone without Navi She would've fallen behind in the competition It's fortunate that Navi is with her So proud of Navi After hearing their story The residents started helping the cats PD : Why are you leaving this umbrella? So the cats won't be rained as it's going to rain soon I got the medicine from the vet There're many good people in the village But still, Norang is very wary of people For Norang though, Navi always gives his food to her For Navi, Norang always comes first in everything He doesn't eat, but watching her eating Only after Norang's done eating Navi starts eating What if Navi wasn't there for Navi..? After Norang hides in the bushes Navi watches out for her After the night falls Navi goes near Norang Perhaps Norang's sick, she can't fall asleep Navi holds her tightly to comfort her Next day The lady came to visit them Oh my... Trashes are everywhere Looks like something happened last night What happened.. In their living place found traces of people passing by Navi~ Navi~ Navi and Norang went missing What happened to the cats? Stay tuned for part 2
