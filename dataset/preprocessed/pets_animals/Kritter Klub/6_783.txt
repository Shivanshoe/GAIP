In what seems like an ordinary house.. There's a squirrel?! But this isn't your ordinary squirrel either He can FLY "I believe I can fly" I live alone But it doesn't feel like that really.. I opened the cabinet And there were holes everywhere Bruh.. Did you not see this before you moved in? I have a stove, but I use this instead Can't use the kitchen because of the squirrel So we installed cameras Yawns Where did he go? Has his own little window There's another one? I believe I can fly22.. Whoa Landing on point Pardon? There's one more! Oh! There really is.. Three came out It's probably the mom, dad and child The squirrel passes out It looks like an artificial environment to us, but it's a natural environment to them Sigh. What am I going to do.. If you kick the squirrels out all of a sudden, they could die It's better to keep them here during the winter Around March (They ask you how you are, 
and you just have to say that you're fine 
when you're not really fine) They were here before me So I feel bad kicking them out But letting them stay is also..
