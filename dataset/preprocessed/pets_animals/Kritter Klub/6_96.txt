My name, who’s caught in the rain falling from the sky is.. "Farmed bear" Producer: One, two, three... thirteen, fourteen, fifteen... Among the 15 farmed bears One bear stands out Farm owner ‘Mr. Kim’: If it’s not healthy it won’t play this actively! It’s raining, the weather’s cool, so it’s happy Farm owner Mr. Kim claims it’s a behavior out of happiness but... Kwon Hyuk-Bum, Keeper at ‘C’ Land Zoo where rescued bears live: This isn’t a replay, but it’s continuous…  you’re just filming it, right? Producer: Yes. This bear keeps on doing that.. Oh.. A severe stereotyped behavior like this.. is my first time seeing it, including all the animals This is a bit… too serious.. Due to severe stress, it’s showing stereotyped behavior Other bear breeding farms of Mr. Kim was the same Producer: But, why are all the bears lying down? Mr. Kim: Oh~ because they’re full, they’re not interested when they’re full The most comfortable posture In my opinion, I think it’s either dehydration or malnutrition There didn't seem to have any water supply facility inside the elevated cage It’s not just about the water supply system but, Doesn't seem like It's equipped with the minimum environment for bears In the video received by the animal protection group [Footage provided by Korean Animal Welfare Association (KAWA)]
After they lose consciousness due to Mr. Kim’s tranquilizer gun I think it’s still alive.. Farm owner: Oh, it’s alive That’s why it’s bleeding since it’s still alive Local nearby: They’d kill a bear (in front of people) and take out the gallbladder of the bear and would Shabu-Shabu the bear meat..They eat all of it and leave Oh... this is... food...? Under the current law, using parts other than the gallbladder is illegal When did they start breeding the bears? 1985 Daehan News: Gallbladder, blood, leather, etc from bears are not only for domestic demand but are also for import substitution and is a wild animal that can be farmed Choi Hee-Kyung, CEO | Korean Animal Welfare Association (KAWA): It’s unfortunate, but in our society, there was a background where invigorating was prevalent For a period of time, the government encouraged and permitted bear breeding for farm income increase But as restrictions were imposed on the farmed bear industry
- Designated as international endangered species
- Import banned
- Seoul Olympics
- Joining CITES (export ban) the number of bear breeding decreased and now 379 farmed bears remain We found another bear breeding farm Producer: How many bears are here? In this farm? About 110 Producer: Isn’t it a bit difficult to raise them? Kim Gwang Soo, Director | Bear Farmers Association: It’s difficult, why wouldn’t it... It’s difficult, it’s expensive to manage them but also labor costs are high Farm owner claims that there’s an inevitable reason why it turns out like this Producer: There isn’t much demand these days? Nope, not at all. I’m not doing this because I want to, now If I make even a small profit and become a profitable business, then sure I can do that I can feed it well and have a good facility But it’s unprofitable, and you know there’s no demand for gallbladder either These... All of these... Slaughtering them for repurposing and... can’t just waste it I don’t want to do it either, even if I die wouldn’t want to The same goes for other farms In a reality where it’s overwhelming even to pay for food The farm owners are also frustrated Park Sang-Hee: Bear breeding farm owner
The government made us so we started the business.. Then if they want to prohibit us after breeding it, they need to provide appropriate actions and appropriate.. rules, but this isn’t it, It’s not a rule nor law.. The majority of the farm owners were in dilemma on how to wrap up bear breeding What do you think about the measure in which the government purchases the farmed bears?
-Agree 85.7%,Disagree 7.1%, No answer 7.1% Park Eun-Jeong | Green Korea activist: What they demanded the government was ‘The government should rescue all the bears and take responsibility in protecting them’.. But that didn’t turn out well.. Then, what is the government’s stance? Government: After joining the international agreement farmed bear breeding proliferated in the private autonomy So rather than the government purchasing the farmed bears, it’s the most ideal to end bear breeding through voluntary disposal of the farms and natural death The opposing stances, per farm owners and the government, the ones who are suffering were the farmed bears. Producer: Why feed on dirt... Choi Hee-Kyung, CEO | KAWA: Actually, deciding on the bear rescue isn’t quite easy Because bears are wild animals and also predatory animals They’ve already lived in an artificial environment so if they go back to nature, as soon as they go back they die. So a space created that guarantees a natural environment to a certain extent That would be the sanctuary Footage: Animals Asia
In many overseas countries After the bear is rescued, in an environment similar to nature.. and being able to live under people’s protection A sanctuary is being operated But the farmed bears in Korea.. Even after being rescued, they don't have a place to go and the reality is that they're managed at a farm Choi Taegyu, Vet | Project Moon Bear: We were a country that ate bears, reflecting on the past and the society officially taking responsibility... not the method where they die but being able to think about them again and reflect upon the past creating that kind of facility and protecting the bears. I think that’s the measure that shows how much our society has improved Instead of being called the Asiatic Black Bears poor lives are living being called as farmed bears It's sad that they couldn't even be considerate of their lives During the past 40 years.. What are the things we can do for the bears who couldn't come out to the world for even once...?
