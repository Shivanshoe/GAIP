Informant: You'll be surprised by what you see. The fur is like some sort of armor. Unknown what kind of creature it is. In a outlandish shape, the dog wanders around the town. The production crew discovered footsteps and decided to follow them. Production crew: Oh, the steps disappear from here. What is a creature roaming around at a temperature below freezing? The crew decided to ask around. Resident: One of his legs is cut off. One of his hind legs got caught in a trap so it's gone. Resident: His hind leg is injured, so he's limping around with three legs. Resident: Thankfully, he's not far from here. He's located near around here. Been around the town for many years. Couldn't leave the place, and stays around here... The creature stays far behind, not letting his guard down for even a minute. So they decided to leave food nearby and watch from afar. In a moment... When there is no indication of any presence nearby... The creature comes to eat dragging his injured leg... Still staying vigilant along the way... Covered with heavy fur all over his body How long had he been wandering alone...? However! Resident: Someone keeps feeding him at that house over there. A farm that takes care of him by feeding him... Producer: Hi, mister. Resident: Yes, what brings you here? Producer: We are Kritter Klub team. Have you been seeing a black ragged dog nearby here? - Resident: Oh, you mean Yong-Am?
- Producer: Did you say Yong-Am?
- Resident: Yes. He calls the creature Yong-Am... Resident: Hey, Yong-Am! Where are you! C'mere, I'll give you some meat! At hearing the man's voice... Yong-Am comes near... Resident: Come here! The dog wags his tail from seeing the man, but he doesn't think of coming near him unlike usual... Resident: I'll give you some meat. Come here! Even if the man calls him desperately, the dog ignores him. Yong-Am moves near the accommodation area near the farm. What kind of story does he have to tell? Resident: He's the dog that a grandpa who lives below here used to raise, but he passed away a while ago. - Producer: Did the grandpa come here often?
- Resident: Yes, he did. Inside the container near the farm The dog used to live with his grandpa... Takes a peek inside... (The food bowl that Yong-Am used to use) Traces of belongings of when Yong-Am used to live with his grandpa remains intact... For a grandpa who lived alone in the mountains, Yong-Am was the only family When they were living depending on one another, one day... Grandpa passed away suddenly. Without knowing anything, Yong-Am was left alone... 'Cause he doesn't know of his grandpa's death, he remains at the place where he used to be with his grandpa waiting for nearly 4 years already... Resident: Yong-Am, eat up! 'Cause he knows that Yong-Am has been waiting for all those years more than anyone else, he has been taking care of him by feeding him well. (Long time has passed) (After checking that everyone has left, he starts eating then...) (Limping badly...) Gobbles all the food... (Limping badly again...) With a poor, injured body he has been searching for any traces of his grandpa. Any more waiting will leave wounds to his feelings and his body more... Resident: Yong-Am! (Come here!) Resident: He senses people's presence and won't come near. It's such a pity looking at him... Resident: I feel so pitiful for him... Although the mand lends his hand, Yong-Am ignores him and turns away...for that the man feels such pity. The rescue team arrives to help the dog. Rescue team: One leg was stuck and was lost from a snare, so... Rescue team: We will try to lure him to this site (where the farm dormitory is) and catch him there at once. Because he is a dog who is very vigilant... It's only best to catch him at the site (farm dormitory) where he usually appears. After blocking the escape route, he is expected to be rescued safely! In a moment... Production crew: He's here, here! Yong-Am shows up Rescue team: He's heading in! Rescue team: He got in, in! Rescue: Got it, got it! Close it (the door)!! Blocks the doorway Production crew: This way, this way! Rescue team: Oh, he's there! Production crew: Here, here, here! (Whimpering) Rescuing the first attempt, FAILED. Production crew: Beneath the stairs! Down!! Thankfully... He's rescued safely... (Whimpering) Tried to calm the dog down as he seems very surprised... (Yong-Am has calmed down...) Yong-Am, let's go to the hospital now Production crew: Mister, you must be feeling upset... Man: With that one leg, it's hard to imagine all the difficulties he's been through... Long four years of living in the wild We're worried about Yong-Am's health.... Layers upon layers of matted fur... Health being examined Vet: Examined each organ and also tested the level of inflammatory anemia. Vet: Both came out fine. Vet: However, in the case of heartworm, both microfilariae of dirofilaria immitis and kit tests came out positive. The dog is infected with heartworm... Vet: For the case of our Yong-Am, he doesn't show any other special symptoms. Vet: So, it is not a condition that cannot be treated with stage 1 nor stage 2. Fortunately, he can be treated! And after 4 years of waiting, decided to send all those fur away! After three hours of grooming, Yong-Am reborn is still so cute! Mister waits for Yong-Am. - Vet: What do you think? He's so pretty, right?
- Resident: Wow, so pretty! - Vet: It's your first time holding him, huh?
- Resident: Yes. "Dear Yong-Am..." "Your grandpa who is in heaven" "Will wish that your happy more than anyone else does" (Kisses) "Yong-Am, let's only be happy from here onwards!"
