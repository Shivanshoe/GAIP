The traditional market full of lively vibes Customer1 : How can it just stay still like that? Customer2 : Usually it should run away, not just staying like that! All eyes on her! Yep, here I am :) Yes, I'm taking a stroll lol Yippun, female(hen)

Sorry Yippun, this persimmon will cheer you up Nom Nom Yippun living together with 300 chicken fam Yippun Yippun~ Waddup Aww our Yippun came Even when eating Yippun Run chicken run Lane change Yippun She just looks like a dog, not a chicken lol Yippun knows her name She's also the only chicken who has the name Lunch time Phooood Look at my desirable eyes dude (Kimchi stew) I gon' get it Dayum.. It tastes okuurrrRR It feels so great Cuz she barely ate when she was a chick So I'd like to feed her any food if she eats well They care for Yippun like a child but actually.. Since Yippun was born weak, she didn't get along well with other chickens Eventually, Yippun's parents even refused to take care of her So this couple has taken good care of Yippun so far Awww, eating well But the happy moment of regaining health didn't last long.. She suffered from aftereffects and her mouth got crooked like this The crooked mouth I'm okay cuz I'm super healthy :) Next day Yippun disappeared?! Found her! Put yo camera away jeez Looks like she's in pain tho..? What's happening? *groans* Yippun laid eggs Isn't it pretty?
