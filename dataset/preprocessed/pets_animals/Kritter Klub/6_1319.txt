Gotta focus +_+ and hear +_+ It is dangerous! After checking the kettle's boiling Mom!!! The water's boiling! Turn it off right now!! Oh~ Good girl Smart Lucky~ Owner : I compliment her so she does it again What genius dogs have in common is that they receive tremendous compliments from their owners <3 PD : How long have you been raising Lucky? Owner : What? Please put that camera down Because I can't see your lips move I have to see your lips moving to understand what you're saying Lucky's owner has a hearing impairment Can't hear, but Lucky hears on behalf of her owner To heat the cold porridge Mom puts it in the microwave for 2 minute Stay focused. Timing is now..! Mom! It's done! Eat before it gets cold!! Hehe, I got your back, mommy Owner : She was an abandoned dog who could hear well so she was trained.. Lucky was abandoned But people recognized her extraordinary hearing ability And Lucky started a new life It's the coolest job For the coolest owner Once outside, Full of confidence But the problem is.. Lemme on~~ Dogs are not allowed to ride the bus PD : The bus driver doesn't let the dog on? Owner : Even if I tell them that she's my service dog They only see her as a dog Even with a service dog ID Riding a bus isn't easy ;( Lucky has often been refused to be on board But it hurts every time when she's rejected.. After the struggle Lucky came to see grandma~ I believe I can fly~ To grandma as well Lucky is so precious My daughter used to be depressed all the time, and was lack of confidence But now that Lucky is by her side She became brighter Daughter was pronounced deaf at 4 years old Due to her disability She shut her mind to everyone Lucky helped my daughter to hear So grateful Lucky, we're so lucky to have found you Happy to be lucky I want to hear what Lucky sounds like hehehe Smart Lucky, stay blessed with mommy~<3
