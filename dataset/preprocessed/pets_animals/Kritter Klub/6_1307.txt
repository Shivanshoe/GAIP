I demand you to open youself Meowgic Hola mi amigos What, what's the fuss Starting from 10 days ago Why are you keep coming in Because I want to +_+ Restaurant owner: It's scary how the cat keeps following me and chases after me.. I like you Let me in Just accept me and RAISE ME You are a purfect butler Is she a stray cat? Yes, she is.. I'm special, you know I'm different!!!! Trust me I'm special After attacking the lady With no apology Takes a seat in the restaurant Somehow looks relieved.. What am I doing at this age Get out Nahhh How dare you kick me out! This is why I don't let her in I chose you tho I'm not shameless Shameless cats usually Act cute Or Use pity as their weapon Pity meow.. But this kitty.. Why are you sitting on the table? Come down Come down! *simply ignore* Wat da hecc are you talking about When pushed OK. Imma lie down like this then.. You said I shouldn't sit on here. So Imma lie down instead Smarty kitty, right? Geez, stahp Tbh.. The lady finds it cute too lol I dunno Just live there then Perseverance ftw But why does Bbunsson like this place? Is she.. pregnant? I never thought that she'd be pregnant If she's here because of that I must've come across cold-hearted? Sorry~ I'm fine Who's this smelly monster Vet, jeez Let's check your belly~ Vet : She's not pregnant.. Hehe. I'm single now Vet : She gave birth within a week to 10 days She must've had stillbirth or had a normal delivery, but shortly after She must've lost her kittens.. After losing her kittens in a short period She would suffer from extreme anxiety And need someone to lean on After losing her kittens Met the lady by chance The cat recognized her kindmess.. "I know you're a good hooman" The guest cat gets the best treatments only for VIP In the storage room I chose a good butler I'm not going to kick her out again because she came to me for help I'll take care of her Live happily with your nice, new butler~
