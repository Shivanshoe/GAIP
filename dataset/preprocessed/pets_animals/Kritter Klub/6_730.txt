At the end of a market alley, A dog who's been waiting for five years, 'Daroo' Market vendor: He's probably waiting for her owner out of lingering attachment Thinking that his owner shall come back one day At the edge of that alley, This is my homegrrr There's Daroo's house However Daroo is the only one who lives here Emptied food bowl.. In this place where there are no signs of living Daroo's been living there over the five years Market vendor: He's yet to know his grandma's gone, but she knows this is her home That's probs why he sticks around her home For Daroo, They've thought of an adoption Nope, never! Daroo, not wanting to leave the alley Daroo, let's go over there Let's go for a work out by the brook This is ma home I'm not goin' anywhere Phew, it always breaks my heart, what to do He seems he's never going anywhere At last, Daroo's unleashed And has gone deeper inside the alley For Daroo, this place is The last place where he spent time with his grandma What really happened To Daroo and his grandma Grandma's relative: Aw, grandma really loved Daroo But as soon as she passed away, her daughter Left out of the country, not staying at home She tried to bring Daroo who was left alone Grandma's relative: He was brought here several times, but he never let anyone get hold of him Whenever he comes up to the stairs, he runs Several times, as if he might be leashed "She'll be back one day" For over the five years, Daroo couldn't lift the weight of time and tide How about his condition? Vet: As I see it, he has heartworms that are spread through the bite of a mosquito I think he's infected with that disease Daroo needs to be treated Fortunately,
he'll get better if treated But the problem is the market that will be redeveloped soon If it's a rather stable neighbourhood, there wouldn't be much problem But if it's redeveloped, he'd have nowhere to be Where shall Daroo go, Living within the memories of the old-time? To be continued in part 2
