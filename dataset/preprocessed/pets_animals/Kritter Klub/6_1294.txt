In the pouring rain Getting wet from head to toe Waiting for the owner If not today Then maybe tomorrow It's sad how the dog keeps waiting for the owner And follows cars Turns around if it's not the owner Comes out upon hearing a car Chases after it Today as well The owner hasn't returned Is the dog abandoned...? He came to this neighbourhood with two dogs at first A grandpa without a family 5 dogs watched over him The owner passed away around 50 days ago Still haven't Opened their heart to anyone At any presence They run and hide The problem is that One of them lost the life behind the truck Poor surroundings within the mountains For dogs to live in Although the neighbors Look after them Many times, I thought to take them with me But they're too wary to leave Since the owner Can't come back It's time to end Their endless waiting The rescue team arrived As soon as the hungry dogs see the meal Letting their guard down They just enter the trap Prolly shocked but.. They don't let go of the food even when trapped For them To not go hungry anymore Successfully rescues the four dogs!! Is there anything wrong with their health? Vet : To put it simply, 'thelazia callipaeda' Is an eyeworm If left untreated, it could lead to inflammation of the eye or cornea, or a corneal ulcer They need to be treated in the meantime For the dogs A neighbor let them use his yard Neighbor : I'll take care of them Until they find a good owner Although the dogs will still miss the old owner Hope they hold hands With a new love soon
