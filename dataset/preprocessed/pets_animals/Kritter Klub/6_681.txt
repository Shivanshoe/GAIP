I suspect that there were intentional strikes acted upon him And I genuinely don't want to believe that a 'human being' had done it "I'm Jjajang" "Whose face's wrecked" "By brutal violence" As no one wishes to believe To bring back a beautiful grin on Jjajang's face Which is no longer there 'Vet'erans stepped forward The surgery begins at last As much as it's not an easy surgery, Can feel the tension in the air You should pull it this way, right Vet : Checked closely to the condition of his jaw as I began the surgery, And the tissues are too closely stuck, in which he can't physically close his mouth The first goal, that is to close his mouth Doesn't seem easy at all.. Vet : We tried in every way, but it surely isn't easy So an idea of a breakthrough just popped into my mind Shall we inject 3CC, each? Press here one at a time, 1CC? Syringe for 1CC!! You want 1CC? You want 1CC? / Two of them Vet : Applying the principle of levers to put back the jaw joint was our last shot, one and only Done it! Finally, the mouth is shut And done extracting the eye protruded by an impact as well Three hours long surgery has now come to an end Did a great job, Jjajang Only a year old since his birth The pain this little puppy has endured, Is leaving us all dumbstruck Vet : The surgeries we planned so far, are done at the moment The only thing left is to shut his mouth and fix it for about a fortnight to a month And to allow him opening his mouth just a little, So that he can slowly demonstrate the normal routine Moreover, The guardians who've been taking care of Jjajang Paid a visit Jjajang, you recongize my voice? My goodness lord.. Jjajang recognizes the guardian The guardians feeling sorry for Jjajang's misfortune Sir, thank you deeply Sure, you must be worried, but he's doing well. He has a strong will to live and win this game Please, keep a close eye on him Sure thing, We're doing our best Wish your dream is as peaceful as heaven
