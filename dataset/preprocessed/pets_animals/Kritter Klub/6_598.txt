Only when wearing this, we can see One doggo,  two doggos two white dogs And None That's a deserted island. It's pretty far from here to the island. How did they get there? It's hard to explain and just unbelievable.. Hard to believe the scene with two doggos in the desert island People usually don't know about that They just know the island exists Phew, who else can live there We can't even get into the island No one lives in and people don't even know about the island's existence.. How the dogs have been found on this island More suspicious though It's understandable if they went that frozen way since the ocean water freezes in winter But last winter, it wasn't frozen because the weather was nice This winter, the river wasn't frozen The one last possibility has been proved wrong.. (Green algae latte) Worrying that they don't have much food and water are that we're overly concerned with them? Lovey Dovey Com-fy You guys look pretty happy, huh..? Ecology Expert : Many people think that 'dogs have been eating and living well there for more than 1 year, so it's good for them' They might deal with the food problem by themselves (in this place), but (if it continues,) it's not that easy to keep healthy and they can be easily exposed to the disease. So, it's better to block such a risk from them Get equipped with heavy devices and let's go to rescue them Running away! (Cuz strangers arrive) (Escape) The half-baked attempt might be able to raise their guard! To figure out their route we installed cameras at several places and decided to watch them more! However.. Nom Nom Someone seems to put a meal bowl..? Moreover, ????? There're some traces of human habitation?!
