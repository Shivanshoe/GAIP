Owner : When I first found Donsoon, it was a piglet It was left all alone without it's mother I had no choice but to bring him home because I didn't want it to starve to death The man also has a dog, Gomdol Donsoon and Gomdol are besties They are walking together If Donsoon went ahead Walks backward and waits for Gomdol They are always together They look similar from behind! They even take a nap together~ All of the sudden Donsoon just disappeared Gomdol is waiting anxiously So happy to see him again Where were you? Didn't you miss me? Kinda looks like a bad bunch Is the owner chasing after them? They caused troubles LOL Both are being taken Come here Donsoon! IT's enough to catch Gomdol Come here Donsoon!!
