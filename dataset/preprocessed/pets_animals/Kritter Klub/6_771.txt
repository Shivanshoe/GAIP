The shower mysteriously turns on every night There's only the two of us and our three dogs Who's responsible? The prime suspect Bathroom mania, Woongee I like it here Woongee goes into the bathroom occasionally But it hates water or taking the shower I hate it here Time to see what really goes down Is that who I think it is..? Producer: Isn't that Woongee? Owner: Yes, it's Woongee In the middle of the night.. Hops into the shower Turns on the faucet?! I thought you hated water.. How can it turn on the faucet like that? Woongee actually enjoys the shower It was you all along What are you guys doing here? Runs away Why does it do that? Woonhee is our first dog And then we brought the other dogs Vet: It used to have the whole place to itself Ever since the other dogs came in, Woongee needed its own space But why the shower? Sound engineer: The sound is like that of a waterfall It puts the mind at ease.. Thus, a special trip for Woongee I love it here<3 Fresh water, there ain't nothing better
