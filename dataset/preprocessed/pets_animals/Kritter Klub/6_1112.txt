Bongshik was born with astasia It can barely walk with a wheelchair Can't spend time with its mother more often So it's spending an ardent time with its mother now Owner: It's good if they spend time together in there But if Bongshik doesn't move its legs, it will just get hardened That's why Bongshik needs to exercise regularly After a brief encounter It's time to say goodbye Vet: Its legs are bent inside so they've became brooked.. But as long as the calf stands up properly, there's no problem. Vet: There's a high possibility that the calf can walk again. An injection for rehabilitation And the wheelchair Bongshik is working out again The owner's devotion is also a motivator! You worked hard I don't care even if I get tired.. It must be harder for you.. You're enduring the pain. You need to have a good life! Cute little thing.. Bongshik fell into deep sleep and is snoring A few months later Crew: Where is the calf? Why is there only a wheelchair? Owner: We don't need this wheelchair anymore. Is that Bongshik standing on its own? Yes, it's me! It can even walk around...! Meets with its mother again Owner: It can walk now.. We tried so hard.. I'm not worried about anything now.. I'm pretty satisfied Always be healthy Bongshik~
