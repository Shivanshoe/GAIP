Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: It was by far the most difficult rescue I have ever done Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: I was thinking “Should I keep on doing this?” It is really difficult to go in between the pipes GIVE UP?! OR NOT! Don’t call us haha Chimney Cat Rescue Project Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: A cat was stuck in the chimney that is 5M deep cat who’s fallen Luckily, the cat can move Goo Cheol-Min | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: “It’s best to use a ladder or stairs” Bringing in ajdustable cat tower Can the cat climb up? Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: The cat is not moving at all Loud and clear! We waited… I gave the cat almost two days and the cat never tried climbing up so I figured the ladder cannot be useful in rescuing this fella ladder removed When I looked at the ladder, there was no sign of pawprints or food eating on the ladder Goo Cheol-Min | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: The cat did not try at all If the cat cannot rescue himself The only way is to ‘open it wide’ The company that manages the apartment (Seoul Housing & Communities Corporation) tried to cooperate with us as much as possible in opening up the chimney to rescue the cat The problem was… The.. difficulty was .. Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: The chimney was built with bricks so if we cut the wrong bit the whole chimney could have collapsed Goo Cheol-Min | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: The safest way was to break “the upper part” where they have the least pressure so we had to expand the hole on the upper chimney even though it’s far from the cat Operation begins Carefully We are coming to you~ After an hour-long operation It’s still tight but it seems possible to get inside (Expanded) Production crew: Hang on a little more, little kitty Production crew: Going down (Come quick) (Exhausted) Specially-made D.I.Y hanging ladder Putting on safety gears Going in~ Finally entered Seeing from inside, inside the chimney is narrower than expected Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: I will rescue the cat and come back safely He seemed to be going down smoothly… (Rattle) There are pipes in the middle, it’s making things difficult It is really hard to pass through between the pipes 2M from the bottom there are 2 pipes standing up Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: I had to go down 2 more meters Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: It was difficult to go lower because I’d get caught by the pipes in between them There no other options than to go down grabbing onto pipes Arrived at the bottom! Lift up the ladder a bit Making up the space that was taken up by the ladder How’s the cat reacting? / It’s curled up in the same spot The cat is not moving;; Besides, the rescuer is also stuck I was stuck tight Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: Bending over the torso or anything like that, I couldn't even think of doing that. Barely, using his foot inducing him to move (Jumps up) At that moment! The cat hangs on to the rescuer’s body! I GOT THE CAT! Let’s go out, yes, yes, good job Alright, step on me, good one You’re doing great. Get in the bag. Goes in~ WE. GOT. HIM! Success AMA~~~~ZING! The cat's finally out after nearly a month or so Woah~ let’s see your face Production crew: You can’t see his face now Let’s see at the hospital ;) What’s left~ is the rescuer to escape (Troubled) Tears TwT Wow… Look how dusty he is I don’t want to show myself like this anywhere or in front of anyone I wouldn't want to show myself to anyone Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: but I believe that was the look that I won’t be ashamed of anywhere I go Kim Yong-Hwan | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: “Someone had to sacrifice this much to save one life” This is how I see it. Let’s have a close look~ Tada! A cat with beautiful emerald-colored eyes Han Jae-Woong, Vet: Are you sure this is a white cat? / Yes Han Jae-Woong, Vet: The cat’s feet are too black to see it that way… Squid-ink beans She is dirty, how is her health? Han Jae-Woong, Vet: Fortunately, after she fell, she didn’t have any fractures or Han Jae-Woong, Vet: lethal injuries in her internal organs, so that’s her first luck Usually, when a cat didn’t eat for about 10 days that could lead to various side effects or have developed complications that kills that is not the case here too Only ‘dehydration’ and then an imbalance of nutrition Han Jae-Woong, Vet: caused by lack of consumption. Apart from that there are no injuries on the internal organs Then… Why didn’t she climb up on herself? Han Jae-Woong, Vet: When she fell due to an accident Han Jae-Woong, Vet: (when the accident happened) she must have tried hard to escape Han Jae-Woong, Vet: seeing that her nails are all broken Han Jae-Woong, Vet: she must have tried to escape with all her life Han Jae-Woong, Vet: Probably she felt all those endeavors are not being fruitful and thought “I cannot get out” When cats are out of physical and mental power Han Jae-Woong, Vet: even though cats think “I could climb up on this” Han Jae-Woong, Vet: often they fail to do so In short, she was having a mental crisis Let’s get you cleaned up and forget all~ Han Jae-Woong, Vet: All these fumes are not good for her health Han Jae-Woong, Vet: so the fumes had to be cleaned Squid ink Production crew: Oh~ her toe-beans are pink! Before shower           After shower Kitty~ you did well Goo Cheol-Min | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: This rescue was really difficult Goo Cheol-Min | Animal Rescue Org ‘RE:BIRTH’: and the process was really odd. Anyways, it’s a mystery what’s clear is! No cats will be falling into the chimney again Get well soon~ Let’s meet when you’re healthy!
