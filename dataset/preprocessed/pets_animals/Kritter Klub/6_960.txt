"Please help our Nabi" Nabi Do you hear me? If you do, meow back, Answer me, please So let's break this up I have no clue how she went in there What a poor kitty It must be dark and suffocating Do you see anything? No, It's too deep that I can't see Deep down the chimney that it seems to run down endlessly Nabi's inside here..? It's been 3 weeks 3 weeks? / Yes I haven't heard Nabi crying (for 3 weeks) But What's fortunate is Oh my! She ate I placed a meal here once, and she ate it all Without giving up Nabi's been survived The madame as well can't give up on hope.. Where Nabi is It's 12 meters as high as a four-story building Caretully, put the camera After it goes down endlessly found two beaming eyes That's our Nabi! Black ash is all over her body Hissing Being wary of people but looks exhausted at the same time Where is it connected to? Down below the basement room Here, here! The entrance of the chimney on the ground is blocked by the wall Since we don't know what's in here it's hard to break the wall For her safety, tear down the chimney cannot be an option.. Nabi occasionally played well on the rooftop But she was gone one day.. The stray cat Nabi who has been fed by the madame After much thoughts, out of anxiety I put a bag with food inside in here (Chimney) Then I put it up again and found it was empty For Nabi What all they can do is give her strength to survive by providing her food and water Perhaps Nabi's read their mind.. Oh my, she's coming to eat Oh, she's trying to live.. Oh my, she's eating! She's eating well Next day Nabi~ Not answering Nabi, get up, why don't you move She's not moving at all I know right.. Nabi doesn't move at all..! Will Nabi be able to be rescued from a dark tunnel?
