done on what's it 2-1 I guess we laughing okay folks welcome to one of you I'm guessing that we are live now okay say welcome back to Mala Mala for those of you that were with us this morning we found Pete and Bruce found the piccadilly female leopard is in screen now and she had two kills in a tree behind us the one was a water back cough very young whooping cough and the other was an Impala and we Saturday and the way she she rented and hold the one carcass out of the tree and took it into this Bush that we sitting next to now she's been hiding for a while we came back here earlier this afternoon she wasn't here and upon our return she's not lying in the shade so we guessing are we hoping that as it gets cooler she might return to the tree and feed off of the second carcass that still hanging in the tree and I will introduce you we dragged Mike Hickman out of the office you didn't join us this morning pizzas now and actually peaches not babysitting so Mike is with us in the comments today and then we've got yaku driving us and in myself Gareth and I will introduce you in a little bit you just want to see if there are any comments coming to you Mike that missed the morning but hopefully opinionated giraffe go Andres so I'll consider on lots of familiar man's popping up here and if you have a look she's quite a little or he went alive she was actually lying flat art and then some what was alarm calling it the guinea fowls are making a bit of a noise and she stuck her head up and she's been listening intently ever since first prize would be if some other predators came to investigate could maybe smell these carcasses and we'd certainly get some interaction in lots of people lots and lots of people joining the chat so for those of you just catching up this is the Piccadilly female leopard you just hear and Mala Mala Game Reserve and we are exactly in front of the Mala Mala man camp so yeah if you gonna look on Google Maps you find out precisely where we are just look up Mala Mala main camp and you'll see we just across the river from there and then this is the sister of the savoia female that some of you are probably a bit more familiar with but and i say system in the litter mates or not older younger sister they actually grew up together and we recognize her because she's got a 3-3 spot pattern and her sister this is a boy a female a two two spot pattern and welcome back to starlings Dylan Morgan yes it is the same lifted from this morning she's got kind of almost behind us behind the camera anyway is water back cough kill that she had there and the impala kill she had I think it's in that thicket next to her there some they're Delaware's in the bull day so the time here is a quarter to $5 Morgan is that Mike yes you finally came and joined us today hello Julia attorney patron Marty postman again welcome back so miss cinoman is asking have we seen a new Cubs yet so that's a no we actually just had a little tour around the area where we suspect she has the Cubs we saw it tracks coming and going from the manual a'ti River but the tracks were coming and going from the manual lazy river so we're just having a look around but no Sun yet and read a asking can lipids have the same identifying spots yes we have quite a few lipids let's have three three spot patterns and and then we gotta use different techniques to help us identify them this particular leopard the Piccadilly female is a very dark lipid you can see from the back of her neck and her back and all the females yes she's probably one of the darkest ones it's very golden in here you'll see it nicely especially look at those back legs their spots are quite denser doing it yeah angry with is any territorial mal around so not really it used to be the same of Senegal Bush mal in this area but at the moment there is a chance we could see one of the sons of them's or any female turning up which are her nephews there are any male lipids that we ready seeing really in this area and in another way that helps us identify these lipids 'as the areas that we work in they are very territorial so we have a good idea of which lipids we may find just based on the area that we are working thank you you're getting lots of compliments on the phone so folks there's a few just to carry on without gas was saying about the spot patterns you go and Mala Mala x' ranges and oscillation series you'll see when we talk about certain lipids we actually included a little chart that you can maybe pause it and have a closer look at how all these lipids we identify them and how they relate to one another I think the most appropriate video there's the mistaken identity one where we do make a bit of a blunder because even though we all know the spot patterns we didn't actually check they're just going wow what we thought Tony Johnson asking are we in a safari van we as a streaming from inside a camp no we are just across the river from Kent and we are in a Land Rover and open game viewer and then Christine Prescott asking the aged and so the Sabrina female and the piccadilly female were born in late the same between a 13 so they're just over six years old now Robin Robin Sewell joining us again so Robin is our - Tom we are we champion but today it's not very fair because to answer another question about where we are in the reserves so we actually exactly opposite Mala Mala main camp so we in the I want to say the northern half of the reserve and on the western side of it Chris Lockett wants to know Gareth how long do the hardcore usually well I think that depends on the individual lipid you get some lipids that are and very relaxed around our vehicles you know you know they tolerate our prisons like this one and you know she doesn't really hide from the vehicles I think this morning she just took the kill into a shady spot and we in turn fit on its day and but in other cases we have some lipids that you know we believe would have come from Kruger National Park because they don't have too many vehicles around them they that are very nervous of the vehicles and they don't like to share themselves whatsoever so just to get a glimpse of a few spots of them can be quite rewarding and that's for the most part and you know there's very few areas in the world we can be leopards this relaxed for the most parts you are going to just glimpse of these spots or rows it's rather more accurately did the leopard notice you so Jung sure she certainly is aware of us she just doesn't care about us so this lipid she grew up on Mala Mala when I first started here 2002 I used to view her grandmother great-grandmother I think and so we've been viewing this family of lipids for generations now the first time I saw her she's a little bit smaller than her head is now her nieces to the subway a female just not far from here in fact about two kilometers away so and I think it was Pete that actually found them he was chatting to you this morning if I remember correctly he found the dance at first but yeah so she's growing up with us around we just a normal part of her day Misenum Andres waiting to see the maxims male laugh-out-loud we are so laughing out loud yet smallest of any male lipid - yeah we're a little bit too far of his normal range Tyler fun yeah asking do we have interfere with him if they are being attacked or killed or injured and so no we partly that's because we just here to view we don't interfere with animals we don't feed them or disturb them any more than necessary but also it's just say she was having a fight with lions they found her and we're trying to steal her kill there's no way physically even if we wanted to intervene there's no way we could actually do that without probably causing things to get worse and almost certainly being killed ourselves in the process well done Cooper let's trade wrong yep max take it over the camera wick I'll just see where she goes to for not so effect so she's walking kind of into the Sun here hopefully it won't be too bad so yeah Cruz just going to reverse and get us into a position if she does so there's a few people asking so she's just having a look at and around it's gonna zoom out a little so you can see where we are that there is the Mala Mala main camp she's actually just opposite the main part of the camp in the swimming pool so you need to be an owl to follow the slip it all the way around all right so you Gareth and I are gonna trade back Christine Prescott quickly asking how all the cabs are we don't know Christine but probably two ish weeks I've lost it they into the reeds okay thanks she's walking through the reeds she might be walking down to the river for a drink of water I'm gonna try and zoom in on here it is quite difficult to keep track of his especially with this friend and she might come out into the Cure now yeah there she is okay so we might have tea she crosses the river might have to just call Pete yeah tell him to keep an eye on here so he's walking directly towards camp imagine she's gonna have a drink and maybe come back so if actually just trying to keep an eye on their lipids of taken my eye off of the comments yeah but just to back through some of the comments there's the noise of the cars disturbed in digital tennis shoes so no it doesn't can see she's actually walking right towards main camp as well she lives around anyway so she's seen plenty of vehicles and that we not an issue in her life and she grew up with us around so we're not a problem at all for her and then thank you so much Tony Johnson it's our privilege to be able to show you this animal as well and new yadi asking pium the camera so yeah we are filming on a highway sulfa it's not quite a camera so the day is noisy other than what we can if you got zooms and too much he's just gonna see pixels right right now I've actually lost visual of the lipid altogether so I'm gonna keep it on a wide angle she's walked into the Reed center of frame and I'm guessing that she's gone down to the river to have a drink of water so we're not gonna go anywhere from now she'll most likely come back we're hoping that she comes back and it might take a few minutes might take longer but I think until then we'll just keep on talking for nine I'll just keep it zoomed out a little bit maybe she does walk in into frame and one of you guys gets budget from home as we suspected somewhere in the manulito River so not anyway super close I want to say maybe a kilometer or two away and then yeah I think I did answer some of your Forex questions about me why did she leave the kill so I think she's just gone to have a drink like us if you've had a big meal especially lots of meat protein really and it has been a pretty hot day so she's just thirsty I think as soon as she's done drinking she'll come back and tell me a asking what are your favorite big cats so mine is 100% the Lions are a lot easier to see in this type of situation and leopard which are just magnificent at being camouflage normally with the Lions there more of them so they're just easier to find in the first place and lines are very rock and roll where when they're not sleeping here leopards are more your pop stars look very pretty action a big two different lines can be rock and roll maybe no point won't be seen to the time but lipids definitely grab my attention more how about you yeah it should you see to the driver puts their lipid so lipid one lion one Mike Mike Hickman millennial generation I'm not a puppy I mean I'm not a millennial or a pop star for that matter do you like lipids sure asus asking is strange with two kills not seeing hyena so that is a little strange I'm sure though you know I'll turn her I think she caught it a little bit later on in the day and that's all so we going into winter so the mornings are pretty cold at the moment so that kill was kind of refrigerated if you will so they haven't been smelling too much but we're we on the riverbank I've got no doubt that another predator whether it's hyenas other leopards raps lions turn up pictures also while she doesn't sleep right where they kill is because anything following its nose to their kill was gonna come across her she was right next to it so they normally put it up the tree or something and will stash it away and then go and lie about 20 30 feet away so that that I get ambushed and caught by surprise if they're nothing Jays McGary does she have cubs so we think so we just don't know where the den is but if she does have Cubs there about two weeks or so old so we won't even try to look for them until they're about six weeks so check back with us in a month and I'm just gonna show you a little bit on early saying the cat is in this thing you can keep your alliance that cat is known as meow meow my cat at home and Johannesburg I'm sure he's loving hearing my voice so the TV Mike did you name him okay so FX I just wanna give you an idea of what it looks like yeah and maybe just tell you a little bit about this area because those of you that have been watching the live streams may have noticed that a lot of our live streams are right in front of camp and that is because the area I'm pointing to none are we looking into the sunlight but there is the confluence of two other rivers that join the Sand River Center of screen there we're currently looking at the Sand River and those two other rivers are them law law RT river and the Mannie literally and they both join at the same points just in front of Campea and a lot of these animals like using those rivers to walk down to get to the Sand River where there's water flowing almost all year round and generally it's a high-traffic area so the game being right in front of camp is quite intense that area there is known as bicycle crossing and if I were to say pick one spot on the property and say this is the spot that most animals walk by or most sightings occur at I would put my money on bicycle crossing just pick the best button in the best region yeah so just to go back to the questions is it true they're far more leopards and lions it's actually hard to say they're probably about the same numbers was Sidney here you know well we keep a pretty good game report than that and I think there we averaged 25 to 30 leopards and a good month the Lions on Mala Mala between 50 and 60 s certainly on Matamata there's more lions and leopards but not that much and and then I ena is probably just as many as the lions and leopards together the gray fur leave the leopard to leave they kill they so she does have a kill one of their kills in a tree she's got a water back off in a tree and then an Impala on the ground that was last seen on the ground and that thicket way we started the stream from so she's she hasn't really left it the killers in a tree I presume she ate the Impala she's just gone for a drink we hoping and then we'll come back soon he's also arranged at Mala Mala so yes indeed she is Tim she's just at home driving around in a quad but getting it stuck in the farm damn then maybe just to follow on a little bit from their question about lions and leopards you get far more lipids that do you live outside of these reserves than lions and you know just about everywhere in South Africa you can find lipids but lions are generally confined to within the borders of these game reserves and that is because of the secrets of nature of lipids it's a lot more difficult to spot a lipid than it is a pride of lions and there are highly adaptable cats say I think the densest population of them in the world there's actually in in Mumbai city if we are to believe BBC Bradley comment Architects p2p a yellow buy a laptop of big-screen TV awesome very like so Pete I think then you've got the best chance of spotting the slippage somewhere in the reeds we can see how many pixels you can pick out from San Diego here's another interesting question if you could be a prey animal what would you be if you could be a predator animal what would you be if the whole vibe was not to be eaten I wanna say giraffe that I do come too sticky into sometimes but I think they have a far less exciting life in a Impala would say creditor I don't know I think a big crocodile might not be a bad  let's get the chill on the beach all day go fishing from time to time ways ways to live your life as if when the rivers run dry then you you're stressing hey how about you good choice yes I wonder she's not just had a drink and fallen asleep at the river yeah it is very possible as well hello from Indonesia so thanks for those of you that are just joining us and wondering why you viewing Walla Walla camp from across the river so we with the Piccadilly female leopard she has a small water back cough kill from this morning stashed up a tree behind us we just watched her walk down to the reeds you can't see the water itself but I think she just went to go and have a quick drink I'm hoping it was a quick drink and we'll come back alternatively she went for a long drink and is now lying in the reeds there in the shade it's just where she is it's a bit of an awkward flesh you can't quite see it but there's quite a sharp drop off that we can't really get down and around to where she is that will give her another couple of minutes and see if she pops out again that's it Jesus saying she'd be an elephant that's a good choice I think I just want to be an elephant but the question was prey animal of an elephant qualifier I'm sure in Botswana there's a part of lions that eats elephants there's actually Dakin the vgb john joy do you remember the old hands can say yes I do I went there once and I've been to it nowadays it's a wildly fancier place and it used to be okay so Jay according to research done the highest density is in Valhalla National Park in Sri Lanka second highest in South Florida National Park daily the confluence of the Sun and Saudi rivers I think you should tell Satan brother Jay I think it's like a little rocky outcrop that's kind of in the middle of the city and every day the lipids go and spend their day up on that rocky outcropping at night go and hunt in the city so I think it would depend when you are counting him is it at 12:00 midday or 12:00 midnight whether there's how many leopards there are in that little protected area but thanks for that Jay we appreciate looking that up for us definitely he's not quite dated David Attenborough but I trust him nonetheless right up there with know from Greece [Music] I need Johnson making your Friday afternoon glad you're enjoying it and any offering the death of Atilla Scott molten shadow LOX wants to be a hyena just Bo which female and which male lipid his favorite sure stuff on him the male lipids I want to say one of the sons of the insert when a female de three three one that we've been seeing a bit more regularly and coming later the females [Music] may be the Three Rivers female so she had quite a cool story but so she is the youngest sibling of this one the piccadilly female the mom was killed when she was about a year old if he's just gonna get gassy twist the camera around her mom was killed I think over there some way so I'm not good at the pointing on the fern thing and but then after that this young female leopard could have an orphan as able to survive and kind of taken up a territory around rat raised camp so that's a she's my favorite and the dev asking where in the screen are we looking at so in the dev I'm trying to actually focus on this elephant yeah it might be a bit blurry it's just in front of the Economist yet just in front of one of the rooms there maybe I'll just go wide again and we keep on looking in the area of the Piccadilly female Jonjo asking do you remember Cholula say yes indeed i was really lucky when i started working we used to see him all the time that we knew him as the rock drift male jalawla was his screen name but he's certainly one of the most famous leopards that we had at Mala Mala and leave his documentary living with leopards and Beauty and the Beast documentary but yeah one of our most famous leopards also National Geographic cover Christine Prescott asking did she get killed by a lion say yes she she did she got killed by the what at the time we were calling me a vodka mouse now we know them as the southern of our mouse to distinguish him from their younger brothers and bad yes so we we found her just after it happened sadly but those two males killed quite a few quite a few of our leopards in its a four to six month period really disrupted our leopard sightings for a row survival studios this channel makes my dad as well as provides me a reference for my new game I'm making hmm is it a computer game otherwise well if so I'd be quite interested so Ken Smith how often do these large animals end up in camp so pretty often the elephants it's just I want to set just normal especially in winter they every day the leopards couple times a week perhaps and then sometimes the Lions hippos pretty much every night on the lawn if you go into Mala Mala channel you'll see there's a couple of tips here where we show you the animals running through the camp will the lionesses anywhere hunting in impala running through the camp bond James Bond so either leopard that was formed about dereck and Beverly G bear in Botswana stalking lipids you know that ah that's it so you have jogged my memory James Bond but the documentary was called stalking leopards that featured Cholula Robin Sewell and joy making fun of me I will be sure not to water your plants anymore oven and anything we are looking for a needle in a haystack she arts pretty much right so we can see that bird flying more or less is where the leopard was last seen at sorry flag so this leopard is she is not really playing along well just give her a little time to see if she comes back so I wonder maybe it's not yeah I'm just going to the cause I yeah maybe go to the causeway I was gonna say maybe we should just wait and see if she does come back and then go live again I don't know what you guys think in the chatroom there welcome to Where's Wally Safari Edition that's pretty much exactly right mr. Punisher asking why did the Lions attack and kill them I'm presuming you mean the leopard so it's just a competition thing so not so much territory territory is only between species are normally between animals of the same sex so like this female leopard only worries about other female leopard she doesn't care about the males and how they define their territory obviously she wants to know who her male leopard is but she's got nothing to do with that but the Lions just want to get rid of potential threat to Cubs in the future or potential food competition all the Predators will kill one another if they get a chance Jonjo asking new mr. wallet ah yes I did meet Kim is sort of a friend of a family friend I think Gareth you know don't you yeah sir Kim's I think he's currently in Botswana in say excuse me in Zimbabwe filming hi he knows if you go on Instagram you can see he's quite active at the moment with his young daughter and wife and there are yeah busy getting to know a hyena clan they you know kim yeol now that he gets up close and personal these hyenas so tightly saying we will just drive with you guys so I think everyone is happy to stick with us I'm guessing no weight dishes just spotted the needle in the haystack ok let me try and zoom in on this I'm waiting for Mike and yaki to see a fax this is it Tom when gas normally flips the camera around to himself yeah okay I'm apologies if that does happen but thanks for making me aware of that Mike okay she looks like she's coming back I wonder can you all see you on the screen there this is a bit of a legs they're gonna wait for you all to you comment the beautiful cat so Robert McClain asking how does one book accommodation so I think the dogs just answered you there but you're welcome to you going to Google sightings page and have a look from there that sorry facts are just for those of you that are joining us this is the Piccadilly female returning back to her kill she is quite blurry on the screen because we are filming her on a cell phone because that is all we had when the world shut down we didn't have time to go and buy in streaming camera but I think his camera has done a pretty good job all things considered and the reason we can do this is because we have cell phone signal here it's one of the few places on the reserved we only about 10% of Mahlon wall is covered which is why we can't really give you a time for the sightings so when we're gonna livestream because we just don't know we need the animals well we need to find animals in the first place and then invariably a second question if someone sees something is do you have cell phone signal there yeah who's just going to reposition us I think the big innately female will just watch it for the for the time being this is just building up the suspense they on their way back waiting for everyone to be on the brink of giving up before she popped out of the grass now the other thing that he did drag the one caucus down into this thick it's a bit earlier and I'm wondering I'm hoping that she's finished feeding on that I'm hoping that she does make an appearance again and that she doesn't lie at the bottom of the bank and maybe still feed on that caucus if there is still any lift everyone had their patience pants on which was hopefully paid off you I hope you didn't take them off yet because he's still waiting for it to walk up the bank now to where we are I mean a question from Christine Prescott how's the battery laughs on that song we're looking good for now they still 65% yeah so just to kind of ran you through our setup we've got Gareth is filming on his cell phone and I'm watching the YouTube stream which is kind of weird because it's got a 20 second lag so what do you see and when I see your comments is kind of after everything is happening [Music] so yeah I think you can try okay yeah we're just gonna see if we can see around any of these bushes maybe she's in the open around the pardon if this base yeah I round run so if you look sinter a frame at the moment to the right of that sunset is the northern end of the Drakensberg mountain range wait here skies here at the moment very beautiful of is like a see here they she's busy feeding on the poly caucus yuck he's gonna make a plan like so you can't quite see but we're out on the edge of a kind of an embankment or a cliff yeah yeah I think if you a little bit for it yeah I think you're good actually okay let's see if we can zoom in on here that did you wanna try and rest a day okay so yeah ku is going to just try and set up this camera for a bit of you questions fund it's a good suggestion about hitting the cell upon charger commandment we can't really I don't know if you can even buy that kind of stuff in South Africa yeah quite a severe lockdown fortunately for us we went on the lockdown quite early but because it's a strict we not really able to get all sorts of orders and that so effect you're just trying to set up the camera but hopefully you can see already well now so Christine Prescott also for everyone watching so she's got this Impala kill here that other one that she's eating but behind us in the tree is a water back cough so what about is one of our bigger antler but the car she's got is probably the same size as the Impala and that she has up the tree if you want to go back to this morning's large James you go into Kruger sightings channel you'll see this morning's last stream and and you'll actually see when she had both of the kills in the tree and then opinion I said yes the definitely was with the way and so we hopefully gonna get to see her a little bit more now that she's I kind of occupied with feeding they're doing she is also is very well hidden so and there's something way to walk her right on the banquette it's not really gonna stumble across there and then yeah just the question is she pulling off the so yes she is like us and like most pretty much everything she want that J step to the so should I want to eat too much of it because she will have to cup after furball at some point and so she's gonna pluck off the fear as much as possible before eating the the meat and the other very important function that that does is actually brush their teeth as well so kind of biting through all that first grabbing all the clocks and whatnot off it's actually one of them she's living around cotton Marcy it's one of the quite distinctive things if we find they kill and we found all the flat offer on that there's a pretty good bit that it letters they're a lot more fastidious eaters and most animals with the Lions they would have just detonated this Impala every line running in grabbing a piece and we're not to say is about plucking it neatly and Amanda so you'll know what to do if we ran out of toothpaste and lockdown now please let us know how that works out for you and then Hamid I think it's sanic is full but it's fulfilling a wild habit so she doesn't know when her next meal is coming and so she does have the to kill but there are very opportunistic I don't know which she killed first but if something walks faster even now while she's eating she'll still try and catch it and also she we are pretty sure 99% choice just had some Cubs in the last two weeks so she's kind of eating for two or three maybe four most leopard letters are between two and three though I've never known a leopard to raise three cabs and but two is a kind of a more normal number she and her sister were raised together there's a boy a female and little met does she still have suckle marks I don't know did you guys notice at the sauna I didn't see that me still lactating but I couldn't see if she had second mark they're greedy this is not really greedy it's sensible and it's kind of the make hay while the Sun shines attitude also even though she's got this kill or one of the kills up the tree and she's eaten the bulk of this one it's a the best place for safest place to store her food is inside of herself because even not a male leopard or the Lions that you come along that still be able to climb up and steal that kill that she has on the tree and definitely get this one on the ground but if the Foods insider then anyway they're gonna get at it is by eating here to switch for the Lions is not completely off the table and survival syria's is correct leopards eat prayer small as dung beetle up to Elin so we had one of our male lipids we're talking about earlier to Lolo the raucous mouth he killed a young giraffe even so they take some pretty substantial kills after well he kind of had it in the tree but I think the feet were hanging on the ground and then her father the a strip mal we once found him with this enormous pattern about I want to say it must have been not quite five meters but he had some of the pattern up in the tree but it was so long it was hanging all the way down to the ground [Music] Denyce Mortlock what is the smell like it is not as bad as my brother what luck is my mom that countries are charming in how long did they keep the kill for and doesn't get a chance to rot and become tired so she will keep it or you can see it's actually worse than their and but I've seen leopards eating meat so rotten it's almost liquid so they're not too fazed by the the smell or decay Lawrence jr. asked gasps is it possible for Gila to smell the Impala learns yes very much so hyenas have a great sense of smell and now that the Sun has gone down the temperature is starting to get very cool here and all of the cold or cooler air is gonna sink into the river right in front of us and that is all gonna go downhill in the direction that the water is flowing and that air is gonna carry that smell along with us and somewhere along the line I'm sure they are gonna be hyenas along this trail ends I'm pretty sure somewhere along the line some will add a predator with her it's I you know or Lionel another leopard may smell it and may come in investigate this and Amanda saying love the sound of the name tool or social Allah means he who walks in darkness it's a very cool name to have especially if you're a lipid so he who walks alone depending on how you want to interpret it it's the name of one of the roads here on Walla Walla that leads from six crossings and opinionated so yes the best place to store food is in your stomach not in the fridge that you can feel opportunistic feel better about opportunistic lockdown ranges so having lived amongst these wild animals as long as I have are also over the opinion that food needs to be in your stomach at all opportunities which is why I have the big size uniform an eight-lane how Harper away do we think the den is so in a straight line [Music] so we don't know exactly where her dinners we suspect the area that's not it not that precise location any equity description how FAR's Mala Mala from jimeniz so we are south of Jummah it borders on to us from here to the way we are exactly nos maybe seven ish kilometers but our food is on to us I think I'm not sure it's got a lot of properties that border onto Mala Mala so I'm not exactly sure where their particular property is but yeah somewhere up there to derive goal Nadia to look pretty often school work or here so I'm gonna say here face conferences they'll repeat that about a billion times on the news I'm sure school work is something that can always wait unless you're under 18 in which case get back to it hello TJ Candida never lose teeth then get tooth abscissas or is impala flossing effective so it's actually a pretty good question i want to say that dental hygiene and these cats is pretty good in general we see them sometimes with the missing tooth but if an abscess Seymour with missing teeth or broken teeth yeah that's a con actually very cool coming across one of the cats anyway with an abscess in its tooth but yeah broken teeth especially with the Lions when they get kicked in the face by zebra or giraffe or something one of the male lines at Charleston male he was had a well you look like a saber-toothed lion for a long time because of his broken tooth hanging down but been yeah and i've known an elephant that had a sort of an abscess where its tasks were quite badly so the nerve was exposed and that one we actually caught it and tranquilized it cleaned out the abscess we rounded off that injury and let him go Nia is fun afterwards we don't normally interfere with animals but it must have been intensely painful because if I'll think about how sore toothache ism a human-sized tooth imagine your tooth is about eight feet long and about 12 inches around so it must have been ridiculously painful for him but he recovered very well from that and hello to Iris Cabela's in the Atlanta Georgia Dental Group did you draw this exactly I think we I do remember driving a Georgia Dental Group and welcome back and hello Jay Candida pitler do we know if is a book about them a poke alliance so there isn't petrol or not that I'm aware of but is a documentary called brothers and blood I want to say the bulk of that footage was actually filmed here on Mala Mala well yeah there's no book that I'm oh era I was actually at one of the sightings with a map or course tried to take over the Styx pride in that documentary this is a very intense sighting and Micah Hoffman do they churn the bones as well though they leave them Assad so it depends on how big the bones are so something like there's some pilots bones are relatively soft so the leopard just gonna crunch can may be from Tom Thierry Tom yeah them crunching away but she's also after the marrow that's inside of those bones also very nutritious so provided nothing steals us from her I'd expect all that will be left is maybe this fine the kind of Tufts of the ribs and the skull but all the other boy shall crunch up and eat rather asking where do we get our food who you get it from macro and do you ever go out late at night like at 12:00 it depends what we up to we don't do it for filming but we must occasionally do it for other reasons have you ever seen any liquid and hyena confrontations so quite a few but I haven't managed to fool many I don't think we've filmed any on Mala Mala Channel I'm sure I'll grab my data and Kruger lights aside things there would be plenty of liquid IANA into actions normally though the lizard's just back away they don't wanna risk getting into a fight with hyenas ie nerves are bigger so it is something that they just conjurus getting into that confrontation in survival studio do we see leopard taking run or Butler car so Butler comes is something they do a little bit more frequently and p2 is chatting in the last stream this morning making coffee as well he actually saw the bicycle crossing male leopard which is who this lipids grandfather if I remember correctly they were in a sighting the one night and he ran in and caught a newborn Aaronic off I wish that he had got it on film but the leopard ran in were old over the calf was trying to bite it to kill it Pete actually thought it was a big warthog at first because I couldn't quite see what this leopard was talking in the grass and that the mother Anna came and hits him very luckily for him with the kind of flats of the horn not to the point otherwise I think she would have impelled him but she knocked that little runner copper right let's write off the car the leopard ran off honestly two tons of Rana wasn't enough to you oh there's more than enough to get him read all over the coffe but then afterwards we saw that coffee took about a month for it to recover did well in the end but it was pretty shaken up and badly scratched at first so we had find it just lying on the road kind of passed out not looking too well but you're all superficial scratches really but I did survive in the end but it was a pretty spectacular sighting nonetheless damn just charming in there I think I'll face livestream on the Facebook page the Three Rivers female was in a tree with I he knew at the base and then the does just posted another video there that you can go have a look at I'm sure that'll be quite entertaining Semmy j-just kidding yourself some coffee tea Lawrence jr. wants to know yeah yeah animals fight during the mat in the camp we do yeah animals fighting at night Rima Kent I think Gina cheers at the most he's got a couple of units that fight in his roof every just about every night and all about it in the morning yeah we do yeah animals fighting in camp from time to time sometimes you hear animals being killed outside of camp I know we heard the sticks pride killing a buffalo and Piccadilly triangle which is behind us from Kemp one evening yeah does happen sometimes time asking is it true that honey badgers attacked Buffalo and other large prey by the con jewel so yes it is attacked even documented here at Walla Walla but long before video cameras were even a thing but there was one honey badger that killed three Valdivia using that method one not just ridiculous and unnecessary have you ever seen a cheetah kill a lion or leopard cub I haven't I think it would be pretty unusual I'm not saying it wouldn't happen but it would certainly be a very rare sighting got no doubts that they would if it was a particularly small line or lipid cam I'm not sure she's pretty much done feeding or she's just moving around to get a bit of a bit of kill a bit of position yeah I'm kind of surprised that there's no high Hina that have turned up by now the court there would be at least one now but we're at bother camp so it might be investigating the camp to see what three meals are going there Pauline Darris what about the Boone attacks so the lipids are famous for catching the Boone's they don't do it nearly as often as it's made out to be here anyway but yeah just about 100 yards from where we're sitting one of the male lipids the Newington male that we had here years ago he killed a baboon but in the process that mauled him so badly that he didn't survive that encounter so it's not always the Leopards way and then I'm pretty sure on the does Channel there's a crazy sighting of the litter doing that's carrying a lion cub around I don't know what happened to the lion cub in the end there but if you're asking about the billions attacking us [Music] meet the current asking how old is she Patrice said just over six years old yeah just another six years I'd actually have to check that honest face mm 18 mm yeah this December 2013 there you gotta send the dog saying he's actually got two videos of the vision sealing leopard cub which is pretty crazy it's a little bit booing the size of the man I'm going to say that it probably doesn't end well for any of those Cubs that have been stolen by baboons the boons are pretty well known for eating little Impala and push back lambs and that as well and that I suppose fair's fair because the leopards do you catch baboons too so if X is getting to that time of evening again that's always you like always I have to bring you this news but they're starting to get darker and you know that when it does start getting dark it turns very quickly and so we are gonna be saying our good-byes shortly but just want to say thank you to all of you for joining us well this morning sighting as well as this one and thanks for being patient and waiting for you to come out of the reeds again so Adam booth what animal must get your heckled after the gardens when you come into Kemp do you have one quick story so as far as making me so infuriating us I want to give it up on to the baboon to pull the thatch out of the roof make a mess in general steel whatever they can it's like living with gremlins if it's to be scared of I'm gonna go with Buffalo those things very very unpredictable and also hard to see on a dark spot to see a black animal at night and you know that it's gonna be aggressive I think mark was telling us a story yesterday about having to dive into a vehicle to get away from a buffalo that charged him in camp but I think I would have paid just to see my dive into the car what animal would scare you the most in County so Buffalo yeah I think Buffalo's win for being the encamped danger so anyway just for myself everyone thanks for joining us again you got like the double feature today with the morning and an afternoon livestream maybe we'll see what's happening here tomorrow as well my guess is that there's not going to be too much going on I think she'll be gone hopefully back to a cab you never know maybe and one of the other leopards could be there but yeah thank you for joining us yeah thanks folks and thanks
