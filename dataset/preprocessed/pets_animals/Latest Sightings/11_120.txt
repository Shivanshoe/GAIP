yeah yeah i've got signal showing in the right hand corner so hopefully this works this time and that says we're coming through now yeah here we go all right folks if anyone can hear us just let us know if we're coming back um i'm sorry we've just really been battling with the signal here for some reason channing labonte hi kimberly beck infinite army friday xa donde no they are not mating right now all right yeah sorry about that folks uh i'm not entirely sure it might have been a load [ __ ] issue that this signal or the sultan wasn't really working but it seems to be fun now read number mesh from singapore welcome curly and mommy williams ticky boo rod woodford yes big crunch good evening abhishek from india welcome proud cat mama of three maria here from upstate new york welcome all right so welcome back barbara russell um so folks we are with the well one of the gallery males and one of the kambula lionesses just here on malamalak game reserve and we are immediately to the south of the malamala airstrip more or less in between malama main camp and malamala rat race camp and the yeah these two they've she does not want to mate but he does so we'll just see if there he tries again soon this infection new york saad patel from toyando hi from romania and that's chianti i'm sure i'm pronouncing that wrong any welcome back guru of pandey these are asking how many times a day do they mate so i'm actually not sure how many times a day but i want to say on average it's about every 20 minutes to 45 minutes and but on a cool day like this that interval will actually be quite short it's quite long when it's hot and i just want to sleep but now they i'm hoping that we'll see some action in the next 15 or so minutes um but when gareth and i came pasture on our way to the hyena den earlier they were looking like they wanted to mate at that stage and this morning you were certainly trying but she kept rebuffing him then ezra matthias from one of my favorite countries amazing rindu namibia guru of pandey adefa yasfalt in the netherlands cmd ant camden new jersey welcome and proud cat mama of three asking do the lions hunt or eat during mating not as much as they would when they're not mating usually they're quite noisy and you know all the animals in the area will be aware of them so if we just scan around here quickly you'll see there's no another general game around our airstrip is just up at the top of that rise there not so they you know when they're busy mating as soon as the female gets up the males happen after and um you see our sulphur entire top right corner there and because he's up and after her with that big black man he's very conspicuous so he gives their positions away very easily so they're not very successful at hunting when they are mating [Music] and great bear from the north this is malamar gam reserve so we are right next to the kruger national park very broadly the kruger park is like a backwards l and we are in the corner of that l if you go on google maps and look for malamala's airstrip or look for malamala camp and retrace camp we are just next to that teacher murray bosman welcome back two days ago i went to pilansburg and saw a line with the cubs and four runners very lucky what is the weight difference between a male and female about so i'm glad you put the about there because there's quite a lot of variation but i want to say a normal lioness is probably 120 kilograms and then the male's about 180 but you do get some that get much bigger i stand to be corrected but i think the record weight is 267 kilograms which is a huge lion but that would be kind of the exception and i i suspect some of that weight will also be the last thing that is eaten so when lions do eat they can eat about 15 of their own body weight in one sitting so that 260 odd kilograms might have been 20 30 kilograms of uh well say 15 20 kilograms of wildebeest or something as well that was being weighed kathleen jones welcome back hello from washington state okay everyone welcome back uh friday didn't miss anything we were just moving from the hyena den uh where we were earlier to the lions unfortunately we had to go through two valleys on the way here so the signal dropped out on route which is quite sad because we passed some elephants and some baboons running across the river on the way and then arjuna in assuming that this is the gary mail with the kampula lanes that is correct and the kambula pride has been fragmented over the last month they are a very large pride of lions and we're seeing them in bits and pieces lately and proud cat mama of three asking is the lioness part of the styx pride no but we did have reports where they're on malamar this morning um too long until our traversing area but not here okay so they're very close by this morning well close by on the other end of the reserve hello from khao teng from it's just nandy i think aesthetic uh dizzy 1369 asking we were at tahini so unfortunately dizzy we were with the hyena then if you go into the later sightings page i don't know if it's up yet but you'll see we about a well for the last hour we were at hyena then with some pups the youngest pups moved into the den not long after we got there maybe about 10-15 minutes after we got there and then we were just with the two older pups but you'll come sorry but you'll see um that if you want to catch up and then just does he again asking is this where line is from the pride no it's one of the lionesses from and then it's just nandi the x is just for decoration excellent hello from narnia sorry i missed the question but someone was asking are reasons are asking do they ever hand baboons um and can they catch him so it does happen but it's pretty pretty rare normally the lions don't bother um and the baboons are pretty alert so for the lions to sneak up on baboons is i want to say virtually impossible leopards are able just because they're masters of stealth and patience which the lions don't really have um but it is quite funny sometimes when the lions do chase a baboon up a tree or the baboons kind of blunder into them yeah it's not not common kathleen jones asking how's the lioness from kambula pride and their new cubs doing so dancehall it's it really is quite a long distance view but he did see her nursing what looked like two cubs in the distance yesterday and so there are at least two little ones there maybe there's more but he just couldn't see them but you have to kind of look through a tunnel of bush into a small overhanging rock um but yeah hopefully in the next couple of weeks we'll start to see those cubs more and more regularly uh barbara russell asking if they just started to mate today so we only found them yes this morning together or paired off like this um but the male is a lot more keen to mate than the female um we saw him getting rebuffed this morning and then this afternoon we haven't seen them mate yet but he he's been sticking to her like glue and then letting her out of her sight friday i'm not drinking mushroom hats and mike says hi let's try and fix this again and penguin chicks or lion cubs which are the cutest i don't know i'm gonna go with lion cubs but i've also seen a lot more lion cubs in penguin chicks and i'm here and i don't know if any of you are watching on facebook if you are and you want to ask us questions just switch over to uh youtube later sightings youtube channel and we are answering questions on that live feed i know this does go to both facebook and the youtube page so proud cat mama asking how many days do lion mate so normally it's over two or three days sometimes four and about every 20 minutes on average that they'll mate in that time um actually read like one of these weird facts but for every two year old lion that you see took 3 000 matings to produce or there's three thousand matings for every uh two year old newly independent lion produced but the reason that they made so much or one of the speculated reasons for so much mating for what would seem like so little result is that it helps bond these males to the female so you know they'll mate with the lionesses thousands of times before any cubs are actually produced and that just keeps him around or him and his brothers around if it was a case of he came in mated and left there would be no males to stay and defend the territory and keep other new males off and new male alliance kill the previous male's cubs so they want to be or from the lionesses side they want to be sure that the males are definitely going to stick around it's not just a one-night stand and never seen again because she's not pregnant for three and a half months raises the cabs and then some new guy comes in and kills them so all of that energy that she spent and time and effort and heartache is all for nothing so the more they can kind of guarantee the mail stay the better and lauren's just asking when are we going to get a camera laurence we we have been looking at cameras um and there are many different types of cameras and they're all very expensive so we've got to kind of make the sums work and decide exactly which you know which way we're going to go with the filming um because there's lots of different options so for now we don't have an answer looking at the amazon app and the banking app on my phone so sadly next to each other look the two aren't friends um juha asking are they or i'm hoping i'm saying that right um so are these two part of a bigger pride so yes so he has a brother the other guy male and then she's got five sisters and 14 assorted nephews and nieces um so part of when they're all together there's 22 lions um well 20 excluding the plus the two males um so yeah the much bigger pride well actually no it's more than that's more than because there's the new cabs as well so in the next couple of months if there are when those cubs are moving around and they're all together then it could be 24 if not more um we're not sure where the rest of the the gang is um our anti-poaching unit did see four of the lionesses this morning on the other end of the airstrip so they have somewhere around here and then for those of you that watch malamare's channel a lot you'll be familiar with gene at one of the other ranges that does all of our ecology stuff and this morning he could hear the other lions somewhere kind of at the back of the camp but uh we we didn't well no one really went to look for them because we had found these ones already and then uh carolina leone asking about the one-year was it linda ship and i'm not sure now about the one-year wild dog um who we've shown on on malamar's youtube channel a few times they've also got pups it's a pack of two wild dogs an alpha male and alpha female and i think they had nine pups and uh they have moved from their den site on malamar we're not quite sure where they are currently but they are not close by to us in the meantime we have another dan site that's been established at malamata and and i'm we're not 100 sure how many adults there are there's at least four but there are 11 pups and they're still very young and they've started denning here hopefully they will continue dinning on malamar for a while and barbara russell asking do you think the stixx pride will start mating again so barbara i actually personally haven't seen the stixx pride for more than a year now so i'm actually they've been moving around so much and are so far removed from our normal day i'm actually not even sure what's going on with that pride now um i don't know if they would maybe mate with the gary males i suppose it would depend a lot on if they were in the garamel's territory in the first place but i think the kambula lionesses they're just so strong and so aggressive they'd keep any others out so you can see as soon as she started moving he's woken up to make sure she's not sneaking off to join her sisters he's so paranoid about her abandoning him and sneaking away then welcome back to pillow howard good to see you back in the chat room then does the 1369 saying only two question marks small pack it is indeed we've seen them around you for the last couple of years uh but they haven't managed to raise any pups just yet they do have a number of perhaps now hopefully some of those they are able to raise to adulthood and then their pack will grow kathleen jones asking do we know if the cheetah brothers found one another and so we don't know the we actually are in the same area now about i don't know 5 600 meters from where that happened but we haven't seen any sign of the dogs or the cheetah but you know it's unfortunately for cheetah they very often get bullied by the other animals bullying is maybe a nice way to phrase it but it's not unusual that they get chased around and separated by wild dogs or hyena the lions even leopards or bigger male cheetahs so they're quite used to getting split up and then finding one another again so i'm pretty confident that he's all right and if they hadn't joined or hadn't been able to find one another what i'd expect is that the other brother would still be walking around the airstrip calling and being visible and you know trying to be found um so we haven't seen that so i'm guessing that they find devin barrett saying g'day jens why doesn't malamar subsidize the camera equipment surely it's in their best interest to support the virtual safari cheers thanks for the footage you're welcome for the footage devon it's a little bit complicated especially now with covert um you know most of the staff has been home since january march-ish and uh you know we've had no guests coming here the only income we get is from guests that come and visit the reserve so there's been precious little income actually no income coming into the reserve and only now are some of the or a lot more of the staff starting to trickle back to work we will be opening up to the south african public in the immediate area and yeah you know we're still not charging full rates and so at this point we can't justify spending money on camera equipment when you know there's still people that aren't getting full salaries and we're just at a very awkward time right now so hopefully in the future we will get some more camera equipment i know um since lockdown we have been doing more in this filming department and i think we will continue in some form or another we just got to decide which is going to work best with our operation when it comes to guests obviously the the real life guest experience should naturally come first and um yeah we'll just have to see what works best in terms of filming or live streaming or whether we can do both and there's a large bull elephant approaching now he's walking directly to us but he's still quite somewhere off i'll point the camera there when we get a slightly better view of him but it'll be nice to see him come close by it's just nandi asking is this kruger so yes um and for everyone that's just joining us so we on malamala game reserve next to the kruger national park and we're with one of the kambula lionesses and one of the gary male lions and we found them together this morning well as a pair with a whole pride with in front of malama main camp yesterday so we well they've been trial he's been trying to mate and she has been putting him off um but yeah we'll spend some time here and see if they do uh decide to mate in the end okay so this uh elephant's just changed his trajectory a bit i'll point the camera in that direction when he comes back into view again seems to be quite a nice big bull friday saying the mail looks small so like he's not that small but it's also the kambula prada are quite big lionesses um so he kind of uh it just seems that way um because because she is that much larger than his okay so that bull elephant isn't coming this way anymore okay i will see if they get up she might want to actually find the rest of the pride um okay so i'm not entirely sure where they are but they're somewhere in this area um and i don't know where his brother is i presume he's with the rest of the the pride and but the pride itself has been a bit scattered lately um there's the one sister that's busy raising a cubs on one of the rocky art crops here campbell copies which the kambula pride is actually named for um and then they had left five of the cubs in front of ratra's camp in the river and then there were another three of the all the cubs that had been left quite far in the north of the reserve and then the balance of the pride moving around um but they all seemed to have regrouped yesterday and all be back together the two males were actually kind of babysitting the three youngest cubs um you know they it was quite funny they weren't with the cubs but they're about 100 meters away they could keep an eye on them and that without being hassled by the youngsters um but i don't know when they last ate i haven't caught anything big that we're aware of any time recently but these lines are pretty successful hunters i think they catch lots of impala and that and they just devour them and move on before we even get a chance to really see what happened now if these irons catching them pilots in five minutes it's completely gone then barbara russell just asking any doctor any updates on the monthly female and cub referring to the monthly pride of lions you can see he's got bed here is that a lion calling sure folks we're gonna go and try and keep up with the lions they are in a big rash just forgive me if we don't answer the questions that's why we're driving his back legs on entirety i think he's got a dead leg from sleeping through the day it's just it's got pins and needles that he's just riding uh but yeah we're not sure what got their attention um yeah they might have heard other lions or possibly they heard something else being killed maybe a leopard lady killed or the wild dogs this is uh some land driver driving going through but you're gonna be mexican yeah so there is a this road that they're going on leads down to the river so it might well have been a leopard kill that they've heard so we might lose signal fix so again as we're driving the signal might cut out so we've lost sight of the lines it's gonna try and find them yeah they're on the crest there so folks unfortunately it's quite a steep bank that these lines are running down and i'm hoping that the signal doesn't cut out once we go into the river valley here okay all right like sarcon see the lions right now oh they're already running across the river uh no we can't go down here all right folks unfortunately there's no crossing close by here but we're gonna shoot around as fast as we can to get back to the lions alright so you get to see a little bit more of mala mala as we go good job just the speed that the lions are moving i think they've actually heard a kill unfortunately the riverbank is so steep that there is no way to cross where they are sorry yeah yeah for those of you that watch malamala's youtube channel and the latest sightings channel are live um we're in the territory of the maxim's male leopard now and so it could well have been one of his kills that the lions heard being made i just have to shoot across the sand river now hold your breath i'd say yeah let's stick in the river at least we'll see them all right and the dove asking is this near maxim's lookout so yes that big tree in the center of the frame there that's the tree at maxim's lookout all right and we're asking where are they samia we just had to loop around to try and find them again they've run across the river they were going with some speed so that's why we suspect that they actually heard a kill that they don't want to have well don't want to get stolen by something else they want to steal it [Music] first [Music] the other possibility is that they went to join up with the rest of the pride they might have heard them roaring and i didn't hear anything but the lions have got a phenomenal sense of hearing themselves i'm gonna have to power up this bank uh you're gonna have to just go straight back and slide your way here all right so you can't really see it on screen yet but this is a bit of a land rover proof bank we're gonna try go up there just need to [Music] the words of jeremy clarkson at speed and power is what you have to hear again [Music] there we go all right back on the trail so perfect so the lions have got a pretty significant head start on us here's the tracks going up the road in front of us so what we might do in a second if we don't have any luck finding him is just stopping and listening for any growling and arguing if they have stolen a kill maybe the alarm calls of another animal contracts there i think that was when they were coming to every saw then i'm just gonna listen for a second so just gonna see if i can find one of their tracks on the road here unfortunately we haven't been able to hear anything [Music] okay so i'm not really following the comments i'm just trying to find these lions again all right like so those that are just joining us we were with the gary they just woke up they'd heard something and woke up and then went running off there she is sorry never mind we've just found i can just see a lioness in the distance here but yeah the lions had woken up and again running across the river after something uh i'm not sure if they heard a kill or they heard other lions i'm just gonna see i think i heard other lions it doesn't look like the lions we were with so we found lions but it's not the ones we are looking for uh all right we're just going to try and reposition the vehicle here and see if we can see actually how many lines there are i think this might be the balance of the kambula pride waste we'll just see what happens here folks but it's quite possible that these lions heard one another maybe we've actually got ahead of the other two that we're originally trying to find i think that's fine for now all right so these look like the other four of the kambula parts so there's these three here on screen and then the other lioness behind us then obviously number five is with that male wherever those two are maybe on routier still and then the sixth one is the one with the littlest cubs up on the rocky art crop there all right but yeah like i said they're not actually the lines that we were initially with but they were running in this direction and all right sorry folks we go gareth and i'll just go through some of the questions that might have come through while we're driving around and try and answer them but if we don't get to your question just ask again and we'll we'll try get those um get to those questions um this is lapwing welcome back saying we're gonna need to get name tags for them so you are right it's quite difficult following these lionesses because they all do look quite similar and that particularly pale one does stand out and there's another with a prominent scar across her face but it's very difficult to actually tell them apart from one another um there are kind of twins anyway the high from shanghai station's four lines scotch and north of them to the eastern station last visual of the single lioness and gary now headed north and west from mexico [Music] i don't know if they've just heard the other lions calling kathleen jones saying she's having a morning coffee oh yeah it's afternoon it's getting well i think we might have gone past sundana time that's odd be very appreciative of a cup of coffee right now and proud cat mama it is a great way to spend the day for a lot of our regular viewers as well you can kind of see what gareth and on some of the other rangers dan and nick and yaku are all up to with our malamada's youtube channel um we're hoping to keep up both that youtube channel and and these live sightings on the devs channel latest sightings going into the future so hopefully you'll actually be able to follow on malama a little bit more and i know it will be quite nice for everyone to be able to see what becomes of the kambula pride and their new cubs and we still haven't really got a good look at them just yet but very soon thanks for that kg oh digitally accept them another possibility is that these lionesses called and the other lioness came to join them but they only maybe called one so she wasn't quite able to like pinpoint where they are but it wouldn't surprise me if the other two lions turned up here it is more or less the direction that they were all or the other two were coming in and i had high hopes of actually finding them trying to steal a kill from a leopard or something like that it would seem not fighting wolves just making the comment that the sleepy mode so far you know just watched how quickly that can change with the single lioness and the male who were in full sleep mode and then just went straight into action gary mel half dragging his legs because he looked like he had pins and needles from sleeping all day long and so for those of you that are watching regularly on our live feeds from malamar um you normally just sit with a particular sighting and wait but today we've actually covered a bit of ground um it wasn't perfect but remarkably the signal has actually played along for a change and where we are now actually i'm quite surprised that we have any signal at all but it is working so obviously the stars all aligned correctly this is left wing just asking about any sightings of talala in her cub so known as the marty linus and her cab or the motley pride they haven't been seen in a couple of weeks i don't think but um we have seen them probably about two weeks ago and um yeah they have been around we've seen what we think it's them we see their tracks in that area and so we think they're still okay buttering around maki which is one of the farms here uh kathleen asking is robin's still in camp no she's not but i don't know she might be i don't know robin let us know if you're actually watching saying it wasn't perfect either it was brilliant all right sorry these messages are coming through a bit quicker where is it gone um arjuna asking where the other male is up i don't know perhaps he is actually babysitting the cubs and i don't think it's by choice that he babysits him i think he just knows it's a good bit that the lionesses are going to fetch the youngsters to come and eat so if he wants food you better hang around with the cubs because they'll get fed at some point so this is what we've been seeing from the kambula pride over the last month or month and a half is where they're splitting up into little groups quite often and going off to hand by themselves and only regrouping every so often just a morning cough there robin how are you roland hello robin so there you go kathleen robin is sort of here and i think she's having more fun looking after a new puppy than looking at lions with us proud cat mum asking how many lions on this pride so there's six of these adult lionesses and then sort of 14 older cubs and at least two brand new cubs that are what are they now maybe two three weeks old only um so yeah i want to say at least 22 plus then the two male alliance 24 with maybe one or two that we haven't seen yet of the littlest cubs into pillow just commenting there that was good work managing spot these lions thank you to pillow it is nice being able to spot them sometimes you drive right by them when they're right next to the road that'd be really lucky on this occasion see this lioness is getting a bit restless yeah i just got some fur in the back of her throat or something this pride the kambula pride really is a particularly large pride we do see quite big prides of lions in this area and this part of the world is actually um you know very predator dense area malama has always been really well known for its game viewing but for the density of predators in particular and for the leopard density we're one of the highest in the world [Music] and then the lions also it's a pretty amazing number of lions that we see there's about 10 different prides and coalitions of lions that we follow i think in a normal month we see about 60 odd individual lions and just on our property and we're about 30 or 33 000 acres or 15 000 hectares for the rest of the world um arjuna asking is the kambula pride spreading often because of dominance or other reasons so i think it's partly for food it's not unusual for really big prides of lions to split up at some point because they like there is a lot of competition for food but then some of those big prides that do split up the split is permanent and then others they actually kind of keep on good terms with one another and different members of the pride might go off in pairs or threes or fours or even singly and then join back together it just depends on how sort of severe that competition for food is like the lioness that's got the youngest cubs now it would make sense for her to kind of move around within the pride territory on her own and or with her cubs to start with because her small cubs are just gonna get bullied uh constantly by the the older two-year-old and one-year-old cubs that these lionesses have um for those of you that watch our channel youtube channel regularly you'll see that the kambula prides cubs are particularly scruffy looking cubs but it's because they have such a hard time so if they survive cupboard they're gonna grow up to be the toughest meanest most streetwise lions on the planet i think because they they really have to brawl with these other lions that are two three times their size for for any food and there's a number of you asking about um the tragic accident and with the guide and our condolences go out to the hooper family and having this very difficult period yeah it can't be easy and our thoughts are with you and kathleen saying there's a large group of sub adult males in the pride that will be on their own soon so yes i'm guessing in the next year those young males will all move off together and maybe not the youngest ones but certainly the older ones and then if they move off as a group of six i think or five or six young males together there will be a pretty powerful coalition already the gari males their fathers were initially a part of a coalition of five the biggest coalition i'm aware of on malamala was nine lions so kind of an unstoppable force but i don't think the young males will be able to stay too much longer um without really getting on their father's nerves a bit or the new male lions if any come in and take over the prada definitely going to chase those young males out eric kill asking do you ever come across lions that are exceptionally large males um every now and then about honestly three or four years ago there was one ridiculously big um lash main line he looked like he had just come out of some other zoo or something like he was a remarkably well looked after and phenomenally big lion he came here he mated with one of the eyefield lionesses for a while and then left and we never saw him again but i wish he had stayed because he was an exceptionally good-looking lion as well um but i don't think he could really that single lion would never be able to hold a territory against uh all the big coalitions of lions that we see here in the dove asking do you think those two lions would have been here by now if they were coming here nadav i think they would have been but i think it's quite likely mark said it earlier that these lines could have potentially called and that lioness you know made a beeline for it and maybe they didn't call again and she's kind of lost her way potentially and in which case she might just be close by lying down waiting for the next call welcome welcome oscar robinson let's see new faces in the chat room and just one thing we will send our gods as we see them i was really when gareth and i this morning we were quite far in the south of the reserve where uh the stixx pride of lions had last been seen but i was really hoping to see them myself because i haven't seen them for so long then some phonia doll i just got here what's been happening so quite a lot has happened since we started the stream we started out at a hyena dan site where there are five cabs and they eventually um went back into the dance site so we decided to go and follow up on a pair of mating lions who were sleeping and then just to work suddenly from their slumber and came running in this direction and we're trying to follow them but lost sight of them and stumbled across these lines in frame here and just nandi ascetic it's just 90 and the animals get ever get bothered whenever you film them if you have a look at the previous live stream it's probably two live streams ago now where there is a leopard in a tree and we had an experience with a very nervous metal leopard that we've been seeing around here and we don't have all that many nervous leopards we're quite fortunate to have very relaxed leopards here but we were aware that this particular male was nervous but uh we sat quietly and watched as he approached and uh he actually got right up close to us and climbed the tree and then maybe about five to ten minutes after feeding on the carcass just got spooked and ran off uh when he did run off we gave him his space but we do recognize him as a nervous leopard and if they we see that they do need their space we do give them their space and we let them get used to us and very slowly we don't want to get them scared of us we'd rather have good viewing and let them be as relaxed as these lions are in frame some funnier dolls saying i'm falling asleep just watching them the relaxing way not because i'm bored some fernia i get that feeling when i watch test match cricket and i love it i'll fall asleep because it is boring uh fighting wolves how many distance i'm guessing you mean how far away from the lions uh i want to say we i'm just gonna move the camera so you can see where the vehicle is and so we are that far i wanna say five or six meters away and you can see the lions onto phase by us at all at this gambula pride they've kind of grown up on all of the private game reserves you know for myself i used to watch what i think is these lionesses great grandmothers or great great grandmothers even perhaps [Music] so this product has got quite a long history here it's part of the mothly pride lineage if you will but the martley pride split up into a couple of different groups over the years but when i first started viewing them it was three lionesses a lioness with her two daughters and then that prod grew exceptionally large fragmented into another big group and which fragmented again into what's another kambula pride and eric hill thank you so much for that it's greatly appreciated and sami j and casper nice to see you again and enjoy hopefully we'll catch up on the next stream oh i would love a peanut butter cookie rod right now one of those yeah that hiki no whooped and all the lines of their heads up listening sorry you might not have heard that because i was cackling away over my desire for a peanut butter cookie but there was a hyena that just whooped now it's getting onto sunset now past sunset in fact so a lot of the territorial animals will start calling now just to let their or their own species know who lives where and so on so a lot of the birds call um things like the lions hyenas and that partly it's now the time for the nocturnal animals to be waking up um so they will be paying attention to who lives where and for things like birds they're all kind of letting their competitors know that the territory is still occupied and then again in the morning when they wake up they'll let their neighbors know that they're still around but with the air getting cooler and denser it's also a good time to call it doesn't really make a difference now because it's an extremely cold day for us but in the summit makes a big difference thanks for that tesla smart tech i've had uh rod woodford asking how often do we film say over this lockdown period we've been filming every single day and but we haven't been streaming every single day so if you are enjoying the stream and if you want to see more sightings that happen at malamata outside of our cell phone cellular coverage and then go on to the malamala youtube channel we've got a series called ranges in isolation where we have formed a lot of our sightings and put them up there and we've been very lucky that nadav has been letting us use his channel to show you all these sightings on a typically um on regulator sightings it's sort of the more exceptional one-off sightings and there's some truly phenomenal sightings that people capture and send in to nadav to post on his channel but through the lockdown obviously with a lot of the guides having a bit more free time on their hands he's expanded it to include some of these live streams which we hope will be able to continue with in the future as well as some more educational ones um on birding and guiding skills as well so he's been able to diversify his channel quite a bit and then he even came and visited us to do a tv series or short series anyway um or hopefully be on tv in south africa soon a few close calls with snakes and a few other things the dove is a bit of a hazard in the bush i think he had leopard on his veranda aikina trying to get into his room snakes on the pathway so all this stuff that would happen to us in the course of the career he had happened in the space of a week murphy is really lucky or unlucky depending on how you want to look at it i think he saw all the big far from his room while he was here i can see the lionesses aren't exactly active but they are just slowly starting to wake up and listen to what's going on around them unfortunately there's been no more sign of the other lioness than that male 1 sham i think her sisters gave her the little blue ticks again here he sent the message but didn't respond at all to to her and a lot of you guys just uh saying thank you both to dave and to i'm assuming and you're welcome we really enjoy these interactive experiences on the live streams obviously when we are filming for our own youtube channel it's not quite as interactive so we do enjoy the commentary that goes along with these live streams and all the relationships that we built within these chat rooms so we appreciate you all joining us and talking to us and for all of your comments on our youtube channel keep them coming um it's almost time for us to get going here mike yeah so i know a couple of you are just asking what the stv is so that um the tv series we're doing with the dove will be airing on the south african satellite channels on kind of like our cable network i suppose here but i'm assuming that dove will be able to share some of that at least on his channel down the line so maybe not immediately but keep an eye out for that in the future and for all our south african viewers it'll be on the weather channel channel 180 [Music] and then yeah we'll see i'm kind of cringing because a lot of the time that camera was rolling and i wasn't aware of it dreading some of the more off the cuff remarks that i made coming through because i had to cut a few things out there [Music] but we we shall see okay thank you folks and it's been good again we are going to end this broadcast soon yeah i think nadav is saying he's had some load cheating where he is that's good that's gonna definitely affect our live stream so let's say goodbye quickly while we can thanks superbikes and sleep tight to you all if you are if it is night time where you are and good morning to you all and thanks for the cookie yeah all right goodbye
