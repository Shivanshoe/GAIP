okay okay can you one hear us and see us hey there so everyone that's joining welcome I'm you'll find that your marks are muted let's just do do you have a little bit of organized chaos that would be impossible if we had everyone's marks on yeah if we can ask also if you don't mind keeping your webcams off it's nice to see everyone's beautiful faces but just to keep bandwidth dead and it's knowest I'm gonna I'm gonna stop your videos cool so yeah no I just wanted to welcome everyone we're going to be starting this in Iran maybe one or two minutes just let everyone I'm tuned in it's quite exciting we have caught a lot of people already so far it's going to be ready a such a fun thing to do and and we're all gonna learn alight and yawn please remember this is a interactive course it's a Q&A so sending your questions and we will try and answer them yeah thanks today so if you look at your screens you'll see there's a a participants menu at the bottom or sometimes if you're on a device a tablet or phone and might go to the top if you open up that you can also open up your chat box if you've got any questions you can use that to to chat to to us I'll send I'll send you all a little chat message cool so if you've got any questions going through the session please just use the chat box because your microphones will be muted perfect and I'm basically all done and me are gonna be running the the course here I'll be looking at the facebook comments the YouTube comments so please if you have questions and you're not watching on the zoom you can feel free to just send in your comments it's so nice security a lot of the regulars that join us for our live streams Tunis and already so yeah I think maybe one or two more minutes and we'll be ready to start oh I just see so everyone knows my Hamid he just said has it on on zoom and he actually full in one of the videos that were gonna be analysing today so awesome yeah yeah we invited all the filmmakers today so yeah it's cool to see that you guys are joined now Zima is gonna be really nice talking about your video yeah so we got people from sorry no dev I'm gonna be sharing just the links to the videos as well in case zoom kind of likes taxes the cuts art that you can all watch in HD awesome so should we should we get going I think there's quite a few already online and maybe we can just introduce ourselves while we wait for a few others it's really nice to have this opportunity a dev to join later sightings and this is quite special way to do something like this love yeah definitely you know especially during lockdown we we've always been real-time sightings but you know other parks are closed we've found really entertaining ways of keeping everyone engaged and we've been doing live streams of from all Amala we also had a researcher do a live stream QA and and I think a bird course is something that anyone who's part of our community will love and all learn a lot even for me you know so yeah it's really exciting they say the dog older and I came up with this idea during lockdown and both of us run to companies and we both guards the difference between me and older as he's a specialist bird guard and I'm just a guide but we we were trying to fix this the sort of cabin fever that that was happening we really needed our fix of of going out with people on tour and so he came up with this idea of running interactive classes and in particular birding so that's where the the the thought of birding with Aldo first came up so I think it's a good opportunity then a good time to just speak to older have older introduce himself hi everyone and a couple of my friends there in Wales hello do you look everyone up I've been in interested in birds for 54 years now years ago and by and from being a bird watcher as a boy it graduated into me doing bird research and then I was the first director of bird life South Africa and now currently tourism permitting I'm a specialist tour guide and I've got a good list of birds under my belt 837 for southern Africa but throughout throughout my life you know it's always I've always been really keen on introducing people to birds and showing people knew things about birds and hence then burning with Aldo and crewing Kruger with elder these courses that we are running and now what a wonderful opportunity with later sightings so hello to you all and so they're just again before we get going just roughly what we're gonna do today is we're gonna take three really noteworthy videos and we've got some of the content creators like Nazim this thing in and we're gonna just talk through them Undine quickly a meal as well can you just show I'll our faces on the side I'm not sure if you can do that because a lot of Facebook and YouTube are just seeing the screen like kind of just the the sure limitation um there we go it should be pinning all those webcam now do you see that let's see yes okay I can sit I go perfect okay so remember it's it's an interactive thing normally our crosses are about maximum 15 screens it's really awesome to have so many screens but the point is if you have a question for older lit let's put him on the spot and ask him a question or two and use the chat box to to ask anything so let's go let's watch this first video it's a pretty epic life-and-death battle between two birds Nadav he shot this video so we received this video from a hurt young but he little he works at Sally Park which is just outside Kruger right there and so one of the people who work they actually filmed this and sent it to him to share the video with us and this video is just an amazing interaction it has over 23 million views on YouTube and it's just a crazy battle but I'm gonna let you kind of explain the rest and actually analyze you know what's going on here great let's get the video going and then I'll stop it a little bit into it so although this is a good spot right yeah I mean it's such stunning footage every time I see it I'm just blown away well little sparrow hawk tackling a Jacobin cuckoo and to thee a life-and-death struggle well for the Jacobin yeah there it is now although if people are looking up in their books a little Sparrowhawk it's gonna look a little bit like the pic on the right let's just come up quite different to the pic in this video you know these the identification of these these small occipital as they call the sparrow walks and goshawk s-- is difficult and on top of adult plumage as you see on the right you've got juvenile plumage --is included in that variation so it's tough and that's one of the things we teach in birding with alder and Kruger with all the processes for identifying birds but here we're looking at those lotsa teardrops on the front the greenish yellow sere which is the the soft skin behind the beat and pale eyes these are great characters for identifying a little sparrow hawk okay great and then when it comes to the Jacobin any other species of cuckoo that are similar in the kruger yes you know Krueger's great place for cookies and Jacobin there is a similar cuckoo called the violence or striped cuckoo which is rather more heavily well it is heavily streaked on the on the breast compared to Jacobin which can have a few fine streaks and Jacobin by the way also comes in an all-black form but always there is that white patch in the wing that you can see well the birds struggling on the ground there as well as the still image its watch a little bit more and as we watch is this normal behavior for a sparrow hawk I well yeah I mean they they kill birds the the remarkable thing here though is that that cuckoo may weigh exactly the same as that little sparrow hawk so it is attacking something right at the extreme edge of the normal range of its prey they would normally be going for bubbles and and smaller birds than that so that cookie is probably verging on 80 grams and the little sparrow hawk you know it's a juvenile bird it could even be less than that but it's gonna be 80 or 90 grams so they're more or less the same weight it's remarkable it's a crazy battle and now we've paused it here the the sparrow ox actually starting to pluck at the the Jacobin yeah the sparrow hoops you know after they've killed a bird they will they will pluck it so that they can eat the flesh so this now is plucking before the way before the bird is dead and I'll put it down to one or two things it's either so stimulated and agitated by this battle that it's it's lost track of of events or or else this is another function of it being a juvenile that you know it hasn't got its sequence and timing right predators take time to learn their trade and I think this juvenile hasn't got there yet look at that battle there so all the cookies get a pretty bad reputation if you look at the video that was person latest sightings of this actual video people are saying look you got what it's what it deserves why is that this all refers to the fact that cuckoos are on this parasite in other words they lay their eggs and other birds nest and then their hosts birds as they call will raise the cuckoo chicks so they outsourcing the raising of their chicks to another species which is quite a remarkable thing really but one interesting thing here is that you know the Jacobin cuckoo does not parasitize sparrowhawks they normally use bubbles as their hosts in effect I don't know of any cuckoo that parasitizes a Raptor anyway and so also with this being a juvenile bird there is certainly nothing around the fact that this bird is a cuckoo that has led to the little sparrow hawk attacking it so as the video says now moments after the cameras stopped rolling the cuckoo flew to safety that's good news for the cuckoo but was it unexpected yeah well you know my take on this is that this is all one real big mistake on the part of this little sparrow hawk it's a juvenile bird and I think it's taken something far too big clearly you can see all this protracted struggle it didn't have a really killing grip on the bird and in fact being dragged around like that means that that little sparrow hawk was at risk of injury itself now you think you know finely-honed flying bird you can damage something in a struggle like that and that can be the end of your life as a predator so I think this is a mistake and the fact that this bird the cuckoo got away is is further evidence of that I think that's it I think the little sparrow hawk has learnt a serious lesson today and on this day rather and would downgrade its expectations to something a more appropriate and size very good point so he probably learnt from from this encounter I just wanted to say so so you mentioned right at the beginning it is difficult to identify birds especially if it's a juvenile or if it's busy changing its molt how do the courses that we've developed help someone to improve in their birding well you know email people are faced with a book with so much so many images and in stuff so it's overwhelming in the beginning so what we do in our courses is in the process of teaching people how to take a mental snapshot by focusing on different areas of the bird and remembering key areas we then make people familiar with the book and with different groups of birds what to look for and when and this kind of background knowledge is enormous ly helpful for people who trying to get into this burning business when you faced with this huge diversity in the beginning so we try and make it a happy smooth process becoming a birder and it's been fun hosting them that's for sure yeah any questions from from YouTube or Facebook cool so on Facebook and YouTube everyone's just amazed by the video so we got one comment from Forex gold he's just saying he's not a birder but this is just so fascinating to him but we did get a question from mrs. Lapwing she she basically asked what's the size difference and I think you did on say in terms of weight and but this is a juvenile obviously so when it when it's not a juvenile is there mass the size difference between these two votes okay it's where most flying birds when they leave the nest are pretty close to adult size they in the case of something like a raptor they might be say 10% lighter is a real rough rule of thumb but so it could be as I said that in terms of body weights I'm guessing that that Sparrowhawk is just a few grams heavier at 85 possibly 90 grams versus the Cuckoo's 75 to 80 grams something like that oh cool and then I had a question just for me watching this video you know you could see the the D feathering in the middle like does that it can that affect the fly to does that like does the bird losing all its feathers does it like hinder it at all that's that's it that's a great question now you would have seen where the feathers came off they were taken off the belly and the function of feathers and that areas primarily about insulation and so it would have lost a few feathers down there it would not affect the flight at all if if the cuckoo had lost wing feathers or tail feathers then you can look at some potential serious impact on its ability to fly I would expect the cookie just to to regrow that little patch of feathers and assuming that it survived the attack all would be well okay cool so I think that's more or less all the questions for for this video on the social media platforms happy to go into the next one thanks Nate so is sorry what's the biggest bird the hawk will take that's a question from Lezyne the zoom I think you're looking at it well when I looked at when I looked at this I couldn't find any bird bigger than a Jacobin cuckoo in the list of prey items so this is it this is the record join us do these Hawks attack on ground or air and is this usual behavior they will they are they hunt in two ways so they can be ambush hunters either coming from a perch or flying through heavy cover and then snatching birds so in those situations they can kill birds on the ground or on the perch or assume they will also catch a bird just as it's taking off but it's not like a falcon where there may be a long attack in the air with you know a long approach it's it's a short shot attack which can end on the ground or or very to it sorry a question from online as well was how do you think the the star walk would have initially grabbed the cooker in this case do you think it would have been like just on the ground or like what do you think well the cookies would normally be sitting on a perch not exactly as the still image is there so they're not on the ground much at all so I'm guessing that the the cuckoo would have been sitting somewhere and then the sparrow hawk came in an ambush attack and grabbed it it seems to have caught it fairly low down on the side and you know for all the struggling in there the cuckoos seemed almost as strong at the end as it was in the beginning so I think the the Gravatt made was also substandard they've got subpar and that is also part of what I suggest is the inexperience of youth in this case of still learning its trade as a predator they're zoom good good news for you on the cuckoo it did get away successfully so all's well that ends well for the cuckoo you at least last question Jen and Nev asked with the feathers regrow on the next molt I think in circumstances like this they might grow immediately rather than awaiting a molt a little bit I'm open to to some doubt there but at the very least it would be at the next mode which assuming this was kind of middle of summer they would tend to molt run about very macho sir thanks thanks all day and then sorry locations are kind of flying in and another one was from tourists await oh I knew these birds migratory like today both of these birds in South Africa all the time or you know did they migrate yeah so the little sparrow hawk a resident but the the Jacobin cuckoos are migratory and and their populations actually that come from from from India as well as from Central East Africa now one of the populations of Jacobin cuckoo breed here the others that come from further east in fact or non breeding population really really interesting migration situation most of the cuckoos which come here to south africa in the summer breed here and most of them all of them I think are migratory or now cookies yeah I think it's right oh cool perfect so in the dev of the next video we have martial Eagle and warthog is is that now seems video yes that is the one it's amazing because so I was just on Facebook the one day scrolling through my feed and I just saw this video is incredible and I saw Nazim posted it and I just kind of asked him if we could share with our community and everyone's loved it I mean it's such an amazing siding and it's also so rare for people to be forming like a group of warthogs and stuff like that and so to actually get the the sites of the Eagle coming in and actually you know the impact is is something I've never seen before so we shared it and this video let me just check but it's it's on 17 million views so it's been seen by 17 million people around the world that's how that's how rare this is and and what's also cool is you can really hear their excitement because it's something I would react if I'd have seen something like this you know so so yeah I think that's what's special about this video and I think it's place and yeah well welcome azim especially for starting off just taking a video of a family of water you can see in this clip the the piglets are tiny watches I love that we saw a kill like we've all been all reacted like that literally you know it's it's it's exciting to see and this is such a good spot to stop and just talk about about the the eagle here although can you just help us identify a martial eagle yeah I sure know the theme fantastic footage I would have been even more excited than you I think this is a martial Eagle so this is one of the three big African Eagles weighing up to say four and a half or around four and a half kilograms for the female and the males will be maybe a kilogram less than that but if you look carefully at it you can see what and the parts with a black spotty and that separates it in particular from the black chested snake eagle which which we do in Kruger with Aldo we separate the identification of these two but one of the other things to watch for through this video or the huge feat of of this martial Eagle as it as it deals with this warthog late-- so this is this usual prey for the martial Eagle they they will normally catch prey within the range of one to five kilograms so this would be in that range I mean I'm guessing out right here that that's maybe two or three kilograms maybe even four for that little hoglet there so this would be a normal prey and Marshall Eagles characteristic characteristically will take a wide range of prey including large birds like like bustards and spur fowl and so on they also take a lot of small predators like mongooses and they've been recorded as taking jackals for example as well as things like really young father you know there's a really small buck they are capable of killing it's such a little bit further on at some point you here we go at this point here that the eagle flies off the martial eagle flies off why why do you think that is I I'm guessing and I'm happy Nazim Zia because maybe he can confirm it I'm guessing that the arrival of other vehicles here may have well scared off the of the eagle I'd love to hear from Nazim if that was the moment yeah there we go it was the arrival of other vehicles that scared off the eagle and he's not letting a gun here he comes walking back in I say he it could well be a female bird of course okay we can actually see all the vehicles that have come up in the background there so here we see the martial Eagle walking over the street over the road and we get a pretty good view of of this the side profile here how how do you these martial Eagles actually kill their prey well yeah this is this it's a nice tall short here if you see that upper picture you've also timed it very nicely there Amil look at the size of the rear Talon just to the right of the picture it is massive so the the killing takes place it can happen the impact alone may help the Eagle to develop or deliver rather a killing blow but otherwise that long tail and make you see on the back of the foot in particular can be used to to essentially strangle or penetrate some vital functions you can imagine they're telling pressing in around the heart and the arteries for example can very very quickly lead to lead to death on the on the part of the prey I mean that's amazing look at it dragging that that hog lead across the road sure and the video basically ends here with the martial Eagle under the bush why does it drag it under the bush yeah yeah it's got his beak open there I'm guessing all of this is has been pretty hard work struggling with it that were talkin and you know birds of prey cannot sweat like we do so I think I think it's panting I think it's offloading heat so it's getting into the shade to cool off you got to keep body temperature within balance so this place under in some shade thanks older so I see Jordan did although answer that question already so the question was was the kill done through suffocation okay angles do Eagles ever kill through suffocation I think it can happen in a sense you see how big that footage you can imagine that foot then grabbing a prey and crushing like the rib cage area so it would suffocate in that way rather than we tend to think of suffocation as as being around the neck as such so I think very often they may well just crush a rib cage of a small prey and in its life that way older and - Vegas hammer - the Warthog with the Eagle consume yeah as much as possible I suppose without being too facetious III really wouldn't know if there are some bits that it that it would choose not to consume would leave any any larger bones behind I think but yeah and in further on that the really good question how long will it meal like this loss the marshal I'm taking into consideration that if it's a female she could be feeding chicks yeah okay so you know just working through a few things here I'm guessing and the xeam can confirm that this is probably around November December now the Marshall Eagles breed I think it can breed any time of year but mainly in the in the winter and so if it's only feeding itself prey like this could last it days maybe three days if it's if it's got a chick to feed between you know taking some food for itself and the chick I guess that's that's a days ration more more or less there was also that question of why didn't the mother warthog come back and scare off the the martial eagle I suppose and and here this is just my feeling about this I I'm not up on on warthog behavior in any detail but it had at least three other little warthog Leslie and maybe it took a decision there I'm gonna look after the three good ones the three healthy ones here in a sense knowing that this little hook was probably already badly damaged by the attack that's that's as good as I can get and it's a geese no it's interesting one that I actually saw at the beginning of that video I didn't see the mother when the when the the the the piglets ran over the road so that would be interesting to you if you know zeinab an you know there are scenes in the in the full video I think on YouTube where like there's there's a moment where the mother and other baby warts I could actually come back and and kind of watch for a bit and they run off they don't try and stop it but they did come back there are some questions coming in on YouTube and Facebook so the one is from Maria and she asked do you do Eagles ever hunting groups ever has it ever been seen I'm not aware of Eagles I'm aware of crowned Eagles hunting in pairs and I think the same with Vera's or Black Eagles in which essentially one of the birds acts as a decoy allowing the other bird to sin she come up behind the prey and male that was that's watching one of the Eagles acting as a decoy I'm not aware ever of Eagles attacking prey together such that you would have say two Eagles on actually getting their their claws into the same prey at the same time haven't come across that at all before we move on a dev would you mind sending the chat group a link to to sign up to the course if anyone's interested in in any of our courses it's it's it's no obligation for you to sign up if you fill out the form it's just that we can send you a little bit more information about what goes on in their Kruger and the begin birding courses withhold oh cool yeah so I've send it to all the other chat rooms all over the place same thing does so I think the last important question here from Helene Mayer how can you differentiate between male and female Marshall so it's essentially size and I did come across some where someone's suggesting that the females are more heavily spotted now I can't tell you relatively whether this is heavy spotting or not I'm guessing because this is a fairly large prey item I think that it would the female essentially I think if you're very very skilled observer you will know okay this is a really big martial Eagle it's a female the the no other plumage difference other than that's forty then I could come across and also before we move on there are some other interesting questions there was one by s a wolf and and that person asked where does the marshal come from yeah marshal I presume marshal you know it relates to sort of military meaning I think relates back to that so I I assume that the name of this huge magnificent Eagle then is related to this the strong military power you know aggression kind of background in in that sense it's a very appropriate name yeah ok cool no that doesn't make sense and then another interesting question was do martial eagle usually eats on the ground or in a tree or like what would make them decide that they would they would usually try and get the prey off the ground into into a tree simply because it gets them out of the way of competition from other predators if they've got a really big prey and you could see the difficulty that martial Eagle head and crossing the road it was dragging that it might not be able to lift prey at the at the high end of the range so they would eat some and eventually take it up into a into a tree ok ok I think that's that's more or less all the questions from from YouTube and on Facebook questions on this side what we'll do is if if we've got some time it we can always just come back to them yeah I just like to say well blade Nazim very cool so we on to our last video snake eagle versus Cobra um no doubt he shot this so this video was by Katherine egg and this is actually on the s25 near crocodile bridge cuz I remember that cuz she actually posted this in real time and so people who in the area could actually gone and experience this themselves on later sightings but it's just one of those amazing amazing interactions between a bronze snake eagle and a spitting cobra and this has been seen 11 million times by people all over the nation it's crazy Beaufighter still alive you can see the excitement there I I don't blame the the guys in the car to get the name wrong they I mean he's so excited you you seeing what's going on and so they call it a puff adder but they correct themselves later on but this is a good spot older to identify the snake eagle here okay you know you know Krug is full of these big brown eagles and and they present a serious identification issue and so we deal with it in the Kruger with alder course in the case of a brown snake eagle look at the look at the legs the bear legs look at the big rounded head and those big pale steering eyes little during this this video you'll see when the bird turns to face you you get these pale steering look on the bird and a uniform color but the sort of big-headed round-eyed uniform brown and the bear legs are important because most of the Raptors that have got eagle attached to them and they're named have got feathered legs so here the brown snake eagle takes on Mozambique and spitting cobra I think we're gonna see a clip now it turns to face the camera are these snake egos immune to to the venom no they not but in a sense they are armored because if you think about the snake trying to bite an eagle it's actually the feather covering of those birds is quite tough and quite difficult to penetrate and therefore quite easily I think to deflect the fangs from a snake and secondly those those bare legs those scaled legs I think a fang there might easily be very very easily deflected one really interesting thing I did come across as a mention that rehabilitation organ organization sometimes get landed snake eagles so it is a Mozambique spitting cobra and so I presume from time to time these these Cobras might and it's probably going to be juvenile Birds again get a face full of spit from a cobra if they are not careful so they not immuno and do stake Eagles only eat snakes the yes essentially they are snake specialists which is quite remarkable if you think of how seldom we see snakes and yet these birds are probably killing essentially you know a snake a day or every two days and if they raising youngsters to adults would deliver say up to three snakes a day so they will also get bring in some lizards and very occasionally you know a rodent or something like that but they specialize on snakes and have a look I'm not sure if we get a chance but I was talking about how big the talons who are on the martial eagle look how small relatively speaking the talons are on this brown snake eagle and that is because they have to grab relatively you know small narrow-body prey so they have to have a tight grip with very sharp talons we have a oh yeah I actually missed this shot but I'll bring it up in a in a screengrab here's a nice screen grab of the undoing yeah so Emil if you can just point out the secondary feathers there with your cursor so the secondary feathers are the inside feathers of the wing so you can see the cursor on the screen there and you can see those silvery feathers now both the secondary feathers which are the flight feathers closest to the body and then the primary feathers which are the big feathers furthest away from the body on the wing they silvery in color and that really helps to identify the brown snake Edelen in flight so that's a a brilliant view of that ID character it's an important one for the species so man yo asked a good question older what is the normal attack mode of the snake eagle they would normally so they are perch hunted still hunters mainly not entirely so they're sitting on a hard point looking watching for snakes they were then flying and hit the snake hard and try and break its back they would take off the head or bite behind the head ideally and do it in that way I have to assume in this case that either that first attack failed I mean that's a big snake it softer it's a really big snake or it just saw the snake on the ground and and flew in to try and have a go at it again maybe vehicles being there scared it off but I don't see any chance of that brown snake evil well I shouldn't say any chance but it would be really difficult for it to kill the Cobra from from the situation which had developed here Alethea Diedrichs does that answer your question as well we could wait for it to respond and then answer at least are there we go yes thanks Lisa Haller are they resident or migratory brown snake Eagles resident node of any questions from the web yeah so there is one question of the yellow eyes is that something that's special to the brown snake eagle or like walking to us about the yellow eyes that it has look the number of of the Eagles have pale eyes a lot of them tend to have dark eyes so it's that character in combination with with others that are key for identification here in terms of functionality and so and I can't really comment on that about a paler versus a dark eye a lot of the Raptors will change from dark eyes and juvenile to to pale eyes him in there in the adult okay and then we have a question from Nick Mateos he asked to the state like when the snake Eagles catch a snake do they either do they eat it like instantly all the time or do they ever like store it for later they they will swallow sorry I've just seen that the Sun shines reflecting onto my face I'm just gonna move over here they they will swallow they will swallow it and in fact apparently if it's a big snake sometimes they'll regurgitate it back up again and swallow again until it's it's sitting nicely so essentially they they will essentially try and take everything in at once they've probably got a massive crop as well in other words a holding area if you like just below the beak to help them take in a really large amount of prey they taking it back to the nest they will then regurgitate the whole snake there and the youngster can then pile in and eat it Morde it's at its leisure okay cool there's quite a few more questions that have come in Jay Dean asks do they go for all sort of snow all sorts of snakes or do they kind of have a favorite they I think they'll take anything they get but in looking at the lists of prey quite often it's it's big venomous snakes and I don't know I don't know that they selecting venomous snakes other than so it's spitting cobras they eat a lot puff adders and in fact the biggest snake that I could find on record for this was a two point seven meter black mamba if you're going to take on a dangerous like I reckon at 2.7 meter black mom is as tough as it gets so but they'll eat anything okay another question on from Facebook from Melissa she asked us does this eagle have like a protective eyelid in case like venom from the spitting cobra actually hits it yeah that's a good one now all birds have got a protective Island it's called a nictitating membrane so unlike ourselves as mammals it's like having a another eyelid which is transparent and I presume that if that so occasionally when you're looking at birds you'll sometimes see they've got like white across the eye and that'll be that membrane which has covered the eye and if by chance the Cobra spat at that point and and it hit the outside of the membrane I presume it's going to help protect the eye but it's not there specifically - it hasn't evolved specifically for snake eagles as a protection okay another question is from Andrew on YouTube he asked if there's any record of a snake eagle being constricted by Python not by Python but snake Eagles have got into trouble with big snakes other big snakes I may have to go back on on that and I think I think the shorter answer is yes they are records of snake eagles getting into serious trouble I would have to look again and see if it nedeth I'm just scraping my memory here I think it can I think it has been recorded as leading to the death of both of the participants in this and tires so yeah being a predator is dangerous sorry yeah we've still got two questions from zoom firstly how do you the stake eagle survive in winter when there are snakes when the snakes are hibernating that's from Ellen Bamberger yeah that's a that's a good read and I think part of the answer to that is they they're actually living mainly in the in the hot hot earth lowland areas in in which even in winter there's a little bit of snake activity and perhaps at that time of year in particular they are well also I'm guessing that that's when they would be available to take just about anything there is of course less cover in winter so although the snakes are less active what is active is going to be more visible they breed in summer which which is also sort of evidence of the snakes being more available in in greater numbers and summer good question that one you know very well then the last question from zooms Jenna Neve asked once they have swallowed the snake does the poison and Jess had not affect them apparently they will decapitate the the poisonous snakes or all snakes as a rule the short answer is I'm clearly if you ingest poison it's the different way of venom of the venom getting into you versus being injected through your your vena system and in May that is also part of the answer clearly if brown snake eagles were very very or yes like eagles were very susceptible to poison I think they'd be they would have evolved into extinction by now okay I've got an interesting question from from YouTube which I never thought of is why don't these Eagles just take the snake fly up into the air and just drop it from very high life with that with that hurt the snake yeah yeah it would but I think the short catch is when you grab it the first time that's when you kill it so if you come in hard hit the snake hard break its back then it's dead remember that what we are looking at here is an unsuccessful attack normally it would come in and essentially kill or really damage the snake on the first strike so there is no need to take it up and and and drop it again okay another interesting question was you you mentioned that an eagle as eaten a two point seven meters Amanda how would it be able to eat that and then fly away would it not be too heavy that's from Parker on YouTube yeah it did occur to me as well so I actually don't know how they do it you know I do know actually at times they will actually carry a snake in their claws so it may well have been that with a snake of that size that it was even eaten in a couple of sittings so maybe in a circumstance like that it it something different to the usual may have happened so yeah it's another good question Network very cool no there's there's so many questions here another one do they ever hunt at night Eagles or any birds of prey well the elves of course but the the others rely on on superb eyesight first and foremost and when it comes to killing at speed in in Stoops and attacks it's all about the visual sense and good eyesight and so on okay and is any record of their success rate at hunting no that's that is a good question that and I'm guessing that it's it might even be relatively low I couldn't come across any information on how successful they are remembering they I guess they are aiming to be successful in the region of once a day and and that's it so then a kill is a fairly rare event in the course of a day just one occurrence or one every two days and yeah okay cool no so there's a lot of questions but we've kind of done with the what the video is right but everyone's saying especially on YouTube like don't end it because they have so many more questions so okay and if you have any I don't know if you have any closing words to to many people who do want to like or have other places to be at the moment and for some people just wanted to stay on for maybe another ten minutes and ask other questions the dev before before we go on with that could you just send the link again on the chats quite a few people are asking and I can't seem to copy and paste for some reason oh cool thank you yeah so you know in all those sorry yeah I just wanted to to thank everyone for joining us and and I love the questions it's really great that had some really good questions come out there it's the kind of thing that really teaches us all something watching this and trying to analyze it afterwards and understand it so thank you to all of you for your questions and happy to take more if the opportunities are there oh cool so I'll start off with another question from mrs. Lapwing on YouTube she asks are any of the birds that we've seen today on the endangered list very much the martial Eagle in particular so in the modern world the big birds of prey at risk and the martial Eagle is classic because it will kill for example domestic chickens as well as other small domestic stock animals and so on so in the early days and even today it would be hunted by killed by people to protect you know their domestic stock and so on they will be vulnerable to poisoning so cruder is really important as a refuge it is the primary refuge of martial Eagle in South Africa and is maybe there's guests to be somewhere a hundred hundred and fifty pairs of them there it's critically important to them it's one of the great sightings to have on a on a on a Kruger trip brown snake Eagles are less under threat little sparrow hawks have adapted to urban situations so certainly we are lived in in westphall in Durban at one stage we had a little sparrow hawk that would come into the garden there jacobins are widely distributed so the Marshall Eagles are one that's really a threat okay perfect I'm just reading through some other questions on oh that's what you do that I'll ask some questions on this side one parlance do they threaten these big birds yes you they do and it's you know a lot of people I think are all quite surprised that power lines can actually kill the large birds of prey as much as they do because you know we all know that these large birds of prey and vultures and so have got magnificent eyesight so I think the answer to that is how often do aircraft fly into into power lines even though they are pylons and things around and it's it's a matter of where you are focusing and looking and if you're traveling at speed I think it's quite easy for a bird of prey and again younger birds possibly in particular at risk to to hit power lines one one bad blow to a wing and you've broken a broken a wing bone and that's it it's curtains curtains for the birds so nowadays Escom tend to put up markers on in areas where there are frequent bird strikes but obviously it remains a threat to birds to these large birds okay there's another question here about poaching of birds is that a big issue and does that happen I know it vultures it does but Eagles and and other types of birds I'm aware of the the vultures in particular being a target for traditional medicine because vultures are supposed to have the gift of foresight you know to being able to see into the future there is also when people are poaching mammals in reserves they are aware that the circling of vultures in a particular place can give a clue to the fact that these poachers poaching going on because it alerts the Rangers and so on to the presence of dead animals and places and they can be deliberate poisoning of vultures to kill them so they cannot actually alert the ranging staff other other birds of prey may be poisoned deliberately and and accidentally so accidentally people may be trying to poison other predators and and some of the well vultures in particular but other birds of prey like better layers for example scavenge kills and therefore they will be vulnerable to picking up poison baits the other accidental places that if if people are poisoning rodents for example and there's a lot of dead rodents around the Raptors can eat those and build up a huge load of poison so so poaching is is coming back to the question of poaching I'm not sure if if I have answered that in in in the right way people are not really killing these Eagles for food it's it's normally then as a result of the kind of things that I've mentioned poison is a huge issue so I've got you mentioned a battler there which is I want to bring up a story that I had and I was told and maybe you could confirm it but as in the as in the the Kruger once and I saw a battler and a tawny eagle and a tree together see next to each other and I was with a guide his name is Mark wayna I don't know who used to be on the last safaris as well anyway he mentioned that bachelors and tawny Eagles are one of the lowest flying Eagles I think it's because they have like thicker feathers or some rock that makes them heavier so they're usually the first ones to spot a kill and he kind of said the fact that they were both sitting next to each other in a tree meant that if they had spotted something that whatever they spotted is probably still on the kill and we actually scanned around and we found a leopard on a kill and we only started because of the bachelor and the tawny eagle so this learn to know is is that is that a true fact that that those are usually like the first few birds of prey or that that spot a carcass well I remember once being in a scientific meeting and somebody wanted to see which of the vultures were first to come to two dead animals and and experimenting by putting out bits of dinner animals basically and they found that usually the first vulture was a battler of course it's not a vulture but they were the ones that that first came to the prey so I think the issue of them flying lower because they heavy they've got heavy feathers well that's that sounds like a load of bollocks basically I think feathers are feathers they the same way doesn't matter what kind of bird they are but I've really interesting the comments about them being low flying and the first two two kills and I think that's exactly right that they are specialized in in scavenging - that kills 20 Eagles secondarily battlers as a major source of food so they want to be lower down to pick up the smaller caucuses and things lying around so that's an interesting one that yeah okay cool another question was how far can these Eagles spot prey from well okay I've passed a mention more than once of someone who who spotted a martial eagle coming into a prey from from I think it was two or three kilometers away that it was able to pick up something and come in and detect that now it's going to vary obviously with the size and conspicuousness of the prey but I think the bottom line is they've got fantastic vision it's it's how they make their living so they have been selected for fabulous eyesight and getting it it right so I think we have to think in terms of being a great deal better than our own eyesight okay cool so I think that's kind of it there's a lot more questions but kind of time is run up we've had an hour I think it's been an amazing I've learned to lie to her first me and and and also just looking through the comments on YouTube and Facebook some actually have done your course and they all said like how much they've learned and how much they were able to take away from it and how they've enjoyed this as well and I think it's been really cool it's great bit of thank you for that thank you very much for the opportunity on the zoom side the chat also there's a few questions we haven't answered but maybe we should do this again there definitely I think there's so many so many different birds that you can we can analyze and I know we focused more on the reactors now and the Eagles now but yeah I think there's so many different courses and I think that's also what you what you deal with in your course I think the Kruger one you you you look at 80 different species for Kruger alone so so there's a lot there's a lot to learn there yeah great thanks and thank you everyone that listened in it that's you know a real pleasure yeah thank you to everyone who came in it's been brilliant perfect thanks again and good luck everyone thanks Ned and so we hope to see some of you guys on a and of course very soon Cheers bye bye
