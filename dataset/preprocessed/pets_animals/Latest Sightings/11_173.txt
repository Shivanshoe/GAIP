okay so we're still with the pack and it looks like the whole pack has been reunited oh elephants these elephants and the dogs together now this could get really exciting look at that elephant and the wild dogs i'm gonna try get in behind there you gotta be very careful with this situation huh we've seen these enemies really chase wild dogs before let's get into spot there we go here it comes look at that look at that isn't that amazing [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] they're from there ran into someone's love on vault's nest they're now heading towards central probably 100 meters from the junction i'm stuck behind andrew copy thanks sam did you copy that standby in central about 100 meters to the east of the junction with vulture's nest i'm just stuck with the eddies of planets i have the global chest on my dash so wasn't that exciting guys look how those elephants corralled now they're a bit upset so i'm obviously not going to try to sneak past them as such i'm hoping sam can get to the other side oh they're the dogs behind the elephants eddies don't even know what's going on uh there's my dutch have headed back uh towards twin dams in this mokule between vultures nest and the mawati a bit further further north um probably closer to quarantine edge from the direction they're heading okay so we've got a mexican standoff here one that i don't think i'm going to win now those eddies are already upset and sometimes they can sort of misplace aggression on to the next closest thing which would be us that's why we staying our distance a little bit wasn't amazing to watch how those elephants immediately sort of chased and the baby charged with the rest of the herd but then afterwards they corralled and made the sort of protective circle around the babies even though wild dogs don't actually really show any um potential threat to to to the elephants i mean i've never heard of a wild dog attacking a baby elephant or anything but elephants just react really negatively to any predator so i've told james where i think those wild dogs are going to pop out and i'm not going to take any chances with a herd that's just been upset like that i'm going to go around the long way unfortunately it does mean there's a possibility we won't find those wild bugs again but that was incredible that was so amazing watching that so hopefully
