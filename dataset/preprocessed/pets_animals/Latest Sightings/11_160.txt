like he's going live effects I don't know if we live already botany Yong Kim messaging so I could be looking down into my left apologies okay Nadav sees we alive okay right so I'll come tomorrow male on what's turned out to be quite a cloudy afternoon it was quite sunny this morning and we are currently looking at the Campbell a pride which are center of frame as you can see they're all lying in a big pile and we're hoping because it's quite cool yet that they may get active soon so today we have Nick driving us and this is a couple of Gauri males in the background there and then there's Mike on the comments again come back so I'm gonna get us set up and just part in the wobble for a little bit and then you can get going just let me know if you have audio doing this thing again [Music] all right from India Brazil thank you for that Adam Kennedy says thanks to dev yeah I'm just gonna get the horizon nice and able at the back me the national champs is that we do have audio I can hear us loud and clear thank you welcome back Eve McCaffrey hello to starlings regular view and giraffe go as well teaching in 30 minutes does the 1369 hello from Vancouver Raj M from New Jersey USA welcome all Germany Australia Las Vegas Tennessee Arkansas Michael from pella boy Akshay nee Arizona Chicago Saudi Arabia welcome back to Christine hello to Capetown are watching on your televisions you may not be seeing the comments so whilst we are live-streaming these lines mark is on YouTube on his phone and he can see the comments I don't know if there's a way for those of you who can't see comments to see comments maybe someone a lot they can help us or instruct for those of you who want to see the comments exactly what they need to do they need to hit the chats button so a live chat button okay on the phone anyway I'm not sure about on a computer but I'm guessing it'll be very similar another half from Cape Town Mumbai Mauritius Texas Kristine asking did they catch another meal last night so not that we know of oh no and apologize yesterday we found them near at rice camp in the morning and then in the evening when we went to go find them again we could not find them at all and they were found this morning by Gareth and yaku G Netanyahu for those of you that watch our YouTube channel the Mala Mala youtube channel they found them as well as the occipital male leopard in this similar area so we don't know if they did catch anything last night doesn't really look like it or if they're caught something it wasn't anything particularly big so hopefully they get hungry early it's also clouding over quite a lot and cooling down very quickly I'm sure if you look carefully you can see the wind blowing all the leaves around them so we hoping they wake up a lot earlier than normal just gonna zoom in a bit back shadow locks from jo'burg come by Kuwait Arizona Florida England so Haley's asking other guy emails they said they are they are just on the opposite side so on the your screen it will look like there on the right hand side will flip over to them in a minute but they're lying in the grass as well a little bit harder to see them and the house it from Devon how's it yeah Eva can feel asking for their hand every day so they'll certainly try whether they're successful or not is another thing but a big pride like this is 20 in the pride as well as the two miles is 22 so they kind of have to hunt every day to feed that many lions welcome back Angus Tina saying we have a similar weather here in Ontario Canada guessing yours it might look the same but be significantly colder than what we've got yeah yeah that's maybe 20 years degrees at the moment you on trade we're not sure if they did or didn't catch anything yesterday they didn't that we're aware of they're not looking particularly hungry but it's possible that they did catch something last night but not just next to them about 10 yards away when they start moving around a bit more we'll put the camera on them or the phone on them should I say flex and maybe I think we'll do that you'll just wait for a few more people to enter the chat room so if you want to take Street screenshots and share it with your friends and just let them know we are going live please feel free to do so once you've got a few more people in the chat room then I think I'll just briefly show the gauri males cuz they are lying in some long grass and we've got the camera nice and stable so I don't wanna be picking it up too many times but we will show you in a moment not really Buffalo but in this part of the reserve where we are there's lots of zebra giraffe and vole the biot-savart and hordes and hordes of impala only any injuries among surprise none that we're aware of the men that are severe but with lions is always a few cuts and scrapes and bruises amongst them Thank You Kristine and Hayley sharing it on their groups we appreciate that and Liam Julianne Scott saying Liam her son loves watching this from mid-stream estates Liam I'm very happy that you enjoy watching these lions where do they sleep when it's raining they just sleep where they are elf but I'd really have too much of a choice if anything they'll go under a tree you into a thicket and but now that I'd really have anywhere to go this he gets plenty of screenshots you also screenshot gas fast when he switches the camera I do want to tell you what happens is when I try and zoom in I accidentally click a button that doesn't show on the screen and then it flicks the camera around it's an honest mistake see take asking would any animal be on the menu if they're really starving so I suppose that yes but also some things much like ourselves or particularly with people and vehicles that done actually CSS food so if they're not used to hunting a particular eating a particular thing they might not realize that it's actually meal worthy which is very comforting when you're sitting in the vehicles next to 20-odd lines so does he not asking do lions actually live in and if not waited does he when Lions have cabs when they are young so with most predators and the babies are born relatively underdeveloped compared to the prey species and you know things like in parlors and Valle de beers and zebras they hit the ground just about running it doesn't take long for them to get onto their legs up and standing and they can run within in the first few hours just so that if they are any predators around they can get away it's completely different with predators and a lot of these female predators actually hold quite large litters which is also quite different from prey species which usually give birth to one car forlán and you know expect about wild dogs the other day and I think the record is twenty-one or twenty-two peps and you can imagine with 21 or 22 pups in your belly and you're gonna get heavy and it'll be more difficult for hunt and do you have to end a lot of me and it's the same with lions and the Cubs are born relatively underdeveloped they're born with their eyes closed they a little bit useless they can't really walk around much and and they are deigned at that age effectively mum will find a thicket or a pile of boulders big in this area we've got a lot of granite rocks yeah and she may leave the Cubs in an area where they can get away from other predators and it might be a little crack between two different rocks so in a dense bit of reeds when a thick bush in a gully and just so that they can hide away first of all and potentially even get away within a hole or crevice and that's where the term den site comes from it they don't den in the same area for very long it could be a couple of weeks or a week it depends on if other predators have been in the area and well maybe the den site gets infested with parasites or and very often in this area they the Lions like to dine in the river itself so maybe the river comes up and then they decide to move in sites that can happen quite frequently until the young cubs are old enough to walk with the pride so it's a long answer so just to go through clear the questions that came through Frances Hong so welcome from Taiwan they are some three there are three ten month old cubs here hopefully if I move around you'll see them the one closest to the camera is a bottom right of the screen that's a cub the ten month old one and yes he's all the Gargamel's hello to the UAE Mala Mala we are next to the Kruger National Park there's no fence between us and them Alex but it's very close and hello to Robin Sewell and her parents watching from PE ba the sea [Music] yes I think we're going to just show you the Gauri mails quickly I see someone who's also asking who's driving today and so we may as well kill birds two birds with one stone there okay so please Nick Mel is driving and is the guy emails behind him and then of course you got grease on the comment I'm sorry yes Mike on the comments game Thank You Jay myself Gareth handling the camera okay keep it on the camp on the project because they're a little bit easier to see and they haven't been a little bit more active than these two Gauri males welcome back to miss and am Andrus and asked me and I from Singapore in the knit lane and yeah an itchy can't comment on our YouTube page lot welcome back so dizzy to answer your question so the dev who is the one on the Krueger sightings comments that come up here from time to Sun so it's his channel and he's very kindly allowed us to use his channel as a platform for us to show you these animals and that's a Mala Mala we have our own YouTube channel but we don't live stream and we certainly don't have anywhere near the audience that the dev has criticized things has so we've just been working together with them and you can see if you've been following our quick ears to put in all the links and everything to things that we mentioned like our game reports and videos and so on so thank you to the dev for that bad yeah so even though Mala Mala is its own private game reserve we are next door to the Kruger Park and actually part of what's considered the great or the greater Kruger Park at other Kruger National Park is closed to visitors at the moment so there is is no-one really driving around there even there and staff are fairly limited depending on their positions and welcome back to mrs. lapping question the affero can kill an adult lion so I'm pretty sure they could it wouldn't be a particularly quick or Pleasant death it might take a few days but it's yeah it's not impossible there are fairly poisonous snakes and also a venomous snake should I say and it also depends on how much of the dose they were to give the line how healthy was but are these two gary males the fathers of all the cubs you can see their brother was in fact killed by a snake so it has happened we're not sure what species of snake it was cabinda saying if you could have a reserve the size of the country what would that be like so the greater Kruger National Park you can fit Belgium inside is about the same size so even though I wouldn't say there's human interference there are human people or humans inside it that the animals kind of just do what they do but would be quite interesting to know if there was a big difference or somehow doubt they would be and Augustina what is a cost of one of that I'm presuming you mean a trip to South Africa so if you're going to have speech Kruger sightings he does actually have all the links and that there for you so you can actually just go to his page and have a look otherwise you can just look up Mala Mala zine web page and have a look what it costs force here specifically even though the DAF does a town have have that on Kruger sightings to which brother was killed by the snake I have no idea so that Mala Mala we refer to them as the gari males we don't really name them as individuals and it didn't happen here it happened on another reserve so we also heard secondhand about it so it's more hearsay but I've I've heard it from multiple sources so I'm assuming it's true is there a hierarchy between the females not really if we haven't really or ever noticed anything some lionesses I'll just begin a bit more aggressive so they tend to dominate that kills but they do seem to kind of move and hunt together more by consensus in anything there's no clear leader like you would see with say a clan of hyena or a pack of kept hunting dogs let's neck attack that probably let me lay in the middle with them so snack attack I think your name would become wildly appropriate if you were to lay in the middle of them there would be some snacking and certainly some attacking going on and Adam booth to answer your question what do you think triggers them to stop snoozing and start hunting so it is getting cooler now you can actually see them all sunny to stretch and move about a little bit and so it getting cooler certainly hunger does pay wrong also if they were to hear something and if they smelled or heard a big herd of buffalo moving through the area that would definitely wake them up or heard some alarm calls close spot how far away were they from yesterday yeah so I'm guessing seven kilometers or so and they were close to retros camp yesterday and then we are about maybe two kilometers east of Mala Mala main camp now but where they moved and how what route they took to get you will never know they covered quite a bit of ground last night I think lions are the only kings he did not live in luxury from ask me so it's actually probably right how many are there and how's it - Jacques priest so how many are they handily this prod is 20 in the prod so the six adult lionesses they're 14 Cubs and then there's the - Gary males or normally with them so there's quite a quite a big pradhan unusually large pride Yussef is it is almost impossible to see a kill laughs it does happen here sometimes but you're really it has to be right place at the right time so on average I'd say they might make a kill every two days and the actual the stalk and that can take a long time but the actual pounce and kill can sometimes be thirty seconds so you need to be there for the right 30 seconds in that 48 hour period but you know I think for those of you that have been following our channel we've been putting up some flash back so we might actually include some of the kills and our flash backs that we have been able to see that we you all said I want this to become a wildly violent Channel the kills are pretty spectacular how long would they move in this constellation constellation of Leo I'm assuming and so probably once these Cubs get a bit older what will happen as the young males will disperse and head off as a group and the some of the lionesses might say with the pride but it's probable that some of these youngsters are gonna have to move off and form their own prides eventually so I've got a bit behind with the comments yeah all questions sweetie so we yes we do work with a lot of students yeah we actually have the University of Santa Barbara that does a lot of our grassland research and some of our own Rangers G nut in particular you'll recognize from our YouTube channel he works yeah but he's there's quite a lot of research and we have also another student Priscilla who's on leave at the moment but she also is working through a scholarship program here at Mala Mala all the males brothers yes they are Chad they were father them originated down to you just the two you know Christine we haven't seen them monthly or Salafi Malin cab but if I'm not wrong people put a video of them on our channel to knock perhaps or tomorrow morning that we formed of them day before yesterday alright and then shame we really really hope that we do see here at the end of August and you get some mass taste of what you can expect and kiss violence it is hillock but yes we do have a very good life welcome around saying hi to Uncle Mike any of you have seen our YouTube channel in the last few days or Instagram page there was quite a lot of excitement around some of the camera traps that G not set up in Clarendon in the northeastern part of the property run did you see our latest heat I think was the latest one but the YouTube video before the latest one and I'll carry on to this conversation once you've replied I think that I reason run has set a low here so they can give them props for finding that odd wolf long before anyway that's it okay so if any of you have seen our camera the the video on YouTube roan claimed that he saw art art forth checks at the Clarendon probably about six months ago a very long time ago and you know we barely ever see our fourth year so obviously everybody is skeptical and was putting in their two cents and but yeah Ryan was indeed correct they have been artful for at least one artful wandering around Clarendon open area and G not got footage of that on our camera trap and just hi to the rims - Alex and Ethan my niece and nephew it's always nice to see you in my sister purse that they're watching and hi to all the family back home and the dance saying there is some grooming at the back this yes we really hoping folks that we get to see some activity with the Lions we are quite fortunate towards the end of our previous last stream they got after and at least moved around a bit had a drink at the river but we'll be ready actually show you like some activity yeah so you got to caught amusing comment CMS and nom-a-nom and trend say how do you send a man dress and a man dress says she'll be back in five minutes alerts genius saying hi girl sorry I'm late today Lawrence is one of the first two ways comment on our YouTube videos that's where you come into the face the other night learns and I think you only came in third on the artful fun but well done for getting in the top three and Fernanda saying is the son of tenure in the prod and so there's almost certainly sons of both of these males even though one marked mate for a day or two they normally tap out and then the other brother will take over for them it's not really relevant who the father is because they're all sharing the same genes as well as the lionesses they raise their cubs as a collective so they don't really worry too much about whose Cubs are whose oh you know it would be impossible to look at that pile of lions now and discern which cap belongs to which lioness and it doesn't really matter to them because all the Cubs will be able to nurse from any that's got smoke and they'll also if they do make a kill they can all feed on the same kill if they strong enough gene saying ice from Caesarea hygiene and just a few reserves to the north of us I'm sure you're enjoying this cool weather that's just just kind of arrived today but I think this cloud that's covering us is just about to reach you I can see that the end of it Lisa Reeves the fins asking does a reserve have a fence at the border and no it doesn't so the animals can walk in an art of Mala Mala at will and they go into the Kruger National Park sabi sands I might even go there's a gene at that class eerie the male's that are here from that area and but on the very very boundary of the reserve separating the game reserves from the sort of rural areas there is a fence there and that's actually more to stop things like domestic cows and goats and dogs and whatever else coming into the reserve and spreading disease as well as to stop obviously Lions from going in helping themselves to the odd cow goat and Henriques sent us I'm guessing you from Brazil welcome how many prods are they in Mala Mala so we think about 10-ish it's probably between 50 and 60 individual ions but from quite a few different products Freddy Torre is saying he watches all our YouTube content thanks Freddy we appreciate that saying hi from Ohio and the name of this prod of I'm hoping that's right is the kombu Laprade so the kombu Laprade six lionesses 14 cubs and then the two males so 20 and the pride plus the two males that are almost always with them kg one hi and welcome back [Music] modular where are the lions so normally what we do is ask all the Mala Mala ranges and X ranges that are unlived to try and guess where we are today would be a huge challenge I reckon but you'll see I'm gonna give them some perspective if any more ok so you can see the view in the background there and you're looking into the Sun but to answer your broader question we are on the Mala Mala Game Reserve okay so one of the one of the guy nails just looked at his head if I can get this gorilla sampling off in time maybe you'll get a view of it oh is that for a second I just lying back down but they're the two male lines behind Nick they say and the vet it is life but it is very much a repeat of the day before and it just appeared from below this cloud that's in providing the shade just saw we busy with that so welcome to Bradley plummet from Safari architects brings a lot of guests and groups here and then the males are not a threat to the Cubs at the moment but if the when these young males get to maybe another six months to a year all they're all gonna touch it chase them away if the male's themselves get ousted by new incoming lions then they actually those incoming whales will be a huge danger to their cubs yeah saying mac taught me all of my tracking skills oh I barely believe that right yeah I'm gonna say that so long until you love your job yes we do is under definitely Gillian's got the Mel's on us a five six meters but they pretty fast asleep they've moved into some shade where there are now you can see with all the cabs lying a party they don't really want to have the Cubs harassing them while they're trying to sleep and then David sure welcome back from Saskatchewan Canada did you find the Lions yesterday Lawrence jr. oh no he did not and we spend many hours looking for them yeah unfortunately we did not find them as I'm asking what do you do every day well aside from trying to find Lions to livestream we also hoping one day to find a leopard that cooperative is enough to be some way we've got cell signal then we'll be that T otherwise we often film for a YouTube channel in the morning and then edit those videos through the day and then try and find something to last stream in the evening then asleep repeat yeah as I say a few things that need to be done on the reserve that we attend to and yeah I think if you go to our YouTube channel you'll see some of the things that we do and there are a few videos sharing not just animals one the latest video that was posted was one we put out to pulled a few videos ago asking people if they prefer more animals and less people in the videos and have had quite a balanced response about it it'll be interesting to hear your opinion the last one was one of more animals than it was of a stranger's go and have a look and decide free software with the preferred just animal behavior ones or if you prefer the range is talking about what's happening in the video cows guarding a lot welcome back when was the last time they had a feed so that we are hundred percent sure was a day before yesterday we don't think they got anything last night they could have but if they did they hate it completely Cabella asking about the feline AIDS and bovine TB and the lion population in the great Kruger so I can't answer about bovine TB and I believe this I don't know about the Kruger but I believe is some areas with is as much as 90% of the Lions have frv which is a feline version of HIV but I don't think it has as better effect as it does on people but bovine tuberculosis on I was pretty widespread amongst the Buffalo as carriers so we don't really see any issues with our lions here the state which does come and have a look around the reserve about once a week she'll come and go and drive with us or go and drive with Priscilla ecology student and then they just look at and monitor what's going on here i Megan Gordon saying that they left Beth the animals and the Rangers talking I think it's yeah few people saying they enjoy the Rangers talking a few people saying that they do enjoy the animals as well we're trying to strike a balance on our YouTube channel so we are trying to get a little bit for everyone Thank You Eve saying she loves all our content we appreciate that and Gregory asking looks like a stable pradhan a threat from incoming mail so no not that we're aware of there's one of the lionesses is work enough that's always a good sign but yeah so these males actually went and chased around I think it was four young males quite far to the south of us in the sabi sands Game Reserve walled off of maula maula and I think they were just teaching those young males a lesson to not even think about coming to this territory so for those of you that have an idea you can look on Google Maps way maula maula again reserved is you'll see that we have the Sand River running right through the middle and it's pretty much the ideal territory to have so it's pretty well defended by the resident lions you hunt duplicity saying glad to hear you guys are keeping busy I'm as I still working as an essential services company we fight bush fires nationally throughout South Africa by using ground teams and aircraft yeah it's great work Johan and that can be quite intense we do fight fires here from time to time and yeah yesterday very important work and on that note to all of those nurses and doctors and clinicians out there who are on the front line of the current coronavirus epidemic just a shout-out to all of you that are really doing an amazing job getting up in the morning and going to work every day we respect what you're doing very much and Alan B StarD thank you so much for that and the switching from camera to camera is something that we really have been trying to get right so you can see there's a lot more activity with the Lions so we've been really trying with the video editing and that T up our game a little bit so there's a lot more people watching now that we really want to keep informed and entertained at the same time and and Owens thanks guys for my entertainment Sarah finally rebooked my data to mana mana from the canceled last week of March thank you and we're very glad that you rebooked and we look forward to seeing you Robin so are we new five breaks off of Fred's trees so Robin you are in the region I want to say Robins very good at this game sure I want to say you up by 200 all actually I suppose you could approach from that side I suppose you trended meters are Tisch they are amazingly close any Leopard yes they are hordes of leopards at mala mana in fact this morning when these lions were found and whilst the Yaqui and Gina too busy filming then they happened to see the occipital male walk by and they just had a two-minute sighting of him in quedan filming the Lions it'll be nice to be popped out now and most image hated thank you very much for that glad you appreciate us and our content you really do enjoy doing it as well and yes like so some of you have noticed they are getting active so the lionesses when they get active those are the real ones that get things going so them yawning and stretching and grooming one another's always a very good sign como Missouri saying thank you guys must be some way from East Africa agostina so the Lions get tuberculosis yes after eating buffalo and particularly the Lang's of the Buffalo where all those little nodules are and unfortunately often the male lions because they get the proverbial lion's share of those kills so they get the kind of bulk dose when they eat the internal organs of those Buffalo and welcome back to pan Hudson so we are with the Khumbu Laprade fortunately then an area with really good cellphone signal and some way we could actually find them today which is which is great evil arm calling I think that you referring to was a Franklin calling in the background I wasn't quite paying attention but that's any other noisy thing I've heard Maggie and Gordon asking if you have any idea in the park will be reopened we have no idea we're gonna have to wait until we go watch our president decide I believe he's having a chat with us - not a date so then we'll probably have a better idea pull a little bit over from Canada how are you doing from Uganda become or just looking at your surname thinking that sounds very East African Tyson F Lawrence jr. asking if there any teacher at Mala Mala there are Lawrence we don't see them as often as you do lions or lipids and they do come under the property from time to time and we do view them but they're not as stable sightings as lions and leopards are yeah the habitat yeah is a little bit more suited to lipids with a thicker Bush and to the way Lions hunt and that cheetahs prefer a little bit more open woodland because they rely on their speed to hunt whereas lions and lipids rely on stalking so they like the cover of the bush so we do you see them but more in the open areas in the northeastern corner along the eastern boundaries and occasionally around by airstrip which is what right place to camp Wellman guessing planks pan so also close Jo not as close as a Robin there and but yeah I think Robin Robin could take it almost buddy you in the right region there and this is that wing or the computer lady's considered on the large side so I would say yes I quit the different line prods is a bit of variation but the yeah they certainly are sort of larger lionesses they're not I wouldn't say they're huge but they definitely tend to be on the bigger side fancy cheetah asking do we still have the cheetah brothers no I believe they moved to Manuel 80 again reserved north of us we haven't seen them for ages and I kind of miss them Thank You Christine much appreciated and I must say Christine making the videos is also keeping us saying I think the Mia Ferrara's saying she always watches the videos Thank You Mia we appreciate that so flex also if it seems like we're answering your questions a little bit out of sequence is a bit of a lag from when the what you seeing is transmitted and however it works goes to youtube and then comes back to myself and to read the comments I think there's a little bit of a delay but it's only about 20 seconds or so opinion ATZ a asking have we had in you we think the Drakensberg mountains which is in the background you can't see the see them now but I think there's a lot more rain in the foothills of the Drakensberg because our River has risen substantially over the last few days is there such thing as one pride dominating the others asks good meter all right and so this prod is a particularly big dominant pride they actually kicked out another pride that I feel pride that were dominant here for about [Music] and on Mahlum allah their territory is more less the middle half of Mala Mala when we do that video with the monthly or Salalah lioness and they can bullet prod that hopefully we'll add this evening or tomorrow you'll actually see a map of all the lion territories they that's more or less correct except for the sticks prod which have more become nomadic lions now but you'll be able to get an idea of the the territories on that but these are the most dominant dominant prod and for those of you that we're asking about leopards earlier the last few episodes we have included a few leopards and you can start to get our get to know our leopards by watching those episodes I think we've had the Piccadilly female ready then cover any female the lookout female which males that we had then rate email the cub of the or the son of the aims of Queenie female and the flat rock male just the other day say if you do want to start learning about our leopards you can go to our YouTube channel and you can find some of them over there alright an opinionated sorry [Laughter] south africa and then there was a question where how long have we been gods so Gareth when did you start man well mine's a bit broken up but I started in 2009 and I think in total mine's probably about six or seven years all right this is probably close on 30 or 40 years yeah yeah I started in 2002 end of 2002 here at Mala Mala and Nick in yourself for me it's about seven years yes paradox sort of this is the third place I've worked at now mr. Knab Andrus yes the our field prod is the spotter prod so we call them the our field prod it's actually the name of the property that they live in or lived in [Music] so we name prides after features or areas that they move around in and this is that point commenting on the sticks prod so we actually have a river sticks or sticks crossing that they are named over and now they do price of emerged no they do not they yeah yeah they'll kill each other first the question was Frank do prides you've emerged like mage like banks yeah it's a nice way of asking the question I enjoyed that which female leopard was with the Cubs today so serious I'm guessing you referring to the ones on the Krueger sightings page so that's not Jarrod Mala Mala um saw some of that video but uh I don't know we wouldn't know that leopard Christine yes we do love our jobs indeed sorry folks I'm just catching up with some of the comments coming through thick and fast yeah and miss Adam Andrus yes that is exactly like in Greek mythology the Styx crossing and am Andrus I want to say that sounds Greek as well Mia Ferrara asking I always wanted to be a ranger how did you get into this so I always wanted to do this for as long as I can remember and I was very very lucky I grew up not far from the Kruger National Park so we used to come very often and I would hassle my parents to have as many pets as I could to make sure more or less worked out for me to answer your question a bit more detail me as there are quite a few options to become a ranger but if you do you sort of google it you can go on TV for Gaza the field gods Association of South Africa's website there's plenty of training courses on offer there to at least give you an idea of how to start miss Ana Madras I think I've read one of those books I'll not have to go and reread it again so there's a couple folks asking about the male lions again so there are just sleeping in the grass I think we'll try put the camera up on there for a second but they're a lot less active in their pride is at the moment they're all in the process of waking up yeah next trying to get out the way I don't know you're trying to get out the way [Laughter] yes we do name the lipids if you go into our YouTube channel you'll see a couple of the leopards they're the lookout female in a new HTML was the last one that we put a video on and then so if you've gone to the Matamata web page you'll see the game reports that feature a lot of the leopards Kel's guarding like the best Sun to come to the park it really can be anytime most people would say winter is your best bit it's a little drier the animals a bit more concentrated around the water halls and then also the way there is a little bit more stable it's not likely to be rained out but in the summer when it is raining you get to see all the insects and migrating birds and all sorts that are back again and it just depends there's lots of big mammals or lots of life you know so there's a greater variety in the summer Lawrence the word garius is the property name to the north of us so the Lions are from that area that's where we named them from and Brian Elmer yes odd wolf it was a big tick for us as far as the nets the first one ever as history and we've got records going back to 1920 of what's being seen here [Music] it was quite a big tick for us as well mrs. laughing it is a pleasure to spend the day with you all dizzy 1369 one of the mail slip away from the wrist so you can see how the Cubs all messing around and playing and whatnot they so that's why they anxious just too much of bother Jay to cure while Jay just south of the lookout point east of rage tree it's a good guess but wrong that's wrong Robin was close I use that as your clue so you're getting colder in the other direction piñon ated so I actually haven't heard of any cases here but I also concerned that anyone is tested so it's impossible to say if is covered 19 amongst animals but I am very sure that a lot of conservation czar conservation is all very concerned I haven't heard or read anything about it but I'd guess anyone researching and conserving the primates particularly the gorillas must be hugely concerned about this being as they are so closely related to us and go cena is covered 19 we're not guarding at the moment so yes that is correct the camp is closed is just a skeleton staff yeah and and what we are doing t instead of taking our normal complement of for to or for six guests on drive we are not taking in the region of thousands of people I'm guessing on I see there's 250 folks on the chat and who knows how many more will watch us in Tom or clicking on and off but that's amazing to be able to share this with so many people all at once so you can see that one line is getting up there everyone wants to play with either I'm just gonna flop down on top of the park god squash there and opinionated now we haven't seen any cuffs or anything like that developing here fortunately my asking when they start hunting so it could be quite soon it's hard to see now but the Sun is just about to sit now we're getting close to the mountains so once it gets darker they might well get going the Dove saying the last live stream at 35,000 views so that's a phenomenal number of people that have been able to watch these lines with you and thanks to all of you that actually ask the questions and are joining in and that it is quite nice to be a bit more interactive and engaged and I also gives us something to talk about while we're waiting for the Lions to get going which will hopefully be seen yeah that's amazing to think some of these cats I know there was a very successful male leopard yeah the bicycle crossing male for those of you that ever came to Mala Mala would almost certainly have seen him fare here in the last ten years or say and I always used to wonder how many how many photographs had actually been taken of that cat I would say that if he had been found on a day they would be certainly a few thousand photographs taken of the Bosco crossing male and it's just amazing that theses I mean they're blissfully unaware of how famous they are that people are tuning in from all over the world to see the Gauri males and the Campbell Alya pride and a lot of the lipids we we are well known for leopards yeah dizzi 1369 so we're not streaming anywhere else besides Kruger sightings but we are also forming for our own Mala Mala YouTube channel so if you look at Mala Mala Game Reserve mal mal mal ama you get us there's a nightclub in Barcelona which has the same name but an entirely different vibe to what we do and bless and clear any idea where the Gargamel's are so they are to the left of us about 6 meters sorry to the right of us and then bingo just saying Abu Shan Shan welcome dingo missus Lapwing the airstrip now was my favorite lipid Sydney when I was able to see him quite a lot here I was a spoiled with sightings with him I think wasn't the a strip mill one of yeah it was a son yeah he actually looked a lot like the bicycle crossing male from the photos I've seen yeah and see asking why the bicycle crossing well lipid or why is he called that so we have a crossing right in front of Kemp called bicycle crossing and he used to live around there when he was younger so you got named for that crossing and the reason the crossing got its name is I think in the 50s or so one of our staff was on his bicycle going home through the reserve got chased up a tree by Lions just in front of the camp and they run good here I'm shouting from the camp and there's loud clicking sound going on when they went to investigate they found a staff member up the tree and the Lions playing with his bicycle just there was lying on its side and one of the lioness was finally whacking the tire with their pool making it spin around so the crossing was always called bicycle crossing after that and then you know we named the leopard in Tom because that was his area okay so they're starting to get a lot more active now we may start some of the lines I've started to slowly move off I think let's enjoy these caps playing in the frame now because that's probably the most entertaining activity right now and if we see that they start moving we all start moving with them and remember to take some screen shots now that they up and share them with your friends if they want to see some awake lions and Lisa V Robin so they answered your questions I yes they D sometimes fine catch a buffalo I'm not always successful at it but it is on the menu for them cows guarding lot any giraffe or elephants on Mala Mala yes they are it looks like the males have got their heads up now so we probably I'll show you the males in a second let's just lift these play a bit more they're gonna walk you okay now's a good time for a screen shot yeah he's a little bit stuff from that light on limping a bit so if they move in the direction that they look like they're moving in I can't see where the leading lionesses are but if they are do moving this direction that these ones are moving in we might go into a nice open area scene which will be perfect for us okay so it's gonna get a bit wobbly now cuz we are gonna be driving and I'm gonna be holding this freehand sorry folks we're just moving the vehicle our arm to this one in the who on the branch that's a good place to go so it looks like one's climbing and iran some stumps we are just gonna try and get into a good area so you can go and do that so right on that stump additive beautiful [Music] yeah there's another line ish jumping up the stunt this is great [Music] it's good okay so we're gonna I'm just gonna hold this like this looks like so I think Gareth are not gonna change comments yeah you can experience magnificent camera skills remember to keep it centered very much oh yes there you go thanks okay so effect so we would have missed some of the questions that's why we're moving around they're gonna have a look yeah I'll try to get back to them has there been any interaction between the Birmingham nails or the GAR emails and focus currently and they are the northern black males and I haven't seen interaction I don't know about you guys not that I'm or not that I've seen that's like so just on the move again it looks like that tree became not as entertaining Ivan Sewell asking guys are we northern side and Corazon and once again Robin Sewell is spot on all that if you heard that Betty you are correct we are indeed on Golden Sun good John in fact I think those lions right up here they are currently working on the ride itself we're just gonna try and make our way to that race you win one freak and delicious on gas account so effects you're just gonna move around the lines are coming out onto the road fortunately we'll get them all out in the open shortly I hope in the meantime there's a magnificent sunset for you over the Drakensberg mountains I'll hand you back to Gareth all right yeah so they're coming to this beautiful open area here and they are just on the fringes of the open area they're not racing right into the open area just yet and impalas and lots of different prey species like to come and bed down in these open areas particularly these open areas that are have a bit of innovation and they all congregate in these areas it means that there's lots of ears and eyes at night and there's far fewer bushes for the Lions to stalk them from and so these lions are closing in on an area on northern side and go bazan where the hundreds of impalas come in congregate at nights I can't see any impalas at the moment but we did hear some Nichols line does have beautiful hair that's it in the background amazing if you can and nick is also just spotted some impalas is that lioness at the head there's another Linus to the right is this a spotted as in parlours you're just gonna gonna keep a little bit quieter now well this goes on just they can use their senses a bit better and if you have a look at the cross you can see that they are downwind from the impalas impalas are a lot of frame to the right the advance to the moment but that little cap making noises there is not helping method so there was a question do they hunt into the wind so not normally but they don't get too bothered about the wind but knots perfect for them because the wind is blowing right from the Impala to them but you can see also with this grass sounds like an Impala has spotted them from behind but hopefully for them these are partners in front of them have not noticed a play so we have no idea what happened to that lion it might have been some big prey species that is tackling and Gregory yes Sammy Jane is correct the Lions the two males are between nine and ten years old and then for those of you that are helping out with the comments thanks so much so just while we've been moving and driving and trying to watch what the Lions I have to I've missed some of the comments but yeah so far a few of the folks that have answered have been bang on Maggie and Gordon any cheetah in the open area I wish I think the cheetah they are glad that they are not here missing a man was the Kampala lionesses seven years old now there are some impalas noting that sadder where they're looking at an F they've have seen these lines off they're just reading like so not to build anyone's expectations up too much but the occipital male leopard was seen in the same area this morning so it might be that the Impala seen the leopard might be distracted just translating audience again Mike yes just letting people as what I did afternoon John Tobias say in the distance is one lioness that's hugging the push line every day and probably continue eating in that direction she'll watch her sisters which is doing currently she's just keeping an eye out and all the other lines were lionesses are so she can coordinate where she walks and the idea would be that she flanks and maybe chases them into the other lions that would be waiting so if you have a look on the back of it years you can see there's some dark patches this helps them when they're coordinating their hunt from the front a lot more camouflage than they are from behind also helps youngsters like this one over here watch from behind and see how the adults end just and thank you so much - Marcos Dholavira and John T I think guys just answered your question there and Bonjour - Timothy fun fear term TV V and Michael Tilly that's just Brian Alma asking how far from the Sand River we're about two K's east of the sand river opposite Mala Mala main camp and yes they are searching for prey at the moment fear I can't go into what's up and check pictures because I'm busy on a live stream case you hadn't noticed just trying to get a little bit of perspective Christine asking how many ie Nizar out there they actually are an awful lot of hyenas here I'm guessing lioness I'm not gonna be too visible while there's this many Lions around especially with the males in the area and the Lions are definitely on the hunt folks so we can also I'm just trying to zoom into the in Kiev into a little bit as well while they're doing their thing so to just give you an idea the Lions are all moving in a parallel line and the Impala about 200 meters in front of them just on the edge of the trees that you might be able to see there but each line a sauna says about 30 meters from your sister so she has one on either side of her and they're all moving in one long straight line probably someone gonna try and flank around do the classic pincer movement to attack unfortunately all the Cubs are also pouring into the open area so having 14 Cubs coming as observers and trying to get the grandstand view is not gonna help things necessarily I see one of these lead lionesses just stretching me and she hasn't lost interest but they are lionesses in the distance that are flanking you can see one in the distance over the center of a frame now it's the more pale and that's been mating with the Gauri male one of the guy males is actually a second line is behind it they are still very far off from these impalas ively get to see then at least run in before it gets too dark yeah you know I'm just gonna try and zoom in on the head of impalas again in the bush line right in the distance Sintra screen if you see something milling about that's an important opinion a turd asking to sometimes mess up with the hand so not really because the Impala also don't see us as a threat so they don't see the vehicle here and think there must be lions around and I see us just as much every day so we're not really gonna interfere but also at the same time we are not gonna try and do or track detention to the Lions that's why we are giving them plenty of space the moment we waiting at the back with all the Cubs some of the Cubs at least some other house and the male's also a little bit behind them just waiting to see what happens here two of the Cubs and do not have the patience to wait but you can see there's more lines flanking around to the west they say they are really doing the pincer move like Mike was saying I wouldn't want to be one of those in parlors right now where are the males will the help with the hand so if this was a big animal like a buffalo or a giraffe the males would certainly help something smaller like the Impala they're gonna miss the lionesses and if the lionesses take the lead we actually hope that the male just stays where he is and doesn't come into the open because that big black man of his is very conspicuous you'll get noticed very easily and quickly by the impala zoom asking so when it comes to Impala it's not chasing the strategies trapping so exactly right the Lions are cats at the end of the day so the technique is stalkin parts where things like the wild dogs hyenas wolves there and the prey into the ground the Lions try and sneak up as close as I can or lions leopards and so on and then pretty much try and pounce on them so if each line is flanks are armed and welcome back good morning but I've made a funny that's the dirts a snack attack we might see a sneak attack yes there was an Impala that alarm cult that mutt from the head that the Lions are busy stalking if we're really lucky that actually might distract the ones the Lions are stalking thinking the threat is far away not realize the closest lioness now I want to say is about 50 yards off that's a bit more but they do need to get within I want to say 15 metres 15 yards to be a real danger to those Impala good yeah that's just the lioness we can see I don't know if others maybe one flank trot around its effects we are starting to lose light quickly and we're gonna try and keep this going as long as possible but I see the screen is starting to a little bit grainy now right and hello everybody in thanks I'm just missing some of the comments because I'm also trying to watch what the lines I have to but yes I do I think they might have been bastard bear that was they snort from someone in there or one of the impalas in that head but I see there's a lioness it's flanked quite far to the little screen just in the bush line top left of frame anyway our gonna definitely try and stay as long as we can fortunately with the way things are moving it'll probably play out before it gets completely dark and go ahead Ali the Impala getting suspicious and facts it is hard to see for you but with twenty Lions they're scattered all over this big open area they're slowly kind of closing the net if you will but they I don't know where the lionesses have gone but some have looped into the thickets behind what two parallel to the Impala unfortunately the Cubs all kind of standing staring and in the open one of the male lions is also very expert he's not hoping yeah yeah where he is he's really gonna be spotted you know later that black man stands out quite well doesn't look like he's mission to stalking now they say the head of impalas is in the bush line top right corner of the frame and top left corner is where one of the Lions into the bush line why are you laughing at my Lisa beats all their husband to be quiet is on Safari yes be very very quiet we are taking Paula Lenora commenting how they coordinate with our walkie talkies that is amazing a lot of it what even you can see on that camera is the those black tips on their ears so they can kind of see one another from behind but you can also see how while they're blending in with the state grass and the grass is relatively green at the end of summer it's gonna get if there's another another impalas north there it's just after that Cubs do that yeah it's fun to see I think they're hot and the Impala suspects something they just can't see the Lions at the moment and like I say the real danger is that they might be seeing the male lion or the Cubs and actually not notice the lionesses oh there's some running is there something chasing after than they are running towards a liar there's a lion running there in the distance yeah so under the Lions did pull the trigger one of the lionesses oh there any let's go Nick all right folks we're gonna try and keep up and get you to the action there's a single Impala that's also run waste day and there's another line is waiting straight ahead of us in total clock let's stand by when you get close to these lines yeah the one Impala running off in the distance there is a lioness it's flanking that single Impala which is the Impala is center of screen just to the left of the aerial now I'm gonna try and zoom in on it a bit yeah what's getting very grainy no but at the base of that tree that center screen just to the left of the base of the tree is the Impala and there's a lioness that has walked into the bush line to the right of screen thanks to give you an idea how dark it is I'm actually watching the YouTube feed on my phone because I can't quite see the Impala myself anymore and Toby we are definitely loved giraffe go welcome back I hope you done the rest of your classes but just to catch everyone maybe that's only just coming on so with the Khumbu a pride they've just been trying to stalk a herd of Impala one of the lionesses ran in and kind of pulled the trigger but too early but the Impala Lulu there's another one running in the back the Impala all scattered around the open area the Lions are trying to flank the last one or two that are left yeah without being spotted that the Cubs all standing around being quite visible so not really helping it looks like everyone is assuring you that it is a knock to doc I just see some blurry things on the screen here that keep on going for a little bit longer like so there is way in the back there some of the lionesses are still moving around as if they're stalking there might be an Impala that's just hiding in one of these thickets so we don't go there and kind of run it for them that's again while we're waiting with the Cubs certainly if something does happen Cubs are gonna go and try and get it but to eat before two devoured but we will get you to the action there nick is got his hand on the ignition ready to go and sometimes the action just comes to you that would be the best of luck well Impala to run towards us into these lines here that works I think at least with the what you could see earlier you get an idea of how these Lions talk and hunt and spread out in this big wide net almost too catchy and parlor and that's a pretty good tactic to use in these larger open areas when they're in thickets and there's a lot more cover than they will try and creep from cover to cover but you can see here there's not that much cover to go around so they'll change the tactics depending on the terrain yeah asking how old is the oldest line is so there's three sisters that are seven years old and then I think the other three are six years and nine months or something like that there are about three months apart the two groups of adults and then the Cubs are all between 18 months and 10 months old now they are there are a lot of Ages to remember yeah and if you do want to see the exact ages and just go to WWE American and click on the wildlife tab you'll find our monthly game reports and that's and you'll find a lot of information there on the Lions as well as on the leopards and any of the other predators that we've seen around not only predators and some other species is awesome interesting species I'm sure they're artful make an appearance in that game report might even make the front cover sorry you have to leave us Christine enjoy your work yeah I think I think I'll go and have a look at the mail there it looks like a lot of these lines are kind of lying down not losing interest it was like one of the lionesses is coming back from the thickets in the distance here so I think let's just go and see one of the Gauri males they're all kind of just walking towards each other pooping nah Tim I'm sure you miss my fatherly advice so the caramel is in a way more sensible position now that the hunt is over just lying down behind the shrub yeah and I can probably a bitter idea of hard dark it is now this phone does lighten everything up and the fans really struggling to you so much detail on this line I think I think the we're gonna have to call it tall and mark because it is getting quite dark fortunately the Hanten whatnot took place while you could still see a little bit you can actually hear one of the line is contact calling nos it's the hunters Mississippi over so thank you all again today for joining us and we look forward to our next live stream maybe next time we all find something else maybe not but yeah we really enjoyed spending time with you this afternoon and we hope you can join us all again soon and if you want to see more of the animals please go and visit our YouTube channel we are covering a lot of the animals that are outside of our and mobile coverage which is only about 10% of the property so some of the animals some of the lipids that don't have their territories within cell phone range you probably won't ever get to see on a live stream so if you'd like to see some of those animals and have a look at our YouTube channel Mala Mala Game Reserve YouTube channel and if you want to get notifications of when we go live then make sure you click the bell icon on latest sightings YouTube channel and subscribe to all of those different social media

looking at this bit of the sunset yeah beautiful here Nick's just pointing out the sunset now if I can see how dark it actually I can actually see a star there it's planet I was waiting for that and then from myself thanks so much for joining us as I glad it was a lot more exciting than last week's sleeping on the river well yeah I see scene and - Nick thank you today you're welcome yeah and from myself yeah cheers we'll see you next time
