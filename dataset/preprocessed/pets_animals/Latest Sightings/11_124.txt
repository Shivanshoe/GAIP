in the ridgeline let's say start of the tree just around the whole district okay good afternoon folks welcome to malamare we are currently sitting with members of the kambula pride there are a few of them lying down here and um just before we started this live stream one lioness had running on a head of giraffe just on the other side of the river there that lioness hasn't returned yet but those giraffes have run away and uh we're currently with tubbs welcome and myself gareth a it's a little bit shaky today it is a little bit windy so forgive us if there's a little bit of noise and camera shake and my gimbal broke just as you're sitting up here i'm just gonna open the comments on youtube and then we'll start answering your questions okay so welcome fix here we go little bit better there cyrus welcome ms lego south african fan mario good afternoon mr lion faro deck 16 kimberly lopez welcome back haiko hi zoom good afternoon in dubai gandalf green dj carson welcome all jackie coke saying she loves the vids thank you jackie we appreciate that you're under duplicity who is it who's it back saffron bell all the way from new zealand saying it's 1 18 a.m here but i'm staying up to have a glimpse at these beautiful big cats brilliant then mike oxlong 612 saying someone fast forward to the killing part mark we just missed um one or two of these lionesses we didn't actually see how many lionesses we arrived just as at least one was running in on a herd of giraffes across the way here as you can see there's been a kill good afternoon from brampton johannesburg then mr lyon asking are the males with the kambulas by that i assume you're asking about the gary males and they were not far from here two days ago and they're just downstream in fact the one was probably about 500 meters from here as the crow flies and the other was probably about nearly a kilometer downstream from us but these lions have been doing a lot of walking lately they've crossed the property breadth ways and just about length ways in the last couple of days and it's nice to have them on our doorstep here at bottom area again so tabs was with a a leopard this morning probably about 150 meters from this position on the way to the kambula proudly we just popped in to see if that leopard was still in the tree it was like any female for those of you that are familiar with our leopards and but there's no immediate sign of here so we just decided to come down to the lines here but we do know that there is at least one leopard in the vicinity so it'll be nice if she pops in and makes an appearance does he 1369 welcome back russell cooper asking if lions can climb trees yes they can and they don't do it often but um there are some places in kenya where they do do it often to get away from the tetsy flies how's it then guys dan bailey's just arrived 90th hunter asking is a streamed or live streamed live or pre-recorded this is live welcome back kelly loves wildlife just to get back to that question about deer lions climb trees in this area if they're climbing trees it's usually to steal a kill from a leopard and they climb they're okay at climbing up trees but they struggle a bit more to climb down trees [Music] they don't climb close to as well as leopards do um okay and then so i've just missed a few comments here let me get back to them harold and goody i'm from victoria beautiful and looks hot there already it is quite warm for winter it is quite warm and there's quite a lot of wind generally august is quite windy so apologies if there's a bit of noise in the mic and dizzy 1369 asking have you seen the cabs yet have a count so the what dizzy 1369 is referring to is one of the kambula lionesses it belongs to this pride in frame has recently had cabs we guess they are about three weeks old and we discovered her den site and about a week ago and their den site is actually in frame right now i'm just going to zoom in there's an area called campbell copies right in the distance there and just to the left of that big tree is a rocky art crop and that's where the dan site is and we don't know how many cubs there are but if you go to our youtube channel and malamata game reserves youtube channel and you look at the video that was posted two or two videos ago you'll see at least one of those cuts in the video how much distance is taken from this group of lights i'm assuming you're asking how far we are away from the lines we are probably about 15 meters away from these lines martin luther hi everyone watching from nairobi kenya welcome and then saffron bell asking how many adult females are in this pride and how big is the pride in its entirety so there are six adult females in this pride and the pride had six adult females and 14 youngsters but like i've just mentioned now there are some newly born cuts and we are not 100 sure how many new cups they are at least i think we need two but they could be four or five we just don't have that yet because they're in quite an excess in inaccessible area for us and we do give them some space when they're very young like they are just so they get used to the vehicle how do we stream wildlife videos with no internet connection we do have internet connection that's how we're streaming but we don't have internet connection across the whole property only about 10 percent the property has internet connection and this is where we are limited to our live streams haley loves wildlife asking about the gary males or the birmingham's birmingham males they have been around they haven't moved uh from this area much at all the one is closer to retrace camp at the moment the cambodia pride is spending a lot of time walking around at the moment you know i've got a lot of mouths to feed having to cover a large distance i think it's part of it maybe a little bit territorial as well as trailing the heads of buffaloes that are around we do know that they played on a buffalo until three days ago and but the last time they killed the buffalo here in guadalajara it only lasted this pride one evening so they're obviously um having to hunt a lot and i'm covering a lot of ground and i think these guys have just decided they're not all that keen on you know walking the distances that the kamala pride are currently walking [Music] if you've been back to visit the new captain yeah i think someone goes out there just about every drive henry just commenting on the wind sorry about that it's august is a windy month here i'll try and put my hand over the mic hopefully that helps a bit nora whittle welcome back and then john sherman's asking where exactly are we last week friday i saw pride of lions opposite the crocodile river at marlette park john we are at malamar game reserve and i don't think this pride has walked quite that far yet um we're probably about 60 kilometers from that area so i don't think as the crow flies i don't think um these lines are ventured that far does the 1369 asking is this the largest pride we've had in kruger recently anyway so we are waged between the kruger national park and the sabi sands i can't speak for krieger national park itself i'd imagine there's some big prides there as well but it's certainly the largest pride in this immediate area at least in the same sands it's the largest pride that's been here for a while as well i'm asking what the temperature is what should you say it is we're guessing the helmet i think that the tub says there's the wind that's catching saying 28 29 i was gonna say a little bit less but uh yeah it's quite warm here 25 there we go 25 hi mia welcome back and then i'm just going to try and pick through some of these comments here i think i've been a bit slow on the uptake so i'm just going to try and make my way to the bottom and you are asking are there any males he can take over this pride so that the males that are have sired all these young youngsters here are the gauri males and so the kambula pride is very familiar with the emails and we often see the gar emails of the the kabula pride and whether any other males in the area can take over the gary males territory well that's another question altogether and there are another two males that are about the same size to our east you spend a lot of time with the four ways pride uh but whether they have the confidence to come in or the confidence or the the will to come in and take over the kambula or the gary males territory i couldn't tell you [Music] so lizette asking is any pretty close by which these lions have their eye on lizette's when we arrived here there is a lioness at the bottom of this riverbank and she had run in on a head of giraffes and the herd of giraffes had run off just as we arrived here so there was prey and you can see the lioness center of screen is lying on the edge of this riverbank head up and she's keeping a close eye out for any um for any prey species that might come by here right now i can't see anything [Music] welcome back annie then forex gold saying when the pride is sleeping or racing like this will they always be at least one line on century duty no it's not like some of the smaller carnivores or prey species um you know they don't really need a century they are right you know there are apex predators they are right right at the top of the food chain there so yeah when they're sleeping sometimes when they're sleeping the whole pride is completely flat out and they'll still be aware you know they'll still be if they hear something in the bushes they'll lift their heads and see you know what it might be or if they smell something unfamiliar or hear elephants walking by they'll still be alert but they won't have an active sentry like saying mere cats would okay i'm gonna just try and see if i can make a plan with this wind and the mic so just excuse me if it gets a bit shaky for the moment okay excuse me for a second [Music] oops okay how's that for everybody is that a bit better then mr lyon asking have the northern avoca males been close uh mr lion the northern irvaka males are currently feeding on a buffalo right now and along with their kuhuma pride and they are they are in the northern parts of our property they have found the uh buffalo bull this morning and they hadn't started feeding on it yet so they're i'd say probably about six five or six kilometers from here to the north okay so lego south african fan saying way better thanks lego i've just put my sock over the mic so i'm currently shoeless on my left foot i think it was uh friday he suggested this a few live streams ago and i've just taken him taking his advice seriously so if it does work i might just bring a sucker along for these live streams oh juno welcome back uh yeah just asking about the new litter uh yeah unfortunately we don't have a confirmed number of cubs yet uh you know they haven't shown they sell themselves all that much we can view them from some distance away from their density just because they're on the top of a rocky art crop which is a great density for them and funnily enough uh the rocky outcrop that that kambula lioness is dining on is called campbell copies and the kambula pride are named after that rocky art crop kambula is just a sort of local name for campbell whack campbell was a previous owner of the property and those particular rocks or copies are named after him there's a draw saying lions hunt at night and they also hunt during the daytime especially at this time of year along the river when a lot of the prey species come down to the water to drink i can see one of the lionesses the one that probably ran in on the giraffe is now starting to this you can see it just climbing up the bank um kimberly asking can we go there i'm assuming you're asking about the kuhumas and we're not sure if there is signal there maybe what you'll do is ask if there is but right now i think uh the likelihood of something happening and the likelihood of us at least keeping signal you know this area is a lot better both for signal and if you know a hundred to take place or something at least we raised here uh where the kuma prada currently is quite a thick area and uh this is very patchy in terms of signal mr lyon asking do we see they're not far from the um the gar emails the b boys the birmingham boys um do we see a clash between the vokers and the birmingham boys happening i don't see that happening anytime soon the guy emails certainly a lot bigger and quite a lot more confident than most of the other lions in this area and um yeah there's i think uh you know they've been covering a lot of ground as well i think they've been chasing a lot of the other lines in this area away from alamado there was a spell towards the end of winter we were seeing or towards the beginning of winter where we're seeing a lot more lions and property and both the cambola pride and the gary males have been covering a lot of ground a lot of their territory and i think in recent weeks we've just seen far fewer prides than we did at the beginning of winter okay a couple of you asking uh where are we streaming live from we are currently at malamala game reserve and uh that is based in south africa we are wedged between the sabi sands game reserve in the kruger national park if you've ever been to the kruger national park and set its kakuza which is their main camp you've sat on the river there and looked across the river we're pretty much just north of the river and the southern end of modern modes not far from that river from that deck welcome pam hudson welcome back then superbike saying them lions would take corrective action if you try to pet them in the words of my kickman see there's a lot of people saying please go and pit them so for those of you that are south african and there's good news a lot of these reserves are opening to the public now although that's intra provincial so if you are close by to kruger close by to us here at bala mala you are more than welcome to visit all of these lodges in the area or the ones that are open at least and we are planning to open towards the end of the month and we are currently taking bookings so if anyone's interested please go and visit our website or call our reservations welcome back james schmulowitz not gin is saying maybe i should use the other sock too i must say i'm enjoying this breeze going through my toes here welcome shade 45 from canada kimberly lopez asking will we still be seeing you kimberly we are feeling our way around what our new um procedures will be here i think all the lodges and game reserves are and the live streams and the videos have certainly um been something that we've enjoyed doing and um i think a lot of the public has enjoyed it as well so i think we're going to try and fit it in somehow how exactly we're not sure yet those details still have to be ironed out but we hope not to be going anywhere offline kansas high from mongolia and russia it's a very long way away from here the mcw from australia and then eric chen which prior does this is he dizzy is answered already kambula pride then mr lyon saying around 10 years old i think there's about a year to get between the gary males i think the ones 10 and the ones and on that's parker yes the kambula pride that's right and it's love shantial from nepal and that's very cool that you're watching us all the way from nepal from poland styro patrika so tony stark asking how line dynamics work in the pride with the addition of new cubs so tania we've spoken a little bit about how this pride is walking around a lot at the moment and they're having to cover long distances having to hunt a lot we've got lots of mouths to feed and big prides like this often fragment when it becomes too difficult for them to get enough food for the entire pride we have seen you know a few weeks ago there were three lionesses that were hanging out by themselves away from the pride one of the lionesses who has given birth has been spending a lot of time by herself and has been hunting by herself when these prides go off and walk around i think in that time that she's spending by time by herself she's scoping off dan sites and now that she's found a dan's site she's now that she's given birth she's founded the inside and she will not venture too far from that dane site she'll leave the dan site and she will go and hunt and then she'll return to the dance site to let her cubs suckle and yeah so that will she won't be able to cover the distances that the kambula pride do she'll have to keep on going back and forth between the den site and the immediate area where her dan site is is a great dane site for a number of reasons firstly it's quite high up on a rocky art crop so it's you know there's not too many predators just wandering by they'd have to make an effort to get up there and there's lots of crevices for those little cabs to hide in and not far from that rocky art crop is an area called piccadilly triangle and the kidney triangle is full of general game and in fact just to the north of that copy there's a lot of general game there's lots of impalas zebras voldemiest so there's a lot of game four here to hunt in the immediate facility and uh that dan site is actually in screen and sort of center top of screen where the largest tree is there's actually a rocky art crop behind there so she's close to the river as well the river's just in front of us here so she she's got access to water and all the prey species that come down to drink at the river she can hunt along the river so she'll be sticking to this area whilst the kambula pride and you know have been covering a lot of ground so every now and then you know she might meet up with this pride while they're here and i haven't seen her but perhaps they'll meet up while they're in the area and she may hunt a bit with them but if they leave it's unlikely that she'll continue to follow them if they go too far then hi to shielders africa and lawrence jr welcome back it's been some time since we saw you here just trying to catch up with some of these comments quickly lauren's saying yesterday i saw three prides of lions and two leopards laurence i'm assuming you're back in the krieger national park and that is some good gambling and then love shantial asking do lions mate to their own offspring ask us because females will stay with the same pride right for the most part that is correct and but male lions have quite a short window period um to be able to sire cubs first of all and let those cabs grow to adults and in this area there's a lot of pressure from other male lions so by the time that male's daughters reach sexual maturity usually there's other males that have come to push the fathers out of their own territory and so it's not often that they do matter their daughters but given the opportunity i guess they would so i hope that answers your question and there are some areas where maybe there's far fewer um male lions you know here we're in a very high density you've got a very high density of predators and so the sort of natural dynamics is just is such that uh you know stronger males will reach their prime and push the older males out by the time those other males daughters reach daughters reach sexual maturity but it is a problem within smaller game reserves that are fenced in in particular because you know there may not be other males that can push out males within those smaller reserves and in those cases the line populations actually have to be managed very carefully and so lines will have to be moved from small game reserve to another small game reserve just to mix up the genetics a bit and to prevent that inbreeding from happening then balaji narayanan how long can lions go without food after a healthy meal and they can go for quite a long time tabs what to do i don't know if you've noticed a specific period and at least a week i would say yeah and i'm sure they can go for even longer than a week without feeding um but yeah when they do feed they definitely take on a lot of meat if you've seen some of our youtube videos you can see how voracious they are around kills and they definitely do not like sharing and they try and eat as much as they can because they just don't know when their next meal will be and they're not gina saying that they're clip spreading springers to hunt for the lioness on camel copies perhaps so those clip springers are incredibly agile on those rocks the clip springer is a very agile small antelope and and they're a little bit like mountain goats in that they are very agile on very steep inclines and on rocky ledges and i don't think a lioness would be able to catch a clip springer very easily on those rocks i think they're far too agile for this big cat so just a question here about the when sub-adult males leave the pride it's usually and it also depends very much on what other lions are in the area and but yeah it can be you know anywhere between three to four four and a half years um that age these lines here i think the oldest ones are just over two years now i think they're two years in one month here we have one of the sub adult lines this is just sure it's getting difficult to tell the difference between the sub adults and the adults now cheers super bikes nice to see you kimberly lopez asking have you seen the gorgeous maxum mill lately uh i think gareth saw the maximum smell two days ago hanging out around west street bridge and then someone just asking is it true that malamala and london don't belong to sabi san jose anymore well malamar hasn't been part of the sabi sands for sure probably about 15 years maybe even more than that um but i believe london is still part of the sabi sands game reserve and still love shantial asking why do predators not hunt and eat each other uh so love sometimes they do they don't always eat each other but they definitely do kill each other quite often and yeah you'll see that both lions and leopards are very wary when they go down to the river to drink because crocodiles will try and catch them if they have the opportunity to and leopards are very wary around lions because lions will uh you know they're competing for the same resources so lions will also quite easily kill a left but it's happened here many times before and uh you know lions will kill other lions as well so it happens very regularly it's not all that often that they a predator feed on another predator but there were lions here and that were nicknamed them we knew them as them luati males and they killed very many lions and ate very many lions which was quite unusual behavior senator dove asking where on mata mala are we the dove we are just south of the causeway so we're just south of uh sable camp we probably about probably about 600 meters from camp so and neil king just asking about um one of the guy emails was in sabi sabi recently how far is that from malama sabi sabi is one of the many farms that borders malamar we are a very large property definitely the largest privately owned property in this area and one of the largest big five properties in south africa and so we do have many many reserves that border our borders and so yeah from time to time you all see these animals on our neighbor's properties and yeah andrew saunders art commenting can get a bit noisy and gruesome when lions take down a warthog yes this is true warthogs i say are quite tough so they generally put up quite a fight and it can be quite a noisy fight that they put up it's not always the most pleasant thing to watch or here for that matter barbara russell asking how long do you think it will take to get the lion population back as it was before the mapojos barbara i don't know the exact numbers uh during the pojo's reign in this area but i would imagine that that population would have bounced back pretty quickly and you know lions breed very quickly if they if their cubs or young are killed they come back into each very quickly and they're ready to breed again and you know they can have four plus cubs at a time so i'd imagine that the population has settled down for the you know the amount of game that is in this area and then lizette's saying if someone comes to kruger must you book separately to go through to private properties like malamata yes although we do form part of the greater kruger national park we are private property and operate completely independently from kruger itself you'd have to book at malda mala itself and then lauren's just talking about some zebras and voldemorts that weren't afraid of lions yeah that's funny lawrence i have seen that before sometimes it's almost as though they know that they're not going to be hunted and they will stand close by and just watch them sometimes alarm call but yeah you know as long as they've got the lions in their sight they don't have too much to be afraid of and can be quite confident when that is the case then doc raven asking was there an altercation between this pride and inkahumas so this pride was in the human prides territory or at least close to um a couple of days ago and then kahuma's are now i don't know if they had an altercation if that happened it would have been off of our property but um it doesn't look like it from where i'm sitting at least not with this pride of lions none of them look too battered and i imagine for the most part a lot of these prides will try and avoid each other they won't um necessarily it won't always end up in in fights if they do get close to each other i think it's a matter of risk and reward if they know they've got very young cabs in their pride they might not take the risk of such a large pride of all these large sub adults in it so they might just avoid the kambula pride all together and then dizzy 1369 saying oh yeah there was a scuffle okay so maybe there was i'm unaware of that and yeah you guys would have to fill me in on that and then someone says fake news they're coming from this end and then leroy from facebook and saying is this is there still a coalition as big as in my pocos leroy i can answer for this immediate area and no there isn't but they may well be in the kruger national park and i don't know if you get a lot of videos uh on your uh on later sightings maybe you've seen some big coalitions come in from kruger recently an ai fed asking leopard versus lion who wins i'd say most certainly adult verse adults and yeah it says they send me a lion they're far bigger than leopards and then hey i feel asking again do lions starve to death occasionally you know if a lion gets injured and can't keep up with the rest of the pride and they might not be able to hunt for themselves and yeah i'd imagine in cases like that they might starve to death and then does he just commenting on uh pretty sure to sit on that they cross paths and one of the incumbent pride members has a lump or something now i could have heard wrong does y'all know that one of the kumar lionesses does have a limp whether it was because they crossed paths with a kambula pride or whether they she got injured taking down a buffalo i can't tell you but we do know that they are feeding on a baffler currently and but yeah i don't know about the full story so then annie just commenting the munich zoo is selling lion's cat it's very popular to keep cats out of gardens and under cars to deter cats from chewing cables wires so they said in a video yeah lions get i think would deter just about anything [Laughter] it's not the most pleasing to smelling things and and then uh mr wild you a e87 how far is mala mala gamma's there from juma jimmy borders us to the north eh does it actually share a border with us yeah yeah so that's another one of the reserves that shares the border with us so so i see there's a question that comes up here a few times a balaji narayanan 20 odd lions of the same family yes how many males and females are there now i don't want to get this wrong because i always get the sub adults wrong so there are six adult lionesses you know how many sub-adults or young cubs here six males i think five or five males yeah five mil okay um we stand to be corrected here um balaji tub says five i think six but i might be wrong so let us try and get back to you on that and barbara russell saying i heard one of the kambula lionesses is pregnant are the others that are probably also we don't know at this stage but i think the one that you're referring to has already given birth barbara one of the kambula lionesses is actually denning on camel copies and we discovered her cabs just about a week ago welcome maggie and gordon higginbotham yeah shame you're supposed to be in south africa at the moment perhaps next year and then um so love asking what is the best way to survive a lion tech or deter them i think the best way is to not put yourself in a position where you might um yeah don't put yourself in the position where you get attacked by lions it's probably the best way then pam asking do we know how many cubs she had yet and no pam not at the stage we have seen the dance out uh but you are unaware or we haven't confirmed the number of cabs yet if you look at our youtube channel you can go and have a look at the discovery of that insight and i think one of the one of the cubs appears on that video but we at this point we don't know quite how many cubs they are we're guessing that they're about three weeks old now elder moser asking would you say this is one of the most dangerous places on earth i can think of quite a few cities that are more dangerous um yeah uh i think it depends on how you define danger i i certainly feel safer here in the reserve than i do in many cities around the world it's nice not to have to lock your doors and and well we don't actually have doors on our vehicles so we don't even have to close our doors but yeah kg1 thank you very much says thank you for the guides answering so many questions really appreciate it thanks keji we appreciate that comment and yeah so there's there's a lot of questions coming in sorry if we don't get to all of them it's love asking do brothers fight over mating rights or do they all have their own lionesses i think they will there's a lioness that is ready to mate i think they'll definitely try and match with her i have seen male lions fight when females are in easters and yeah that's not uncommon this little pekka it could be welcome back in atlan a world love day yesterday yeah it was world line tabs are just bringing up world lion there and um yeah you would have seen a lot of post on instagram if you follow wildlife sites then um bellagio asking do you shoot regularly in south africa we shoot videos yes and um there are game reserves where hunting is permitted that's what you mean and currently and we you know a lot of conservation efforts rely on ecotourism and that's either either in this form that we are in or the situation that we're in here um where we have photographic safaris um or there are hunting safaris there's very few um other sources of income for these natural areas and uh this whole situation with curvat 19 has certainly affected and all the streams of income that do protect these animals i think there's going to be a lot of thought given to how we can bring in more income for these natural areas and i think a lot of thought has been put in already throughout this experience with these this weird strange time we're living through at the moment lauren's lucky to have a leopard near your car barbara russell asking uh will we be receiving guests we do have bookings none confirmed and i think the president will give another address in the next week or so and then we'll have more clarity on whether um or i think we'll have charity on whether those guests will confirm their bookings or not but yeah we are open to take bookings and we plan on having guests back next month but those will be only south african guests and any guests from within our province you know arjuna saying he posted a photo of the three kambula cubs on instagram for world lion day that gives us a good idea of when you were here gina i remember those when the three of them were still quite young just asking what are our thoughts on people that keep lions as pets um you know a lot of these wild species really need a lot of space and um when they grow up especially lions you know they got these instincts that i ingrained in them to hunt and to stalk and catch things so they can get dangerous when they're a bit older i certainly wouldn't recommend it and i'd much prefer to see lions in the wild than in people's backyards and then christine asking did they give up a hunt this morning christine they actually hunted as we arrived here about an hour ago and one of the lionesses ran in on a head of giraffes just in front of us yeah that was just before we started live streaming then there's a few barbara here in september 2018. we hope to see you back in the nearest future don't know when the borders will open but we hope to see all our guests and new guests come to visit us at some point when we do have been but you know us are commenting can't wait to get back or jen it'll be nice to see you back here foreign marie lupico asking is it true if if a male lion mates with a female with cubs that at times he may kill him marie if those cubs don't belong to that lion he'll almost certainly kill him then johar asking if a pride doesn't have male lions in it can younger males stay in that pride uh what happens is when the females come into easter and they will leave their scent all over their territories and they might actually seek out males or contact call males but males will be aware in patrolling their territories of any females in and around their territories that may be in heat and maybe ready to mate and in such cases they'll seek them out and obviously by seeking them out those young males would not be able to stay in that pride they'd have to um leave the pride and become nomadic if they do not if those are not their fathers the r60 is saying looking at these open jeeps what protection do people have if lions attacked and so br 60 we are fortunate enough to have been viewing these animals for about 50 years now and we've been driving a very we've got very strict protocols around these animals we drive in a very controlled manner we always approach these animals in the same gear and we all use the same vehicles so they get used to the engine noise when we approach them we always approach at the same angles and they know when they're sleeping we drive in a certain way which might be different to when they're walking which might be different when they're hunting but over many many years and this has allowed these lions and the other predators on this property to get used to us and they've become completely tolerant of us and they do not take much notice of us at all we are just very close by to these lions and you can see that our talking and um doesn't bother bothering whatsoever they are very used to it we behave in a very um in a very predictable manner should we behave unpredictably then these lines would display more aggressive or more fearful behavior towards us and then pet drag next asking do we ever wear a gun or during these tours just in case we do carry rifles with us and that's just a standard procedure but we've never had to use them and then dizzy 1369 asking can lions get rabies yes they can and one of the strange things about how rabies works is that wild animals they become their behavior becomes almost tame and they become a lot more confident around humans versus domestic animals whose behavior turns more wild and but yeah they certainly can get rabies and uh there's a lot of management in iran in and around the edges of these nature reserves with regards to rabies management a lot of the um sort of abandoned dogs or can you hear some elephants in the background there or dogs that or stray dogs either get caught or inoculated and to prevent rabies from spreading into these national parks and then lawrence jr gareth is a tree that if a predator ever ate human being it will want to attack you loans for the most part and these wild animals are afraid of humans there are what about seven billion of us on the planet now and that's for good reason is because we are the most dangerous animals on the planet and you know i think all of these animals have a healthy fear of humans we've hunted them for as long as we've been around i guess and um i think what happens gen when you when you talk about man-eating predators it's usually under quite strange circumstances it might be that a lion or leopard is either ill and struggling to keep up with the pride or struggling to hunt and or maybe old and is struggling to keep up with the pride in the case of a lion or struggling to hunt in the case of a leopard and uh may just get so hungry that it decides that it has to take the risk by trying to hunt a human and maybe once that has happened once besides that actually humans are quite easy to catch and then uh may do it more often after that uh and i think yeah i think that's probably but for the most part these animals are afraid of i say more you know like if you're walking into into these uh predators in the bush now lions behave very differently at night than they do during the day during the day they might run away from you and at night they might stalk you and i think they feel a lot more confident confident at night than they did during the daytime as well but for the most part they're afraid of us the dove saying last time we heard that elephant called and cavendi female was around well then coveney female was close by earlier so she may still be around here somewhere a few of you just thanking us um yeah you're welcome it's lovely to share this experience with you all especially under lockdown conditions and for those of you that have watched our malamala youtube series ranges in isolation we're gonna have to change that uh title soon because we won't be in isolation for that much longer and but if you do want some more game viewing and to see what happens on the rest of the reserve feel free to go and visit our youtube channel it's malamata game reserves youtube channel and have a look at our ranges and isolation series and then also just thanks to nadav who's helped us with all these live streams from the very beginning so barbara just asking which other prides make malamala home so the kambula pride uh territory falls over a large swath of malamala and but the prides that we've been seeing in winter thus far who boarded the kambula pride and ah then kahuma bride the tortured pride um the four ways pride the i feel pride spends its time in the south the monthly pride as well the monthly pride and the uphill pride are down to lioness and one cup each or respectively um there's also we've seen the camps or a few young males from the camps camp planes pride uh the stixx pride we've seen here tubs are not forgetting any prides um i've seen the sandro pride oh the sandra of pride as well yeah so we're very fortunate we've got a long uh we've got the the river the sand river uh runs along the length of marmala's property uh particularly during winter when there's very little water around elsewhere a lot of the prey species come down to the river to drink and usually um the kambula pride or at least last year the kamulo pride is spending a lot of time around the sand river which allowed a lot of the other prizes to kind of um spend more time on malama and even towards the end of the beginning of this winter there were more prides on malama but those dynamics shift quite a lot but we do see many prides here we're very fortunate in that respect and is i think since the beginning of ranges in isolation we've seen something well over 10 different prides and coalitions i think the last time we counted was about 12 or 13. yeah these are two different sets of avoca males and then pam asking if a cub or youngster wanders off and gets separated from the pride are they ever able to unite to their pride or do they just go off on their own they would make every effort to try and reunite to the pride and i can't think of many cases here where we've actually witnessed where they won't be able to but we have found dead youngsters before which you know they might have been separated and then another predator may have killed that youngster so we just yeah we wouldn't have seen that happen and but it is possible then mita welcome back asking how the new cubs are doing mita i haven't seen them personally and but so far so good i believe levi asking is this actually live yes it is then david charles saying some of the reserves have different names for the pride it's possible to list the names the only names that i think uh i know the kambula prada also called the incevu pride and now the birmingham boys also called the car emails for the most part i don't think the other prides and have too much or too many other names but i would like to steer you towards our monthly game reports david so if you go to malamala game reserves uh website malamala.com and you go to the wildlife tab and you will see under that wildlife tab there are game reports and that gives a breakdown a monthly report on all the different leopards and lions all the predators and other interesting sightings on malamar and that'll give you a good idea as to what prides are here what their ages are and all of that kind of stuff so br 60 asking what other animals have particularly good eyesight during the night hours while all the nocturnal species of the predators would be things like leopards obviously lions and there's genets and civets yeah there's plenty of animals that are mostly nocturnal and they all have rather keen eyesight or most of them at least then arjuna just commenting on nadav achieving his fundraising target for assisting cougar rangers well done the dev as a good deed you did there and then it does also just added our game reports thanks nadev so now gina's just asking can you maybe go have a look at the elephants um i don't know how the rest of you online feel about us driving around for a little bit we can maybe return to the kambula pride it might be a little bit windy and shaky but if you guys are happy to do that then maybe we can have a little a little drive around you let me know okay so a few people saying yes please go for a drive then love um just asking about why are people still permitted to handle lions and yeah you know i think that's each to their own i personally couldn't hunt too many animals that i would be i would be a hypocrite if i said that we should stop hunting impalas and you know things that we eat if i am not a vegetarian which i'm not um but hunting unfortunately does still contribute fortunately unfortunately hunting is one of the big contributors to conservation lots of people come to africa to hunt and it's a very complex issue because that land is protected by those hunting operations and um if it was maybe not ideal land for say a photographic safari destination and or maybe just so far out of the way and for the j for photographic clients uh it's at least that land gets protected by someone so you know i think i guess the argument is that a few animals might get shot on that land but there's lots of different birds that are saved because the trees aren't cut down because the land is protected and their nests aren't chopped on and the ecosystems are intact and you know all sorts of other species are protected because a few have been taken out of the ecosystem i think that argument can go in circles and circles and i don't want to be the judge of which is right which is wrong but what i do want to say is that i think we need more tools or more streams of income for conservation in general and not just hunting or not only hunting and not only photographic safaris but we certainly need other streams of income there are of course ngos that also protect um large swathes of land but we can't rely on hand arts either i think let's drive a little bit let's see if we can find this elephant yeah so should we take that treat around past all the easter eggs so we're gonna drive now excuse the wind and the shakiness as you go and um if i am not answering your questions it's just because i'm trying to put the tubs and the rest of the river in view for you so we're driving along the western bank of the sand river and um i think we're going to take a little detour to where those elephants were making a noise and perhaps you bump into something else then i've just seen a question here quickly how many bird species are found in kruger at mala mala there are just over 300 species and there are quite a few more species in kruger i can't tell you the exact number but as well does he asking where are we going does he we are just going to take a little drive around see if we find anything else we may return to the um kambula pride um we're just going to see maybe we bump into the coveny female leopard here somewhere there was a herd of elephants close by so let's just go and have a look see what we can find let's just check in there yeah so saying we must go check in the river and then lauren's saying the stream is already lagging like if we have trouble with a with a stream then we'll head back to the gambola pride yeah 60 asking what are the what is the temperature uh there's some elephants well then taps so i don't think this is the head that was uh making a noise but tubs has got his sixth sense working for us here he's taking us to another hedge does he 1369 seen any wild dogs lately does he we have and um we have some more news but it needs to be given a little bit of time but we suspect that there's a wild dog another wild dog dane on the property which is quite exciting and we have seen wild dogs there we haven't seen the pups themselves but we'll probably know in about a week or have confirmation of whether they are wild dog pepsi or not but we have a strong strong feeling that they are okay so here's some elephants drinking here there's a whole bunch to our right here as well okay so times are just going to get into position here i'm just going to focus on these ones that i left drinking here but not i think maybe let's focus on these ones a bit nicer with the light on them yeah okay we're just going to focus on these ones to our left so we don't have to turn the camera into the sunlight yeah thanks okay that's good all right so you can see he has a young bull elephant walking towards us yeah and there are more elephants behind us tabs is going to keep an eye on those ones but i'm not going to put the camera on them just yet just because i'd be pointing the camera into the sunlight you can actually see how deep the water is in the sand river from looking at his legs what's that tubs i'm saying you can actually see how deep the water is in the sand river just by looking at his legs wet parts of his legs he's going to walk up here now and then we'll have a look at what tabs is talking about nice hiding his legs but this young bull has just walked through the sand river so we're gonna see how deep that water is so you can see those little black socks there looks to be about two feet deep at the deepest point it's love just asking about which animals are dangerous to humans and just mentioning hippos so in many parts of africa there is no running water and so people have to go down to the river to collect their water and either to wash their clothes or to just collect water for whatever uses they need waterfall and that's often where people have uh bump into hippos you can see these reeds all this tall grass in the river here and you know there's an elephant center of screen right now and we are in a raised position and we can barely see that elephant in these tall reeds now imagine having to walk through that to go and collect water and you know you'll it'll be very easy to bump into a hippo in that and hippos when they feel threatened and and usually in these cases if you're walking through the reeds you'll be right on top of it before you notice each other and it will feel threatened and most animals have a flat fight or flight region and generally if you're well within its space um animals will tend to fight as opposed to run away so just because of the nature of where the rivers run or where the water is and where the hippos are found and because people have to go down to the water to collect their water um hippos kill more people in africa than any of the other mammals but uh yeah you know all of these animals can be dangerous i think it's just depends on what situation you find yourself in the dove saying is the sandpit drive it is sand for drive well done lawrence jr asking is it possible that a tourist can visit malamala and not see a predator that's never happened with any of my guests i don't know has it happened with any of your guests that they've come here and not seen a predator no it's never happened it's never happened i don't think yeah i don't think i know of any anyone that's come here and not seen a predator um christine asking do we think the water will last through the winter what do you think tubs it's difficult to say yeah sometimes you're sitting on the fence there's obviously a whole lot more water than we had the previous two years i've been here yeah so we've come out of a drought and this is certainly the most water that's been in the area for many years now um i suspect it might just last all the way through winter then maggie and gordon charming in there the mosquito is the most dangerous yeah they do kill more than any hippos kill in africa with the malaria arjuna commenting on some of the pied kingfishers in the background so that's coming to us a bit earlier but i did see them hovering above the river so if you see little black and white birds hovering above these elephants or close to these elephants those are the pied kingfishers that arjuna is referring to uh so love just asking me about tour packages and prices uh so love maybe if you go to malamala's website and you can have a look around there there's a tab that says reservations that will probably give you the most accurate um information at this point it's only you know the the prices have changed because we have a south african rate and um only people within south africa can travel here right now so i don't know if they are actually taking international bookings at this point but if you go to our reservations tab on our website and you'll find the right contact contacts on our website i think that would be the best place to ask then the dove chiming in there you can also email bookings later sightings.com and there you can see the pirate kingfisher again diving down into the water and then back up again if you look at that elephants above it you can just see that white flickering bird there it's actually looking down into the water for fish to catch and it'll dive under the water and catch fish from underneath the water obviously and then fly back out to the fish in its bowl if it's successful diving down it's like another unsuccessful hint yeah this is that female with a tusk that goes down is it i think so welcome peter ferrari and annette lane just commenting on this afternoon light annette winter here is amazing for light obviously and the sun is further north it sits further north and rises further north of our eastern and western horizons and because it is a winter for us so and it's throughout the day it is in the sky and at a lower angle and because it's so dry here during winter there's a lot of dust that has kicked up by these animals and the sun gets filtered through that dust as well and on a windy day like today there'll be even more dust in the air and it makes for this very soft light it's love just commenting on the water i'm going to just show you where the water is it's in this in the reeds here we're in the grass that you can see in screen i'm just going to go to the left and you'll see how it snakes through there we go there's the water if you can see if those elephants are more accessible to the topic meat are asking are they eating yes they would be cropping the reeds there and uh they would also be drinking from the sand river yes we're just gonna see if there's maybe some elephants a little bit closer to us and view them from a bit closer there's one over there yeah it's the youngster there's one right here oh this is good yeah i think there's a whole bunch of them here you can get up a bit so tubs is getting us nicely positioned over here see a whole bunch of elephant butts yeah oh that's perfect you can see some youngsters there as well and you can see in the foreground there's a bird a black bear that's just flown off of that branch that was a forktail drungo and they like to hang out to these herds of animals as they walk through the grass they may disturb insects which helps it which makes it easier for those birds to see and then they'll fly down and grab the insect and then go and sit on a perch again see them doing that there see that baby elephant's nursing there temperature is starting to drop now i can feel it on my foot that does not have a sock on andrew sordin is asking about cycling safaris andrew there are certain places where you can go on cycling safaris uh this area has a very high density of big five animals and when you talk about big five animals that's um lions leopards rhinos elephants what am i missing and buffaloes cape buffalos and all of those animals can be quite dangerous particularly if you give them a fright on a bicycle i think if you're riding a bicycle you can ride into trouble very quickly but maybe not necessarily ride away from trouble quick enough so in this area i wouldn't recommend it but there are areas where the vegetation is far more open and you can see animals from a lot from a distance and it's a bit safer to do that off the top of my head and i don't know if they still do it but i know meshato which was a malamala sister reserve used to have cycling tours through it you can have a look there and i think they did and i don't know if they still do organize a cycling tour called twitter tuli which is in and around that area then muhammad asking who will win or an indian runner muhammad i cannot answer that question uh yeah unfortunately i don't know enough about the indian runner and i've never seen the two in close proximity to each other so guys if i am missing your questions my apologies and i will try and get to them barbara asking do the buffs to regularly stay in madame mala because of the water buffaloes move a lot they've got the large home range but they do visit malamala often because of the water so some of the older buffalos may be here on a more regular basis we refer to those older buffalo bulls as dagger boys but the big herds come and go quite frequently and they tend to keep on moving to better grazing areas or at least perceive better grazing areas and between grazing areas and watering points so they won't over graze in one area specifically if they have the freedom to move so yeah we do have lodges i think there's a herd of 500 plus yesterday that visited one of our northern water points it's there today it's there today again tap says see my sister's trying to call me here on on the live stream i'm just gonna have to hang up on here quickly she's putting together a little care package for me she's probably wanting to know whether i want full cream milk or she's obviously not listening to this live stream but if any of the family members are just tell us to get full cream cooked is referring to a very south african dessert or treat cook sister you can see this very young coffee the mother mum's got a hole in it yeah oh jenna commenting here send some other some good coffee for the other guy at the g nut lauren's just saying you're back had to write you a homework well then lawrence how's everyone feel about the elephants do you want to maybe go back and see how the kambula prada doing or carry on driving let us know um i think this i tell you i don't know if this is yeah welcome game drive meter says okay so i think let's we're going to leave these elephants the road gets a bit close to them there there's a quite a lot of thick butcher around in there so tabs are just going to take us out on a different route we get out to kick lazy russia and uh i think we'll take a little a slow a little detour back towards the lions they may be getting active there's another young elephant there it's been there since we arrived so gina and my mom's saying full cream cook sisters for tubs good coffee then yeah i think let's just go shy straight it's a love thank you for all the questions today and bulapride there got tabs in screen here see one of them are up they're just grooming me looks like where the rest are hey they're still lying down there so it looks like a couple of them are starting to groom over there for the most part there's flat as they were earlier yeah thank you and then a few people asking how often we go live uh we go live when we can where we have cell phone coverage so only about 10 percent if that of the property is covered by oh we have cell phone signaling and um you know if there are sightings worth a while to stream and if there are enough staff at hand to get all our duties done um then we'll come and do a live stream but if you do want to know when you do go live the best way to know is to go on to later sightings youtube channel and click the bell icon and malamata i say usually puts let you know by the instagram page so if you subscribe to our platforms as well you'll get notifications and then dive just welcoming all the new viewers for those of you that are viewing on facebook and you're wondering why your questions aren't getting answered i have youtube open here and i'm answering the questions that are posted on youtube so if you do wish to ask any questions get onto the youtube channel or later sightings youtube channel and you can answer or ask questions there is behancil welcome asking do cars affect their natural behavior not here these predators are very used to our vehicles you have strict driving protocols around them and all of these lines would have grown up with these vehicles driving around them so they are completely used to our presence thanks annette for joining us again we look forward to next time barbara russell asking what is your personal feelings when all these lions around walk by your car sometimes what does it feel like when a big pride of lions like this walk is gonna get tubs in frame here well i never really feel intimidated but it's just very overwhelming i would say have alarming good or overwhelming bed good amazing amazing science i just want to point out that tubs has no door there so when they do walk past they can get extremely close so yeah it's got an experience to have i mean a pride of over 20 lions walking past your vehicle it's one of those things very hard to describe it's quite exhilarating eh yeah for sure one of my first experiences here at malamala was having the five luwati males or my pojos and get up in front of me and start drawing and then walk right past the vehicle and it was one of my first game drives i ever took and then at times it just said it's not intimidating but i definitely felt a bit intimidated having those big lions walking past me and then dray band six asking do they look at the cars like the landscape or do you think they understand that we're in the car uh they said they definitely know that there are humans in the car and it's just that we are we behave predictably when we are in the vehicle and and as long as we behave predictably they do not feel threatened there there's the 1369 saying would you pop one in the nose if you had to i think if it came to that uh probably would yes but i don't think i'd want it to come to to the point where i have to pop one in the nose and then oh rutherford i know you've asked this before sorry for not answering the question at the time what is the most common small bird that you observe sorry if you really answered my internet is slow in the mountains in the usa sounds like you're in a good spot there yeah it's also a lot of red bull credits around yeah as well those are some of the smaller beds that so tabs has just said um and i've just said uh red bulb quelias because i have lots of doves here and yeah now we've got 300 species of birds and in our summer months i know someone asked earlier do any birds migrated during the winter none that i know of i think they're all migrated for the most part in the summer some arrive earlier and leave later but i don't think any migrator specifically for the winter then dre band six asking do they view humans differently outside the car they do very much so and if we were to get out here these lines would all be up immediately and i don't know exactly what they'd do whether they'd run or whether the 20 of them might feel confident enough to um approach but i don't i wouldn't want to test it right now but they'd certainly and behave differently to what you're seeing on screen right now then eddie veda i'm assuming it's not the real idiot but um if it is well either way we're going to scan this camera for you asking for a 360 view that's the top of tubs's head there needs a shave tubs and uh trying to stand up here so i'm just going to do the reverse all the way around so we are just to the south of malamada mainecan and eddie saying he's not the real innovator but love that you know a great musician there then meet her current saying love hearing the sounds of the bush meter we'll keep quiet for a while i don't know if that's what you're hinting at but i think you'll do it anywhere and just let you enjoy these bush songs for a little bit so very much okay just um let's break that moment of silence a bit um yes there are a few questions here what pride is this this is the kambula pride and the males that spend a lot of time with the kambula pride the gary males have been in this area for the last few days i know one of them was found this morning about five or six kilometers south of this position and if anything they may roar in you know soon to try and see where the other brother is or to try and see where the pride is and with any luck the pride might respond ella rutherford's saying you'd love to take a bird watching toy and kruger i'd certainly recommend that there's yeah lots to view levine asking where in africa we are we are currently in south africa at a game reserve called malamala game reserve we are wedged between the sabi sands gamer reserve and the cougar national park and arie berm asking have you ever been in the vehicle and been charged by an animal um it doesn't happen often but it has happened before and i think i think all guides might have a story uh but yeah for the most part we are trained to deal with those situations and yeah i haven't heard of anyone who's you know near-death experiences or anything like that by being charged by animals but it doesn't happen all that often and lego selection fan mario asking are you guys close to jimmy reserve and they are one of our neighbors we have a very large reserve and we have plenty of neighbors so many of the reserves that you might have heard of in the savvy sands do border malamala and jimmy is one of those and then are just asking do we carry anything we do carry rifles it's just standard practice and but i've never met anyone who's actually had to use their rifle a few of you just commenting that we're very lucky to be here we feel the same way we are very grateful to be here asking any cabs around there are young cabs about two or three kilometers from here that have just been discovered recently and they actually belong to this pride but they have not been introduced to this pride yet and their mother has been in this area with their cabs for a few weeks now and this pride has been on the move for the most part hunting and yeah they've been moving a lot over the last few weeks thank you then arie asking what does it take to become a ranger aria i'm going to steer you to a website um which is so there's a slight difference between a ranger and a guide and so guides take guest art and do essentially what tabs and i are doing right now is present nature to guests and rangers are far more involved in the field work and you know main maintenance of these game reserves at malamala we do both you know we uh fulfill the role of the guide as well as the ranger but we call ourselves rangers and if you're talking about the guiding aspect i would steer you towards um for gaza f-g-a-s-a if you google f-g-a-s-a that's a field guiding association of south africa you can find out all the information that you need to there you know asking how far away from these lines we are we probably about 15 20 meters away and then a few questions about the mapochos um do you know what that documentary is called bloodlines brothers in blood i think brothers implied i always forget this there's a documentary about the mapojos brothers in blood and i was at one of those sightings in that documentary and i know someone asked earlier what are my feelings about the mapojos i guess they're quite neutral but they were quite uh formidable lions and their behavior was quite strange they did i think when i was here they killed 40 odd lions and ate many of those which is quite strange behavior but yeah it was a pleasure to see them all together in their prime and just some griller with internet access saying i personally think i can take on a part of lions and then roll one asking are any birmingham's near the birmingham's if you've been listening to this podcast diary of this podcast this live stream and oscar features a guy you've heard me talking about the gari medals the one brother was seen about five or six kilometers away from here the other brother might be closer we don't know where he is and but they are not in this immediate vicinity right now at least not that we know of and nicole aaron's asking how do we know where the pride are do we look for them or do we have trackers i see one's getting up now if you're getting up now um so we don't have trackers here at malama we take on their tracking responsibility and that's how we find them for the most part sometimes you hear them roaring and we'll head into the area and find them that way sometimes you just bump into them but yeah so it's good to see them you can see they're starting to get a bit active now this is quite exciting for gaza as f g a s a not f g h s a lego silent fan mario f g asa any thank you good to have you join us again you can see some of these lines on our moving that lioness is heading directly towards camp they often walk through camp we'll see how close they get today the temperature is dropping up what was that there's an insect tonight yeah something just flew into my ear so i'm keeping my fingers crossed they don't defecate upwind yeah yeah so does it just talking about lion's cat as a deterrent i think someone mentioned earlier in this chat room that they use lion sketch to deter house cats from areas and it is a great deterrent even for rangers and then know asking is an area where someone may be hiking and possibly bump into all these ladies and there is uh no one would be hiking randomly in this area that would be very dangerous manufacturers asking do we have to if i use our weapons and no some of the lionesses walking behind the vehicle let's see how close they get they're not fast bass at all do you mind just holding it for a second so i can put my jacket on if the camelot pride is looking to get active and they're looking to head north along the harsh south of the crossway nope three so so so so so so thank you so so so yes oh that seems like the last of these leggeds are now starting to stretch and start walking the lead lionesses could be close to camp by now dave landy one of the ex-rangers here at matamata welcome dave um thank you uh dizzy you welcome just saying thanks to the rangers we appreciate that and we enjoy bringing you these live streams thanks gonna just keep on going and hopefully they don't take us out of signal here so tubs is just going to loop around yeah hopefully catch up with the front runners um but they might be close to camp already nina asking are the other animals in the area there certainly are elephants who don't know exactly where we're gonna just they are using the road so we'll give them right away we're just gonna loop around and try and meet up with some of the front runners there yeah so for those of you that are all just saying thank you if we do lose signal thanks to all of you for joining us and for asking us all of those questions and we really enjoy the interaction streams as well as our youtube videos so please keep the comments coming and if you haven't seen our youtube videos yet please head over to malamale game reserves youtube page and uh if you enjoy these sightings have a look there and if you enjoy those subscribe and like see tums has just found some of the front runners here but you're going to keep on going and just see where they head to there looks like they are still on the road there it's gonna get lumpy i think this is smart for now there's some elephants there in the distance someone was asking are there any other animals close by so there's some elephants there you can see in the foreground he has lioness see that elephants either heard or smelled these lions just scrambling at them a negative taking a wider route than the rest of them but let's just see all of them climbing up the embankment there they're not interested in those elephants so we are going to be losing what we are already losing light but if any of you heard the radio there there are a couple of vehicles that are heading this way that are going to continue following these lions should they do anything interesting i'm sure they'll film whatever they do so keep an eye out on our youtube channel this is the last of them here so i think once these lions get up this embankment we're gonna leave them to themselves and uh just like to say a final goodbye and thank you to all of the viewers that have joined us today especially to all those regulars who keep on coming back um and to tubs for these commentary and driving today hoping to see you here on safari once our international borders are open awesome and then for myself let me try and do this
