ah today I've just let us know and realize put that on silent laughs okay jfx welcome maybe just take the side buttons it yeah yeah effects welcome to Mala Mala and we are currently sitting with Gareth metalsmith he's in frame now with guy bomb and with Nicky Nicky I've forgotten you I don't think I've got your surname okay so guy and Nicky and we just ever look in the Sand River here we are currently at kick lazy hash breakfast spots very beautiful area it's a lovely day here at Mala Mala much and we need you guys help this is a bit windy today I know there's a cold front that's hit Cape Town and I think this is the warm front before the cold front and it's a little bit windy here so I just need you guys to tell us if the audio is good or bad or otherwise but what we are going to be talking about today is carnivores and you're gonna be talking about carnivores because and there has been doing research in this area for quite some time and guy is gonna tell us guy you know excuse me folks I'm just gonna be a little bit more comfortable because I don't want to be something like this with geeloger yeah yeah okay so guy maybe in the in the meantime while I'm doing this if you want to start talking about what spent there it is first of all what there it does hold on a second folks you'll get this right at some point technology time yeah typically joke yeah so there you got in have this ready okay so that's much better now okay I need you guys today okay so let's try that again tell us a bit about pen theory so it's a pen it's a charity which is headquartered in New York that funds overseas and implements project's conservation projects on cats all over the world so we we work on on tigers and snow leopards in Asia on jaguars and mud lines in the Americas and then here in Africa on on lines cheetahs and leopards and and most of my focuses on leopards I I direct Pantera's leopard program it keeps me busy leopards have a vast geographic distribution so they found from the southern tip of Africa across proposed to the African continent the middle eastern across most of it focused on unapplied conservation I'm trying to protect leopards I'm trying to improve their status but we also that we founded by our scientists and we always want to underpin our work on on strong science and that requires understanding knowing about the species that we we're looking to protect and hence studies like we have here on Mala Mala and and some of the adjoining reserves trying to get to grips with those aspects of leopard biology leopard ecology that can help inform their management and conservation in other parts of the world where they are far less protected as they are here at mono mono it's a guy you've been doing research in this area hard luck now how long has pet therapy in the sabi sands and we've been collaborating with the different lodges here with with minor modern and many of the other lodges and the the sabi sands and the soy be game reserve property for about ten years now I I started working on lipids almost 20 years ago now I'm in another part of South Africa this is in more than kwazulu-natal it's another protected area and we're on a tenure study there we learnt a great deal about lipids but I realize that ten years even that is just a very brief window on the life of a long-lived species like lipids they can live up to 18 19 years and then to really know their species you need to study multiple generations and um thankfully I'd always known about these very relaxed efforts here at the monument Mahna Mahna i am i family of mine and have allied just next door since I've been coming here since I was about two months old and I knew about these incredibly habituated cats and more importantly harder guides and documenting the lives of these animals over the years so so yeah in 2009 I started reaching out to to the to guides and that have been working in this area for the last 3040 years and starting to reconstruct their histories on these of these different cats and and so even though that the projects only been going for ten years we have data going back to the late seventies so it's over 40 years of demographic data and we've been able to reconstruct their life histories we're never born how many Cubs they produced when they died why they're what what killed them and that is that's been pivotal to to us being able to understand what drives their populations goodbye just for a second yeah just want to find out from anybody listening yeah so you got a few people in the chat room why don't any of you guys just tell us what the audio is like coming to you I just want to check that we're okay and we are continuing so you mentioned that you've been working with guides a  and also just want to mention if you have any questions I know a lot of you do follow our cats here at Mala Mala and all three and please feel free to ask and guy what's it mean like you know you say you started to weight more with guides and this is Gareth yeah gas job here at Mala Mala is not any as a ranger or guide yeah that's in the contact in [Music] individuals and keeping records of individuals so just to clarify between carrot talks about the sightings data we pull in the dots of book fitted with the dates what you're talking about is what we call the game report book and I think it's being pulled in since 1988 and basically keep a record of all big five sightings every single game drive and even if we out in the field not in a game drive and we see some other big five species will record that if they're doing anything interesting will us a note that and if there's anything else that's interesting maybe servo Carrick or anything like that drill and ajar and game reports just wanted to find out so photographic ink line that is since you say most of the range in Seminole individuals are being tracked what we know about those particular individuals who they interact with what they're killing what they're doing on a daily basis so it really is it's a unique data set I would say not just for leopards but for cats generally there's very few studies that could rival this maybe the Serengeti lion project where they've been following that population for sixty years and so many that the cheetah population there but otherwise this is this is unique and it and it's what I love is it's it's it's it's a robust scientific study but it's on the back of ecotourism operation those two initiatives working very closely together and by the means of protecting this this beautiful area but as well as us learning a great deal about a species which can then inform their conservation so it's been an incredible synergy between between bonamana between the other reserves and I know you know in the past communications a little bit slow before the internet and you know from a guy's perspective we you know seeing guests on a daily basis sort of disseminating this information and in the past it would have gone three you know research into books into textbooks and you know years down the line the guide picks up a book and reads bodice and helps us it really was I was at one stage as well and I remember then basing my knowledge and what I was telling guests on you so please then just few so they gave us a tiny snapshot into the body to the species where's no we finally have that data the sample sizes to be able to really tease apart the various different drive is that that regards to be able to make more I guess formative conversation but it we can actually use that information on that point why do we need to consider lipids and they sit at the top of the food chain typically means that if you're protecting carnivores you're often protecting most of the species that fall below them on that food chain so they are what is what is often referred to as an umbrella species the tip one line and you protect all the biodiversity with that deadline relies on to survive it's not an insult to generate the resources we need to protect it area so that that sort of and and and again healthy ecosystems require carnivores they follow a very important role when it comes to ensuring that eco systems functioning naturally so so that's with with with that's generally with carnivores and lipids it's interesting no i i often and this is even with the event faraday lipids are often assumed to work very little conservation concern they are they they float off as us incredibly resilient adaptable species and that's i guess it's because they often found in closer proximity to people and many other large carnivores they they have this extensive geographic distribution so people think well it's a fine doesn't really matter what we do to lipids they know they'll always be able to survive their numbers will be able to bounce back and as we get to know more and more about their populations across a range we're realizing that that's not the case most places real danger free fall and unfortunately now when we go in and because abusive we have to use this technology and survey catch to work out if they then how many are there and when we start using those intense research techniques we often find what is great sure so that again varies across the range so in many places leopards come into competition with people the risk that they are perceived opposed to livestock to people's lives leopards are trophy hunted many parts of their range that can actually be sort of tool for conservation if it's well managed unfortunately because vast sums of money involved often there's a tendency to over harvest the cats but I would say Sharon in southern Africa and without data think the greatest threat that the species face this is the skin trade now the legal skin trade for all spotted cats was was always a very significant threat in the 60s and 70s oh it was predominantly an international trade it was for the the third cut I trade in so Western markets this is when when fur coats were still popular then it was estimated maybe house of lipids was being killed each year your demand for for-4 spotted cat skins thankfully with quickly almost overnight and now we see a new train and this is a leopard or my revered in many African cultures and and leopard skins are worn as a symbol of prestige apart and and there are several ethnic groups that they do that and it used to be it used to be regulated against two to two sometimes royalty or high-ranking dignitaries but those cultural taboos seem to have broken down and are we see just yeah between religions and cultures thousands of users of leopard skins and I would say that is by far the greatest threat at least here regionally that I'm just going to take we're gonna take a brief pause just because my mouth is incredibly dry and I don't have a sip of water but while we take this pause and please go and have a look at a period not walk this is Pentheus website and if you do one tea and donate please feel free to do so they do you have donates buttons on their web page obviously the kinds of which involved in Mala Mala not anything but all over the world the largest big cats and so it'll be money well spent and I'm gonna get back to you what that money is based on just in a second but there's a sir if you guys tomorrow Marla's webpage we've also got a donate button which also goes towards research and some of that money is spent on camera traps and gonna talk about about camera traps in a second and from Marla Marla's perspective a lot of it would be spent on our anti poaching unit and to protect these animals in the reserve obviously there's poaching the guys wherever there's wildlife just make a little bit about that so please feel free to donate to either we would appreciate that if anybody RC questions that we can also just reach out and continue talking [Laughter] that makes a quick what a break so be kind be sitting wherever we are Mala Mala will be sitting in a lipid away proud of lions territory and right now these two are sitting in Maxim smell is an interesting case some of you who follow our cats all know that Maxim's male is kind of the new kid on the block he's been around for about a year and you push this morning interesting for us because he is quite a nervous lipid so we assume that he's come from creational Park and we don't know much about Kruger National Park members there aren't working areas early as they are here in the sabi sands or dark wastes in some sense Walmart mullet and the lipid scientist electron decals as they are here in the Saudi sense and in mild mana so we assume that the Machine smell has come from the Kruger National Park and guy I know you've got your collecting data from Kruger from sabi sands from Mala Mala from all over the shop you just tell us exactly how you go about collecting them no smoking a little bit about the guides input from us clicked engage for you three main methods you said the guides the sightings data which they capture in a customized software which we've developed and that's roll dots and Trust about 20 Dodgers have some on Amara and in several lodges in sabi sand Game Reserve and hobby game reserve and all capturing standardized data for us and from every sighting I think we so in total we have about 90,000 lipid sightings within our database each year we get about 10,000 sightings incredible in any given time and that's awesome we're not just learning about the lipids we're learning about the whole large carnival guild which obviously has a significant influence on what lipids do and how they behave but it's not as easy we don't have these photogenic cards to [Music] so we have a camera with a motion detector that's a guide I shouldn't forget because it's not everyday absolutely and so what that motion detector does is it sir basically picks up changes in temperature as an animal moves across the front of the screen takes a photograph and if it's a leopard it's fantastic we can recognize the individual because they you tell unique spot patterns but like a human fingerprint so we can tell which which cat it is and then we can use strong these powerful statistical models to estimate the numbers of lipids within a particular area also we don't obviously it just photographs of leopards we get photos from Gina tells us a huge amount about where lipids occur and and how many they are and if we do those surveys over time so this is the second time are we running a camera type survey on Mala Mala we can see how populations change over time which from a management perspective it's probably the most important so information on on population trend and we run these surveys on long term research that the population here on mana mana is at capacity this is this is probably the best protected native population in the world a professional well then we know it is at that level which is sick sort of button but pray by other competitors and it remains relatively stable over time so we could use this as off control we can use this to say okay just as how many lepers should be in this area how does that compare to different parts of Kruger where there she might be more heavily impacted by poaching or our neighboring community areas where there is they come into conflict with performance was bad people generally and so then we we have a sort of a benchmark on what to aim for when it comes to rolling out our conservation programs and also to to determine what types of interventions might be more applicable in these different spots but a PhD student currently working on these surveys I think she's running about 10 surveys across the broader Kruger area and them and already the results have been illuminating so like I said we we typically talk about population density so this would be the number of leopards per square kilometre per 100 square kilometers and here at Mala Mala which is some of the highest densities in the world we get about 10 or 11 leopards per 100 square kilometers and you could contrast that to a place in the central core of the Kruger where lipids we assume are quite protected because it's just quite far from the boundaries and yellow it's obvious jacuzzi and then it drops down to about seven or eight lipids 400 square kilometers are still reasonably high but if we get much closer to the boundaries to Pretoria scope had to and we need to do all of these which are hard up against the boundaries that's right down to the habitats is very good lots of food is wonderful cover so we would expect similar leopard numbers but it's much lower and we assume that's probably because of poaching or cats moving up the reserve and being persecuted when they do that so we maybe see this whole gradient of density as you moved it from a very well protected population to one which is still in a protected area but just because of its proximity to people in a much greater pressure and then we can start intervening to try and recover those numbers now what's what sort of interventions do you undertake it depends um Kruger would be working very closely with the statutory authority still with the sarcana National Parks tomato protected so that's through anti poaching measures it could be working with the communities so engaging very closely with the communities living from the boundaries to work on how they perceive leopards and other wildlife are these days typically perceived as a disadvantage in ways that we can change that to be advantageous I mentioned that one of the real threats to lipids is this demand for skins people wear leopard skins as a status symbol so one of our very effective projects has been developing to follow leopard skins these these synthetic skips to replace fake skins at Detroit to replace authentic skills and and and that has been remarkably successful we worked with several ethnic groups know that the biggest one is a religious group called the Nazareth Baptist Church or the shimmy Church there are literally millions of Jimmy members many of whom desire a leopard skin may they see it as a means of being able to worship and and we've worked very closely with the church leadership to try and embrace a sort of a conservation ethos they are now sort of they promote they endorse this use of synthetic skins and we've donated over 18,000 of these these faux skins and essentially if we if we first condone eight it is a lipid saved and and I'm sorry I think that has been a very effective program and we've seen lipid numbers in places which were previously heavily pushed approached start to rub on and start to recover and that that documented through these camera traps and then just a curiosity you mentioned that you develop this camera trap yourself why so poor not yourself your organizer maybe you did yourself even a self I'm banned from all technology but but but we we rely incredibly heavily on these we produce about five these each year and we use these across that is a Africa Latin America they are the best ways of surveying cats of counting cats while we did it ourselves typically the only people that were using these remote cameras previously were were hunters they were putting them up at deer blinds to be able to see you and I sort of I guess trophy animal would come in and because of that that way they were designed accordingly so they had relatively slow trigger speeds not particularly user-friendly for what we wanted where we needed to play them rapidly access some downloaded images quickly we need a very fast trigger speed and we needed to be cost-effective when you're making these and customize it to our needs and so this is not a seventh-generation we we've we've come in a lot to and I did my PhD we were we were still using a print version that's that's old I am bluetooth so we have an application that's now researchers these days wait super super user-friendly and very effective and we learn a great deal about the cats from this okay bits of you watching will you just let me know if there are people asking questions I don't see any showing up on my my phone yet sir I just wanna make sure it's not just a technical area so excuse me guy for a second so when I checked my messages yeah and there we go I'm getting some messages we are getting questions I just can't see them oh yeah we're gonna try do this again yeah any welcome it's perspective on poaching of big cats front upon it it's a real issue not just for lipids for most cats two different types of poaching I guess that indirect the more incidental poaching where we're snails are set typically for bush meat so these would be for antelope but but because they're unselective mini carnivores are caught in that even if carnivores aren't quartered in in snares they can severely reduce prey numbers and if lipids don't have food then they can't survive so that's one type of poaching that we have to deal with and then there's the more targeted poaching so we're because there is this real demand full efforts kins so poachers will come in they might least slay Secaucus with poison and so specifically targeting leopards or we'll hang up a bait in a tree and put snares are on there and and so we we have to try to combat both of those and that's done engaging communities like I said trying to increase the benefits that people living with law the wildlife can um can realize and then also working with protected area staff to better secure lipid and other carnaval habitats such a to improve their the protection of those areas okay and then Mia Ferrara welcome back saying is it true that there is no such thing as Black Panthers they are black rabbits lipids there's a tree mark it is hard alright it is true it's just another name for a black leopard so black leopards are there they're just a it's a monistic version of the the spotted cat that we see here and we don't we don't get black leopards in Mala Mala and in south africa probably the furthest soft that you would find black leopards in in Africa is in ah closer to the equator in in northern Kenya Ethiopia those areas and still quite rare there but many more projects in Asia so in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and Thailand where these are gains forested habitats all of the lipids they are black and just that that black pillage is much better suited to that type of an environment they're that much more camouflaged and and yup better better to hunt I have worked from some of our projects and there it is leeches is pretty much anything that gives you a raft stings or bye to you but yeah that's where they typically excellent miss Adam Andrus welcome any painted wolf okay it's gonna say scroll through some of these messages so you got a lot more people now that we starting to answer your questions sorry about that there's a question why do most cats like lipids just like water do your lipids just like water and resilient I like most cats are all cats the same maybe some cats actually very much like water so Tiger seems to quite enjoy water I'm probably the most not the most aquatic large cat I should say so there's a fishing cat which spends a lot of time in water that's a small cat but um the most aquatic large catches the Jaguar they spend a great deal of time in water catching caiman so there I guess the South American version of a crocodile and capybaras which are large rodent that live along rivers so they very aquatic and a nepeta I'm do cross the rivers when they're flowing and they wear these records from from Mala Mala of leopards being killed by crocodiles but but so they don't both lipids and lines and hesitate to get with sheets I don't know if I've actually seen cheetah swimming but but there's records of it sir so no they don't get wet wait if necessary then to you hunts are you still busy they know okay welcome back you hung and you just sent me Jane welcome back any okay let's see okay Kovacs welcome you won't be pissy asking do you guys also do you work in easy case it in we do in that's where I am assuming he may be referring to Isabel or kwazulu-natal Wildlife which is the the provincial authority in the cuisine to tell Provence we do a lot of work there similarly running camera traps across most of their protected areas in the province so some of the better-known one Joshua employs D Game Reserve koozie Game Reserve Timmy Game Reserve somebody we also run regular surveys and that helps inform management and that is one of the strongholds of the shimmy church that I was talking about so we do a lot of community work through their resume natal province and with the provincial of party with ekn wobbler okay I'm just trying to see some more questions yeah there's a lot of people saying hello and okay so Miss Adam Andrus and maybe this is for you Nikki I'm gonna have to get out of the way maybe turn the camera so Nikki can answer this but the question is can you elaborate on genealogical research you're doing with sabi sands in Walla Walla what are you doing with a sketch so maybe you just went to and speak us free excuse me Frank's gonna get a bit wobbly for a second [Music] in Mala Mala and the sabi sands in order to get DNA samples from the resident caste and so how that works is on the outside of the scat there are cells from the lipid that have collected there as it's passed through the digestive tract so it's typically not a lot of cells but there are enough for us to get the DNA of the lipid and that enables us to do a lot of things particularly in a population like this where the individuals are well known so mom is unknown Cubs are known and having the DNA from males enables us to be able to work out who the father of the Cubs are and that's that's great from an individual point of view and it's lovely to know and work out the dynamics on the ground conservation processes that we don't always know are playing out and without being able to dive deeper using DNA so for example different populations usually have different slightly different genetic signatures so if you have a new sample a new DNA profile of a lipid you can often tell the area that it originated from so this can be used in something like the illegal at wildlife trade if we get a sample of us confiscated illegally the skin and we can use DNA to pinpoint where that lipid was poached and this can identify hotspots poaching hot spots that we may not have known that occurred and this can then inform the conservation and protection of lipids in those areas so it's gets a great way to collect DNA from wildlife it's non-invasive as long as you as you know the ID of the individual and and you can you can use it to piece together these familial relationships as well as inform quite a lot of conservation and it's obviously it's easy to collect and as long as you can get good DNA from that sample it's a great way to do it great and then guy thank you my vision I think guy here's a question yeah and you wanna go for it sure dad hi John Sanders I saw it video featuring you know attack against a group of Lannisters and their cubs much the lines disappeared one - and and lionesses will vigorously defend their youngsters against any threat even male lions where they stand little chance given the size difference so I would I would guess it probably was a a rearguard action and minuses are there for the most great months Kimberly Lopez how do we go about financially supporting Panthera Kimberly can get there a Dutch or embed you should find it and then met P say hi to Megan fun started ins mom she watches you every day hi I'm Megan fun started mom joining us we really enjoy the comments that you guys and we enjoy having the company and all the questions yeah sorry that it's taken so long to you to get to these patients but we here now yeah just gonna okay goodbye or even then it's but not here in Sydney Australia off to bed okay and here's one Carol hall do you know how prevalent bovine TB is within the sabi sand Mala Mala labor population so I'm gonna hand this one over to Nikki because she worked on bovine TB in Kruger for quite some time I know that there has been leopards have tested positive in the reserve in the past as you mentioned why bovine TB work was in Kruger but also on Buffalo so I think he's trying to shake the responsibility one so lipids do you get Timmy they can do I know they have in the park but yeah it's usually there is what's called a spillover host normally so lipids don't they don't transmit and maintain t be within the leopard population but sometimes they get it incidentally but 40 years now of life history data demographic we have a great deal of information but what the main causes of lipid deaths are of mortality disease TB other types of disease sarcoptic mange does crop up turn to pond but it is a it's probably only responsible for less than 5% of deaths so so it is not a it's not a major driver of this system that doesn't mean we shouldn't be vigilant and and we be aware if some type of epidemic would move through I guess it's quite poignant at the moment an example of this and a cat population would have been in the Serengeti I think it was back in the early 90s where distemper canine distemper got into the lion population and that that population is roughly was then about 3,000 odd lines and it killed a third of the population in six months but even there with such a sort of catastrophic population decline within a few years that population it bounced back and knowledge actually significantly higher than it was at that stage so so cats typically a few you if the conditions suit the numbers can rebound quickly but yeah long long answer to that disease in this particular system is is not a significant cause of lipid yes great back freak asking D then use the information just for territorial maps of the lipids and or lines in guiding and I'm sure it helps you in your research as well absolutely so we use those sightings and and the last thing is because because Mala Mala but many of the the surrounding reserves of capturing data and and the cats of strict and we can we can map those territories we can see where individuals are and who they're interacting with and that's a key part of the research and then king of the beasts how do you classify lions to use the eight subspecies method or the three subspecies mitten by king of the beasts I'm guessing you're referring to leopards obviously right yeah so said that eight eight recognized subspecies would be I guess the method and that and that you that's that's the more recent classification it needs to be a that there's at the moment edek samples have been collected and detailed analyses undertaken that that will probably be split into more subspecies again from the meaningful conservation units and they don't necessarily align with and kept on being the branch of the cold front you thinking of Jana you say from Kate on and do you think lipids and zuly land will ever be as the bitter a cheaters in the sabi sands a key from Devon I hope so I didn't worked in finding proper game reserve for for many years and and when I first started working here spots and and and offices for the ten years that we spent there both with some significant changes to conservation policy in the province and the country numbers were able to rebound and also then with some three sensitive viewing by the father the guides there they operate similarly here tomorrow mala and cats started to evacuate and and Nikki now actually visited Pender last year and it was a real treat we we had several episodes and it was it was great to be able to see how that population has changed over time again so it's a combination of a lipids being able to survive for long enough to get obituaries and then for the field guides putting in the hard yards and they're being very sensitive to the cats and a lot yeah that from our perspective when we first arrived here as a guide and I'm sure it's like this throughout the sabi sands you've there's a lot of emphasis that is put on hard to drive around these animals and we've got a long history of driving around the cats supreme ask you for cats and certain big five species and we have we use fleets are the same vehicles you driving the same yeah we always approach at the same angle and you just try and stay as consistent as possible and when we do a cheese cats if it is a nervous cat we'll give them some time to get used to us maybe not approach as close as we usually would and then eventually they do relax and just take some mother and to become relaxed and then the youngsters follow suit your honor to please see asking a question here and in the large park areas where vehicle access is limited do you guys walk into those areas to place cameras do you make use of helicopters tracking leopards by vehicle foot helicopter drones so typically by foot so in places like Kruger most sites and 90% of the sites that we work in we have to yes you're a lot of walking into it and with them we were able to put up I think 12 stations working some countries like Saudi Arabia or Mongolia sort of big mountains wheel if it's live we maybe we're lucky if we get one station up a day so so you know we rely on yeah there it's it's it's a bit harder it's all done by foot but lovely to be out there hiking um maybe not again we've gone up in a helicopter and being dropped off for the station normally it's part of an anti-poaching operation when you really do feel like a rock star but but that's not the norm right and you just commenting on the hip elites saying she loves people like applets we can get you guys some do the ill skinny lipid scene have Bev on TV from TV from Liz that is looking in poor condition maybe it's it's been injured while hunting and it's struggling to feed itself maybe it's the youngster which is still developing and hunting techniques so that doesn't necessarily always mean that it's that it has TB it might but the condition of the catch is not a is not the solver the first symptom that you would look for here as a as an indication that it's disease there could be many other reasons why that catches isn't normally some most causes of leopard death here tend to be violent it's it's because they so the primary cause of death there's other lipids and males killing Cubs committing infanticide when a new male comes into area sometimes you might even kill another metal or even adult females and they can trying to fin their day and the youngsters so that is the leading cause of mortality is other lipids and following that it'd be lions hyenas and so that is that would probably can't fall so it will turn into an intra specific mortality would probably account for about 90% of digits it's drowning fires and disease cubs orphaned if their mother was killed and every now and again starvation but but very very rarely in this particular population then luck TBG do you guys ever run into purchase if so what do you do when you run into them luck we don't run into poachers they for the most part don't want to be seen there are poachers throughout Africa all over in the world every day is wild I just punch up on patrons and but for the most part they don't want to be seen so we don't we barely ever run into them and miss and Amanda is saying I'm guessing his favorite as a leopard guys that true so what I think I still get it as excited and we saw the maxims Mel did a great job in finding him and I exaggeration IO has I'm excited noise I was the first time I saw the lip it as a young kid so think about that I stopped doing this absolutely my favorite how about you I know a lot of the guides yeah just I mean it's leopard country this I mean a lot of it guides are lipid match I certainly enjoy live that's a party unit [Laughter] it's quite interesting because between ourselves you know we've got YouTube channel if any of you folks don't know about our YouTube channel we can only live streaming on about 10% of the property where we have large stream coverage or we have cell phone coverage and but for the race the sightings we take videos and then we upload them on our YouTube channel so if you haven't seen those please go have a look tomorrow Molitor working on the neighbor's property Emmy bumped into them on the boundary video don't mind and then just interestingly it seems like a lot of the public art they really enjoy the Lions so our lion and video is do really well but not necessarily lipids I know there's a lot of locals here maybe you guys want to tell us what your favorites are back freak setting is a nation of concern when it comes to put it's another good one teach on Saturday I would suggest not as I was mentioning when we were talking about the reserves and kwazulu-natal it's only when when reserves are very well protected that that animals can evacuate that there's an opportunity to obituary and so only one source those capsules sufficiently secure will they become a relaxed enough to view and and so generally that only happens where they're there they're at little risk and so no I think that I think that advantages that you can get from a habituated leopard being showcased the species and being such an attraction from a ecotourism perspective is far more benefit than than any potential harm that habituation yes on that's on that note for poaching if anybody wants to be in the hand is for anti poaching teaming some of the menu will be used with these camera traps as well and amongst other things you can just have a look on our website to get more details in and then here's a question from our mum is the Fairtrade starting to have an impact on poaching of Captain Africans it is a concern it's an not so much that we know of with leopards and but certainly with lions the bone trade appears to be on the increase probably the best evidence for that comes from a nearby reserve just only the eastern boundary of Kruger is the Limpopo National Park and panther i ran a project there for many years where we were documenting multiple incidents of targeted poaching of lines and interviews with informants and suggested that those were four bones that were but these are typically and being used as a proxy for Tiger bones the Tiger bone wine is is in great demand for the traditional far eastern mitten markets and major threat to Tigers and now I guess has taken Tiger numbers a decreased it looks like that other cats are being sourced either to be sold as Tigers or to be sold even under their own species name so it's certainly something that we've got our eye on and and yeah so it's about here and in East Africa there seems to be a general increase we don't yet know the scale of the trade it's it's because all of these illegal activities because of their illicit nature it's hard to quantify but we're doing a great deal of work on that to get to the bottom of it and then see how best to address that then Maggie and coordinate hiccup button welcome back how long maybe this is four year Nikki how long do the numbers how low do the numbers of Laettner's have to sink to you before the genetic pool becomes non viable to answer specifically but with lipids I think the numbers could go incredibly low because they're very good disperses so the danger mostly comes when you've got a small population that goes very low and it's it's very tightly controlled we know lipids they they really can move they don't easily get restricted into one small place so you'll you'll have young animals moving sometimes vast distances to spread their genes elsewhere and so as long as there's even just a little bit of connectedness between populations even very low numbers in one area doesn't necessarily mean that anything negative is happening so it's really about connectivity between between lipids rather than numbers per se okay here's another one thank you king of the beasts how prevalent are cheetahs servals caracals and other small cats in South Africa I think it depends very much where you go to you know genus discovered a few of the smaller predators on Mala Mala with the camera traps and that's I don't know we went strolling to that one I think you wanted it I think it depends away so that they favor different habitat types a serval you're generally finding in Gracia or wetland areas den sorry parts of ok wait they have that type of suitable habitat simple numbers already hi there was actually a recent paper that came up from Sasebo one of the one of these big admit was it wasn't a nature reserve it was it was a refinery and and there was just ridiculously high several numbers I think because it was all the other large carnivores have been extirpated and beautiful wetland habitat with lots of rodents and so they were doing very well and caracal often in the drier parts of the country but but also they then come in and along with some jackal species into real conflict with with sheep farmers and there's lots of persecution a caracal so so they are they're they're they're fun throughout much of the country and in their status fairies with regards to whether they're in a protected area or not and in what's happening there also to protect the numbers will be able to Rabanne so to give you an indication that there may be roughly 20,000 lines left alive today most of those lines been fun and southern the East Africa just a strange statistic which you might not think of is is there's probably more lines left in me all right a few lines left arrived and yet often you wouldn't think of line as a species of conservation concern and so they they really are they they're they are they are on the conservation radar there's a lot of effort going into trying safeguard populations and for all of these cat species I remain very positive because of the way they breed and like I say if conditions suit they can bear a bond very quickly and it's different it's different to some working on elephants it's a much longer lived and slower life history then then catch to you and so then it's it's harder for those to recover those populations for lines for leopards okay we didn't draw Angie nuts about that lipid we're just gonna go see it might be the maxims male in which case you might be a little bit nervous but you are gonna see if we can find them those functions we are but I think it's quite apt because I was just reading through these comments yeah and a lot of people have been saying that their favorite is lipid as well so we've just managed to spot on I hope you can actually see it and I lost my liver yet it's so FX just trying to get our lives organized yet say us walking just along this to check in front of us there is well done guys every see from this angle he is but she looks like he's coming back if we're not sure here this is if it is the Nexus male it is said Garrett's just confirmed it is which is quite amazing that he's this relaxed they'd be good Oh beautiful Katie I want to know how you organize that so this is turned into a I don't know if you want to just call fear I know you want to appreciate the sighting that I if you DC questions you want to answer from time to time feel free but that yeah yeah you see Christians that ye hi what is the density of lipids in the broader Kruger area so your study in 1983 in part to sri lanka suggested it at least 15 leopards 400 square case so it varies dramatically and probably so a maximum density here in the sabi sands of around 1112 leopards 400 kilometers down to I would guess and some of maybe they're the less productive sites in the north ugly to three leopards 400 square kilometers some of the earlier density estimates for the species and you realize now some of them are over estimates and those based on telemetry data on sightings just because if the cats were often using much bigger areas than we imagined and then were actually sampled and because of that it overestimates population density but but I have heard in part two that these are very hot so thanks for that question sir hi Oh Gina Gina was the case - that's not so long ago and yeah fantastic God you know I hope you you got to see some of these wonderful Mala Mala lipids yeah I certainly did sure is going to an area that you can't really access I think I'll just stand by in the shade for now and maybe get a long distance view of him and that's about as good as the maxims male sighting gets for the most part we're not gonna try and put a few there unless you want to watch just try and get unstuck yes just back to the comments again and a man was saying guy has leopard eyes or than guy nice toilet welcome to Kimmie daily SP SP Robin Sewell epic Kendra's saying she always wanted to see me alive brilliant so if you can't see me it's just standing ap Devon is Adam Parker I've just seen a message pop up on my screen there Rocco wasn't arranging yeah not too long ago are you Parker just wait you'll an awesome driver very amazing welcome back bond amount of magic rock crewson's yeah is quite relaxed lot more less than when you're in your last shock thank you - Jacque Jacque used to capture the sightings date set for us a few years ago I mean you did a wonderful job so thank you thank you Joe and mrs. Levin how much do you pay Maxon's for his guest appearance quite serendipitous and I say I told you it wouldn't be your last maximum sighting this morning yes Gina in saying Mala Mala is the best in Maxim's mail is my wife's favorite animal so this is typically what the maxims mail does to us you'll see him and then he disappears into the Phragmites like he's done right now so watching him walk down the road like that isn't something that we get treated to too often so that's quite quite nice I think I spotted him at just the right moment are you getting tired of us talking no Morgan welcome just asking what we're looking at just chindan Dylan we've been having a Q&A with guy and Nicky from Pantera and they've been educating us on carnivals and what specifically lipids in this area midway through our Q&A session guy I just happened to spot the Mexicans male lipid you scrolled past us probably not too far from Gareth we didn't tell him about it he was filming it and we've just been following him he's now just walked off into the reeds whose name Patel asking if it's gnashing witty there he is on the other side of the river and we don't actually see them on the eastern side of the water course all that often having said that when he was named he was on the eastern side of the horse standing you want to try a new front yeah we can do that you're gonna take over their trip there's a lot in there this tummy yep when there is a holler friends are writing since the mating season for pollen they are very distracted and adult grams and so it's a good meal for leopard let it just show you what happens when you you have other priorities I should say lust view of him visual of it Morgan are you near Kemp I'm gonna have to ask that for kilometers from hello hello in Calgary it's a long way from here you're gonna have to come and visit my tomorrow at some stage good ready can cats get covert 19 yes they can some tigers and other cat species tested positive for covert the Bronx Zoo a few months ago very unlikely that they would be able to they wouldn't transmit that to people and it's unlikely to have an effect on the cats themselves but yes they can apparently Jack Frost has got something special sorts we should hear about so we are currently just south of Maxim's Lockhart and Maxim's lookout is a lookout point that ever looks at this view that you see here and much much more its but higher than where we are currently and the Maxim's mail is named after that lookout point you know hard destruction during mating season was understandable it may be but it clearly is a dangerous distraction I've seen quite a few multiple leopard sightings is that odd behavior or now considered the norm I think for the most part it's two beacons considered odd just because up until very recently we didn't have those types of data where I'm wait animals were relaxed enough to to allow us to so they get that window into their daily lives so so leopards often referred to as a quintessential solitary cat but um because they are so relaxed and and beautiful for so long and so frequently at rest like matamata we have seen that they say they do socialize and that they are very aware of other lipids bordering and their home ranges and and quite frequently guides are viewing males and females sharing kills and sometimes males mating with two females at one time - mouths mating with a female so two types of behavior you would never never in the past have associated with a solitary cat like a leopard and hopefully as as the study continues and we get to learn more about this population we can we can understand that the drivers of these types of interactions and and what they what they really do mean for leopard lives yeah but know this they certainly are more more solitary than we assumed in the past just on that topic they can try and see them just on the edge of the reeds and I think you'll be able to see him but let me get my finger in there he's over there somewhere you just can't be on the reeds again we have been many pop stars on that stand Bank doctor they will okay say thanks gonna leave this up to you should we loop around we're gonna wait 30 seconds for the response look over there answer Bianca parodies question [Laughter] the little Morgan asking does asleep at have any cabs we've seen this leopard mate with the island female we've seen am a truth as another the three rivers female has tried to mate to them but I don't know if anybody's actually seen him mate today she still quite young Bush male and the flat rock male so whether or not that cub is his cub toll now but hopefully the DNA collection through the scats and that's what guy and Nikki are going to be looking into a little bit more now we can tease apart that and figure out if he is the father of the ink of any females come right say the responses loop around jeana okay say Oh God here we go again here on comments DT defects that's gonna take us apart gonna take us about put it in here five minutes to get her on that side we just gotta find a road and then you're gonna cross a bridge that I don't think we've driven across on a live stream it's called waste waste Street bridge it's a lovely view from up top there Chesterton Bengal tiger versus African lion who wins not you sure and I'm guessing we'll never find out given that they don't they don't occur in the same area there are lines still in Asia and the deer forest but no Tigers there go past this camera station I think let's rather just get to the limit it's not often you catch Maxim's nails they're chilled out because I bought some good Gigi didn't have actually be better schooling us and how to find lipids at the same time just put G not anticipate thanking Abby how successful on the South China Tigers in South Africa sorry I quite it's a bunch of that one might I'm not too sure how that program is going in kolesberg and I know they certainly haven't taken those Tigers back in so we're gonna have a question yeah miss and Amanda something it is snapping can lipids the tips familial connection through setting and sores again it's something that we have reignited try get to the bottom of this how do they distinguish relatedness between each other I I would assume that they could that through scent would be the most obvious and yet you see bizarre behaviors that when a female lipid loses its offspring often she will host their offspring feed on it and then spend some time in an area calling for the cup so almost not recognizing that sippy cup also will be they haven't been experiments done with lipids but they have been experiment playback experiments done with lions whereby they they've recorded the cause of not own lines and they've played those back to other relatives or unfamiliar individuals and certainly the response shows that that for relatives they often will not respond to them if they hear a relative calling nearby unfamiliar animals is played back within their territory they they will respond very rapidly so that suggests that they can actually distinguish whether that animal is related or not it's can or not another interesting factor cats can cut during the same types of experiments they played so if they had a pride of three lionesses lying in the center of their territory then they would play back one line is to that those three and and almost every time the three would respond is an elephant's over there yeah I don't know how Monomoy to find any animals with Penn Theatre as much here but and so yeah there was real honest as they played one honest as lionesses will always respond try and chase that that individual to those three lionesses they typically never responded so they were able to discern the number of individuals calling in what the relative risk to themselves were and so that was quite a nice output from that study it was in the Serengeti some of Craig Becker's work so I was sitting at a side sequence guy yep and some of my guests the two male lions and what eastern part of the reserve and its first time we had seen them on the reserve and they started roaring and one of my guests video to them roaring and he wanted to check if he got the shot and he played it back and they heard themselves and ran off the property never to be seen again okay maybe it comes down to the intelligence of the individual it's affects just a quick disclaimer here and just because you've lived Iran doesn't mean you'll find a begin these cats are notorious for disappearing but hopefully we do find them again she's gonna get into the last area where he was last seen a giraffe staring at your office standing there intraframe this way we were initially parked if it is a bit further north nature off is it just gonna be a little bit silent for the time being he's nearing the area where here's last seen say we just concentrating on trying to find him again if you're not responding to your questions right now winds died down completely not the late afternoon standby for a second see buddy have fun it I can see what he weighed glasses not question 4 - Garrett's from king of beasts what a monster school you need to complete to become a safari guide well it's recommended that you complete your full school career that's yeah and after mitrik you can if you want to have a look at for Garza's website you probably get the most your best answer they feel guarding Association of South Africa and you'll find all the details necessary there and or you can go the long reach like Gina did and studied zoology and what else t net and botany and then head for Gaza on top of that after that but JA it'll give you all the details of what you need to become a guide it's my mum yeah I'm um love that DNA samples of scat can confirm paternity of Cubs that it is fantastic it's amazing it's probably the less glamorous part of field research picking up Carnivale poo but we do it tells us a huge amount and we now have a DNA material from from over 100 different lipids in the Mala Mala and and sabi sand can reserves so it's a very exciting new avenue of the research this is that one day it is insist through the major who the firaon drew decides winning way say guys do you nuts just trying to get a stuck yet one who there's there's some mixed results with regards to that um some of the work that dr. put upstander in Namibia in etosha did I'm looking at lion hunting behavior suggested that they were very coordinated he actually sort of related a pride a pride of hunting lions as a sort of similar sort of strategy as you would in in rugby and with different positions and and and it appeared that lines and that much more open system needed to to adapt and needed to to implement this this more coordinated approach here in Kruger and in the Serengeti where they've similarly looked at having particular all the lines don't seem to take and convince up of wooden direction things like that and and this is often why I guess their their success rates are quite low I guess all the females in a pride might be more experienced and and thus appear to be more successful but but it doesn't stop younger females trying to get involved and often spoiling a hunt because of it all young males for that matter so so that seems to be somewhat habitat specific is how synchronised or coordinated lion prides are with regards to their hunting techniques okay so that's independent but but on the prey species holiday hunting yeah absolutely so it's a bigger prey mare lines are that much more important things like Buffalo male lions are very much more involved just because of their biggest size greatest strength yeah position sure and this eye can all of us are today camera traps enough that will be something you'll be looking at absolutely there's a week we can because we can recognize individual highness from the photographs we can use some of the statistical models to your estimate number the only problem is say from our six week survey of mana model we might expect you gets a hundred and fifty photographs of lipids will almost certainly get over thousand photographs of spotted hyenas and so it's very difficult to wade through that and work out how many individuals they are and we can increasingly you rely on on artificial intelligence on computers doing it for us but but often the best way of serving hyenas of counting hyenas and working out the relative densities in an area is using whole apps there's a squirrel alarming yeah maybe it's in the leopard but we stopped because in that tall grass intraframe is alarm calling it's a tree squirrel jeana's just having a look at the ground there to see if you can see any lip attracts may be delivered walk by so you can't see anything there back to the question the best way to to containers is to do a cool app survey so you would you would pay the song typically of a distressed animal maybe a coffin distress a buffalo coffin distress daring or player co-op and see if that hyena responds and we find another individual hyena play the call up from three kilometers away and we work out what the response likelihood is at different distances and then so we know if we put a hole up at a site and we let's just say we work out the roughly half of all I eaters respond in a five kilometer radius and we can't nie lives at a spots then we know all their likely 20 behind is in that sampled area so that's typically the best way of estimating hyena numbers and it's something that we hope to do at Mala Mala in the in the in the near future it's all on our plans going forward with the reserve so stay changed just the if said that's about to come out is wig guy and Nikki are doing some collapse and they called myself and Dan Bailey up as well not only lions and hyenas so if you wanna have a look just like and subscribe our YouTube channel it should be coming out either tonight or tomorrow the only very experienced guard would have been able to pick out that was well that's a banner saying it's definitely a we should just side the vehicle again thanks sir this is a very difficult broken terrain to drive through here so I don't think we're gonna attempt crashing through that Bush over there and then I Barbara Russell see this place brings back wonderful memories I'm sure dad's it's I don't get to spend that much time here but it is truly spectacular Linda from California is your project Panthera the same one on Zooniverse it is yes because of the just the first quantity of camera chip images we get millions of camera trap photographs every year we struggle to to identify the species at all those photographs ourselves we just don't have the staff capacity so we rely on on on volunteers Linda possibly like yourself then you dare defy what is captured in the in the camera trap images I'll admit it's incredibly addictive you just want to look at each one and see what what comes next and then um and then we have basically algorithms that were cut or reliable those classifications are so if ten people say it's the same animal so ten people say it's an Impala then it gets full of the system as an Impala and and and so on so it is a very effective way for us to to be able to process and analyze our data it's also a wonderful way for the public to be able to to really engage and become part of very important research and I'm a huge help to ourselves Klein you should sit actors is camera catalogue camera catalog surveys we run here on Mala Mala as well as many other places not only on lipids but on snow leopards and jaguars cheetahs small cats all of those are posted up there and those dead oh we we need your help we need to be processed your assistance and others is vital to the work we do so thank you very much hey Kimberly Lopez has there been a female leopard successfully area three cubs turtle - they have been a few we know we arrived dead on about 450 leopards from the Mala Mala and sabi sands game reserves that's over the 40 odd years that we've been documenting reproductive events and we know that that little stars is varied from 1 to 3 and our mortality is very high so only roughly maybe 35% of Cubs make it to independence which is normally at about a year and a half old but there have been a few mothers that have got the three cubs - independence there was a very successful female leopard yet and Mala Mala known as the gobos one female that was active here for many years and she she managed to do that I think as the first litter of four leopard cubs it has been documented elsewhere in other parts of Africa that leopards can have four cubs and end up in captivity up to six Cubs but but never in the sabi sand we know the most we've ever seen is three yeah for those thirsty guides up there this is the lip wing um nothing that's a subjective question whether when lipids or lines losses become is there any evidence of morning while they to focus on the task of raising the remaining Cubs and I don't know whether that process of them searching for that cub even after like I say sometimes they've they've eaten it if that's some form of mourning potentially um I don't know um often you will see though they um they generally when when a cub is lost often an entire divert areas lost but whose life can say it's off it's the cause of death is frequently violent and full winter might be killed by another male leopard or by another predator and and they do they start they'll they'll resume mating very soon after that so within days but could as they have such low success rates it's important that they do that they resume cycling and try to get to another litter going as quickly as possible again genus I think that's slightly bumble back back toward camp either way Stu no Eastern bank but maybe way some banks could be the signal missus Andromeda's you correct the Nanga female mother which was in you later she did she raised she raised three cubs to independence one of those big number think yep one of them being of my old lady has territorial in the western part of the sabi sands the Indian lady Mel and and then the last one died but but after independence folks are we just gonna slowly drive back towards the max and smell was last seen and then we're gonna slowly head back to camp let us know if you'd like us to keep on streaming all the way back to camp and guy and Nikki also have had a very long day out here they've been sitting up camera traps since early this morning and it also like to give them a break and just maybe it's a good time just to say thank you to both of you thanks Mickey you know speedily and thanks to guy for joining us and for answering all these questions we really appreciate the work you're doing here as guides and I'm sure everybody out there preciate all the information that you have to give to them thank you yeah thank you very much it's as I say that all the data that is collected on this project is is done by guides it's it would not be possible without the hard work of yourselves and others so no we are deeply did it so this I think you teach all the guards on tape to the owners and the managers at Mala Mala and the other reserves it's um yeah this is it's a great privilege to be able to work in and just to be part of us thank you thank you very much thanks and thanks to all of you out there can you join us some of you quite religiously we appreciate your support and we always appreciate your comments on our youtube channel as well as these live feeds it's a lot of fun being out here with you and we just feel happy to share this with you it's an amazing area and yeah thankful to BRT and thankful that we can share this at years old yes a genus just pointing out that he has lost senior Aceh I think girls is caring gang sure has anybody answered it was a it was quite an interesting quite an interesting question from Sadiq dorama it was a safari game are using any facial recognition tools or other artificial intelligence tech like those on AWS to help of analysis we certainly do we we've developed a machine classifying r2 to complement the work being done by Zooniverse and camera catalog so this uses yeah users machine learning to basically be able to identify now what what species is captured by the camera trap it's it's a remarkably effective probably 90% of the time we like the computer gets it right there isn't yet any AI applications which are distinguishing individual leopards we're working on that on developing that but they are pattern recognition run it through and see how some of it is to other images but but I've no doubt within the next few months we'll probably have that we'll have that available to us as well unless I know with things like whales through sonar they they can identify individual whales from their calls and so hopefully you will be able to do some other applications for leopard soon Thanks so Janette just last my contacts take care of Sri Lanka hope to come with you so I think Gina's based in Australia now but yesterday venture anchor said to be created but I think that's a case Barbara Russell I lost the guards is this near the Piccadilly females oh gee I think so she's a bit fair then we're on the right side of the river she's on the eastern bank but she's fair the north of us she's right in front of Mala Mala main camp so currently on the eastern side of the river this is actually more they accepted to males territory and in female wise we see the island female not all that often right yeah but I'd say this is on the fringes of a territory t-nuts you look like you want to say something strangely is a little bit that's a dead pitch so I'm just gonna yeah it's weird because amazing yeah when I first arrived I thought hanging on one of these big G notches with a Blackrock female just the other day watching your hand monkeys when she can view on our YouTube channel was that in this area I know we found a yeah that morning and then the afternoon she was quite closest to main camp there's a question here about towers new technology helping against poaching so the different types of cameras the ones that we we showed you here these are for surveying animals they have a white flash that goes off and so we can we can identify the individual there is other types of cameras that we've developed termed our poacher cam this is a its infrared and it's a it it works on a wireless network the the GSM or cellular network and we've developed an algorithm which which recognizes a person and so then you would put these up cryptically and if someone walks past the camera it takes a photograph they aren't aware of it and it sends that thumbnail by the the cellular network to whoever is responsible for for alerts and then you can you can respond to that poaching incident in real time so gives you a much better chance of being able to get in front of a poaching incident and prevent any animal from being killed so that's a that's one way our technology has been used to to combat poaching so if you feel like you need to get involved if you have to feel the need to get involved rather and feel free to visit tomorrow male come and donates some of those monies Vulgate go to those exact cameras that guy is talking about and if you wish to donate some money towards the research that guys doing on this on the property here in l3 please feel free to go to panther talk but you know thank you very much so I'll get your contact details from the guides and to be great to meet your brother in Sri Lanka thank you some dramatists I'd need less skittish males I would guess that the maxims mal in maybe six months to a year would probably become one of these the typical mana baller very chilled relaxed individuals it just takes a bit of time for them to get bit hit a bit you add it but but III think he's got the potential to be become as relaxed as any other leopard I am Rangers in a core part of Milan Milan so he's been viewed often and slowly but surely over time you'll realize that the vehicles don't pose a threat today is looking quite relaxed for this Rondon was a good sign as an elephant just eight of us yeah he's standing underneath there Torchwood and these elephants have been feeding a lot of the Torchwood fruits that's the one I spotted earlier yeah thanks did he see the torture behind it yeah okay so that's the one that guy spotted earlier let's mean it looks a bit different sky as you can see how the grass is flat it's just making sure that we saw him there young bull yes he's feeling around at least crank what he's looking for is these fruits from this large tree to the left of him called it Torchwood next to ten what do you think of the lion population American forests that could be I guess the harina first I'm I'm afraid I don't know much about it I know there was a mission recently to go camera trap that area to look for the lines I don't know what the results were um I do know that is where black leopards occur so they have melanistic leopards in there and the same here in a forest and colleague of mine Chris Kelly I love fact he took a beautiful photograph or an old photograph of one of these melanistic leopards and it's one of the few from Africa handle texts that we have so so maybe google that in you you'll get to see what what they look like they're truly spectacular a bushel forest elephant this is a this is an elephant bush elephant okay there's a lot of comments here this is Gina why do you jump like that when the elephant trumpet rangers camp it's pretty much everyone know genus I must say y'all ready photogenic from saying [Laughter] yep community India does a monistic lipids and the many parts in India Malaysia Thailand many of those there is Nepal majority of the cats are on melanistic and wherever there's sort of dense evergreen forests that the recessive gene seems to come out and I assume just because the dark cats are that much better suited to forested environment it's like I have you heard about strawberry dip it I have been I'm gonna pass this one a to Nikki because she [Music] I've seen a few pictures I don't know much about it but I would assume it's it could be a recessive gene it comes out in some cat so that's slightly different much you might give another head shake as you travel just just warning you to nuts they don't jump again nope you know there's a lot of support coming through for you yeah nice people saying it's my problem to be scared of elephants big can be nasty that's the rest of us shouldn't make fun of you you get yeah yeah let's see if it doesn't so just up here we set up a camera trap station this morning I would say we might just get flashed by the cameras as we drive fast it's that time of mic to the cameras Mike Scott the flashing it's a nice color on the left that's crazy get those 90s as they walk past so just a few hours where the station is I'm going to see if we get a flash maybe a frightful start yeah I'll be sure that I'm smiling and that's a good flash let's Jennifer do you like the wrong way there you go I got a blessing that's enough again both working though which is a good side accessor we are coming near the end of our transmission now and and just like to say a final thank you and a goodbye from one of us a guy thanks a lot - you're welcome to be in charge of the comments anytime thanks everyone for your questions and your support much appreciated joy Thank You Jeanette thanks for driving us a fee Vicki thank you thank you yeah and for myself Garrett look for to our next live stream and we'll see shortly Fe and again to Nadav thanks again study hard
