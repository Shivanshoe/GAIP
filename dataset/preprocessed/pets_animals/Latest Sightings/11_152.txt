two animals one minut in comparison but brave and that's what they will do so you you think you know something like a water monitor if they're gonna defend they nest against elephants shrilly a water monitor wouldn't be too much hassle we've also seen how aggressive they are in when they fight I will never look at a crowned crane the same ever again come on elephant you don't need to hurt that bird this is the bravest crowned crane you've ever seen in your life defending its nest it's the same crown cranes we were looking at earlier not very happy indeed I don't know if this is the male or female because both of them sit on the nest and we were talking about how they're so similar looking but that's a big elephant but it doesn't look like he's having any of it the young bull and you can hear it that crowned crane alarming now she's just saying but you're crazy I'm trying to graze around a look at all their lush stuff and that's all she's really worried about she's putting up all the roots in all I'm not sure what she's eating doesn't look like a hyacinth or anything if that trunk were just to connect with that bird it would have a serious headache if not a concussion
