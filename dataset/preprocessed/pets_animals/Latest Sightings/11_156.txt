already its effects you're gonna try this just for the benefits of the Facebook for you is we are gonna try and scream Beth on Facebook and YouTube if it doesn't work then we'll stop we don't interrupt each other and ruin the sighting but we are gonna try for now and maybe you can report back if you see the quality on one is better than the other or vice versa [Music] [Music] probably because these lines killed last night in the morning but once starting to warm up a bit now so the vultures wolves but this Buffalo is out in the open it's quite an open field here they will probably certain is a perfect perch for them right above the kill mat fact so welcome to everyone on the YouTube site and so we're trying something a little different we're going to be streaming on YouTube and Facebook at the same time morning everyone we are with the in Kakuma pride at the moment we just focus on the Lions eating the Buffalo that they caught other late last night or perhaps even early this morning we'll stick with the blinds eating the Buffalo for now but the males are just out of screen screen to the left one is other ones just like in some very long grass but what we're gonna try to do is answer the questions on the YouTube stream and on the Facebook stream at the same time hopefully it works and we can answer everyone's questions if it doesn't we will reevaluate and see how it goes but just let me know if the camera is set up alright sometimes the comments and the subtitles are blocking the screen so just let us know if the YouTube feed is coming through alright and hello to ninja boy this is from kent in UK good morning glad you're enjoying the live stream and hope you're the man is around your breakfast table at home it's is in these lines table manners sorry folks I'm Alfred for whatever reason wasn't doing the chats but so just catching up with everyone's greetings from santen Linda from California welcome back Sally s much better giraffe go welcome back a lot of people here from that we see often on our YouTube channel yes it is a buffalo that they eating it is quite funny the Cubs seem to be able to fit right into the carcass one walked all the way through a question from Noah graves or the Lions eating a cow or a bull it looks like a bull from here and we don't see many herds of Buffalo in this part of the reserve anyway so it is any the the Bulls around and wow how many days are they stomachs full so they should be full for the next three or four days effects and also these lines are all busy squabbling from TomTom of the kill so we might stop halfway through just to let you listen to the the growls and then Percy Johnson so we know these Lions as Deacon cuckoo as the Inca Houma pride and the males that are with him so there's some of those girls I was talking about the males that are with him so it sounds like the lionesses don't want me to tell you who they are and the males that are with him are the Avoca males the northern my camels to be specific Sally is asking how far away the Gauri males in kampala prot are from the in Karuma pride and the American males we are not short the stage we're not sure where the Khumbu Laprade are right now I'm John Tobias boom boom Afridi to you the nine asking is the Buffalo dead was somewhat alive this one is certainly did yeah any movement you see inside of that Buffalo is actually the Cubs crawling around inside of it can we get closer zoom in so GD we are filming off of a sulfur so we actually can't really get too much closer or zoom in too much closer without it being all pixelated and one of the male lions is also lying in a bit of the awkward spot and this is about as close as we draft to these animals anyway any closer and will upset them and disturb their behavior which is the last thing we want to do Hoda Haris saucing what would we consider the vise Bronn what would we consider the most prized part of the catch so the internal organs actually the most important part for them to eat so all the lungs and liver and kidney and all that one of the odd things with cats is I can't make any other own vitamin so like we make vitamin D or your body makes it for you by being in the Sun we eat lots of vegetables or hopefully so that you get all your vitamins Alliance can only get those vitamins from the internal organs so if they were eating say B fill it every day that actually slowly get to the lion equivalent of scurvy so it is very important that they eat all of the organs and generally the male ions do get in there first so they get the bulk of those best bits but also not so much with this pride but with some of the lion prides I don't know how long they're gonna have a kill cuz I might get chased off by eanes or whatever so eating lungs and livers and kidneys if you think about what those organs look like they're very soft things you can eat them very quickly and bolt them down you're not having to rip the meat off the flesh which you can see these lions are doing now getting that meat off the bone is quite tough so it's a hard thing to eat weigh something like a kidney it's not attached to any bone or anything else you can just open up their caucus and wolf it down so it's easy to eat but also very important that they do eat it and Lord can see you're asking how many members are in the prod so I think if how many was it Pete it's lionesses and nine Cubs headline aces nine Cubs and the play with the three of our males or we've seen two of the male's I don't know where the third one is or if he is here and just from the Facebook feed Nathanial is asking at what age to the cap starts eating meat so typically they can start as early as eight months I mean eight weeks typically around three months older but there I just have seen is eight weeks but just with the eating meat that one of the factors is just how close they kill happens to be to weigh the little Cubs are being kept in their their dens I can't really travel too far from the dens because they've got got little legs at that point and also just safety wise you know lionesses don't bring kills back to the dens usually it very very rarely happens but more often than not though bring the Cubs to a kill like this all the adults have kind of had a good feed but more relaxed than that and that's often the introduction of the Cubs to the pride and since I hear Shah asking what they've hunted here so they're busy feeding off of a buffalo bull cape buffalo bull they probably killed last night sometime Audrey asking if this is one pride yes I'm not sure if all of them are here the grass all around us is quite long as you can see but there are some lying in the bushes over there and a couple lying in front of us but when all the Lions are here they are yeah Mike said earlier 8 lionesses mine Cubs and there's a coalition of three males which is dominant over them and the owner and then asking what's the eating order for lions they eat in a hierarchy yeah so people often you know it's quite common people to say that male lions you know don't do any hunting and when the females do you kill something they run and and chase them all off and eat their full although that is often true but also the females afterwards don't all sit neatly around the dinner table and share politely they also get caught up in the feeding frenzy so it's not a surly male or female but rather the strongest lions will get there's one - contact calling over there like so just on the YouTube feed it's a couple folks asking where are we so we at Mala Mala Game Reserve if you were to look on Google Maps just Google Mala Mala from Mala Mala camp or the airstrip you will see we are north and east by about a kilometer and we if you can see there's a rocky outcrop north and east of the camp we just to the north of that rocky outcrop a couple of questions asking a good morning pit row so a couple questions asking are we safe from the Lions here so I would say yes the Lions definitely got something to eat they've all grown up with us around if they were unhappy with our presence I would definitely make it very clear and start growling and thrashing their tails and whatnot at us if they were getting upset that I just attack for no no reason effects and we did stumble or we didn't stumble across this I got called in Hayley this war about an hour ago and we haven't had the opportunity to say notifications art all that much I know and the dev has been probably trying to do that now so if you have the opportunity and you want to share this with anyone please feel free to take a screenshots and just share it with the people you think might be interested in the sighting how many lion prides are at Mala Mala Oscar is a asks so we're actually trying to count it the other day but there's at least sort of ten groups of lions that we do see if you can't the all the prods and the male coalition's but yeah so there's this in Kakuma prod that we're watching now in this area we also sometimes see the Torchwood pride which has split into two groups obviously their vocal males are here with us now then a bit south of here is the computer prior to ever the bulk of Mala Mala territory we saw the 4-ways pride a few days ago there's the Sand River pride more to the south the our field pride obviously the gallery males and the southern Avoca males so there's quite a number of prides and we see as many as 60 individuals I think 64 in the in the area miss any other Lions of course the monthly pride and you see six pride from time this takes pride that's how many privates we forget yes artifacts odd ran out of fingers to count all the lion prides off there then is a good answer couple folks asking we spot this kill any thomna as it heats up and they use the thermals to fly around and look for food so he has one of the younger cubs moving in as well and the hyenas I think that you know they're probably a well aware of this skill but they not gonna dare come here with so many Lions there's eight lionesses with all their cubs and on top of that there's a two male lions here so maybe we might see some I in as a lurking way in the distance but they're going to be very careful of the of the male lions yeah and six and son's asking has a gariand cooler and the Vickers and in Kakuma prade heading into action so no they haven't yeah not that we've seen but if you're going to Mala Mala as YouTube channel and you'll see we put a video up the other day of when we are following the Campbell pride and we found them as well well we found where they'd obviously come into Mala Mala the kombu Laprade must have been aware of it moved into that area and they mom's getting grumpy with a cab there just hi today not really welcome my brother-in-law's brother it's good to see you watching us and glad that you can join us but yeah sorry to finish that if you go on our YouTube channel you'll see where we talk about the closest they've had the interaction we linked whom prod seems to have been driven off by the Khumbu Laprade without any fighting and I'm sure that's mainly because of these little cabs they're about half the edge of the Kampala prod and please mocking morning often how often asking how often do they eat and do they eat every day or maybe once a week please a lot depends on what they kill as a kind of rule of thumb or generally speaking whenever we get also question the kind of standard responses though kill something every three to four days but a lot depends on the area where the end what the predominant food sources how big the pride is so they are very close on 15 much of all the lines are here it's probably say about 15 lines feeding off a buffalo which they killed last night I've certainly been out of this in about 24 hours and then they don't have to eat for or they probably won't hunt again for a couple days but if they can excite I think welcome back hopefully but if we experience any more trouble on our YouTube phone my phone is just overheated a [ __ ] then feel free to switch over to Facebook Peter's currently doing the live stream on facebook on his phone I believe all the cool kids are watching on Facebook so I'm just gonna switch the camera a little bit around to the mail you can see he's just so I can have a try zooming in without flipping around America asked me to any signs of TB and his pride not in this pride so another thing you would look for signs of TB or swelled in areas especially around the joints alright so if X seems to be quite a delay Ashkan Venom's any jokes Evo room like that's my wife who's watching some action let's see how the table man has changed now that dad's arrived his second helping presumably and if anyone's wondering where the other male is yeah Raymond here asked me if the Lions hunt onion their territory they would hunt mostly on their territory but territories do overlap somewhat and it's not unheard of for lice to hunt in other's territories but it's not obviously wouldn't be the best idea if they didn't have to they could avoid it Neilsen what's the biggest coalitions of males biggest coalition of males we've seen on Mala Mala and the biggest number I've seen is five more than five together supported your question earlier about the Cubs responding to somewhere else Bradley Thomas good morning like sorry for you on YouTube but we just struggling a little bit with the signal at the moment and I'm hoping that the video feed is coming through but we can't see any of the comments right now and I'm just hopefully watching it out finds I don't know if it's a signal issue that it's quite hot here that the fans are struggling merely asking how the male line got that limp well he's had that limp for a few days but it's quite common to see lions limping the terrain that they live in and huntin is uneven there lots of holes and lots of stumps when they do kill something imagine bringing down like this Buffalo it weighs up to anyway sorry folks and so yeah I think that vigil was coming through we just couldn't see any of your comments so if you've had any questions or anything we all maybe just repost them and then I'll try to get them as they come through and I'm sure my fern was not enjoying the signal here for a while but yeah for those of you that are just joining us so this is the in Kakuma pride and they've caught a buffalo bull sometime late last night and the two male lions that are with him or the two of VOCA males that we in the northern parts of Mala Mala game reserve so the north and east of our camp by about two kilometers chris swanda pool asking is a true that lines of pink noses are younger than six so as a general rule I think that is accurate I think it's actually the younger than seven if I remember correctly but it's not always a hundred percent guard land it's a general rule of thumb from asking what are your jobs if you don't mind me asking so our jobs are usually as Rangers here at Mala Mala so we take case out on game draws on that obviously now with the lockdown we don't know when that will be lifted and international travel is allowed or any travel for that matter so what we have done is switch to a rather than you coming here we coming to you so instead of having six guests on a vehicle we now have upwards of 30,000 guests on a vehicle but I think everyone is pretty happy with the situation see there's a lot more people on YouTube now on a dev Pete's phone has just died maybe if you can put a message on Facebook just to let people know that we are still streaming on YouTube tears cold air the sister of Brendan Cole I'm sure welcome but you know an average day for our sorry to carry on answering that question as we head out in the morning see what cool stuff we can see the other format for Molly Molly's YouTube channel and you'll see we doing series ranges and isolation it was initially a three week series but our president ordered a few more episodes and locked us down for another two weeks and then he further extended our contract the other day for we are unsure of how long that it's worked out pretty well so far and then yeah otherwise we editing and trying to if there is signal look at that cut balancing on top of trying to fund the thinking out of the box here if there is signal and only about 10% of Mala Mala is covered by sulfur and signal then we will try to to livestream it so normally we do it on YouTube in the evenings and Facebook in the morning this morning that we're trying to do both and which might be a good thing because the signals keep cutting out on one or the other funds we staying in contact just not that giraffe Cole are the tortured sort of northern part of the reserve we think so they were there yesterday wasn't yeah yesterday they were on then the very northern parts of Mala Mala I think that line is might want to pull the caucus into the shade there but that's exactly where the male line is sleeping they'll see how successful she is if the effects you can't actually see all of the Lions right now because they a lot of them are just lying in the shade around here Diseases thanks to our president yes we also thanking and at least keeping us safe I think is the main goal reason asking is this an area where we have to get involved almost never and only time will interfere with animals or not interferes in the right word perhaps help the animals is if they're very endangered animals like Rana or wild dogs perhaps otherwise if the injury that they got is man-made so somehow human caused if it's a natural injury occurred naturally and that then there's you know there's not really too much we can do about it but if for example we had found this Buffalo with a broken leg and fixed up this broken leg after months of rehabilitation and whatnot and trying to convince the Buffalo to put cost on and keep it there we would have taken a meal away from by saving one Buffalo would have stolen a meal from this whole pride of lions ah he knows that will probably arrive at some point the vultures later on the jackals and dang beetles you know so it's pretty hard on that individual animal but it's the food for everything else so save one and put a hundred potentially others out there's a few of you asking to see the male lion they are two here but they're currently it's currently not a great view of them she's gonna move the camera over fractionally the one is in the right of screen lying under in the shade there you can barely see him yeah try the whole thing in front the Mara lion is just over there but he's just fast asleep in the grass so it's hard to see him in Lacey stanza and a question of any vultures circling not yet such well like the finds keep cutting up because it is getting hot and it's that hot eh especially in these big open areas gonna heat up quicker than in the thickets so the warmer air from the open areas will start moving up and the vultures will soon start flying and using those thermals to look for food so we will hopefully see them soon broseph are asking is this really love yes it is indeed really live though it keeps cutting out and Brian D saying nope it's fake live I'm not sure added intellect reminding us of breakfast who are quite hungry and eggs amudha listening to let the bodies hit the floor I think we have to definitely be a suitable Psalm track eight tabs warning tabs you will see from Sonny's allele and seen tabs is one of our ranges and seem to be the potentially the star of the show for our YouTube channel if you want to catch up on there or do you know we should bring an umbrella for the phones and 4s the Lions of Sterling all the shade and then a relatively large open area so there's not too much shade going spear earlier one of the male lions was actually lying in the shade and the front of the vehicle so we couldn't even see him properly then Ellen Fay you've asked this question a few times and I guess you just so just asking about the and are we safe in the vehicle we are these Lions have grown up around us driving around in vehicles these particulars particular pride hasn't grown up here on mana mana but the reserve that they've grown up on they also drive around in vehicles like ours and they are very tolerant about prisons almost finished eating yeah so I think they've eaten the best parts of the kill all their internal organs that are quite important that they eat and you can kind of see the the hams or the back legs of the Buffalo almost done but now they're gonna be eating sort of the neck and the shoulders is where I think the meters lift but it's also any really at the moment accessible to the doubts because that skin around their neck you'll see every now and then this line is closest to us picks up the skin you can see just how thick it is so for the Cubs I can't quite get into that thick skin around the neck and shoulders that helps protect the Buffalo from other Buffalo's horns when they're fighting - I think I see us asking what does it smell like so fortunately it smells oh I'm a carnivore myself so it smells quite pleasant it's all the nice fresh meat around but it's not too different butcher shop smell the killers fairly fresh and it was quite cold last night so it hasn't gone off or anything like that so you can see one of the other lionesses arriving in the background they're gonna she's gonna come and try get some seconds or thirds or fifths or eighths or whatever it is that she's on to now but they might be a little bit of a squabble when she tries to make is some space of the kill Ellen face saying he's sure there'd like kangaroo I'm sure that that kangaroo I think it would be quite funny to see a lion encounter a kangaroo for the first time there were no what on it's the new escape tactic I think I can get is pretty fast as well that's a lie [Laughter] do Lions typically avoid humans asks well the man say I'd say yes like in a situation like this they found with us in the vehicles and that I wouldn't for a million bucks key get out of the vehicle anywhere near them but if we were walking from far away towards him and they saw us at start growling and telling us not to approach any closer so here's some more of the lionesses and the balance of the cubs arriving also for another round guys looking for the male lions I heard the Cubs coming and just all of a sudden thoughts a little bit more angry than they were a minute ago see the male's finally dragging this carcass into the shade so if like so it's quite a big delay between when we getting the comments this is what we're seeing here let's get asking what is our YouTube channel called so it's Mala Mala so just Google mala more on YouTube such Mala Mala Game Reserve and you'll see there's quite a number of videos on there from over the years but we've been doing a series called ranges and isolation and like I said was so popular our president ordered another round of a two week extension on it but yeah you'll see there and then what we do is if we can't live stream for whatever reason normally because it's just nice signal then we'll film an episode and you can kind of catch up on other encounters we've had with in Kakuma pride or Kampala prod perhaps even some of the leopards and other animals that we see here one of the reasons we last stream with lions or lot is that they're just quite visible animals some of you probably watching our last stream with the leopard the other day and leopards are very good at becoming invisible animals and then we have a last stream of a shady piece of grass until that leopard moves yeah the lions are a lot easier to livestream and also a lot more activity often with the Lions should we move around a little bit so it's like so what we're gonna do is just move around now that that Mel bond is dragged the kill out and try to get you a bit of you in the meantime Gareth it's gonna be introducing pizza and it's funny heck to everyone so it's a bit like a mullet everybody wants one but no one wants to wear it in public [Laughter] because a face to get one disgusting hat this is our normal people wear hats but yeah I must say I'm quite thankful for that mud flap at the back there this hot Sun beating down that I think are gonna do the same as peach that's our effect so you're just moving around so we can get a bit of you now that the male line has moved the carcass about at the moment and which is also why the males have chosen to pull this carcass into it it's good like you wanna sit this up Harry that's how flexers gonna have to jiggle the camera around a little bit or the fern while I get it cool guy Michael obviously just want to say that the nice mode clock is maximum yes my biggest fan [Music] Heidi Swiss asking do we know where the third of a Kemal is no I know someone commented earlier that he was with the Telemark ride we don't see that fraud here but they live quite far to the north of us and Alan Fay top speed of a kangaroo 71 top speed of a lion 80 I feel like one of these international challenges that could go on here what's a you'll notice is my kangaroos in Africa maybe this bit has taken place already [Laughter] how do male lions form coalition's or their siblings are syriza's yes there are siblings if you look at this prod I think there's nine Cubs yeah and so saying four of those nine are males so those young brothers when they leave the prod normally at about three ish and then they'll stick together and partly that's to help them hunt if they catch something if there's say the four brothers together then they can defend their kills from hyenas a bit better they can bring down bigger things like Buffalo which take a bit of mass lling and then eventually if they survive then they have a much better chance of competing with the rezident males for kills and the young males will often when they leave their pride they've been turfed out by the incoming mail that's taken over their father's pride and they in you know those new male lions territory you will try and kill them and when they leave that area they in someone else's territory that tries to kill them sir it's very difficult for young male lions I think it's only one in seven that survive that transition from cab to adult it Brezza fraud asking or any vibration man's I'm assuming you mean vibranium mines and what kinda is our best-kept secret then just see something icky grunt well just asking again sorry grunt these comments do you come through quite quickly and we will try and get around to answering some of them asking is mala mala fenced to answer that question no it's not we are waged between the sabi sands Game Reserve and the Kruger National Park and there is not a single fence on any of our boundaries and yes one of the camps has a low fence but the other two camps don't have fins fences and if you have a look on our Instagram page you'll see some of the animals that walk into camp I think the most recent one that we've seen was the ink of a new female lipid that Mike saw walking straight to the front gate of camp the other day just to add to that if you go onto mala Molly's YouTube channel one of our recent videos we actually put up a map of that great Limpopo Park that as the sabi sands Manya Latika ciri the kruger national park the Limpopo park and timber Vaati all of happened to granny game reserve sorry Connor is a in Zimbabwe so you've got an idea of the scale of the reserve but you couldn't put Belgium inside of this protected area then king snow asking have you seen any male coalition's coming in from Kruger King snow again if you go to our Mala Mala game reserves youtube channel there's a an episode there on the four ways pride and those are two males that we have not seen before [Music] so if actually just trying to catch up with the comments old camera in three and benches Lincoln 1800 no definitely not to your question do you ever come across coaches so no we don't really come across him unfortunately purchase our reality all over Africa and what I am planning to do is actually for our channel anyway putting together a little video of our anti-poaching team to give everyone idea of what it is that I actually do obviously we have to be quite sensible for security reasons on how we do it but that'll be probably coming out in the next week or so and then but yes Mala Mala has a very active and fortunately a very large anti-poaching team so we haven't had any incidents for quite some time now camera dings nice to see you on the feed camera noseless arranged at Mala Mala it's currently at home streets of Los Angeles subscribe to Mala Mala thank you streets of Los Angeles we appreciate that enjoy the support asking about like so we're not gonna tilt up the well we operating on a sulfur and so for something like a speck of a vulture in the distance it'll just be a couple of pixels but if any do you come closer we'll talk the phone app so you can have a look so he is asking how do we distinguish each lion so we're looking at things like the territories may be prominent scars on their faces normally what the sort of makeup of that for Vlad is I like to pry these lionesses and these non relatively yes as well as maybe the moment oh that actually the largest with eight lionesses adult in terms of adults so it's kind of a variety of factors and also their behavior so these lions don't care that we hear the not reacting at all but if say we had strange Alliance coming in from the kruger park often they they nervous other vehicles we a new entity for them that I know what we are and it takes him a while to get used to us and we normally with those animals we give them a lot of space if they don't like us say then we just leave and over time they'll get more and more used to us lions aren't used to being scared of things they won't say know that we're not a threat then they just ignore us for the most part I think Chris on a pool asking a few times not Chrissy gonna get we won't get her answer these questions what's the best place to study and vote Varda okay game ranging so there are a number of places and a lot of the ranges here have studied at different places and I think I think it'd be very difficult to compare because you don't actually go to different schools you guys the one and stick at the one and I think the best way we're just to be gone to Google and to research and look up reviews on all these different places you have mentioned a few there I'd recommend that's probably the best route to go yeah Mala Mala generally you need some sort of tertiary education and so you have to have gone to uni or college or otherwise have a few years experience perhaps at another Reserve so there's a academic route and a practical route we try to have a mix of different skills here so some of the guys have been doing this for twenty twenty-five years we other guys have got perhaps you know we have two of the rangers here that have had three different degrees or zoology and biology related it's there's many avenues that you could use so no Heidi of few people ask that so the animals here so it's I learned a lot of the more urban built-up areas animals are making appearances I think a lot of that is also to do with people actually just paying attention to what's going outside and instead of just rushing around the rat races we're here the animals don't care about us whether we here or not here here you know in the grand scheme of things we've been mala mall is the oldest private game reserve so we've been watching these animals since 1964 but they as a species have been here for at least ten thousand years and they didn't care about us then they don't care about us now so their behavior hasn't changed I talk about their normal business you can see they're not really reacting to us being here right now and this is what would potentially be the most dangerous situation lions defending a kill and Cubs so yeah if they don't mind us now then they're not gonna - ever then just hide - Maggie and Gordon from the UK has there been any liens tacking kill crock said also I believe that does happen if you go into Kruger sightings YouTube page Nadav he can maybe put up the link but he put on quite a cool video the other day I think was when in Creswell if I remember correctly of lions surrounding a crocodile I think the concern was more curiosity than trying to eat it but the crocodile said me let him know that he is not something to be investigated do lions and hyenas other carnivores consume each other's meat or just eliminate competition so normally it is just to kill one another that I'd really eat one another it does happen sometimes that I've seen lions killing high in a couple of times and it's an incredibly violent brutal thing they grab that I ena and they shake it and drag it around and rip their clothes through it and so on when they kill an Impala or something like normally they grabbed by the throat throttle it and kill it to eat it they don't kill it because they like with hyenas I certainly hate hyenas so it is very violent I'd be very surprised if hyenas were able to come here and steal this skill from these lines and then TD kid one asking all nine caps present we're not sure they come and go and they have been lying in the shade elsewhere so we haven't being able to count all of them that I would assume that if all nine cabs are still of that probably would be present and a good morning to Robin Sewell they're giving another suggestion for arranging or guarding courses Pam Hudson it was pretty funny almost there watching that I think the Nadav has just posted that link rushes with us I have my goodness welcome from Russia is this buffalo dagger boy asks our genus yes so dagger is actually if you are building your the traditional mad hats that people think of when they think of people in Africa how we don't live anymore but yeah watch it is make your your sort of thatched hat and then on the outside put a mixture of cow dung and mud on the outside to seal it and kind of weatherproof it and that mixture is called dagger for these Buffalo and they're rolling around in the mud and they often their own gang to that dagger that Matt gets plastered on them and so they often referred to as dagger boys and meaning the mud that's covering them [Music] Petra asking to have a school for the Mala Mala kids so Mala Mala well arguably there's any one kid here the ranges to frequently get referred to as kids but if we have been through the schooling process you're listening to the voice of the biggest one of them or the most mature kid but they only have one kid yeah and he is one year and one month old belonging to Peter the guy in the funny hat pink asking how about the small youngest cub akan see him now but he was here earlier but he seems fun and healthy I sure I'm actually not sure how many male and females with these calves normally with the young lion cubs we don't really check the undercarriage too carefully it's hard especially now when they're all milling about on that but also you know as cabs that doesn't matter so much perhaps until they're about 18 months old sadly a lot of these Cubs probably won't survive the the lions have been very successful the last few years but yeah we if you go into Mala Mala z-- web page you'll see our game reports we often have a breakdown of the the sexes there but I can tell you orphaned in the own kahuna prod Sydney we don't see this part all that often King star do we know why the male as a short man compared to the other male so that's a good question he might just be a little bit younger and also there is a genetic component to it you know like with humans you get blondes and brunettes and that so and some guys are able to grow a beard at 14 and others after wait until they're 32 so it might just be that his he's just not as hairy if you will as as his brothers but also these of our males are not that all peaked you know how old they are I think that is six or seven 19 answers yeah so they're about six years old so they're still growing into their manes so then d li x2 DCL i can people adopt baby lions and other wildlife baby animals at home as pips we do not recommend that whatsoever and all of these wild animals 10t have that wildness in them throughout their lives and certainly with lions and some of the larger cats they can get very dangerous in there are adults so we don't recommend it see quite Chris Rock when that tiger attacked Siegfried and Roy and everyone said the Tago ain't crazy he said that target and get crazy that tiger at Tiger and made me laugh for about a week Fedya these are wild animals they are not domesticated at all you can't expect a target to be anything other than a tiger carl Griffin they are quite a few videos of crocodiles fish if the lines were meta killed close to a river the crocodiles often come out and see if what's dead and if they can steal anything we had it not so long ago with one of the leopard kills and a big crocodile came and tried to to get a look in there but Lions crocodiles are not normal part of the sort of menu they don't really hand things Jaguars and the Pantanal catching the caimans is the probably the like you see it now quite a lot on BBC earth and called planet Earth and that pit there's a few congratulations coming through yeah on the path of your child so the time is 25 to 10:00 in the morning and it is warming up quite considerably nah it does feel like it's the afternoon giraffe girl coming in there with the thank you for that the sexes of the Cubs there's 5 male 3 females and the youngest cab we do not know yet he's a male Pete thinks it's a male Henry do be asking how does a young male start its own pride besides taking over another male lines so Henry that is the only way that they can start their own prides that unreleased starter pride as far as the Lions social life goes the pride of lions is really females and males are got nothing to do with the pride daughters daughters generally stay in the prod that they were born into and the males are the ones that leave and disperse and that stops things like inbreeding from happening but those brothers you know as soon as they leave their dad's territory then someone else's territory chases them and so on and so on so they wanna potentially hundreds of kilometers from where they were born where the lionesses are staying in the same area and that pride territory is Mallis handed down from mother to daughter over the generations where the males we get new male lions taking over the pride say every five or six years ish sometimes shorter than that sometimes much longer but your male lions don't start prides really they they have to take over an existing pride what does happen some of the prides are those groups of females get so big like this pride if all their daughters stay it's gonna be what eleven lionesses and plus council will be just too many mouths to feed so then the pride Mart fracture and break apart into two different groups which is how the konbu Laprade was formed so six lionesses if the natal pride the Maithili pride set up their own territory by moving another pride out of the way and then they were taken over by first the southern of Oh camels the older brothers of these two males they're in the match of peer emails and now they are dominated by their Gauri males see there's know quite a lot of chat about the crocodiles in the lines and if you hit over to a youtube channel there is a video that Mike put together a lion crosses a river the hard way and it's a very cool video there's a number of different animals crossing the rivers and you can see how nervous a lot of those animals are when they cross the river and because of the crocodiles within the river and then now just say one of the reasons that the Jaguars can and do tech crocodiles is Jaguars have actually got the most powerful bite force of any other big cats takes a lot of crunching to get through a crocodile or came and came and scull not to say that the Lions couldn't do it but they just not gonna be as good it is and also like the those Jaguars living in the Pantanal that's a massive swampy area so they just have more opportunity to hand something like that where these lines this is a relative dry part of the world crocodiles are not something that I frequently come across also the Lions in Botswana that catch hippos they come across hippos a lot more than our Lions do so hippos unready on the menu for our lines I just not practiced or even kind of aware that that's an option we're in Botswana naca vengo where they come across hundreds of hippos and probably also lots of injured weakened hippos they learn that that's a menu item for them inches grunts was nice having you thanks for the questions Hector if we encounter a situation where baby cub is stuck in the mud or anything you guys assist so like we probably it would really have to depend on the situation if there was a little cub stuck in the mud or something like that wouldn't probably mean the race of the prod is right there so we just couldn't safely get at that little guy to help him out you know without the adults they don't know that you're trying to help we had a situation yeah quite a few years ago now it was very sad but a elephant calf had got stuck in the mud we did want to go and help it out but the rest of the herd wouldn't let us anywhere near and then on top of that a pride of lions surrounded that little calf as well so we just couldn't safely get to the calf through the 20-odd lions as well as an extremely angry herd of elephants and what eventually happened is the Lions jumped in and killed the calf so there was no way we could have intervened there but it was also kind of a natural thing with the Lions killing that elephant calf opportunistically you know so again it comes back to if we had helped that little elephant calf we would have taken a meal away from the Lions you know sadly people we really do want to help but it's just not always an option and like I say the animals don't know that you're trying to help them either you know a few people just saying that they've gone online and researched back forces and saying that tiger or asking the question doesn't a tiger the strongest pack well it's something we can look up afterwards and then I said just this is one of the odd Gina saying again Gareth PETA and Mark let me repeat myself I love your sense of humor feel free to dispense liberally that's very easy when Pete's wearing a cap like that say thanks so Gina its tension is elsewhere he's not really concentrating on what's going on yet it's an easy target for we zoom the more pixelated at guess so we'll see if that helps a little bit there fortunately the shade is getting getting a bit darker now so the phones struggling to adjust to the bright background or surrounds with the dark shed the lines are in the dl i xtd CLI maybe you want to change your name you know if clicks clicks just asking you have you guys ever formed a documentary movie similar to eternal enemies lions and i he no digas just drive around to film for large dream yes I would love to form something as good as eternal enemies yeah so they have been a few documentaries that have made their way onto National Geographic and elsewhere that have been formed on Mala Mala currently we are just filming as a team of Rangers we are forming what we come across and but some of those documentaries that you can go and look up I believe is a Blood Brothers a lot of that is filmed here yeah so brother I think at the brothers in blood my brothers in blood side don't get the two confused they're very different brothers in blood a lot of that was filmed here with a map or horse you might be familiar with and coalition of fire Borg initially six male lions five brothers that were born into the high field pride the milliwatt emails and then there was beauty and the beasts I think that was to do with lipids which was to low load with cultural stalking liquors cooking lipids and living with leopard living with lipids in a queen hyena Queen solidified Beauty and the Beast yeah this this series African rivers I believe it's all with the Sand River that was all funky at Mala Mala I'm a National Geographic they were filming her last year and they are busy working on that project at the wall editing it at the moment when it comes after I'm not too sure but they got an amazing footage of the Lions not this prod and then kumara sorry the Campbell pride killing a buffalo and this perfect golden sunlight on the riverbanks and that's in going back to bed at 4 a.m. thank you for watching pants keep - sorry and then just for the I know there's a couple people this is the Inca Houma prod with the northern Avoca miles think uma Pradas eight lionesses and their non cubs so just a couple of questions they caught this Buffalo sometime last night what we are going to try to do folks is come back here for a live stream this afternoon luckily the signal is pretty good so hopefully and we'll we'll have to just see what else is going on but well maybe the Lions aren't even here when we come back but at 4 o'clock this afternoon South
