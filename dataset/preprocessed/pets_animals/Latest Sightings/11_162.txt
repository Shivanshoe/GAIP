maybe you can tell us if you hearing us you're going live thanks to dev just let us know if you get audio effects welcome to Molly Molly again we are sitting on the causeway and in frame we have a number of lines this is a full complement of the campo de prata at least we think it is and the t'car emails are present as well I'm not gonna turn the camera around just yet because there's a little bit of lion activity and you've got the camera set up quite nicely at this point but with us is Mike as per usual in the comments Mike Kirkman m'kay and then briefs missing he's I said they had rain she had Mala Mala he will be driving for us today and yeah if anybody can hear us let us know that you got two audio well that you have audio yeah so Hayley love wildlife says yes we can hear welcome back to you know welcome good evening from Indonesia [Music] under PC welcome back Samantha flem Twitter back again welcome and dizzy waiting for the Lions because they are earlier yeah thanks Brian glad he can hear us it's effects the Sun is just come out as we went live it was very comfortable for us about five minutes ago and it's just gotten very hot very quickly as you can see all these Lions are trying to lie in the shade there this is the cam boola pride I'm just checking in and saying hello and I love back to everyone and hopefully for you watching if the lion will and the sun's come out but make the lines as hot as we are and perhaps get them to move around a bit that I suspect they're just gonna move from one patch of shade to the other Pippy welcome from the Netherlands and then tr1 any further info on the clash between Gary males and males I believe the guy mouths word on what far to the south of us were they did have interaction with some new young males but both are here at the moment they're back with their pride that Kampala prides things seem to be going well gas is pointing them out there one anyway the one Gary mill is lying in the shade just over there you can just see the top of his baby and his leg and then the other one is out of screen that side there loud and clear from Blackburn in England and Ireland then hi tuna dove see you active already on top of it as usual when I hello from Ethiopia and welcome back to giraffe girl as well and so they did have I don't think a full-on fat I believe it was more chasing around roaring at one another and that this I'm not even sure what they were doing their way outside of their normal territory I think they just heard that there were some young males in the vicinity at least and thought that preempt any well they did a preemptive strike on them before those guys even got it into their heads to try come into the garden males territory I run from India hello welcome it's nice to see people from all over the globe joining us this morning yes Anna mandus Mandurah say it from Sweden Switzerland zoom in please I will zoom in a little bit for you all right so just a reminder for those of you that are joining us for the first time we obviously I'm lockdown here at Mala Mala cameras and we've just started doing the last streaming thing unfortunately don't have any equipment to do it properly and so we've been using our cell phones I Gath uses his cell phone to zoom in fortunately it has a very good camera and I use mine to read all the comments and hopefully onto the bulk of them and I hello from Tanzania and thank you very much Marion Stampley you really do appreciate it I starlings good to see you back in the chat room starlings also comments a lot on our YouTube channel KP Brian Walker a few familiar names here welcome guys so Dylan it's not the ekor driving it's Bruce missing he yaku is having the day off I think after yesterday's adventure he definitely deserves a day off in a cold beer quite something and Tom v7 for one was it hard to find him so no we were very fortunate in the river immediately in front of the camp so we are but gonna give you some persuasion the odds from the nearest guestroom yeah excuse the shaking I'm just gonna give you some perspective as to where we are so you may have seen this on our videos on the livestream the other day this is the causeway one of the two access points to the eastern bank of the Sand River here I'm Marta Marta so these lines are lying just north of the causeway and then we're looking right into the Sun nah but in the tree line you might see some shallot or some units there that is Mala Mala main camp and in sable camp further to the left of the frame so they actually walked through at least a few of the more three camp we found their tracks in camp this morning right in front of the pool so we unfortunately couldn't relocate the dogs they had gone over a hill and into a valley we went up on the opposite side of the valley and then checked again don't that unfortunately that hi-c with the dogs with we had to leave it at that and thank you so much I'm gonna try favia Olsen I'm confident I've got the Olson watt rod but thank you so much for that and and then yes someone had asked about where we are so we at Mala Mala Game Reserve in the southern part of the Kruger National Park and and just flowing in there don't know if you can actually see it on the screen but there's sure you might see one or two pixels moving across there but a lot of vultures there the caps is up one of the younger cups all right so there's a few questions on these lines again just for those of you that are joining us this is a kombu Laprade there are twenty of them six of those are the adults the adult lionesses and then with them or the - Gauri males also they known as the Birmingham males and a few questions on when their last eight so we believe from our neighbors that they caught an Impala and then caught of all the best and then how anti poaching team discovered a zebra caucus also just behind the camp and then we are here in the river and front of the camp so presumably they had all of those animals and then came down for a drink and that's why they quite settled and relaxed now full DBS is a 200 kg animal as a bruh a little bit bigger and impalas also about fifty kilograms so we're looking at you say half a tenth of meat even if a lot of that is skin and bone and stomach that they wouldn't have eated we still looking at a quarter ton of meat that to cut conceived you have potentially lost not an untidy show that all the lions hate that but very very quite something if they had got that right there's a question earlier asking if we are to the south of the timber body we are in as well as a portion of the sabi sands which is south of the man you latest all Marmara is waged between the Kruger National Park and the sabi sands Game Reserve and we are probably as a crow flies about 80 kilometres south of timber body maybe a little bit more an important message from the levers Richard Levin particular yes I am looking after your brother's fish much better than he looked after man because I'm a true animal lover and what happened to your fishery cave is the key yeah I just was a sad ending [Music] [Music] all right folks I said just a few for those of you again that are just joining us we just in front of Mala Mala main camps if you have another device perhaps a phone or iPad or something handy if you google Mala Mala on Google Maps and then you'll see where the camp is and then we are we 200 yards from the camp in the river in front of it that will give you a very precise idea of where we are but yeah we say north of the skukuza which is the main camp of the kruger national park and and then guys far north is shaquan is opposite our northern end leavers just put a little symbol there what is it this is a cake what are the chances are wild lion will attack you and depend so much on the circumstances if we were to get up and walk up towards these lines and we end up that bag to look off turn the thing is so these liens I they are used to us in the vehicle they expect us to behave a certain way all of these lines in fact of grown up as well as their parents and grandparents and have all grown up with vehicles around and all then that humans in a vehicle are not a threat but instinctively they know that humans on foot are bad news and they instinctively knows well that snakes are bad news I don't have to wait for a snake to bite them to know a snake is something dangerous and that's pure instinct and there that same instinct tells them humans are dangerous or humans on foot so if we were to approach them particularly now with the younger Cubs here and we'd be right next to them if we were to get art so they would immediately have to attack in what they would see as being themselves cab we're walking around from far away probably just move off and before it became an issue and otherwise they would start growling at us and let us know not to come closer but often with the Predators their reaction is very similar to if they saw another big predator so that I'd see us as food they see us as a as a threat so someone's just asked where the male lions there's one in frame I'm gonna point spots gonna zoom in a little bit and then points march say oops they're at the end of my finger you can just see the back of him and they're out at the top in the grass they top errata and corner frame that is one of the Gauri male lions the other male lion is out of frame currently fancy cheetah welcome back asking how old are the youngest Cubs so they advance going on 11 months now it's one of the young male lions that's just gotten up and moving about those young males he's getting on to about 18 months now how many Lions would you need to take a male Rhino sir years ago when I worked in zululand one of the lion prides it did she catch adult rana and the pride of seven Lions with two big males and so it is possible but it's very very difficult to to get right and it was kind of a once-off event I haven't known of lions to do it elsewhere the I do you know in some parts of Africa Lions catch elephants and in other parts hippos the Lions here is mrs. Lester asking and team recall that Salalah line is the motley lioness the monthly pride is here in a cab and they were actually seen this morning max saw them this morning yes we were very fortunate the mom and the cab both safe and well and looking healthy and we did film quite a bit of them if you go into Matamoros YouTube channel not today because you've got a bit of a backlog of footage to go through and edit but in the next 2 or 3 days we'll put up a little video with them it will feature these same Kampala prod and then later on the Alex Costa how many lions can see so we actually haven't been able to count them a lot of them are in the bush but they should be 22 total and then also earlier there was a question on what types of wild other cats we get just so there's obviously the Lions leopard in cheetah of the big cats and then the smaller cats African Wildcat serval and then caracal so we have six species of cat in this so on this reserve lions afraid of giraffe as Sheridan so Lions eat a lot of giraffe but they I won't say that I've got a healthy respect for the kick coverage off maybe not afraid isn't the right word but they just respect the the dangers of catching a giraffe years ago one of the other prides when they did manage to catch a giraffe it actually fell on one of the lioness and crushed her underneath so even without the kicks in that there's a significant danger to lions trying to catch her off Cyril Herbert's asking did the female that was mating the Gauri male from T days go find the sisters both Gauri males are present so we are assuming that she might have but we can't be sure because you haven't been able to count these lines accurately I can currently see 19 lines I can't said 18 but I've just spotted a leg in the bush Linda Bailey sorry though it just was the video transmission so we in the Sand River Valley so this is a bit spotty at times a reception also we are filming on cellphones so it is a bit tough for us [Music] any insulin lookin so there was a question I had is Brian our Haven Hillman so you're asking what does come hula means it's a name of one of the rocky outcrops on modern modern the original owner his name was whack Campbell and his the copies were actually named after Campbell for the South Africans amongst you you will know of quemar shoonya Durbin is named after marshal Campbell the same family in the kilee Campbell museum africa and so cam bula copies where these hands had their first Cubs and they come so we named them the Khumbu Laprade when they just moved on to Mala Mala is one of the lionesses getting up and stretching now greetings from Indonesia she's just trying to find a bit more space in the shade there looks like so there was a question on what else we've seen today so as I mentioned earlier we saw the Matthew of Salalah lioness earlier and then a pack of K panting dogs were seen in the north of the reserve by anti poaching teams so we didn't see them I'm not sure if it's the same ones that we were watching yesterday or not and yes Don it one is indeed up we getting the feed a little bit off to you so it's quite funny to see everybody getting very excited sorry fact so there's a lag from when we film it to when it seems to come through on the feed of maybe 20 seconds hey I'm gonna say hi day I know Mike's is Friday but I'm gonna say hi day he's closer i Maryland from the USA where is the mail so effects of mail line is any being quite difficult gas trying to point him out they on the screen he's not at the tip of my finger in the grass there yeah he's hard to see cuz he's lying down right on the edge of the shed and then his brothers and the thicket asking Taylan we're going to know why leopards like to roll other animals dang so the Lions do it sometimes to Talon but the there's a couple of theories of why these cats like to roll around and dung dogs do it as well so that male line is also rolling over speaking of rolling you can just see Amy with his paw up in the air just a big stretch from him that yeah so just to to go back to a question tail answer the phone sorry he the animals like to roll and bang one theory is that helps to cover their scent so say zebra smelling them would know that wouldn't know it's Lions I just smell zebra dang so I'd might disguise the scent another theory is that it helps with send flee perhaps and then some I have also heard particular things like Buffalo dying it might be the salts in the and the dang in the urine that they're after because you'll see them licking it up and it might well be a combination of all those reasons that they do it Friday say hey maybe retire with a hygiene eco-freak asking do they visit your camp so yes that's actually one of our other videos we'll be putting on the Mala Mala YouTube channel soon I think we already have a little clip on Facebook with one of these lionesses running through camp chasing an Impala at about 7 o'clock a few nights ago and they are treks of lions going through camp from last night which we suspect would be these lines all the three youngest Cubs present with the prod say yes see to the fourth one over or the fourth one from the right and it's really hard to make it out but the one that's lying on the further is left of the screen yeah nothing is too big no this one actually lying in the grass you can barely see it morning - can I cook it all the tech Alliance oh yes they can and we have had it here in fact we're one of the big male lions was killed by crocodile and I believe if you go into the Kruger later sightings and the dove I hope you will put a link up there's actually a video there of a lion with a crocodile trying to catch it think it was successful in the end this meal welcome from Mexico are there any other children watching other than talen so Robert McLaren asking can a Prada the reasonable amount of lionesses expect to kill every day and is there a point where the process of wellness amount of food needed by the prod so yes to both perhaps so these lines certainly will try to catch something every day because there are just so many miles to feed there might not always be successful but if going by the reports from last night they quote three animals lost not a zebra wildebeest and an Impala but when the prod gets well already at twenty this prod is particularly big so they might well split up into smaller units today you will get a drop one day how everybody from darkness living and Wilson they've been it at the ground sandy color so and the other thing as they blend in with the dead dry grass in the winter here as well so in the summer the grass yes or the 3-4 feet tall bright green and quite dense and lush so the lines can hide in the grass and behind the bushes and so on we're in the summer winner to blend in and the color of the sand as well Lincoln 1800 so Mala Mala does not allow any hunting at all ever unless you're a lion or a leopard so a couple of questions about whether these animals can get covered 19 so I know there are reports in some papers of a tiger I believe it was in Bronx Zoo and that we certainly haven't tested and I doubt that these lines would be too enthusiastic about us sticking a swab up their nose but it is something I'm sure that will need to be monitored going forward hopefully not and hopefully they never get that close contact with people that would you know you allow that disease to spread to them I'm certainly not in any hurry to get within six feet or less Health Alliance Brian Walker asking how large the prides get so I believe there's a pride and the kruger at the moment that's about 40 strong but they don't all move around together because it is just too many mouths to feed but they have a sort of a shared territory even though they're not all in it today saying I've got a right excellent hello from Greece other from Israel hello from Alabama sorry folks I'm just catching up with some of the stream Jazze test asking when not in lockdown what other properties are we able to traverse jazz it has we have a very large property here and we actually struggle to cover the property when we have guests at least the full extent of the property unless you have guests for a very long time and so we are able to traverse on one of our neighboring properties and Kirkman's camp which is d1 chi'lan rather which used to be a used to be one of my low mileage camps and used to be a property that is owned by Mala Mala and they are larger based on one of our five farms yeah but we we really don't need to with the size the property we are quite fortunate enough the size of our property and welcome back to marcus wagner that used to be arranged again the nineties i wonder if you worked I'm sure you worked with null sukira and brandon ford Chris Daphne I was here when they were leaving and welcome back to Peter bits Lincoln 1800 watching The Lion King no spoilers please the Marilyn Monroe you welcome and yeah we are very fortunate to be out here we soaking it up as much as we can we do realize we're in a very fortunate position here and we just happy to share what we can with all of you that are under lockdown in maybe smaller areas at home so for all I'm asking what time of day the lines normally a hand so generally at night but it's a lot to do with the temperature as well so when it's cooler they tend to mood but more active so in winter June July we do see them active in the day a lot more what does it mean that Africa just what goes on to South African passports and so on to let you know that we are from South Africa I'll say on average I Hina's tend to win a lot of the time it's got to do with the confidence of that Leopard and so the occasionally we do see some letters clean up I meana but it's pretty rare and I've seen a hyena take a full round house from a leopard and not even really blink and just carry on eating so hi Maggie and Gordon good to have you with us this afternoon look forward to seeing you soon hopefully RMB asking of the Lions every tected Jeep so not here but also we are very careful with how we interact with these animals so you can see we parked at whatever distance we're at something at 7 8 meters if they want to come closer that's entirely their decision but they don't see us as food we just this big object that use them every now and then we don't hit them feed them interfere with them steal their mates or their cubs so they just don't care about us does he 1369 asking others easy to follow the wild dogs so there are a lot easier to follow than the wild dogs wild dogs are notoriously difficult to follow they run very fast to the bush and when they get active when wild dogs get activate into jug with lions just kind of walk until they are ready to hunt and then they'll start stalking in any run when really necessary Rob yes we can understand you and I'm guessing your name isn't random silver Danny Lopez have you guys ever accidentally been sprayed by a lion so not me personally but I did have one very purposefully spray on the back of my Jeep he sent marked the whole back of the Land Rover and got it on all my guests blankets so yes it does happen years ago we had one of our staff members always cornered up against the tree the lion sniffed him up and down and he was he looked like a Snoop Dogg if you wanted to compare size-wise do tall gangly guy but ridiculously brave he just stood his ground the lion sniffed him up and down and then two of them sent Bogdan and after that he was never scared of lions again he felt that that clammed and and they never bothered him again so they might have been something in a tree a ton of tea so all the Predators do interact with one another basically on the totem pole the Lions are right up at the top then the hina then leopards then the cheetah and wild dog right at the bottom Jonathan Cooper saying these lines are tame they certainly are not tame and but there are used to our presence here it would be a completely different story would any of us together get off the vehicle polar a skiing with a few lines breakaways cook away and form their own pride and when they set up their own territory had their own Cubs and that that's when we named them the cam boola pride as opposed to the breakaways of the motley prattle the break away from the breakaway mathy prod so yes it does happen it's rare but that's how new prod and sometimes prods just have a run of bad luck and don't have any female calves or unsuccessful and raising Cubs or get killed by other bigger prides so some prides do disappear over time and then some new prides form like this one we go back to the records we can actually follow this prod originating from the math department arrives I'm actually not entirely sure with this pride but overall it's still gonna be 50/50 at Birth but a lot of male lions when they leave the pride they get driven out when they're about 2 to 3 years old by the resident males and then those young males if they're lucky and they've got brothers they'll go off together but there are wherever they are then another resident males territory will try and kill them so by the time they're adults there is about one male line for every seven lionesses I believe as the average in Craig O'Connor saying special hello to Gina - Hinda from the speller O'Connor family we are shred tubs wishes he was stranded with us all keep up the great way I spoke to touch the other day and he does wish that he was stranded with us all and we'll certainly pass on your regards G nuts in Hindi guessing I want you to zoom so flex just again we are using sulfa and so how much we can use zoom in is pretty limited and then yeah for all of you those of you that are just joining us now so this prod we know is the cam boola pride and their resident on the sort of central middle half of Mala Mala Game Reserve and they are 20 strong the whole pride and then at the moment there's two male lions here with them the males a bit harder to see and those two males we know is the Gauri males and so they arrived in the in the middle of Matamata if you were to look on Google Maps and Google Earth perhaps modern male game reserve we're act in front of Mala Mala man camp about 200 yards in front of the camp in the river just where we've got a little bridge we call the causeway where it crosses the river they're just sleeping next to that Robert my client asking about the footage in India of tigers attacking vehicles they so it does happen even in southern Africa does happen if people aren't behaving themselves standing out making too much noise then the animals often react very negatively towards vehicles yeah though we've got very strict rules on how we deal and interact with the animals we haven't had it yet and hopefully we will never have it but it is something these are big dangerous animals so they do deserve all the respect that you can give them are we anywhere near Harry's camp used to be from Megan Gordon we are about seven kilometers north of that and yeah we at Mala Mala main camp and Harry's campus it's not a trace camp spot seven clumps is downstream from us what's to the south of it and someone asking what time it is yes [Music] fire and thunder but yeah so folks that's referring to eternal enemies a documentary about Beverley and Derrick Jubei it's probably the greatest wildlife documentary I think a lot of the Rangers that was like a formative moment for us City it was for me and someone asking do I know where the descendents are that I have absolutely no idea so that was formed in Botswana we can South Africa a couple thousand kilometers to the south to the south of that someone asking can we introduce ourselves to the camera I'm sure we can it's left to give us a second to untangle the camera from it's because all your reel apart can we just introduce alright yeah how many males so there are two male lions in this product effects so just to give you before I introduce ourselves and just gonna give a quick scan around yeah Kemp is in frame now in the trees there and if you can see it the Lions are there we own the cause a and then doing the strong again so you guys okay so the briefs missing is driving yesterday he's our head Ranger and in my Kirkman as per usual on the comments welcome and then I think you've already seen my face my apologies for that and when I try and zoom in my thumb Scrolls over that's and mirror camera whatever I don't know what it's called but the camera that looks towards myself I've been court shots a few times like that how many Marilyn's are part of the price of these two males that are dominant over this pride as well as another Pradhan Mala Mala missus Lapwing and answer to your questions so the documentary is called eternal enemies yeah definitely I wanna say it must be thirty years old now but definitely it holds up one of the good things with the wildlife and the documentaries are made about them is they're pretty much timeless we act we are at Mala Mala Game Reserve right in front of Muhammad our main camp you have to include my name if you want me to see your response any okay Bruce fixes the car that is corrective certainly tries it does a lot lot of other things other than fixing commas so thank you so much for that Sheryl Herbert you know we definitely have been trying and and we hoping has been way more successful than we ever thought it would we thought we'd have a couple of people watching maybe our parents and some close friends all the ranges that are leave at the moment but yeah it's amazing to see so many people from all over the world have been logging on and enjoying this on that that it is quite incredible and something we're hoping to carry on with in the future absolutely a bit more sophisticated equipment as well and many thanks to Nadav for that and obviously we are live streaming on later sightings and Nadav has been incredible in helping us through this process you can see how clumsy we are with our cell phones even so Adams been a great help how many prods are they on Mala Mala gamers so lawrence i think if you want to see a very detailed account of the predators on mathematical game reserve go to our website at www.flcfs.org and the number of kills the number of sightings that's very very informative but we do you see off the top of your head mark how many prides so we're actually trying to figure it out the other day and i think there's as many as 10 different groups of lines so that includes prods as well as coalition's of lions so yeah it's quite a phenomenal amount I think that if I remember correctly at something like 64 individuals from all of those prides if we turtle them up not all the process big is this one so here there's 22 lions you can't quite see them all but in this front it will group at the moment and then some of the other projects mall so it's the marthy lioness is just here in a cab the half-filled line is again just here in a cab and then a couple of the other prod that are a bit bigger but yeah this is the top end of the prod sizes that we see this is a cab on the right-hand side of the screen someone just asked that the Christians came in pretty fast day so I think you've already scrolled past where we are now say thanks to the dev for putting this game report sir and the dava's as always on point and then just a question on why they're painting when they're asleep so they're painting because they hunt it is cooling down now but remember humans we sweat and cool down over a whole skin so that your cooling panel is your whole body surface for a human being where most animals only lose heat by panting so they're cooling down off of their tongue so we've got our whole body surface they've got something about the size of your palm to cool down off of so they're blowing air across that to cool down so that makes us able to cope with high temperatures and run marathons and that the cost is that we have to drink a lot of water where these Lions they drink once a day and they can go two or three days before between drinks if they have to and today you better listen to your mom how hot is it Optus at the moment it's actually cooling down nicely I would say we mid-twenties now it was a lot hotter than that earlier in Lawrence just asking whether I live in the camp we all live in the camp usually when no obviously we under lockdown now so we haven't been part of model model for quite some time but usually we on a six-week two-week cycle so we will stay at camp for six weeks and then we have leave for two weeks and very often Rangers go to Kruger National Park to where you are learns on their leaves and they'll go and camp in the Kruger National Park she's scary but she understands her dad's been asti washing dishes and this disobeying is neither like a terrible child do you guys go camping in the area so yes some of the Rangers do you indeed camping up and then verily they choose not swear there's gonna be massive thunderstorms and rain and so it doesn't always go so well for them but yeah the animals have not been the problem that's been the way they're for camping out yeah but it is a quite a different experience and that you hear an awful lot of the nocturnal sounds of the reserve and you appreciate how loud some of those silences actually can be that doves offering to be our guide in the kruger park the dove will take you up on their own and I've sold some when asking the Lions to wake up so you can see there's a little bit of movement they keep rolling over from time to time and if you look carefully you'll actually see they're all lying in the patch of shade provided by that little tree and Bush next to it and I'm guessing as the Sun moves a bit lower they are can I have to kind of move with the shed or if we're very lucky they might get up and get going and I'm guessing from here I'm hoping from yeah they might go and have a drink at the river the actual water course is just behind them about 20 yards and then from there perhaps we might see them do something exciting but it's not looking like it's gonna happen anytime soon Brian no I don't think the lioness that was mating as a mother of any of the Cubs is so there's six of them in the pride father have had Cubs so it's the sixth one that hasn't had Cubs that was mating with the males and afternoon - Bradley Thomas of Safari architects tonight a asking but other animals not coming yeah so it would depend a lot also on the wind and that our tenth of the animals are I have seen the hyenas Walker act into the middle of the lion prides before it doesn't happen often because there are pretty alert animals but it is very funny it's never ended badly for the I ena but they get a huge front and you can imagine what would happen we actually have a very funny video on Molly Molly's YouTube channel of Impala walking right into this whole prod was all the cubs that were all lying in a line in some grass and kind of bounced out next to her there weren't really any danger to the to him the Impala Ram but I'm sure he's still running he got such a fright Jonathan Cooper yes they're two male lions are right here it's just hard to see them at the moment one is hidden behind a thicket and then the other one is lying right at the back more or less in the middle of the prod it's just very hard to see him he's got the best deepest shade missus Lapwing to answer your question are there any coalition's pushing in on the Gary Mouse not really into their territory though they went on a bit of an expedition the other night and chase some young male lions around in the southern parts of the sabi sands so it does happen but think the A's was more a preemptive strike and perhaps a bit of a smack down to a little young male lions know not to even dare coming anywhere near their territory Laurens just asking me they have a beam to Paul Krueger rest camp and Tim bhavati I've been to the Tim avati game private game reserve and I've been to the Tim avati picnic spot and just an ID weight weighs poor cougar risk and kazuma means I don't mean I've been to squeeze a pork Riga gate but do you get up and do something she certainly would what does happen this prod so there's six lionesses but two of them do often go off and be their own little missions together and then the one that doesn't have cabs often also goes off and goes walkabout on their own so that won't necessarily wait for the pride but there are social cats so they do want to be with other lions so they they will prefer to stay together but if they need to hunt or say it's a mother with a very young cubs that aren't with the pride yet then she will go and look after them on it so dizzy you didn't miss the Impala saying it's on I believe it's on our YouTube channel I'm certain that it's on our Facebook page for Mala Mala Game Reserve the video of the Impala getting a fractal walking into all the lion cubs if Peters watching then I will ask him to put a link on here for you sure and a shock crust Bonjour I hope you haven't fallen off any rules lately and tell welcome jacques is one of the older angels yeah he was guest I'm guessing is pretty jealous but now can you get all the people awesome to put that link on case law Rijn SAS 'king if it's easy for us to find liens sometimes it is and sometimes it's not that's the short answer sometimes they can really give us our underarms and and you just find their checks going in all directions that's if you can find their tracks and then sometimes they are just lying around in the middle of the river run in front of camp like they are today so it just depends pride this large is a little bit easier to find then maybe a single lioness or a leopard because there are so many more of them and obviously there's a lot more tracks of them set pride beside has said me a lot easier to follow than maybe smaller prides or lipids or even wild dogs for that metric as wild dogs move very fast so a question on the lioness spinning a leg so that's just to expose her belly and that thinner skin and pin of fur there so it just helps him to cool down a little bit better when was the last time we saw a leopard so we saw five two days ago if you go on Malta mollies YouTube channel you'll see expect a few videos coming up the lipids we actually had a bit of a bumper lipid crop the last few days but now that the Lions are kind of back in town we had two prides of lions relatively close to one another that this pride and the moth Laprade are about two kilometers in a straight line apart and so when there's lots of lions around and they're pretty obvious animals and we don't see too many of the other predators we're seeing more wild dogs since a lockdown Kristine's we've actually been really fortunate the last few years that we have seen the wild dog numbers increasing that might well be when we had the drought a lot of the impalas actually did really well and their numbers have come close to doubling in the last five years so now the things that eat Impala and Impala make up 80 percent of the wild dogs diet so their numbers have gone up and and there's a few people asking about whether the animals have changed behavior since lockdown so yeah I would say no they probably haven't even noticed that there's fewer vehicles around and that's partly because I simply don't care about us as you can quite clearly see what these lines sleeping yeah you may have noticed to feel those lines picked up their heads there there is a baboon that is barking from Kent and they've all just lifted up their heads to have a look at it listen to it can probably see all these lines lying down yeah I'm sure there's someone in camp trying to keep those baboons away from Kent and Meghan Gordon sadly there have been no more sightings of that Pangolin but believe me we will definitely let the work do you see we did see another very rare animal but we keeping that one under a hat since all the video of it released in the next day or two it was a big first for for Mala Mala as a whole is a reserve in fact new world order or disorder asking can we do cat noises - sea lions reactions if we did that right meow Thank You Abby in big trouble did you enjoy that one job but no effects making any sounds and disturbing the animals will that would actually mean we've lost respect for them and then they'd probably lose their respect for us pretty quickly too so whether it's making noises or throwing lamb chops or tennis balls that sort of thing interfering with animals is not what we're about we purely had to watch and in play and learn from this and about but you are the respect obviously has to go both way do we get nervous filming at night when they are hunting so nervous maybe not the right word but you certainly are a bit cautious I very dramatically had a buffalo crash into me the one not with two Lions attached to it so that made me a bit more nervous of watching lions and buffalo Pete he's in a lot of our YouTube videos he had a Valdivia stand on his lap and get pulled off by the Lions we have to be very cautious because they don't see us so care about us we just any of you heard the expression the referee as part of the court but the other animals who he just happened to be there so they they do their own thing whether we end the way or not and Cheryl have it it wasn't a spotted creature it was a struct creature which I'm sure will confuse you oh yes but we I'm just putting it up it you titillate some of our audience we exactly are we in the Kruger and so we are in if you're looking at the Kruger we on the sort of bottom left-hand side you'll see that a map of the Kruger you'll see skukuza is the main camp and we know we that the property that runs from the 20 kilometers northwards what will we do if we attack by the lion so they're not just gonna attack what we're gonna do is as soon as I start to show any signs that they were aggressive one happy with us we will just leave but we you know the Lions they've never shown any signs of aggression so trying to say we actually haven't been filming at night and we do game drives and so on sometimes in the evening but yeah we we haven't done any of our videos that not partly just because the lot isn't good and you wouldn't really be able to see anything so flex we do not have skank share but we have something called a strap polecat which is similar and that is not the animal that was seen how many prods are they in the Kruger National Park I have no idea it would be into the hundreds I'm sure I seem to remember eating a while ago that there were between two and three thousand lines in the Kruger Park and the average pride size is to say it's ten well it's actually seven but yeah it's gonna be quite a lot of prods yep yeah we've got an idea what he's gonna do Shay maybe he doesn't want that exposure I get stage fright some of the others have their heads up now they're been asking how long do we typically spend with the sightings so Mala Mala is a bit different to other reserves so we stay as long as we want to stay and we're very fortunate that our reserve is quite big and there's not only one or two sightings normally on it so we can stay as long as we like I've stayed in some sightings I think the longest left in the morning and came back in the evening took a book and I sat next to a pride of lions just like this with my guests they snoozed while I read and we spent the day waiting for the Lions to do something which sadly the only thing that did was rather than yawn a couple of times much like these ones and then sorry just to go back for everyone that has been joining us in the last little bit so this pride of lines we know is the Khumbu Laprade these 20 of them all told six of those are lionesses and then there is two male lions here you can't quite see ones right at the back of the pride and then the other ones to the right of the screen in the thicket in the best shade and we are waiting for them to get up and get going but last night they killed an Impala a zebra and wildebeest and ate them all then came down to drink right in front of Mala Mala main camp so we just in front of the camp now which is also partly why we've got such good signal for a change so we've done well hopefully everyone can see pretty well now saying spent eight hours that a leopard in hmm think for those of you that haven't been on Safari to see there's the action you've got to be incredibly patient and it's not that doesn't happen around every single corner and with hunts and kills and all those kinds of things so yeah if you want to see activity you got to be incredibly patient there's Mala Mala handicap handicap accessibility so yes we do I think we one of the only camps that does so one of our rooms is fully equipped we actually have a couple of guests that come every year specifically for that reason so all the bathrooms and all the accesses are set up and Theo York no actor kills one after the other but I presume through the night and sorry folks we seem to be having a little technical issue here it's fun should be fun [Music] just so there's plenty of places where you can do Ranger training it's a quick Google search but then once you start here at Mala Mala you we train for another once at least the end of how we liked things so yeah it's a long pretty important process as well what tom is it it is not just gone five o'clock and that's according to Al and others o'clock so maybe wrong so the question there's four new young lions and sobby sobby is a I believe so we haven't seen that but these two Gary males that are with us now they actually we went down there and chase those young male lions are armed apparently the other night I haven't gotten around to reading or watching that video that they posted but from all accounts the Gary Mills cleaned up this I don't think they'll be bothered by those young male lions for their next one Daniel Gravenstein we can send your CV and we shall see what was your funniest experience with the guests Gareth impossible to answer that and keep it tidy at the same time actually can't think of any of the top of my head if I do you think of an appropriate PG one I was walking guests back to their room one night and they were adamant that there was a lioness watching up ahead and on closer inspection it was a short lamppost with the damn light I don't know how they thought the lion had a torch shining out of its yeah but that was a thing I did speaking of handicap case we did have a old lady here who was being pushed to a room by a family in a wheelchair when an in Yolo one of the antelope ran across the pathway and all family ran away and abandoned grandma to a fate which she wasn't too thrilled about how long before it's dark here so probably in about an hour the Sun will sit here at 3:56 okay two minutes past five is TV still a problem with Alliance I don't think it as is as big as a problem as it used to be the I believe it's as much as 90% of the liens or something or potentially sorry that's frv I'm not sure about tuberculosis one of our range is Craig lever your I'm hoping is still watching I know he did a study on that the other day so maybe he can answer you quickly in the comments most scary experience I'm doing I don't know you have any scary experiences guy um yeah I'd say probably elephant charges right up there yeah say elephants are not something that we take lightly they often more of a worry than the Lions would ever be I did one of my scarier moments just because I wasn't all that familiar I hadn't seen many lipids by that point where as well as having an interview or during the interview process here at Mala Mala about twelve years ago and the interview took place over a period of three nights or three days rather two nights and on the first night our staying in the pilots rooms and you have to walk down a little le way to get to the pilots rooms and I was to meet the manager at the time North Korea in the bar and walked out of the pilots rooms into the hall anywhere and there's a leopard sitting in the alleyway and yeah I was absolutely terrified I couldn't move the lipid just lift the anyway from the end of that came in on and yeah that was quite a scary moment and none of the range is really cared they just want to know which lay but it was you encounter hippos a lot I want to say not that much unfortunately had a big drought where a lot of our hippos unfortunately didn't survive but we do still see them pretty regularly in front of camper the river came on so flex that male line is just rolling over in the back of your screens there at the moment you can see is one white paw up in the air the furthest one in the back gasps gonna try a zoom in Bradley Tama tested and the pilot rooms a few times hoping to get after those gas stream soon now I've said to Brad Mike wasn't there story about someone walking through a leopard kill early in the morning from one of those paths so that was Brad sidekick Richard to give a like I know Richard from school actually how did that story it was either him no I think it was Chris Renshaw the other other sidekick walked right past one of the male leopards that had killed her and in Yala an antelope rod outside the pilots rooms didn't notice a big dead antelope on his lawn or presumably the land eating it Chris Scalia is another prophet God that comes here so the other two gods I was talking about with Bradley they're from Safari architects a book a lot of groups and come visit us fairly regularly here at Mala Mala so Bradley has spent many times for him and his gods get maula maula I'm hoping he's getting his fix from watching this I wish the Lions were as easy to find like this when you sweet tee' 20 come back did that typically sleep in the same spot every night so they run pretty widely they covered quite a bit of ground from Tom - Tom so one day they might move just a few hundred yards and then the next move 20 kilometres but now they don't use the same spot really where we are now there's a bridge over the river and that is a spot that they do often come past right in front of the bank I'm simply because it's a nice easy way to cross view that follow but not even 100 yards from here why she didn't use the bridge like the rest of the pride I'll never know but it was quite funny to watch her trying to cross a deep river the way they sleep and where they go so there is actually no real leader with the lion prides the lionesses all do it's almost like a consensus even when it comes to hunting and that like there's no real leader they all work together and it's almost seamless the males - the brothers the coalition's all work and work so well together they normally would be dominant male 1 my server you but is so yesterday there you have an alpha email and they are the only ones that breed and very strict social order but it's quite a different thing to the the Lions in tizzy 1369 I hope you guys truly cherish every second you get to spend with these awesome creatures and critters out there regardless of what it is we certainly do that is why we have chosen this as a career and we are very very fortunate to be out here right now we all nature lovers say we do like being outdoors and we're very grateful to be out here right now is the white buffalo a bull so FX is a white buffalo that we all cough anyway that we've been seeing on Mala Mala this last month I'm actually not sure if it's a bull I don't know because it's quite young it's staying kind of in the middle of the hood and it's not that easy to to see the videos that you've seen on my youtube channel or from quite far away and pretty zoomed in but uh I'll have to be honest and say I haven't really checked whether it's a male or a female yet Laurens asking what our favorite animals are Laurens I've got a few favorite animals and that elephants are right up there and I enjoy lipids and wild dogs and honey badgers and lions when they active but elephants are certainly up there for me for me it's evil I like following a soap opera with all the different characters and how they interact between the different families nowadays I say it's much more like Game of Thrones because your favorite early and agostina so if you look on our YouTube channel you'll see a little video of that white buffalo and Mala Mala is YouTube channel and yes we do have a few of the ranges that are big tons of the birds Jacque price being one of them your dog saying he's favorite is wild dogs yeah wild dogs are right up there they're very entertaining and there's usually good interaction with other animals and wild dogs are on so the there's a white buffalo of any significance for any of the tribes not so much a white buffalo often white animals do signify something so white lions and there have been a few born in the timber Vaati they have a little white elephant or logistic elephant that we do see here from Tom to Dan what darker last year interesting white Impala get born every year that they get eaten and the same year that they're born and and seeing as they born in November gives an indication how long a little white antelope last year where they very easy to spot in the green grass Megan Gordon we haven't had any what Lions on Mala Mala yet but maybe one day fingers crossed see my sister being impatient wish they'd get up I eat the night Alex if you're watching Ken wild dogs be domesticated just so no one has been able to do that and I've actually never heard of anyone getting a tract I think they're just way too hyperactive for for that to be an option Jacque asking if that white dico is checked to Burma and suppose hippo pools it was actually the shortcut between first turning and say containing yuckles dry but close enough and busy 1369 have you explored wildlife on other continents Gareth and I were joking about the other day once the lockdown is lifted and we can see the world I'm sure like everyone else on the planet we really want to be able to travel around and see more of that we very spoiled that we here but I'd love to do some of these live feeds from other wildlife destinations in the future we're hoping if our YouTube channel takes off and pass and Kruger latest sightings and thank you again so much in depth for organizing this for us but it would be great to do one or two episodes from more far-flung places how far is Hosanna from here where is that his animal Leopard I think he's in the north yeah sangeeta so then in that case if he's at sangeeta I want to say he would be maybe eight kilometers straight line from here so if you're looking at the screen which is facing more less north at the moment you'd be to the west of us or to the left of your screen by eight kilometers some way now welcome from Brazil and thank you for that mrs. Lapwing someone is just mentioning a white in Y all away and there is a video floating around that one of the Rangers has a van in yadah that made its way up to our accommodation that I hope caissons our YouTube channel at some stage we will definitely let you know if it does get up there it's a very funny video but yeah we all did you know when he gets up there guys can read livestream a Q&A I feel like that's what we are doing we just have lions as a background instead of our Talking Heads yeah I said what yes they were white lines in button in the sort of central parts of the Kruger Park and thinking the Swaney area may be wrong but I know there is a documentary crew that's working with that or filming with that lion at the moment so hopefully you'll be able to see that video sooner Tim and his brothers that they are forming well no reckons now they just don't care about us they know we're not gonna disturb them so they're not too fast Navid asking is the same parts but so we quite far north i want to say about five kilometers north of where we left the dogs yesterday probably further in fact and they were running off southwards away from this area and we are right in front of the main camp if you looked on the map we yesterday we were more or less opposite our rat-race camp and so a little bit further from here tanja are asking how close are we to them so we're about seven meters away I would guess and I'm gonna twist the camera around a little whoops so that you can see the front of the vehicle and the red and then back to all the logical glitch as well as society that's halfway there guys sorry about that folks that's a couple of questions there about the wild dogs and their barking so they don't bark like a dog fox its head off but they do a warning box so it's one loud single bark at intervals so the they do bark but not yapping like a dog does the pups I've never actually heard making any barking sound and they in fact so the Lions do you catch giraffe from time to time it's not common because there's not that many giraffe in the area but it is certainly something a big crowd like this would go for so yes they eat them but it's not particularly common Gareth what is your best encounter with AI Hina hmm I quite enjoy watching wild salmon is interact you I can't think of it of ones so I've had a full of laughs when I Hina's have come wandering along past big prides of lions like this and then just the other day we were watching a little family group of I ena playing around in a waterhole and I don't know if it was flies or what the issue was but one of them kept dunking his head underwater I think like I said it was to get rid of the Flies they are they are well there is a hyena that comes into camp every night just about and we've had a few episodes of him getting into the house that we stay in all the ranges at home will know of ramse is the house that I'm living in and he started to get quite wily you know first of all he came in through a door that was left open by one of the ranges but eventually found his way in through the window and we had to start closing the windows at night so the hyena didn't get in and he took one of the other angels shoes and he took my laundry away with him and so yeah we've had a few funny experiences with hyenas in camp as a found one with his head in the despot in the kitchen once and yeah it was very funny trying to see the hyena exit because you're slipping on the tiled floor and wasn't going anywhere very just trying to get somewhere but he wasn't going anywhere very first any other Lions pregnant so not that we know of all of these Cubs that you see in here around 18 months or so so life is probably to have calves then maybe six months from now they'll start mating the one lioness that doesn't have Cubs out of the pride of six she has mated with the Lions repeatedly over the years and never seems to full pregnant so she might well be sterile it is something that does happen from time to time but Yod she might be pregnant but I doubt it based on the history of this particular Lyoness mark gres I believe that's because I don't have the Abdullah from medulla oblongata what's the coolest thing you guys have seen so I'm gonna say all of my coolest sightings on the dance channel on this Kruger sightings channel there's some pretty close so if you go and search there there's some amazing sightings a couple of them are mine but there are hundreds more from other people so there's plenty of amazing stuff to see that if no-one had filmed that no one would believe it it actually happened you can see the male lion rolling over in the back there and then Haley loves wild laughs I think the Gary males of Mel's that we're seeing here dude dominate the inclu Houma pride before they move down here and they just stayed with the Khumbu Laprade they never really bothered going back north which is why those northern Avoca Mel's kind of got their chance without really having to to fight the Khumbu Laprade so they weren't free to take there was some other male lions that we knew as the Metro females that used to dominate them but they were driven off by the Gary Mel so there's two of them now but there used to be five and they've been whittled down over the years to just the two now do the Lions know when another lion is pregnant so yes they will there's one of the Cubs up and about they'll be able to smell in a urine in particular is how they're gonna be able to tell if she's pregnant or not but a lot of the times the animals are very aware of the condition and health of others so they'll be able to smell it in their urine scent marking and so on is how they communicate all of that info and then if one of the lionesses goes to the bathroom now the male lion might just go and sniff and smell and see what her reproductive status is digital tissues yes it is dangerous to have aa Heena in the hospital and so he declares our window is at bat to deter them from coming in I'm just gonna show you some guinea fowl which are on the call right now so yeah you might have your fanny sighting yeah so it see what happens in there notice the Lions they haven't noticed them yet yep I think they've just seen them it's gonna zoom out a bit hopefully not see my own face there's the interesting rocks are you talking about the bids that up when you're talking about the Lions doing their rocking pressure and you saying our voices are lulling them into faithless slumber I thought those cuz you're boring and then I read the next CDs can you follow I've decided that maybe that's not the right route to take see if I had wings I probably just fly over them lioness is looking quite keen there so if like these Lions had the zebra all the best an Impala for dinner last night do you know what it's like when you've had a big meal the next day you kind of feel angry even though you know you shouldn't for the younger lions this is more of a game than actual food you can see quantity of the adults is just watching and then the closest one to them she's got a eyes earthen but doesn't even lifted a head there's a yuan for you and then the did someone order room service maybe that's all that I want to eat them Linda they're just too expensive how can you know what that ate last night our neighbors told us in the sabi sands I was seen with an Impala and zebra yes I volu be a skill and then on Mala Mala they killed a zebra which are anti-poaching team found defects so these guinea fowl look like they're making taking a bit of reach around these lions now you can see the river just in the background there behind the guinea fowl the river has risen so much over the last few days you've had some late rains I think it's put you back on the Lions yeah see it's our break nothing not okay so here comes an elephant so effect so we just gonna see what happens with this elephant say my guinea fowl of chosen elephant of lions let's see what that huh it's the element machine on the guinea fowl in the Lions with yeah let's drop the air and see the Lions are getting out of the way of go forward and I don't know if you can go through that gap there counselor okay this weapons yeah that em particularly like lions like it's just noticed yeah the effects won't be able to see it but there's actually some lines in that thicker tract where the elephant is I don't think he's seen them yet there's a melon pop de xira she let these guys go see a quick fact so we're just going to you we are blocking one of the routes home yeah we're just gonna move a little vehicle across the causeway quick and we will get back to you with the Lions shortly Sonia happens vivia smiles didn't survive they went through three sets of male lions before these Gary males finally settled in and Augustina if I put on an elephant costume will the Lions move out of the way I actually have no idea but I feel like that would be something everyone would want to see on a live stream so let us know when you're free like say grease hinges and a me being honest mata Mata hi guys how's the drive excellent you this elephants still here and he's just in the background behind these bushes I'm gonna get stable again take a second it's nice to see the male's head is up now so Miss Anne Amanda's asking yes so that is our stuff so even though we are locked on and don't have any guests we have some of our gardeners and housekeepers and that that I saw here just to help maintain the camp they're on a real skeleton staff small s a support crew to keep the camp going and also the chefs that are feeding us some pretty delicious food but yeah we also don't want to keep them locked in the camp the whole time so they do get to go on game drives and actually enjoy the place that they work in - and obviously everyone that works in the bush is here for a reason christine prescott a with an account so not really they all kind of scattered we can just see tails flicking and some of the thickets from time to time but I do think the bulk of the pride is here this hill and this has been the one that's been mating the guy really yeah that's gonna here yeah but other the six lionesses are certainly here so if they're here then I'm sure all the Cubs are here and the smallest Cubs the three youngest ones are also here the lioness is greeting one another there folks how old are the Cubs so the youngest ones are 10 months and the oldest ones on a year and nine months if I remember correctly and then the rest of them are all sort of one month intervals going down if you go into modern wallahs website you'll see on our we have a sightings report there that lists all of the ages of the individual animals that we do see so it's not 20 to 6 I don't know if that elephant has spared the Monty get a little bit active but you can see they are all yawning and standing up now and the question or the lion saying is ruff is cats Tang say yes and much much bigger scale at the cat's tongue ten times more but just any of the lioness we're nice enough to lick you clean should probably take those couple of layers of skin off too the Lions are lazy in the day because it's hot and they've got nothing else to do and Christine we're hoping that they all go and have a drink and the mail there you can see is finally up and about maybe his brother will also come out of the thickets that's exactly behind him now that if they do go and drink we'll try and get a view of it and and see the river banks are quite steep here so they might have to cross and kind of come back around how old is the male lion if I remember rotties 10 years old now the lionesses are all between 7 and 8 years old and hello - Erica Hana Bolivia with us the other day too yeah okay done the soft with the cozy what's that that says one - sconce all the codes are there and let's just wait for these other ones to catch up so what we're hoping to do is show you all the lines to come and are going to have a drink that we do have to wait for the stragglers at the back yard just across there you can see the second mail we don't want to block them and there's a brother that's woken up that the road is looking like a bit of a minefield right now good luck please [Music] there's one more line is just coming out there's the last the sixth lioness in lionesses tend to deliver 13 though we did have one man up to 60 in here and one lioness that lived to 19 but those are more the exceptions on average 12 to 15 is about it for them any guest that likes you have no idea how lucky you are that you can't smell a lion and its excrement it's it's pretty nice what smell so I gave summit on the male sizes I'm guessing that probably around 180 200 kilograms in that range I'm guessing they're a bit on the heavier side now because they're all at a big meal last night and how many members of the Khumbu Laprade it's 20 we are maybe 6 or 7 meters from the Lions at the moment you can actually see the very front end of the land drive on screen there opinion ad so they tell tips are always black it's nothing to do with their main color interestingly lions are the only cats with the conspicuous tuft at the end of their tail like the Lions have and the only good when they're about eight nine months old before that are just in small s and snack attack I've seen do you have a show every day so we certainly try to like we've mentioned that we can be limited where we can go on the reserve way there's sulfur and signal and so it's not easy and we've very fortunate that the Lions on an area with this very good signal at the moment but we try if we possible to be on between four and six South Africa Tom Mike Griffin that's harrowing in the dove just thanks to all that to the twenty thousand people that have watched so far thank you from our side as well and it's been amazing to have you join us and we're really enjoying bringing these live feeds to you all and we hope you're enjoying it tea hilarity Brendan Cole as well so in the kill asking them our lines if there'll be a successor it is quite possible in maybe those four young male lines that they were beating up the other day with chasing around in tompa is a fish eagle but yeah it is quite possible those four young males are the only young male lions in the general area that we're aware of that you never know tomorrow we could have a big group of young male lions come over from the Kruger Park and surprise us all microphone asking are there any good at pulling Buffalo down so these lions are not good at catching Buffalo at all and they were very spoiled in the drought that they had these very weak Buffalo so they did have a easy time of the thin but they're nothing like the are filled fraud which would Buffalo killing machines there are not nearly as good and Dave shoe from Canada hello Dave Walken Mala Mala magic indeed New York we're waiting for Mala Mala madness which will happen in a few months turn watching from Alberta and Canada and meet again hi meter again and enjoy yeah I came on safari with me last year gene what is the name of the male coalition so these are the gari male lions otherwise known as the Birmingham males past our neighbors when does it become dangerous what we look for so what they'll do is they'll be kind of if you've got a domestic cat or even a dog you've got a good idea ready but they'll be crouched down upright tail flicking from side to side ears back growling and so they'll give us plenty of warning and any that's maybe a good idea because I often wonder who KS is for things forgetting that it might be us and Alan Frank so we're just trying to show you the elephant drinking just upstream from the Lions Mala Mala madness is what we have here almost every day it's just these crazy sightings that we have all the time and it makes a good alliteration Mala Mala magic is another one that we use and J Gardea does not scare being close to the lines at all we've gotten to know one another quite well over the years and a lot of respect either way for them and the tuft of dark hair matter in a Suzy Q it actually just kind of transmits or highlights what their mood is in like I said if they're getting angry they're flicking it from side to side that just highlights their sort of mood and temperament the same for their ears having the black on the back of the ears at just where the ears are placed is highlighting a lot of their mood even the white straps under their eyes just highlights what's happening the facial expression was our human faces are very mobile and a lot of our communication is nonverbal the Lions faces aren't nearly as mobile but what movement they do have they highlight with those black ears and white eye stripes the Gary Mouse sometimes go to the Kruger Park but hardly ever and how shiny Binga Akshay knee is a greeting and Shangaan ax one of the local languages it means hello and it's a pleasure mill we are very glad that you could enjoy our live stream and hope that you are entertained the Crocs in the winter hibernate sums the big ones just go into the thickets or liars solar armed the smaller ones actually going to burrows in the river banks sometimes Dillon Morgan just asking when do we go live and Dillon we go live when there are animals within cell phone range on the property our coverage is only about 10 percent of the property so we go live when you find animals in that area on an ad-hoc basis if you do want to know when you go live just turn your notifications on for latest on later sightings YouTube channel as well as any of the other platforms or any of Mala Mala game reserves social media platforms a lot of the sightings
