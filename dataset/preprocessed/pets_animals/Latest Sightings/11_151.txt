one is there we live we live I don't know if we're testing it and it W just let us know if we're testing and whether this is working back how does it look like on your screen Doug's missing a tail there here the done if you can hear us will you just send me or what's happening me know if we love you Gary live very fresh because it's 150 people watching folks welcome to Mala Mala it's been a while since we are on this live stream feed we currently have one wild dog center of frame here and we are gonna reposition in a moment they are more wild dogs around here this vehicle over here there's Nick and the rest of the standby ranges Dan Yakub in the back Ian all found these dogs this morning and they are currently filming them and we are going to livestream them and hopefully and hopefully watch them get active a little bit later there are a few dogs that are moving about okay so some of these dogs are active the other vehicle is just gone to go and catch up with them while we organize ourselves in this vehicle and once you get going then we will tell you a little bit more no but if you can hear us mike is on the comments my back hasn't been with us for a while yeah cruise driving and he got Mel in the front co-piloting that's we're just struggling with connection yeah we're just gonna see how this goes we do struggle to match you yeah just chemistry now okay flexi are gonna give this a bash and but if we do have too much trouble with the signal then we're gonna call it a day but for now we are going to enjoy the sighting these dogs really lying in the shade just to the right of screen but two minutes ago and they've just moved a little bit further west and they settled down in the shade again so just hello to everyone that joined us I see there's a few names giraffe go and [Music] we really are out on the very very edge of our cell phone signal at the moment so we are in the middle of Mala Mala at the moment and I'd say it's sort of just south of the halfway point yeah we found these dogs so small I'm just gonna and fortunately we in the same place this afternoon so we've got one team that's busy filming them for our YouTube channel malta Molly's YouTube channel so hopefully next couple of days you'll see an episode on them in the morning and maybe even the rest of this afternoon if the feed does cut arts at least you can catch up on a bit of the highlights later at the moment and they're lying flat like this you can see our camouflage they are in the dappled shade every now and then you just see a white tail flicking but it's always a mission to keep up with these dogs when they on the move luckily we've got yaku who was our expert driver from the last time we were following them hopefully em nuri saying I'm in New York we have rats the size of those wild dogs say yes I you under please see welcome back and now so just four day asking about the pocket Gregory toe or data so we are actually filming off of cellphones it's anyway that we have access here you can't get any other type of equipment at the moment with the lockdown but hopefully soon we'll be able to get better equipment and hopefully even a better signal if we can get a signal booster dizzy 1369 so for a lot of folks I wouldn't have even really had a chance to see while dogs certainly on the last dreams on that just because they're all so active and mobile it's difficult just to keep up with them and that you know most documentaries you see it's a whole mash of different sightings together because I just saw hard to follow I think the BBC's got the best one where they actually followed them with a helicopter was any practical way to keep up with him on the hand Peter Pienaar saying thoughts are Latino that we love watching your videos seeing a group in South Africa now living in Wisconsin very happy to hear that Peter Kells guarding luck welcome back the question on the weather so it is freezing cold in the morning and this afternoon it's actually not so bad I wanna sets 25-ish yeah but as soon as the Sun gets lower it's gonna get cold very very quickly hello Howard saying excellent we're kites thank you very much appreciate that some folks from Tanzania welcome Bharath Bhushan asking of an Impala nearby so when the guys were on their way to the sighting they did see some Impala not particularly far from here so with luck we might see something exciting happen fortunately in a relatively open part of the reserve if they go east or west there's a large open area that hopefully they ran through if they're run north or south they'd begin the struggle because the bush gets quite dense and there's two large drainage lines either side to the north and south what distance do they run on average per day Ozma Rekha I'm actually not even sure but it's I want to say 1015 case pobably wouldn't be far off when they just trusting around and on a normal move where they can cover five or six hour kilometers in a couple of hours so they certainly in a day they could easily traverse from one end of Mala Mala to the other so someone asking do you know what Peck this is we're not a hundred percent sure we have yaku is with him this morning and yucca how many do you think they were in but yeah so they're quite difficult to count as you can see and they're lying in relatively short cross and even so they're quite difficult to count but yeah yeah ku says 12 or 13 if you didn't hear that they're telling us it might be raining here tomorrow let's hope not I'm quite enjoying the cooler weather without their own opinionated is it a welcome back dub dub is the park open to the public or lockdowns affecting us yes the lockdown is affecting all of the parks and that so it's just the arranging team on the support team that's here on the reserve at the moment so if we're not doing live streams and the YouTube video and we're helping with all sorts of other field related activities and some of the anti-poaching support roles as well so the this is almost what we do for fun when we're not working is try and show you folks some of the animals that we're trying to look after while we still here I'm a sugar Swami hello from India he loves wildlife pointing out that all you can see now is their tails flicking up and down so they just are sleeping we're hoping that they get active pretty soon there's one that's getting up now okay never mind but they did get up briefly and just move a bar so we're hoping they're gonna get up and get going quite soon some of them are lifting their heads up at least in pet safe for joining us again welcome pet jazzy tears the gods in ik st. Nick from the other vehicle is this point start to hit of impalas which are about a hundred meters to 150 meters maybe to their waist I'm not gonna point the camera in that direction none of these will I see ones just left let's head that's maybe you notice that hit of impalas but folks if these animals do start running it might get a little bit bumpy so just excuse the camera work when that does happen that's I'm gonna have to hold on with at least one hand and you are we hoping that they do decide to hunt those impalas they very often have hunts twice a day especially a larger peck like this they'll usually ant early in the morning and late an afternoon now the impalas have not noticed these wild dogs yet hello Muir for arrow away from Robin sOooo they have been doing a day off so Robin if you are still watching or paying attention can you message everyone and let them know to watch and folks a few at home maybe could take a screenshot and share it and like it with your friends as well and let them join in I think that we probably gonna see something exciting happen here at some point well so if you've got kids that are watching just be a way that if they catch something good also be a little bit more vivid than what you used to watching you know this might be a PG episode John Gill fan asking do we see lots of snakes not so much there around but it's not something we see often there's lots of other animals that eat snakes like all the eagles and mongooses and that's any snake that's too visible gets eaten and so they're not something we see a lot of though there are here dizzi asking do they kill for food or just for because they can and I think it's it's the kill for food like there's no killing for fun is almost the trait of a psychopath I'd say animals are many things but demented Psychopaths is not one of them I'm hoping that dog that's standing up actually spots a Impala John Gilfillan says hi to Hindus he knows on the other vehicle I'll point the camera at him in a in a second or in a little bit when you do take the camera off but a Hindu says hi back then was a view that I'm not sure what digs are it's like a kind of den that South African students live in filthy Hall is another word for it in hi to Ethan and Alex and Tyrion Chris oh my family at home watching opinionated tell that to my cats they never kill for food just to give me his gift well that's a good enough reason I feel giraffe go saying she has shed to everyone what peeps how long have you been doing this for one per ass Gareth for you sure in total about five six years they're in their BOTS three or four Yahoo and 17/18 for myself so combined quite a while now and Mia Ferreira when you get to remember your question you're welcome to ask it today is putting it on his insta but they also effects for those of you that are just joining us we on the very central parts of Mala Mala Game Reserve so if you look at our reserve it's like a rectangle in shape and we're more or less exactly in the middle of that rectangle and the pack of dogs we're not sure which pack this is but they are about twelve of them I think they haven't all stood up yet and we haven't really got a good counter them in this long grass and they are not far from a herd of Impala if you're looking at them on the screen they are to the left of the screen and they're within about a hundred meters are the dogs but neither is aware of the other you can't quite see it but there's just a small band of shrubs in between the two groups what we're hoping is that now with the rat let the Impala are going through maybe the Impala make a bit of noise and get the dog's attention or for one of the dogs which you just kind of stand up and just move five or six yards north or south around the bush it'll see them and then it will be game on and what we're going to try and do is keep up with them as best we can and however it's important to bear in mind we filming in the middle of the bush with our sulfur and so the signal is not super reliable but we're gonna try our best in Brian Elmer asking Mike m'kay but I think I can probably answer on behalf of MK and the rest of the team yay asking his Mala Mala the best place you've worked it without a dot I think in terms of game being there's very few places that can come very close to my tomorrow they've sure have either of you been to the Mario migration I have dev dev and I've been a few times yeah I've guarded up their little bit it's lovely so there's one so the dogs keep moving just to get the last of the afternoon shade if you in the Senate is still quite hot so that's why they keep just shifting about a little and that that you really are hoping that you know later that notices and father we've got ourselves in this vehicle doing the last streaming but then we have another vehicle that's just filming for malamaal as YouTube channel so we hoping even if the feed cuts out if we driving too quick and go into sort of the low area or lose signal at least you folks will be able to kind of catch up with what happened on our YouTube channel and I'll I've got high hopes for these dogs right now a nice big pack like this they're incredibly successful hunters they're not as fast as the cats but they've got tremendous stamina so they can run and run an exhausting Paul as the strategy rather than stalking and pouncing like a cat do and with a big pack like this because I think there's about 12 of them here it should be relatively well they should be relatively successful and trying to isolate wine and Paul and keep that individual in sight as they try and run it down and then fortunately for us as well we in a relatively open area close to a road so we should be able to [Music] should be able to keep up with them so John Gila fan just distracting me completely opinionated today saying I think we're all coming tomorrow Mallory and this is all over you guys have done such great work sharing it with all of us thank you opinionated it would be lovely to host you all I said would be quite something to meet all of you in person Febby Voser asking how strong is a back force so I'm actually not sure the other day we mentioned the Jaguar as having the strongest bite force of any of the cats and just when we got back to camp I looked it up to confirm it and I saw the sort of top 10 animals most strongest bite forces and I don't remember seeing the wild dogs on that list or even featured so certainly nothing compared to some of the other animals the lions and leopards and that that we have here and definitely nothing compared to the crocodiles and well the crocodile was actually the top of the list the Jaguar did have the biggest strongest bite force of any of the cats but it was dwarfed by a crocodile I think the crocodile was something like 5,000 psi and the Jaguars a thousand 200 or something like that but dogs weren't even on that list as measured in Henry do be asking his mother model game is even greater Kruger it is we are sandwiched between the sabi sands Game Reserve and the Kruger National Park and there are no fences on any of our borders saying we should offer a discount to the regular viewers I wish that was my decision otherwise I would have a lot of people here however that's gonna has to go away ever wide opinionated asking is anyone ever tried to create a domesticated breed of wild dog so not that often I know of action ever heard of anyone even raising perhaps I can only imagine there would be an absolute handful because they're very busy animals we have a Belgian Malinois pup at the moment that's part of our apu team and she's a handful on her own I couldn't imagine what a headache all pack of wild dog puppies would be like but no I haven't heard of anyone domesticating them I think partly it's also there's kind of no need in a way if we already have domestic dogs don't need to reinvent the wheel and I think just by their nature they they just wouldn't domesticate too well which is true actually of the vast majority of wild animals all right so you can see one of them is getting if it walks just a few more yards to the north that's doing something else it will it'll see those Impala but hopefully as they milling around and that it will notice them so someone was asking what talking about a pregnant while dug in another reserve I've just noticed that one of these wild dogs does look pregnant and I did least check about I don't know if it's the one that's got its head up and sort of sent a lift of screen there one Winton lay down there she didn't look pregnant okay Luca Marrero saying he's back he hasn't be about being able to join the livestream because of school well good to have you back Luca then Robin if you still watching maybe you can just get hold of Peter and let him know that we live on YouTube Kameron mark is just asking how long it will take to become a trekker Cameron I'd recommend that you go to for guys's website and just look up I couldn't tell you off hand but if you do google it you should be able to find out maybe for guys's our our place to start if GA is a Robin thank you and the Impala folks are starting to move a little bit more southward so hopefully now that they've moved from behind the bush the dogs will notice them I don't think there's actually anything in between the two groups now there is a danger that the the one dog that's standing now and just kind of looking around he's looking the wrong direction it needs to look kind of to its right more but the Impala might see at first and run away it's actually walking it's facing completely the opposite direction to ahead we needed to look Keagan Jen saying he's gonna let all his friends know about the stream thanks Keegan and then Hendrick pencil putting the bat force of a wild dog at 317 psi so I'm sure it's no fun to be bitten by one but nowhere near the force of some of these other animals that we get other folks just mentioning how much they all have wild dogs so I think certainly for the Rangers for assets one of the most exciting animals to watch because despite them just sleeping now there are the most active of the Predators you know now you can see even though they're sleeping they're kind of milling about and they're fairly Restless animals the cats would just be unconscious you know you at Basya ear flick in 18 hours of their sleeping so and then if you're gonna watch anything hunting the wild dogs or if their success rate is probably closer to 50% point I point out this one standing up in the foreground yeah is missing the white tipped its tail so all of these wild dogs and it's just gotten down to the Impala yeah see if he does anything about it Akim yes you may ask questions af frontal cortex asking all the flicka new years because of insects yes one of the bonuses of watching this from your home or on a screen as opposed to being here is you don't have to deal with all the flies that are here in Los Angeles yeah painted wolf obviously a really big fan of wild dogs painted walls painted walls and opinionated saying a TSA members are very low it's one of the reasons that we always quite excited when we see them is that the numbers really are unfortunately very low and partly that's just because there's no space for them so these big packs I need hundreds of square kilometers to maintain a pack but then for a wild population you need many many packs in a given area and there's just not the space to house that many fairly voracious predators particularly of impalas you know the Kruger National Park is one of the places where we do still have a wild population in South Africa a self-sustaining wild population but even so I think the numbers here I've heard with from 180 to 250 so in that range but you could well be looking at sort of you know a significant percentage of the whole population right yeah in Sylvia Elena Lopez de Moraes I hope I've said that right saying she likes our channel lock Thank You Sylvia for those of you that don't know about our channel we have a YouTube channel where we film these animals unfortunately we can only live stream where there's sulfur and signal and that covers about ten percent of the property so for all of the other sightings we do film these sightings and you put them up on our YouTube channel so please go and have a look Megan Gordon welcome then someone asked I think Friday asked have you nearly died right here we can't talk about that because Mike's mom is watching and a question as the poaching rate increase fortunately not here I'm sure it's something that will unfortunately happen has sort of economy shrinks a little bit but there we are preparing for that John Gila fan the fan of Liam so we did see a Pangolin if you gone to our YouTube channel you see one of our first episodes McMahons a Pangolin so they're very rare but it's something that we have been able to film fortunately on this channel effects I'm just gonna give you a little look around here so for he's it's just looking towards that vehicle there they're busy forming the wild dogs Liam's giving away for at the center Dan at the back and Nick driving asking ok so yeah the dogs yeah and then I'm just going to point towards where the impalas are and then I'll introduce you all to you yeah so central screen I'm gonna zoom in a bit more you can see them grazing in the sunlight there and then just to show you he's on our vehicle yeah his mic he's on the comments there's Mel she's not training your angel Mel anymore she got her applets so she's now 60 ml is their call sign is yaku driving me and then myself Gareth and back to the dugs so just a few questions on the wild dogs and their numbers so partly the numbers are declining just because there's no space for them unfortunately when they go out of reserves and come to contact with domestic dogs they're quite vulnerable to canine distemper and rabies or the big ones earlier there was a comment by someone that had seen whole packs and that was in East Africa I think they went from having two thousand or two and a half thousand just down to I think one or two packs left at the end of a very serious can on distemper outbreak so now on the Kruger certainly we try to catch them and inoculate some of them against those diseases and that's a fairly topical point at the moment but animals get diseases and their numbers can shrink as a result just like we can so disease is actually a big factor and animal mortality and then the other thing is yes lions do you kill a lot of the pups things like hyenas leopards even crocodiles and kill them so then John Gilfillan saying Darren value as I say he's mate it's Telly's so he's waving his waving John looks like this I mean just in the diver you put up our sina dabs on a test per usual putting up our link to our guys if we stop talking mid sentences because these dogs might be getting active and then just watch closely but thanks to Nadal for helping us out again and he's he's put our link update to our YouTube channel okay just gonna keep quiet for a little bit they are starting to get a little bit active so when you do hear the sound almost like birds or Canaries that's the dogs that's actually not birds and make a very funny twittering sound when I get going seems that they're gonna be a little bit quieter but to come back to a question asked earlier by frontal cortex what is known about vehicle communication used by dogs especially in their hand so they do make this twittering sound when they're all kind of waking up and greeting one another and when they just excited in general not so much when they're hunting but after a hunt and they're trying to all regather they make this sort of hooting call to to one another to kind of gather the troops up again when they're hunting some of these hunts can last for kilometres and they do get quite widely scattered here on the bush and it's not like East Africa with sort of vast open plains yeah the bush is relatively dense so they can't see one another so those big ears you can see on camera sticking out of the grass is actually how they hearing one another and those hoots to kind of just regather but generally if they're all quite widely scattered and they haven't made a kill they go back to where the hunt started so if we were to be following them and they'd chase the Impala and they didn't catch anything this would actually be a good area to come back and see if we can find them again because I'll often come back to where they started and then the other call they make is I could a single Bock and that's more if they see a predator something they see as a threat they not kind of like a dog barking and yapping its head off but just single more like an alert or warning back then are they asking why do all of us have such short hair so Peter gave us all the hair cut the other night and yeah we are still under lockdown here and I don't believe any addresses about but we haven't left the reserve much I don't know why we interested Peter to you this better also the Clippers only have one sitting that's all I think the last time was off the reserve was in February that's been along we've seen 12 but there might actually be one or two more it's as hot as you can see it's pretty hard to see them when they're all lying in this longer grass and again just for everyone joining me on Mala Mala Game Reserve and Rock bang in the center of the reserve at the moment we're at the very very edge of our cell phone signal so mine keeps lagging and dropping out from time to time which is why we can't always answer some of the questions it seems the live feed is going through ok the video feed but if the dogs start moving we're hoping that they'll move east or west and we can stay in signal to our north and south this other side of us is too large drainage lines if we go into those dips who are you gonna lose signal but we should be good for here and there is a herd of Impala in the general area they're just moving slowly away now the dogs just don't seem to have noticed them we hoping one of them are the cesium or if the Impala perhaps make a bit of a noise it's a ratting season their breeding season that might get the dog's attention and then tap know how it's saying is learning so much thank you thanks stupido I hope yeah just go don't you say a frontal cortex asking is the easy way to identify males from females so there is the obvious way but aside from that not really they all have a relatively slender bull the male's little bit thicker body and neck but although I wouldn't like these ones that are all lying down now there's there's no way you would see which one is a male and female interestingly with a big pack like this like I say we think there's 12 or maybe even more here only the alpha male and female breed one of the females that stood up a little bit earlier and the feed like she was very pretty and what they'll do is I'll find an altar under something paintings they might current resident may be above and use that to Denon and that should hopefully be any day now they den in the winter and partly that's because all the impala are concentrating around the last water and pollen mass drink every day and impala a big part of their diet so if they can get their food at its most concentrated while they want kind of nailed down to that then they cond roam these huge territories that they occupy they confined to a relatively small space so they need the food to be concentrated in that smaller space but ideally also with fewer predators in it like lions and leopards so they want somewhere where there's lots of food for them but far enough away from that food source that they're not - seems like the impalas are finally noticed and it's taken them some time starting to alarm call now welcome Sheila cobbler so a few questions on where the animals are telepathic or not so for a long time people thought that elephants were perhaps telepathic and further research and that found that they actually communicate with these very low-frequency rumbles that we can't hear so the it was discovered that elephants are just making a sound that we not aware of unless you have specialized sound equipment and there that's opened up a whole new avenue of research into animal communication and they now know that things like the big cats and Rihanna is also capable of making and receiving these sounds so it's bringing - yeah so that one that's walking across you can see it eats fairly clearly she's not heavily pregnant but she is certainly looking so she's currently racks of screener and standing at but yeah so just to finish what I was saying that there might not be telepathic they might just be hearing a different range of sounds to what we are hearing and that's true of a lot of animals but even people kids are able to hear higher pitches and adults and as you age you lose your ability to hear some of those higher frequencies but not necessarily supernatural it's just not understood yet and Baba Muhammad Ershad and a few folks can hear the Impala all alarm calling at these dogs in the distance and it's like a snorting sneezing sound Pina later asking do their share areas with other pack so they they have a core territory it seems and then there is a lot of overlap and when they're dinning they'll keep other packs out of the the vicinity of their dens but over the course of Tom had Mala Mala we see four sometimes five packs in a year and we mark our months from seeing one particular pack to the next I've seen them unfortunately one pack killing a member from another pack and it was fairly brutal but quite unusual to see that sort of aggressive behavior from the dogs normally they say leaders are playful animals so it's unusual that they get into fights opinionated asking how many pups will should give birth to and do Moses live to maturity so unfortunately most will not survive to maturity they have a very low success rate and raising pups and the number of puffs they can give birth to is actually unusually high so things like lions and leopards two or three the axes is kind of it.where with the dogs because they're cooperative beat beaters so only the alpha male and female breed and but then the whole pack hands to support those pups so I think the record if I remember correctly was 22 at Pretoria Zoo and that's a zoo animal so probably much better fade and that then looked after than a wild animal would be but sort of 10 15 is an unusual which is a huge amount of pups but again the strategy is like raw they have 15 pups and how to survive then invest everything into those one or two and not all of them survive so if I say they look like they're getting might get bumpy nufix so we're gonna sleep with them as long as we can hopefully the signal doesn't cut out but rest assured if it does we are gonna continue to film them one of the reasons we have a last streaming vehicle here so that we can follow them for that but then we have a second vehicle that's yeah that's purely here just to film them and that so if the stream cats out on a YouTube channel and hopefully you'll see a successful hand for a hunt at least in the next couple of days once we're done with editing it and also if you want to see that you can like and subscribe to your mala Molly's YouTube channel and you'll get a little notifications channel you'll get a notification I mean our cell phone signal and we've got no way of predicting that which is why that little Bell notification that's pretty important because we can't schedule it you'll just get some notification at some point but yeah the dogs are certainly looking like they're gonna get get going very soon this is a full scheme time so one of the reasons we can I have to go to the full scheme is I think it if they do start running it is gonna get very busy and I can say we've got yaku as our expert driver to hopefully navigate and keep us up with the dogs yeah we all will see Angela Smith that is very unusual to see painted dogs in the Kruger they are very very animals today is time to see your shoes when we get going yeah that is a lot fewer trees here than the last time we are trying to follow these so we don't have to back down as much hopefully and thank you to Aaron tall cortex for liking and subscribing to our channels he's also asking or she perhaps one of the dogs only has half a tail wonderful to fix it standing in the pack and it's actually hard to say I don't think so one of the functions of that tail is just as a look at me symbol so follow me symbol so when there are running and that probably the only thing you'll see on the screen when they're running is those white tails so it just helps the pack to stay together and it would be a bit of a symbol but it also could have lost it in a fight and only you know if it is the winner of those fights it could even possibly be the alpha male if you won that fight but it's very difficult actually to tell which is the alpha male in these packs because there are fairly democratic animals the Markov Carter you are correct so there are one of the most successful hunters or probably the most successful hunter I have read a lot that something like 90 percent of their hunts are successful but yeah it's probably closer to 50% and I think that's also just their style of hunting is to run down an exhaust animal so that works really well in East Africa on those big planes where they can see an animal and run down an individual to exhaustion we're here in this low felt bush fault that we have the animals can actually go and hide away from the dogs if they lose sight of the dogs well the dogs lose the sight of the Impala it might actually get away from them if it tacks down into a bush and sit still to Pillar asking at what speed did I ran so I've been when I've been chasing a push back on a road I was going 60 kilometers an hour in a Land Rover and the dogs were pulling away from me so Land Rovers are not well known for their speed and also the accuracy of their speedometers but it was pretty quick so even if it was 50 kilometers an hour they might have been going 60 so they are very quick when they're in a flat-out run okay so those are the guys that are diligently filming the wild dogs yeah you can see their dogs are not concerned about the vehicles whatsoever okay walking right up to the vehicles and Haley loves wildlife yes he is one here with the limp so we don't unfortunately we don't see dogs often enough to get to know him as well as we know our lions and leopards [Music] you know are they we gonna try and follow or keep her the bulk of the pack yeah so we gonna get going so excuse us to pray a little bit bumpy for now I'm just gonna zoom out a bit so it's easier for you to see Andrian cut it often and you are just south of the northern border of Charleston farm and right yeah it's nice and open so we have these dogs just continue in the open areas listen out for the noises they make so the second filming vehicle is going to drive with us today just because it's easier to follow these animals with two vehicles and the good news is they're following hopefully the direction that we also have signal again just forgive us if they if the stream cuts up it might just need a second or two to buffer well I flex and then also just unfortunately it's a little bit tricky to read the comments and questions as we bounce around through the bush and we're going to really try our best to keep up with these dogs so you can get and then heavy lungs alivelife suggesting and get the seatbelts on that's probably not a bad idea if you're that then Tiffany cause fall from a seatbelt right now and then the question her de asking if they are there hunting so if these animals are moving then they are hunting just by their nature they're always on the lookout for food and one of their tactics is to kind of run along and see what they can flash out as they go I think they gave up on those Impala even though they were relatively close Impala were able to see them but this is a very good area for Impala in general so hopefully they come across another herd of Impala but running through me perhaps if they the Impala and Hey Wow dogs are like to give love me with so that they don't but that uncie Hansol success coming through I'm getting the comments but not the rest of the feed these smaller trees are calm Britain's or Bush whalers and then these tall ones yes the slightly more open area not all right so we're back on the crest of the next Hill hopefully you've got the signal coming through noggin we're gonna stick with the dogs as much as we can if we do drop off like I say try to keep tabs on our YouTube channel and see if you get the rest of the hunt there Robinson's it's bitchin now and we'll just see if it does like I said if it cuts out again we our plan is to try and stay with them until it gets dark here but the dogs cover tremendous distances you know we could start this or in this feed in the next hundred meters or next two kilometers yeah so if we do if the ders cut out in the next hundred meters you just want to say thank you so long for all of your comments and for being with us this afternoon and for all of those regulars that comment on our YouTube page we appreciate your support federal courts are saying this is so much better than your typical nature documentary like something it's it is quite cool that you can see this laughs this is City we've got some of the most endangered animals in the world the second most endangered Carnival Africa and you are able to watch them laugh as they start their hunts and a light afternoon from all over the world you've got people from Chicago to Brazil and what you're seeing is like the raw uncut footage and you can appreciate with those nature documentaries that we watch well that you see the 45 minute documentary might take years before the BBC are particularly good at producing wildlife documentaries they'll spend two years to get the 30-second shot and this is what happens behind the scenes yeah this is what went into it there are even our little 15 minutes on our Mala Mala YouTube channel so we might film this it will take 2-3 hours of following the animal and then eight or nine hours just of editing the footage together into a little twelve minutes video so as we driving through the stick push again you can see that a lot of these bush rollers have yellow leaves on them it is autumn here and in the next few weeks all of these leaves are gonna turn yellow and it's gonna be very beautiful and yeah I mentioned already that is quite chilly here in the morning Wow whoo asking our using a gimbal for the camera it's just my steady hand we using rock steady for us and the highway sulphide mounted on a Jovi gorilla part but not the most hot cake Wow cool also asking do we use trying shots Valen it depends very much on the individual animals and some of them don't mind the drones at all and some Jews we always give it the animals there and the same applies here just Malindi people asking us about social distancing at BOTS it affects we've all been on this reserve since everyone's running then so yeah coos Justin are we live whistle okay say 4x just updating there we saw the dogs running and then it's him or a road at this point skinny more out of signal range stick by the time we get to the other road remark wallet muscle completed but we'll try to stick with them as much as possible hey yeah here we go he's all right can you believe it can see Mike's been doing this for 17 years great cheap born on the street Marc there's any Mala Mala ranges that are watching I guess we yeah yeah sorry nephew hit mark there and better if you any model mother Chagas beautifully so let me kind of do Naz that dogs were last seen right Ridge up the hill so this is why you've got signal at the moment but the second we move over the ridge we're gonna lose it again hopefully they stay yeah also hopefully if we keep going the way they are down into the central parts of Mahna Mahna and then hopefully we'll be able to find them in the morning and smash dream again so the one the one that ran vaulted north thank say I'm cats the northern end of the Drakensberg range very famous mountain range in South Africa den Monsun Ridge written I know that every one of other ages driven this road with at least every single case that we have you should recognize it in a second okay let's just go back to the rights they can see okay so here's a big Junction for all the Mulla Mulla ranges you've just seen some tracks on the right so I think we're gonna catch up with them now there's again that big open area hit in fact their light in the open it'll be pretty cool look at time let's go okay the other vehicle have spotted five of these dogs you can see the Sun is about to search we're going to go back once the Sun sets yeah the light diminishes very quickly and we do not view these animals at night the minister's very quickly here breathing coal you got a drop but I feel like you're cheating there so what was it Brendan position that yuck we just announced on the radio forget that I've Konya these people talking back to me I'm on camera you I'm receiving something I don't know what it was if they were successful we'll probably have them all calling to one another to get just kind of regather the pack it's a it's a looks like there's a drainage line there it looks like these dogs are running parallel tests but in a drainage line so we're just going to keep on driving north parallel to the strange line and hope that some of them pop out you have a look at some of these trees yeah these silvery look I thought that is kind of doing it as a plan but yes they do you get separated run and you can see how thick this bushes so just like the two vehicles getting separated get watch your heads that looks like against this open area which would be nice okay and see some of them it they in the open area we've just come from yeah this is much better yeah so this is gonna be a lot easier for you to navigate well done your coolers difficult driving I must say very well to stay through there I feel like you might get bored now that there's not enough PC dodge in this open area yes that dogs sniffing would close to me yeah I saw the tracks all right so they're maracas we have found Wally but yes I am eager to go back to a question I knew Smita or get split up while they're hunting and then they start to hit and call to regather once I've either been successful or not so what we're hoping here is that they will maybe gather up again on this big road junction there's some dogs in the background there and further to our West that I headed north you can see them in the in the background just jogging North asking how many packs live in the parks on Mala Mala we see about four packs sometimes five over the course of the year in the whole kruger national park I couldn't tell you but maybe 15 or 20 hopefully a lot more than that and some packs are much bigger than others as well and then loui daeun washington just helping us out so flex we aren't always able to go live and that even if we were to find the dogs tomorrow hope they may not be somewhere with this signal so the best way to get a notification that we love is to go into this channel tricks then the lesson those notifications normally we all go love any time in the morning here in south africa or otherwise from about 4:00 to 6:00 in the evenings more for until it gets dark you can see the Sun is just on the horizon it's about to sit behind the Drakensberg and that little section you can see is the Blood River Canyon just to the to the right of the Sunday so Pilgrims Rest is up that Canyon three round ovals that's a part of the world you're looking for and it's great with while giggling that and just having a look at those images really really beautiful part of the world for those of you that missed it it's bladder BL y de we have a canyon I think it's a third largest canyon in the world I might be mistaken maybe someone can google that first third largest and the largest vegetated canyon in the world after the Grand Canyon and the fish river canyon which are both in deserts vivi what are the Chancellor dogs finding something to eat that's the reason we're sticking around we think that chances are very good it's just a question of them finding an Impala or duiker perhaps though they do seem to be more interested in sniffing around in actually hunting at the moment we on one of the major road junctions so they're probably smelling all the other animals or leopard tracks here as well things like hyenas and lions also will come through yes sir not that they care about the territories of those other animals but they'll certainly be interested in knowing what other predators are about we already fingers crossed hoping rabbits poor sacrifices to the gods sorry Mel I've got bad news for you by the way and that they den here on Mala Mala because they Ultron den in a low predator density area but where there's a high density of things like Impala and that and this is the time of year that they're gonna start to den so if we're lucky they might been here but before they do they need to investigate that area thoroughly I think if they start going we'll try and keep up a bit longer that the light is fading if they start going into some thick layer nard and then if we're going to follow them to much longer and they stay in more of these open areas they know we'll stick with them but you've seen are difficult to this to drive through these areas you know as it gets darker for us and it's actually appears lighter on the screen of the cellphone yeah it's a lot darker in reality it's just gonna be more and more difficult for us to see stumps and the lack in these thicker areas so we're just gonna stick with them as long as the light holds for us listens and see this one investigating around this fallen stump that's a pretty good place to look for other animals that might have Sint marked and even maybe flesh out a little scrub here a little rabbit I think this is the one whose tracks we saw earlier is coming back to rejoin the pack obviously they weren't successful with their hand there's you know that whitetail stands out back to this one but yeah so this fallen tree stump would be the perfect place for any animal to scent mark it's kind of obvious feature so just like we put signposts and very visible obvious places so do the animals and the dogs have an amazing sense of smell so not only would they know what type of animal was here that also know how healthy it was how long ago it was male female all that information that I'd be picking up it looks like the whole pack is coming over to investigate the same Stan Oliver Matthew hello ollie they've been spending quite a bit of time showing interest in dennings well then not so much but they they could have been spending more time here and we're just not seeing them so we really singers crust that they're gaining here this year we're not going to go fax these dogs going to the stick bush line yeah we're not going to follow them there are some that are on the road still so we'll stick with those owns and there's one running to lift yet our West which is absolutely beautiful with that sky behind it so folks now's the time to do your screenshots and like and share that on your respective Facebook and Instagram pages and hopefully you can share these amazing sightings with your with your friends but these kind of spectacular scenes like this that most people would never get the opportunity to see one of the dogs dying walk with a little bit cool hey here's i'm pato running straight north it yeah so good news folks is that we're out on the crest of the hill so this is about as good as our signal is going to get bad news is and I running towards another of our large drainage lines but hopefully that'll get there before it gets too dark alright then welcome vrs five six one three Bibi asking have we seen any other animals not really we've been kind of focusing on their dogs today don't I think everyone was kind of focused on the dogs but because they're just so hard to follow which is why we had our other vehicle doing the Mala Mala is youtube channels videos yet also we don't see the dogs often enough to really put too many episodes with them happen and get great footage but it's also easier to have two vehicles following so we have actually haven't even really looked around for other animals today like the lions or the leopards you never know maybe we find someone our way home there's even another dog in the background there in the bush then opinionated we did see those Impala day I don't know if it saw the dogs first and it just ran off it was way in the distance but they have this very distinctive Randall gait where they keep their heels up really high when they're running away from the dogs and it's almost showing off to the dogs look at me I'm so healthy there's no way you could possibly catch me and the idea is that the dogs then don't bother but if there's ten Impala running like that bouncing around heels in the air the sort of exaggerated rocking horse run and then one that's limping along then you know which Impala they're gonna go for and then a net line just pointing out the beautiful colors so it is pretty spectacular this evening I can say earlier we're out on one of the ridges on the center of Mahna Mahna which is why we've got this amazing view yeah and if they aren't this may well be close to the end of our transmission while our live stream for today looks like they have ducked down into that drainage line and I think we're gonna lose signal seen that yeah so you're just you're gonna stand by this is a pan up ahead yeah I don't if I said watering at the moment it's got some match so you're just gonna stand by it for a little bit and see if any dogs pop-art if not we will be saying our goodbyes it's noon Pavarotti Impala just left there it would be nice if the dogs came here nah I think we're gonna wake give it a couple minutes and see if their dogs come out they were kind of running this way when we last saw them it is one straight ahead of us there oh there we go he's just poked out there is it that this is the gate that mark was talking about okay thank so you can see that but you could see quite clearly that gates that's Mike was talking about the starting kicks its hind legs up in today looking for some water here but there's not much and person we really are live but the effect so we just saw the dogs running and kind of miss on that and Paul I think it just saw them then Paula was really lucky and had a big something's very key behind us to be honest okay this dog me so the two dogs having a squabble you know the dogs had a little altercation with a hyena he's a you know there yet dogs I'm not huge fans of the high year so this is what makes makes dogs exciting to follow if they're not hunting in parlors or other Angela they very often come across other predators or any other animals would say generally arrest so that poor shaky some digging looks like he's got something we are asking that we ever see one of these animals kick a wild dog I'm not saying that it doesn't happen it just you saw our fastest animals ran off so we can barely keep up with them never mind see the intricacies of actual kill look at that sunset the effects of the dogs are moving around this open area well that's like Sam I'm not even sure if we still streaming while feeders cut out FEX yeah if we are still lab we are just going to say goodbye for now it does look quite bright on the screen but it is quite dark yes thank you and there's yucca in the front thanks for driving us yaku as Mike goodbye again folks thanks for joining in from our self Gareth thank you for joining us
