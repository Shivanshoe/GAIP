[Music] hi about a year ago we did a video called the tesla catamaran and in that video i went through the design and the assembly of a twin hulled catamaran boat powered by twin electric motors and energized by a tesla battery if you're interested in the details take a look at that video today what we're going to do is we've loaded it up on a trailer and we're going to drive it up to a lake where we're going to meet a few friends we're going to run it through its paces you're going to see it assembled and just how it performs on the water because the intention is to advance the power supply from the current electric system to gas and potentially wind so the next time you'll see me i'm going to be at the site we're going to be taking this thing off the trailer and you'll get to see what this thing looks like as it's put into the water so i'll see you then [Music] [Applause] [Applause] because is [Music] anti-clockwise is forwards maybe okay nope nope that's that's that's four okay so clockwise is forward takes a moment to figure out okay okay there we go so if i go okay now i'm trying to turn oh this is it's a good first 200 yards what did you have it like one or two or three clicks uh so going out there uh that was one and then two i didn't get up to three [Music] me [Music] yeah but sometimes you can't handle your emotions and i guess that's okay [Music] that's something here i think it worked it's i mean i twisted it there i actually ended up yeah we'll see and i would just leave a long tail on it i don't want it to come off but the thing is there is hope bring whatever you want but whatever you bring would you bring an extra oh sure across the lake oh you're doing this yeah yeah here sure it took me 30 seconds okay is good should i take off my hat you'll have to cover this audio with something else because i'm narrating what i'm doing which is usually pretty awkward [Music] more stable than this boat yeah right what are you saying it just hasn't touched the water in three years no we registered every year like we just keep going for it when i went over that weight because the can didn't even move we can't that's what good engineering gets you thanks [Music] [Music] um [Music] foreign [Music] i wish that [Music] yeah but sometimes you can't handle your emotions and i guess that's okay [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] i promise you won't let me [Music]
