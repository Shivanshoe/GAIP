a couple of days ago i came up with a question that i couldn't answer and that was how much gasoline do you use when you idle your engine [Music] it is a particularly important question because living up here in new england we get some really brutal winter weather we can get down to minus 15 degrees fahrenheit at night and we get a lot of snow and typically what you'll do in order to compensate for that is you'll either use a remote start in a car or you'll run outside get the engine started and go inside and finish some sort of a project watch a youtube video and then go out to your car and drive away but i didn't re didn't really know how much gasoline is used and with the rapid increase in gasoline prices recently i think it's an important question so what we decided to do is a little bit of a test we've put together a variety of different types of cars and what we're going to do is we're going to take each one of the the automobiles we're going to use a pump here at this gas station and we're going to top off each one of the tanks then we're going to set them aside and we're going to let them idle for two full hours bring them back to exactly the same pump and using the the auto shut off on the pump as a very reliable way of determining when you've filled up your tank determine how much gasoline is used by the different types of engines so we can see whether or not it's just a little bit it doesn't matter much or it's surprisingly a lot of fuel let's get going [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so two hours later and until it clicks okay that much what a dollar 53 yeah for two hours for two hours that's pretty good it could be worse [Music] uh oh 1.17 so more than double actually than her mazda though it makes sense though it's a v8 kind of makes sense what are you guys checking the mileage make sure you get the right amount of gas yeah we're actually sort of a youtube video about how much gas is used by uh idling so we did four different cars two hours of vitalink and uh we're refilling topping on to see what basically is the gas consumption check it out tech ingredients that's what you call it ingredients tech ingredients like as a technology type ingredient we're gonna probably put it up on a sunday so item in your car in the morning for a half hour it's cold probably cost 30 40 cents well two hours in this car is three dollars for two gallons yeah hmm [Music] so you can see the results are kind of interesting and you might have predicted them uh the amount of gasoline used is pretty small we ran the engines at their stock idle for two hours exactly and the largest displacement engine the 4.7 liter ford used about twice as much gas as the smaller 2.3 and 2.4 liter engines in the mo in the mustang and the subaru and the least displacement or the least gasoline was used by the mazda but what's interesting is in these smaller two to three liter engines you use about half a gallon of gasoline over two hours so if you're gonna warm up your tank your car in the morning and you leave it run for 20 minutes or so you're not using very much gasoline so i wouldn't recommend it in terms of environmental concerns and obviously money is money but it's not a huge amount of money that you're going to be spending just to warm up your car melt off some snow in order to start your day's work so thanks very much for watching i know it was a short video but kind of an interesting turn and something that i've always been wondering about if you have any questions or you want to make any comments put them in the comments section below because as i always say i read them all and i try to answer as many questions as possible and if you like the kind of content please subscribe because that's the one thing that you can do that helps us out the most in any case you have a nice evening drive safe and take care goodnight [Music] you
