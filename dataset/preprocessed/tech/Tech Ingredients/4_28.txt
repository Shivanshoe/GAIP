hi we've done a number of videos on rocket engines [Music] i began this series a few months ago with a video where i reviewed the basic principles that make rocket engines work then we formulated a sugar-based or in our case a zorbitol based rocket propellant assembled the rockets and then went outside and tested them since that time we've done a couple of videos on rocket ignition systems how you get the candle lit to understand what makes these composite propellants so much more powerful it probably would be a good idea to review what makes a rocket engine work a rocket engine is basically a pressure engine despite the flame and the fury of what's coming out of the end what generates the net thrust or the forward push is the fact that the pressurized gas inside is pushing on all of the walls equally but the front wall which is sealed has a larger surface area than the rear wall because of the opening in the throat of the nozzle so pressure times a smaller surface area on the rear means that you get a net greater force pushing the engine forward in addition the inside of the chamber is at a high pressure and when that high pressure gas exhausts out the end of the chamber it expands in all directions and the divergent nozzle the expansion behind that narrow throat acts to redirect the momentum of those expanding gas particles in line with the engine further augmenting the thrust but basically it is the pressure that we need and the volume of the gas that generates that pressure that produces the thrust so a rocket engine will work in any kind of a condition as long as the pressure inside is greater than the pressure outside it will work in a vacuum it will work in the atmosphere it will even work under water there are there are rocket powered torpedoes and actually it's a design of something that we're working on right now so stay tuned but in any case the three reasons why the composite propellants produce more thrust than the sugar-based propellants is that it has to do first of all with what's called stokeo chemistry or the stoichiometric ratio i've covered this in a number of videos about chemistry and about combustion but the stoichiometric ratio is that golden ratio when the products or the essentially the reactants go through the chemical reaction to produce the heat you have a perfect blend of fuel and oxidizer you don't have an excess of either one you have just enough fuel to use up all the oxidizer you don't have any extra oxidizer or any extra fuel so every gram of the material enters into the reaction because of the nature of the binder the sugar or the sorbitol it's very difficult to load it with enough of the oxidizer so they tend to run fuel rich therefore they run cooler and you'll notice that sugar rockets tend to produce more of a smoky exhaust rather than the incandescent very hot flame of the composite propellants the second reason has to do with just thermodynamic energy per gram the composite propellants generate more heat whether you call it btus or watts or joules whatever it is per gram you're going to get more heat and therefore you're going to get larger volumes and higher pressures of the gas the final reason has to do with the oxidizer in a sugar-based propellant you use potassium nitrate the nitrate part of the salt is what produces the oxygen that burns the fuel but the potassium generally doesn't add much to the reaction and it doesn't add any gas volume in almost all composite propellants the oxidizer is ammonium perchlorate the ammonium ion in the salt contains nitrogen and hydrogen the entire oxidizer is turned into gas so for those three reasons a better mix more thermodynamic energy and all of that energy being used to create high pressure gases means that the composite propellants produce about 60 to 70 percent more power per gram than the sugar-based propellants that's why advanced amateurs use composite propellants it's what's used in commercial solid rocket engines it's what's used by the military and the recipe or the formula that i'm going to give you in the description below so you don't have to get your pen and paper down will have the exact formula will essentially be the identical formula to what was used in the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle so we're going professional grade here now before i get into the actual composite propellants i want to circle back wink wink and look at the sugar based propellant because number one since that video i've come up with a better way to to pour a direct fuel grain to produce the the charge inside of the rocket and i want to cover that with you in addition it'll give you some contrast to the two different methods of assembly or formulation give you an idea of what challenges you're going to face when you're making this so to begin with to make the sugar based fuel we're going to use the sugar and we're going to melt it to form a liquid in order to bind the solids so the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to add zorbitol we're going to use 35 by weight of the zorbitol which is a food supplement or a sugar substitute that melts at a lower temperature than sugar making this a little bit safer we're also going to use mostly potassium nitrate we're essentially going to use 60 potassium nitrate and 4 of ammonium nitrate and the reason for doing that is the ammonium nitrate helps to improve the flow characteristics when you're pouring this we're going to put this in here along with the zorbitol and then eventually we're going to add one percent of anhydrous glycerin this also helps to thin out the mixture a little bit and makes it more portable now you want to blend these very nicely very well because you don't want any hot pockets and as this cast iron pan heats up i'll be blending the powders together so that they form a nice smooth creamy mixture and this will take about 10 minutes now you can see it's starting to get a little crumbly here kind of like biscuit dough it takes a long time to get to the stage but then things happen a little bit more quickly but you just continue to mix to try to get the heat distributed well through the material now next time somebody comes up to you with some sort of a project and they say well this is simple it's not like it's rocket science remember this video because this is rocket science now an important thing to understand here is that this is not done by temperature it's done basically by viscosity as the sugar continues to melt or the sorbitol continues to melt and gets thinner this will become less doughy and it will begin to flow better and when we get to the point where lifting up the stick you'll get almost a continuous flow we're just about ready to add the glycerin okay now nice thing about the zorbitol as opposed to the sucrose based rocket fuels one percent of the secret sauce is that they melt at a lower temperature which is always nice with flammable materials now this will take about 30 seconds or so to warm up and blend in here and then we'll get a flowable mixture that we're going to be able to pour what you'll see over here when i'm going to be pouring this into the tube is that i have a little bit of a pour guide here and what this is is essentially a depth gauge so that when i fill up the engine i'll have enough room at the top to be able to glue in the nozzle in addition it tends to keep the roughened surface here which is going to be used to bond the epoxy nozzle you want to keep it pristine clean so that you don't have any rocket fuel between there that inhibits the bond so we're simply going to insert this to guide the pore so now we're going to take this over here and we're going to begin pouring this into the bottom of the motor and you want to do this relatively slowly so that you don't lock in any air pockets so it can expand at the bottom of the tube and produce a nice solid fill good i'll give this a little tap and if you look in here you'll see that the guide told me how deep to go and i'll just tip this like that yeah good and then if i take the guide out i'm left with a nice clean end to the motor and an ability to be able to put in the epoxy nozzle now what's important here is in theory i could just glue a nozzle in here ignite it and use this as an end burning design the problem with that and that reason this isn't very frequently done is because as the fuel is consumed from the nozzle and to the front what happens is the inside of the chamber is exposed to the white hot exhaust gases for a prolonged period of time during the combustion and unless you have a steel or a stainless steel or some sort of thermally insensitive material these are composite tubes they can burn through they can be damaged so most engines are built with what's called a core design a core burning design effectively the propellant acts as an insulator so that as the flame continues outward until you get to the last millisecond or two of the burn you don't get any of the heat exposed to the surface here and that millisecond or two is not enough to damage the inside of the tube so we want to use these as core burners and what i found in the previous video is that it is very difficult to get the core into this long tube like this this stuff is very very sticky and even when i use teflon and oiled teflon anything that i put in there tend to pull up and tended to give you sort of a goofy type of core so i came up with a better method and that is to literally use a little bit of an insert like this that has been designed to fit inside of the tube like this and act as a drill guide so i can literally drill the core out now in order to make that easy what i'm going to do because this material is hygroscopic it tends to absorb water and so i'm going to put a little plastic over the top of this and then i'm going to seal this up and let this cool off to room temperature and then after it's down to about 20 degrees centigrade i'm going to put this in the freezer for a few hours and let this get rock hard and that makes the drilling operation a lot easier to do and we'll get into the actual drilling operation when we fabricate these cores so now let's change gears and we're going to get into the actual composite propellants okay so one of the first things you'll notice when we make up the composite fuel is it is not pourable because we are going to be loading it with as much as 80 to 85 solids instead of having a flowable mixture that you can use to fill a large motor you're going to end up with something that's more like a putty or a paste and it would be very difficult to pack this very thick material into a very deep motor chamber without leaving voids or gaps that can actually damage the motor so almost all the time when you're building larger rockets and you're building composite rockets you'll produce what are called fuel grains these are individual segments that are much easier to fill and to fabricate than a one single large engine and they're designed to actually slip fit within in the pressure chamber and so it's easier to mix up individual batches of the propellant make these grains and then you can construct an arbitrarily large motor from these individual grains so what we're going to do is i'm going to show you how to build a very nice grain to be able to construct the rocket now the first thing is you'll notice that they have a liner tube and this tube is going to be used to create the shape of the grain and the way that i designed this this method that i'm using may be something that you want to duplicate or maybe if you've done this before you want to pick up a few little tricks here that may help in constructing your own motors i started with my favorite material which is this rigid pvc foam board this material is nice because it's relatively inexpensive it's easy to glue it's waterproof and unless you roughen up the surface it doesn't stick very well to most materials so it's easy to release anything that you put on the top of it and so what i did is i took two three-quarter inch boards or two centimeter thick boards and glued them together to form a thicker block i'll explain why that's important in just a bit and then on the front surface of the block i put some alignment points in here so that i can space the motors out a convenient or the grains out a convenient distance from each other then i punched a little mark at the intersection of those lines and then with a compass i drew a circle that's slightly larger in diameter than the tube that we're going to be gluing on it so when i line this up and have a very slight overhang of underhang i guess around the line i end up aligning the center of the fuel containment tube with the punch mark that i made before and then what i do is on the drill press i actually drill through that punch mark all the way through to the back side of the board or the block and that gives me an alignment on the back surface that's aligned with the center of the tube then what i do is i go ahead on the other side and i counter bore those small diameter holes almost all the way but not all the way through with the diameter of the drill that i'm eventually going to be using to fabricate the grain now if you don't have a drill press some people don't a little shop technique is to get a very long drill bit it's far easier to get a very square normal to the surface drill uh drilling or bore if you've got a very long rod to align with it's much easier to get this perfectly square so if you don't drill press this is a nice trick but i do have a drill press and so that's what i used to fabricate this finally i took a small amount of cotton and just jammed this into the hole to prevent any of the propellant that i'm going to be packing into the tubes from getting through it's pretty thick and this may be a little bit of overkill but it takes about 10 seconds to pack this up here now what we're going to do is i'm going to go ahead and show you how we attach the tubes now rocket motor components which makes most of the hardware that we're using here is a really good source for the components if you're getting started out because even though they tend to be a little pricey everything sort of fits together you don't have to be searching for unusual dimensions everything is designed to work together and so if you're starting out it's a great way to make sure that things work smoothly and work well and if you get more experience and you want to go to custom size motors you can certainly advance beyond them and save some money but we're going to stick with their components here and the first thing we're going to do is we're going to make these little tiny segments of tubing now along with the tubes these fiberglass or graphite pressure tubes they make these spiral wound paper liners that are designed to slip fit inside of the motor tube it's a perfect fit works very nicely but they provide this in a 60 centimeter or 24 inch length which is nice because you can custom cut your segments to fit whatever kind of motor you have the hassle is this is pretty tough to cut i have a band saw with a very fine blade and no matter how i put this through here it tends to fuzz up the cuts it doesn't cut it very well what produces a much better cut is a razor blade the problem with that is that if you try to draw a line at a certain distance or you put little dots measured from the end and then use them as a guide you tend not to produce a very square cut and it's important because when the two grains fit together you want them to fit as flush as possible because if they tend to sit a little a kimbo or one side is a little short you get exposed inner wall of your pressure chamber which can damage the inner wall so you want a very square cut and so what i did having access to both a mill and a lathe is i fabricated a little cut guide that is nice because i took a large diameter tube and i bored it out so that it would fit the exact dimension of this tube and it has a little stop at the far end that allows me to insert the tube to exactly the right depth to produce these motor grains now something just as an aside because of the fact that i have manual mills over here i can produce this kind of equipment but my son has access to cnc equipment down at the warehouse so if it turns out that there's a lot of interest in this and people want to build motors like this check out the website and if we get enough interest in this we can produce a few dozen of these individual components like i've demonstrated with the sugar rocket and as i'll demonstrate with the cutting that make this a little bit easier to do it's not necessary but it is a time saver and we'd be interested we'd be willing to help out with that now in addition to cutting this little stop to allow the insertion i also milled a couple of little holes in the back that allow you to push the motor out if it turns out that it gets jammed when you make the cut it doesn't tend to but it's just a little extra feature and then flatten the surfaces here so that it makes it possible to mount this easily in a vise and then insert the tube in here like this and then we're going to use a very sharp blade in all cases use sharp drills sharp blades it works a lot better and what i'm going to do here is just begin slicing like this as i rotate the tube pressing against at a little bit of an angle like this so that i'm using the face of the tube as a guide or i should say the face of the jig as a guide and i'm going to cut all the way around here like this now you could theoretically take a segment of this tubing glue it to a block and use this as a cut guide problem is this stuff tends to be a little bit friable a little fragile and after a couple of cuts you can damage the edge but it certainly is an option if you want to do this with a tube that's just the right diameter for the the cardboard or the paper now as i go through here like this starts to get pretty easy to cut and we get a nice flush cut here that you can just push out from the back end and we've got one segment perfectly square nicely cut now what we're going to do is cut a second one nice cut now i'm going to mount this here like this centered on these punch points using that outer circle and then taking a couple of weights i'm going to weigh these down and then try to carefully align these inside of the circles which means i'm aligning them to center on those punch points and then taking a hot glue gun you don't have to see the back i'll show you in front i'm going to put a couple of dabs of hot glue to fix the tubes in place now this is not necessary to produce a complete dam all the way around the side all this glue will do is maintain the position of the tubes where they're supposed to be when we start packing it with the propellant so we're going to let this cool let this harden up and now let's go over and start mixing up the actual propellant all right the first thing that you'll notice as a difference between the composite and the sugar based propellant is we're not going to be using heat we're not melting anything we're going to be using a curable resin and some people have tried to use epoxy and i think i would advise you not to do that because i think it's a little sketchy some epoxies the reika raka brand that i use a lot of as well as the west systems will react with the ammonium perchlorate and release copious amounts of ammonia gas you don't want that reportedly some epoxies don't react but you might not know and because the far more common htpb butyl rubber resin that we're going to be using and is used by essentially everybody making composite fuels it costs the same it works very well i just stick with this stuff now this butyl rubber material is a catalyzed resin it's a polymerization of the butyl rubber and what we're going to be doing is i'm going to be giving you numbers along here as i mix this up but because i'm going to give the exact formula in the description below don't bother writing this down i'm going to be quoting these numbers mostly for my own purposes as i'm mixing this up so don't get too focused on that we're going to be filling two of these small grains so we're going to start out by adding the bulk resin and we're going to add 21.2 grams of this material now this stuff tends to be pretty thick and to pour an exact amount sometimes if you over pour you can pull it out of here but let's see how close i can get 21.2 there we go wow 10 milligrams off not bad if you over pour this you can just simply take a spoon scoop a little bit out adjust it and throw that away that's a little trick if you're using a big gallon jug to pour this in the next thing that we're going to be using is the catalyst it's a platinum based or an isocyanate based catalyst we're going to use 3.2 grams of this material and it's very thick so it tends to be easier to use a dropper with the end cut off so you have a nice diameter and we're going to add 3.2 grams of this material good now i'm going to add a plasticizer now the plasticizer performs a function as a fuel it burns just like the the basic resin and the polymerized rubber but what it does is it thins out the liquid and allows you to pack in more of the solids so if you add none of this you're going to end up with an almost concrete thick mixture when you're finally done mixing this and if you use a lot of this you end up producing a rather rubbery and somewhat weaker grain and so you can get up to 30 percent of the liquid volume in the plasticizer but i tend to go to sort of a middle range as i'll give you in the description below the video that will thin this out and make it possible for us to work with the material this is a lot thinner and so we're going to be adding six grams of this good now i'm going to start to blend this up this has an interesting smell it's not as uh sort of sharp as the smell of an epoxy it smells a little bit like new running shoes kind of a rubbery mixture like a tire shop or now you're going to blend this up for a little bit and it's always easiest to blend all the liquids before you add any kind of a solid this applies to epoxy polyesters anything that you do you don't want the solids to interfere with the perfect blending of the liquids so always get the liquids blended first now the next thing that we're going to add is aluminum powder we're going to add 12.4 grams of aluminum powder now what's interesting about the aluminum is you remember what i said earlier on about the potassium nitrate the aluminum produces an enormous amount of energy when it is oxidized there is only one other solid material that will produce more energy per gram when burned and that's boron and that's sometimes used in rocket fuels now the reason the aluminum is added is because even though the aluminum when it is oxidized produces aluminum oxide sapphire it's a liquid at the exhaust temperatures of the rocket engine and does not contribute to any to the gas production but because it produces so much additional heat in the burn it causes the other gases to expand so much that there's a net benefit so aluminum is added to most of these composite fuels in anywhere from about six to about 16 percent we're adding around 10 or so of the final weight of the propellant in aluminum powder now you can see it forms a very creamy gray mixture and i use five micron aluminum if you go down to nano scale powder in the nanometer range it becomes so reactive that it can actually ignite in air spontaneously from static electricity kind of dangerous and very expensive if you get much bigger than the 5 microns up to around 30 microns the surface area is low and it doesn't burn very well 5 microns is just about the ideal dimension now the next material is optional and that is iron oxide fe2o3 these also are several micron sized particles and we're going to add about three quarters of a percent by weight to this now the iron oxide doesn't add anything to the thermal output of the fuel it doesn't add anything to the impulse of the fuel the ultimate thrust that it can make but what it does is the surface of the iron oxide acts as a catalyst that speeds the breakup of the ammonium perchlorate freeing up the oxygen more readily and increasing the rate of the burn now you could theoretically accomplish the same thing by grinding up the ammonium perchlorate particles finer typically when you're using ammonium perchlorate for rocket fuel or pyrotechnics you will use a 200 micron or a 400 micron size particle and the reason for that has to do with what's called rayology we're going to get into that in a lot more detail when we get on to our thermal grease or our thermal paste we made a very very high quality high performance thermal paste and it involves a fairly detailed understanding of what happens with the blending of solid and liquid components when you grind up the ammonium perchlorate to a finer powder in other words allowing it to react more quickly you could eliminate the iron oxide because the surface area goes up as you find get finer and finer powders what happens is that it becomes more difficult to add the amount of solids that you want to add because the shear force is between the particles and the liquid increases that's why you can thicken up an epoxy mixture when you're making a paste with only a few percent of very very fine fumed silica so by grinding this up to a finer powder to try to get a higher rate of burn you're going to find that you can't get as much oxidizer in so by sticking with the 2 to 400 micron particle size we can compensate for that by using a catalyst that causes it to break down more quickly and that's what the iron does but as i said it's optional i've made fuel grains with the iron oxide and i've made fuel grains without the iron oxide it's just a slower burn less thrust but for a longer period of time so it doesn't change the ultimate impulse it just changes the burning rate now when you get this fully blended in it becomes more of a purple color which will redden up as we add the white of the oxidizer now i've already pre-weighed out 101.2 grams of the ammonium perchlorate and when you start to add this initially it's very easy to blend this in because it stays very thin it's the last 20 grams or so where you earn your money that's where it starts to get a lot more difficult to blend but it's always important to get this incorporated as evenly as possible because you again don't want any hot pockets of oxidizer or fuel and so it's very important to get this blended well and sometimes if you're building larger rocket engines larger grains you're making a lot of them amateurs advanced amateurs will use a kitchenaid it's an excellent way of mixing this up you can make large quantities and you don't end up with popeye arms and the commercial people the you know the big timers they'll use commercial equipment for mixing up this mixing this up in many kilogram quantities to pour really large grains but this is inexpensive and we can dispose of this easily when we're done so it's kind of nice to use the little cup plus i don't know if i want to mix up 10 kilograms of rocket fuel inside the lab it's just you know you know now you can see it's starting to thicken up a little bit again the early part is the easy part all right okay okay now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go over and pick up my little block with my grain tubes on it and bring it over here now the trick to filling this is that you want to scoop a little bit in to the end of the tube like this don't get too aggressive because then what you want to do is you want to push this down into the bottom you want to make sure that you don't develop any voids because what the voids become are actually little combustion chambers and can give you pulsatile output in your fuel or in your rocket engine as well as create increased pulses of pressure which could damage it if you're running near the limits of the strength of your chamber or your nozzle also if they extend all the way to the outside can expose the tube the pressure tube to the high temperature of the exhaust and another thing too just like the sugar rockets what you'll find is that the larger the rocket actually the easier a lot of this stuff becomes you're not dealing with sort of small tools and tight spaces and then finally when you finish this up i like to end up with a bit of a convex surface sort of a dome the reason being is that i'll show you how easy it is to trim that perfectly flat but if you end up with a little bit of a concavity or a dent or a divot it's going to be very difficult to seal this so it's always better to be a little generous and overfill this rather than under fill this i'll do the second one here and i'll hold this up and you can sort of see you want a little bit of a bulge it's very easy to slice this off but you don't want to div it now this if we leave this in the room like this will cure in about three to four days you've got a bunch of hours of working time with this material which makes it very convenient as opposed to most epoxies and generates almost no heat so that's kind of a nice thing but it takes a long time as a general rule in chemistry most reactions will increase their rate of reaction with heat the warmer you get them the faster it goes and as a general rule for every 10 degrees centigrade you will double the rate of the reaction so at a 22 degree centigrade room three to four days however if you're in a little bit of a hurry you can do what we did which is use our little hot box this is a small chamber of non-flammable fiberglass here with a couple of light bulbs that we use as heating elements and then with a small temperature controller we can safely put these in here and run them up at around 50 degrees centigrade by increasing the temperature from 20 degrees to 50 degrees basically 30 degrees warmer we will double double double or effectively increase the rate of reaction about eight fold and so this will then be fully cured to a nice hard state overnight so that speeds things up so it's a nice convenient feature so now what we have to do is we actually have to fabricate the grains these have already been cured i'm going to go over the other table and let's start getting these in into the shape of an actual fuel grain all right the next thing is we're going to get rid of these domed surfaces on the top and get a nice flat surface and the best way to do that is a very sharp new razor blade using the cardboard which tends to be relatively harder to cut you can place the blade right at the top of the cardboard and then just slice through here as you can see it cuts pretty nicely and as you cut across here like this you get an excellent surface now you'll notice i'm putting these over here i'm not throwing it away always use sharp tools especially when you're doing this kind of thing now the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to drill the center core where the combustion is going to begin now you might be thinking you're going to drill rocket fuel keep in mind that even though this stuff is very flammable it is not that easy to ignite this material here which you don't want to throw in the garbage can just because it could it could be contacting something hot in the future you never know where the garbage is gonna is gonna go but in general you wanna keep all of the debris that you're producing and you want to burn it that's the safest way to get rid of it now these things are kind of neat these little discs that you form because you can use them on 4th of july they're kind of fun to play with you can use them to start a campfire you could even use them to start your barbecue the the chlorine smell goes away really quickly now the concern though might be that this material would be something that you don't want to machine or manhandle but as you can see i was able to easily slice this stuff up doesn't do anything to it and as a matter of fact you can pound it you can grind it like this doesn't burn and what you're going to be doing is when you're drilling this you're going to be using very sharp drills at very low speeds so effectively you're going to be cutting or slicing it you're not going to be grinding or tearing it so in general working with this stuff is easy and as long as you're reasonable it can be relatively safe to work with now the way that you're going to drill this you've got two choices as i explained we've got the equipment to be able to make these drill guides and again if you're interested look at our website but the best way that i've found to do this as long as i have a drill press is to use this little disc that i have bored a hole in that acts as a cap and can be placed right over the fuel grain like that and then allows the drill press to be able to drill a nice square hole right through the center that's very convenient however if you don't want to get the hardware another option is you can use the thickened block that's why we made it thick and use the large diameter hole that we board nearly all the way through as a drill guide so i'm going to put this in the vise lock it in and again taking advantage of a long drill bit because of alignment i'm going to put this in the hand drill and operating at a low speed we're going to use this to drill the guide the hole through the bottom of the core and up through the top so place this in here like this get it as square as you can now avoid the tendency or the temptation to hog all the way through here because you'll produce a lot of torque and you can actually pop the cylinders off the other side so just take a little bit of a bite cut in there a little bit of ways you can actually blow some of the debris out of there like that and then repeat all the way through and we'll just clean up that hole a little bit nice and you can see that you drill a nice core through the bottom surface of this and this gives you a good alignment and as as a matter of fact it saves on using the uh the drill guide and you don't have to fabricate something to do this with now i'm going to pull these off nice core nice core and get these out of the way and then i'm going to show you the other technique using the drill press to cut through from here and again the trick is don't hog all the way through just make tiny little cuts all the way through and you can blow out the debris just a little ways through pull it out clean out the debris do it again when you get all the way through to the white this tends to grab up and you'll see some of the white in this in the debris that comes off of here now we want to free this up now the trick to removing these things i did kind of a rough and ready with this because i want to do it quickly but the way to do this and get a very neat release so that you don't leave a little bit of of stain back here is to take the knife and simply make a slice across those little rubber or hot glue tabs that you have here that helps to free this up a little bit yeah right like this okay okay then what you're going to do is you're actually going to cut through about a third of the way from the back side and you want to keep the knife at a slight angle like this so you're sort of digging into the the foam board as opposed to digging into the propellant but you don't want to cut all the way through now you'll have a little stain here but this represents just a couple thousandths of an inch it's not much and you still get a very nice clean cut a very symmetrical cut on the bottom and this will be very easy for you to seal another thing you'll find is that you'll often have a little bit of the rubber from the hot glue gun left alongside here and you want to clean that off because when you're done you want to test to make sure that this will easily slip into the chamber when you're going to be doing your final assembly okay so let's go ahead and assemble the motor now these motor tubes are supplied in both graphite and fiberglass and they have relatively the same strength but the graphite tends to be a little bit lighter in both cases they come with a sort of a thread or a roughening on the inner surface at each end so that when you glue in a nozzle or a plug you get much better wall adhesion between the epoxy there's sort of a tooth not just sort of a chemical bond between the two surfaces so in order to be able to close up this end what i did is i took the tube mounted it on one of these foam boards and then placed a hot glue dam around the base of the the tube not only to support it but actually to block it or plug it and then what you can do is you can take in this 38 millimeter tube you can take 16 milliliters of epoxy and squirt it into the bottom of this and this will produce about a two centimeter thick plug which i found for almost all of the rockets is plenty of strength to prevent the pressure which can rise up to about a thousand psi inside of here to prevent it from bursting out through the front end however in the higher performance motors and the pressures are going even higher than that what i've done is found a little way a little method to increase the strength of that bond and the plug itself what i did is i took some glass fiber reinforced epoxy this is geralite it's a six millimeter thick quarter inch thick plate and using a hole saw i simply cut out a bunch of these discs that based on the diameter will easily fit within the motor like this and because this material is denser or heavier than epoxy when you drop this down in the bottom make sure it's sitting nice and flat you can then squirt in 11 cc's of epoxy and form a bond that's still two centimeters thick but is about 10 times as strong in terms of bending across this surface and the end result when you're done will look like this when you pop this off and so you're still able to see what's going on in here with the fill you still have the center hole but you have all the bond strength along here and you have the plate strength of the very strong geralite so it's a nice way to do this so i already did that to this tube and all of the other motors and so now what we're going to do is we're going to insert the fuel grains now the fuel grains are cut as i said perfectly parallel but because the bottom surface of the material is not going to have to have any kind of protection against sort of overflow i'm going to be kind of generous and use this high temperature rtv gasket material this does not react with the fuel and produces sort of a liquid version of an o-ring and it will fill all the defects and any of the un planar surface here and seal this against the epoxy at the bottom so i'm going to place a bead around the bottom here and i'm going to be pretty generous with this particular layer because in case the epoxy has a little bubble or a little you know bump or something like that and this thing doesn't sit perfectly flush this will still squeeze out and form sort of a rubber base that will protect the side walls from any of the hot gases that might leak out through the gap if this thing doesn't sit absolutely air tight against the epoxy so on this particular bead here i'm going to be particularly generous now i made a little mistake i'm going to show you that didn't intend to but it's probably worth showing before i put this in and that is i did a little bit of an over fill here it went past the outside you don't want to do that because it's going to fill it's going to touch the outer surface and potentially contaminate the bond with the epoxy over here and weaken the bond with the eventual nozzle so i'm going to see if i can wipe that back so that it doesn't get on the inside of the tube now on the top surface because these are so flat i can be a lot chintzier with my bead and that's plenty then i'm simply going to drop this into the motor like this then i'm going to do another bead like another fuel grain good drop this fella in only one surface in this case because once i push this down here like this neatness counts then i'm going to push these down a little bit to make sure they're seated and you can see that they're sitting at what i want to be the right depth in order to be able to insert the nozzle the final bead i'm actually going to run around the edge and i want to contact the sides because i want to prevent any leakage of any of the epoxy i'm going to use to mount the nozzle from getting down around the outside of the nozzle now i'll put the bead in here and then i'll show you the end result when i'm done then you can inspect it for any little defects and there are none and you can see it's a pretty good bead all the way around the outer edge now what we're going to do is insert the nozzle now rocket motor components makes these very inexpensive three three dollar nozzles this has a 0.29 inch diameter you can figure out what the metric is if they don't list it in terms of the metric even though a lot of their tubes are listed in metric dimensions this is a 38 millimeter tube but nevertheless this is a throat on this particular nozzle and it costs about three bucks this is designed to fit a smaller diameter rocket motor however they also make these little rings these bushings that will allow you to increase the diameter of the nozzle to fit these larger tubes so what we're going to do is i'm going to put a small bead of this rtv gasket material around the inner edge of this little stop that holds the nozzle in place so it doesn't push all the way through i'll show you when i'm done with this then you see how this bead is sitting on that little edge and then what you do is you take the nozzle you'll insert it in here like this press it against here give it a tiny bit of a twist maybe just 10 degrees and you can see that you get sort of a bead that oozes out there a little bit and gives you a nice seal and then what we're going to do is we're going to simply insert this into the rocket and then push down a little bit make sure you get a nice spread of that sealant check to make sure we're pretty square that's not that it wouldn't sit square because of the grain but because of the fact that you might have locked it in because it's a very very small clearance here and if you didn't get it all the way down it might be sitting at a bit of an angle but once you get this nice and squared in here you want to wait about eight to 12 hours because this is air cured and so we're going to leave this potentially overnight or for about eight hours and what you'll end up with is this this motor has been sitting here for about a day and the nozzle has been inserted in here and now the final step is we're going to seal this by producing a ring of epoxy that's going to fill the gap between the small diameter part of the nozzle and the large flange of the nozzle and the spacer to finally seal up the motor so let's go ahead and do that all right so now the final step is going to be to place the epoxy ring that's going to keep this in and what i'm going to do is i'm going to mix up some epoxy this is a slow cure epoxy and i didn't mention that before but whenever you're making anything that requires a potting or a volume of hardened epoxy you want to use the slowest cure material you can because it's exothermic it gets hot and if you use a very rapid cure epoxy it can become so hot in volume that it can actually cook itself and damage the resin so to get a nice strong safe bond use a very slow cure hardener whenever you're working with epoxy in volumes so i'm going to make a little sample of the material here start out with forty three milligrams off i'm getting better and then we're going to add 25 of the slow hardener good now we're going to mix this up and as i always say with epoxies you want to give it an honest two minutes of mixing now once this is thoroughly mixed up it's now no longer opalescent you can see that it's a clear liquid so this is pretty good evidence that we have a good blend and then what i'm going to do is fill up the syringe now when i fill this up the trick is to go slow because the slower you go the easier it is for the liquid to flow into the gaps and the grooves can you see this pretty effectively okay all right so we're going to go ahead and i'm going to put the needle down here like this and i'm going to begin filling it up at this side and it will begin to work its way around pushing the air ahead of it so we don't get any kind of big air bubble below and take your time the level will continually rise and when you get pretty near the top you can look out for any kind of unevenness you have in your fill sometimes it helps a little bit to go to the other side and give it a little bit of a boost that's pretty good and for neatness sake you don't want to overfill it this the strength of this is pretty enormous and so you don't have to get too greedy and then finally i obviously made up a lot of epoxy here just because it's easier for me to mix it and for you to see it never throw this away as a lump exothermic gets hot enough it can cause a fire and if you were stupid and you ended up putting some of your propellant in the garbage can and then you put something that's going to start a fire you're going to have a real disaster so whenever you throw this stuff out you want to make sure that you distribute it in area so take the syringe and squirt it out and then take the liquid in here and sort of drizzle it on the inside of the garbage spread it around and that way it won't get hot now the final step is this is going to take say a day or two to cure and form a nice hard surface but i have a few engines here that i've already finished a couple days ago these things have hardened up and now that this has formed a nice strong bond here the way you get the engine off is you simply put your hand down here like this and you crack it off and what you'll find you get a nice surface here and obviously you got some of the rubber from the hot glue gun on here but a simple rubber razor blade can clean this off and you'll get a nice smooth surface here that allows you to insert this into a rocket so this engine is basically done the next step is we're going to go outside we're going to show you the test sled that we built as well as the load cell and the computer system that'll allow us to analyze these engines both in terms of maximum thrust and thrust duration so we're going to head outside and we're going to start playing around with these things all systems are go are you sure no need to abort the countdown starts all is working okay send me up a drink four three two one [Applause] wow five four three two one [Music] [Music] five four three two

or an athlete not even an astronaut it was to be a youtuber imagine being a youtuber that gets to do this stuff in the next video what we're going to do is we're going to go to even larger engines and hybrid engines with solid fuel and liquid oxidizer and so if you like what we're doing in these videos please subscribe give us a comment and the best thing that you can do for us is to share what
