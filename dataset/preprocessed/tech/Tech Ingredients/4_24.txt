hi today we're going to be doing full power tests on our hybrid rocket engines [Music] if you're interested in the details and what underlies how we got here this afternoon take a look at some of the previous videos we did three that go through the physics the technology the engineering and the fabrication in a very clear fashion as to how we built the engines that we're going to be testing today and if you want to after you see all the flame and fury you can go back and take a look and see what we did to fabricate this type of engine i think it's pretty good stuff now today i'm not going to go through the whole review because you can get all of that information from those previous videos but a very short layout of what's going on here nitrous oxide cylinder a 10-pound cylinder an oxygen cylinder that provides oxygen for the ignition system electrically actuated solenoids that allow us to operate this from a distance from the control station over there we have an igniter that fires up the engine and we have a load cell that measures the power of the thrust that we're going to be producing and can record it onto the computer over on the table over there so i'm going to come over here and we're going to get going with the test itself okay so we're ready to do the test first thing i want to mention is that we have a couple of spotters so that if anybody wanders into the general vicinity i'll get a call and we'll abort the test the second thing is there is going to be very loud noises here the first thing is going to happen when i turn on the ignition controller we're going to get a beep from this tower and again some people are annoyed by the sound of that beeping especially if you're wearing headphones so i'm just giving you a little bit of a warning that when i turn this on a few seconds before i begin the 10 second countdown be prepared for that noise but it is important to indicate to the general area that we're going to be firing a rocket so i am going to use that function and when i hit the main nitrous solenoid this one over here the rocket will fire and that will be incredibly loud so those are the warnings i'll give you ahead of time so are you already out yeah okay is your software working should be uh you have the green star yep yep we're all good okay so let's just check for one sec still good all right all right here we go beeping ten nine eight seven six five four three two one [Applause] [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] one of the things i'd like to bring up though about the safety of these hybrid engines i brought this up in the earlier video about the fact that you obviously have the oxidizer and the fuel separated until the last instant but there's another safety feature associated with these types of engines that are is also shared by liquid-fueled engines in a composite or a solid-fueled engine where the propellant mixes the oxidizer and the fuel together at the same time what happens is that there is a positive feedback from the temperature and pressure inside of the combustion chamber to the rate of the combustion of the propellant in other words the hotter and higher the pressure the faster it burns which means the hotter and the higher the pressure which increases the rate of burning which increases the pressure and you can get a runaway spiral which can cause the motor to rupture the nice thing about a hybrid engine is it is a negative feedback loop sort of a bootstrap control because as the pressure goes up inside of the combustion chamber you decrease the delivery of the oxidizer because the oxygen ox nitrous oxide is being supplied at a fixed pressure as the pressure goes up here the delivery of the oxidizer goes down this is important because if you size your nozzle say too small in a composite solid rocket engine the pressures can quickly run away from you or if you get a fracture in a fuel grain which increases the surface area or a small fracture of a piece of fuel grain that plugs one of the nozzles or the exhaust nozzle the throat that can very quickly lead to a runaway catastrophic failure of the engine and it's another safety feature of these types of engines i really like that so we're going to do another test and we're going to see what kind of performance we get out of this one so let's just make sure nothing nothing we're all good okay so remember the loud sounds all right i'm turning on the beep starting the countdown 10 9 8 7 6 five four three two one [Music] [Music] [Music] looks like my connector on the top end was a little bit loose but we still got a lot of nitrous in there and we got a little bit less power on that test we'll run this one more time all right so this is test number three beeping ten nine eight seven six five four three two one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] not bad okay so let's wire up the big one we're making videos about testing hybrid rocket engines oh really yep yeah and we've just tested the small ones wow now we're going to test the big one all right this is going to be the larger engine and so it's going to be substantially louder so just a little bit of a warning beep warning and when i hit this valve that's going to be the loud one you're all set yep all set okay okay here comes the beep 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 three two one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it works all right so basically a couple of things to keep in mind the safety features associated with a hybrid engine are significant the fact that you don't have to use any kind of fuel pumps are significant and the performance in terms of the specific impulse compared to solid rocket engines is significantly greater so there are a lot of reasons to be looking more and more into these types of engines another thing just to let you know a little bit about the way that these engines can be scaled is that as long as you follow the guidelines that we gave you in the first three videos about the physics and the engineering there really is no limit in terms of how large you can scale these the sky is the limit you just follow the same basic parameters something else i would like to tell you about is we always request that if you find the kind of stuff that we're doing here interesting please subscribe because it helps the channel to grow and it helps to finance the kind of work that we're doing here in addition youtube put out sort of a troubling notice to all creators a couple of weeks ago where they're going to be purging bot subscribers potentially subscribers that aren't valid there's nothing necessarily wrong with that but i think their algorithms are a little coarse and we've had a lot of complaints from people who thought they were subscribed to our channel who were not getting notifications checked and found out that they were unsubscribed they didn't even know about it so if you do subscribe please it does help us out if you think you're subscribed please just take a second to check because it does help in addition to that if you have a question about anything that we've done put it in the comments below because i've said before i read them all and if there are any questions i try to answer as many as possible but the final thing is stay safe have fun enjoy science and we'll see you soon you have a good night okay so what did you think that was very interesting pretty impressive huh find out what was going on with the noise interesting thing uh maybe you noticed that when you saw the firing i don't know if it was sort of overwhelming and you were sort of not looking at the details but when you look at the rocket exhaust that comes out of the end of the tube you notice it's not just glowing but it seems to have little bands blowing in it and those are actually shock waves what happens is as the gas comes out it's coming out highly supersonic and as soon as it hits the regular atmospheric air there's these interactions that cause it to compress at those zones and when it compresses it heats and so it gets brighter and then after that it kind of decompresses for a while accelerates and forms another shock wave and shock waves are usually a good indicator that you have a really high performance engine because it means you've got supersonic flow and that's what's producing the kind of power so kind of neat isn't it yeah so so like i said please we'll definitely check subscribe out thank you sure and if your neighbors are asking you what the sound is say it's us but say they're doing it pretty safe yeah so and we're not cutting down any trees thanks for being so patient waiting for all my you know doings okay thanks oh [Applause] that was annoying not bad huh i forgot a this ear so i'm deaf in one ear yeah what
