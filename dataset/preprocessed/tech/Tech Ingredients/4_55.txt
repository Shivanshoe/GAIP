hi tonight we're going to do the second in our series of videos on the corona virus [Music] [Music] we posted the first video about a week ago and today what I'd like to do is I would like to expand on some of the things that we talked about there as well as add some additional tips tricks and approaches to help keep you safe the first video was very well received it was very popular we got a lot of thumbs up and I think we handled it in a pretty even-handed way as well as we never discussed any theories but YouTube still considered it a sensitive enough issue that they demonetised it as I suspect they will be monetize this video as a result I think it would be useful if you find the information in here of some value as well as the video that we published before please share the video let people know that might find some of this helpful to get this information out it also means that we're doing these videos pro bono so if you like what we're doing here please subscribe to the channel and we'll take a look at some of the other videos that we have done in the past they're pretty interesting some of them are exciting and all of them are upbeat so if you find this topic a little bit grim it'd be a nice place to go in addition to that one of the things that a lot of people have commented on is that the World Health Organization says one thing the CDC says something else dr. Howard dr. fine dr. Howard each have YouTube channels and they said something else and you're just an engineer I've never claimed to be an engineer or a scientist and tonight I'm not going to claim nor am I going to deny that I'm a physician I'm not asking you to accept what I'm saying because I'm leaning on some sort of official Authority I'm suggesting that a good way to approach a complex problem like this is to think like an engineer so let's get started the first thing is hand-washing typically a person washes their hands like this however in order to do a little bit better job what do you want to do is you want to make sure that you get to all of the surfaces between your fingers in addition to your thumb and because your hand is pretty close to your arm you tend to want to wipe up a little bit further here than you would if you are just doing a simple wash in this way in addition the surface of your hand is relatively rough and it's a good idea to get a soft sponge or a brush and you can use they have to clean between some of the calluses and some of the folds on your fingers and more importantly to clean the cuticles where some of the grooves can Harbor dirt finally it's a good idea for you to take either a toothpick or a little dental pick and clean underneath your fingernails to get any dirt that may have accumulated under there now the brush can be reused you can either clean it off or you can soak it in some disinfectant solution and there's a variety of different types of antimicrobial soaps out there the sort of commercial standard is 4% chlorhexidine and I think you can still get that on eBay I don't know about Amazon but another good cleaning agent is pava dine this is still available on eBay it is available on Amazon and you can get this in a thirteen percent solution from tractor supply and from different types of retail outlets in your local area this 1 liter here costs about 8 or 9 dollars it is non-staining it is non irritating and as long as you don't have a topical iodine allergy this is a nice substance use because it doesn't sting and it's also okay to use on open sores or wounds you won't absorb any of the chlorhexidine from this now if you've washed your hands off you nevertheless want to sometimes not need to wash your hands and one thing to understand is a little bit about how to use gloves now I don't have a latex allergy and so I prefer the latex gloves because they provide you a little bit better tactile sensitivity as well as a little bit better dexterity but if you do have an allergy using the nitrile gloves is a perfectly legitimate alternative now it's almost anybody can put gloves on as long as they're sober but taking them off you use a little bit more of a technique if you assume that your hands have been contaminated you don't want to take this hand and rub it on your arm and across the skin on your glove as you're removing the glove so the trick is to take one of your gloves and pinch the other glove near the cuff down here and then slowly invert the glove as you're pulling it off this hand keeping the dirt on the inner surface now you can either grab this glove and hold it like this or you can dispose of it at this time and then when you take the other glove off you don't want to repeat that same technique because you've got a clean hand so the trick here is to grab underneath the cuff of the glove on your skin to skin and then again invert the glove over the other glove capturing it and then slowly dispose of this in the garbage can you don't want to do that sort of fire it across the room into a garbage can sometimes I like to see how far I can go because that motion can dislodge any particles on the surface and moving things slowly is not going to do that so that's another thing to keep in mind now you might say all right great good technique but I can't get any gloves anymore there's another alternative a four liter or one gallon food storage bag costs about three dollars for a hundred of them they're still pretty broadly available don't touch your face and if you put this on your hand like this and take a rubber band and you can slip it on over this you make a reasonable glove that allows you to grab things turn a doorknob get some gas it doesn't look real good but it's relatively inexpensive and it is an effective way to block the contamination from getting onto your hand another alternative that you can use a 16 liter or 4 gallon which is the smallest of the garbage liner bags you can put this over your hand and it has the advantage when you put the rubber band on to protect your arm so again you can grab things you can manipulate anything and when you remove it you want to tend to follow the same rule which is to invert the dirty part inside in order keep any kind of debris on the gloves next we're gonna talk about the masks now there are two basic styles of masks one is the sort of cup shaped mask which is also of an n95 masks that are so popular and the other is the surgical style mask masks do not prevent contamination or viruses from getting through them they are quantified on their rejection ratio the 95 in the n95 mask means that it will reduce or block 95% of all of the particles that are larger than 300 nanometers the surgical masks tend to be rated on a level level 1 level 2 level 3 the highest level level 3 is rated to be 98% effective in blocking particles that are larger than 1000 nanometers so they are not absolute barriers but there are a level of restriction or rejection and to keep in mind sort of what the perspective or what the the magnitude is here the viral particle the naked viral particle is about a hundred nanometers in diameter so none of these are going to absolutely prevent transmission but they will reduce it now it's also important that the masks aren't just a barrier but they have to provide some sort of a seal around the edges and the best way to apply the mask when you put the masks on is after you've placed them on your face and you've formed them and shaped them tighten them down you want to feel around the edges and if you blow into the mask you fill the mask up you'll feel if the air is coming out very easily there'll be no resistance and you know you have to adjust the feel or adjust the seal but because people have different size faces and different shaped faces the seal will vary between individuals and anybody with a big beard is going to have pretty poor performance with either one of these so you want to keep that in mind one of the issues that was brought up was the fact that the World Health Organization and a lot of people on social media said you're not supposed to wear these gloves if you're healthy it's only supposed to be put on people that have the disease that doesn't make any sense and let me step you through that the mask manufacturers are in the business of making the best possible masks they can for the least amount of money and in theory it's possible that you could make a mask that would be unidirectional in its blockage taking advantage of meta structures like gecko feet or shark's teeth or Tesla valves you could theoretically produce a surface that would only are a material or a matrix that would only flow in one direction but it would require additional expense and there's no advantage to doing that a lot of people think that in an operating room that the wounds are sterile but frequently they are not if you have a surgeon that's operating on a perforated bowel or they are to breeding necrotic tissue or the removing an infected implant or a stent there's microbes in the environment that could potentially get into the crew so why would the surgeon the anesthesiologist the scrub tech the circulating nurse the x-ray tech the reps why would they why would you expose them to that if you didn't have to you wouldn't the other issue that might come up is all right it's not the materials but it's the way the seal works well if you consider what happens when you put a mask on a person without the condition without the disease they want this mask to operate when they inhale when they produce a negative pressure behind it and draw it tighter against their face and if you have somebody with the infection present and you put the mask on them the other people in the room are going to want that mask to block the virus when the person exhales or coughs and tends to push the mask away from their face so from a mechanical point of view it doesn't make a lot of sense to put it on the person or only on the person with with the virus the fact is however those are theories and you might think well okay I can accept the theories but that's not necessarily true the fact is it is and in a operating environment there are conditions called human papilloma virus or the herpes simplex virus and they will create new cause neoplasms or artificial growths to occur on the skin they are what caused vocal cord polyps and genital warts and they are removed by a carbon dioxide laser that will ablate the tissue from the surface and they will create a laser plume of ablated particles potentially live viruses and they get into the atmosphere and so in that environment the providers will wear what's called a plume or an antiviral or a laser mask it's a surgical mask style and it's designed to keep the viruses out of those practitioners so I'm not saying that the World Health Organization is stupid I think they have a valid reason for what they're saying but I don't think it's justified just like I don't think the ends justify the means if you have a room with a hundred people in it and you have one person with the virus and you have one mask the most logical thing to do is to put the mask on the one person it's for the greater good the problem that we have with that sort of a scenario is that because of the rate of the growth of this virus and the long incubation time there are probably at least as many if not more people walking around who are shedding the viruses who have not tested positive they don't know that they are shedding the viruses we don't know who they are they don't know who they are so who do you put the masks on in addition large global organizations like the World Health Organization are thinking of the world is sort of a bunch of NPCs but individual human beings have individual stories if you've got a 22 year old triathlete who's got an excellent immune system she is unlikely to do poorly if she gets the infection but if you've got an 80 year old diabetic with cardiopulmonary disease that person or a person with say leukaemia or a young mother or a pregnant woman or a young person with AIDS they're not likely to do well if they get the disease so if they're aware of the fact that they're using the masks are reducing a national supply they can make the personal decision as to whether or not they would use them but I do not think it's ethical to have them for gold that protection because they believe that there is no potential advantage to them now another thing to keep in mind is that the masks themselves act as catch halls for bacteria and particles and just like the filter inside of a furnace gets a lot dirtier than the carpet around the furnace when the mask has been used for an hour or two it may have a lot of viruses it's a viral hot spot so when you remove the mask you want to remove it slowly dispose of it and then consider your hands now dirty you're gonna want to wash them and that brings up the idea that when you come into your house you might want to take off your shoes I always take off my shoes and I walk around in my socks but if you like to wear shoes in the house you might consider buying a pair of inside and outside shoes also your hair potentially can accumulate viruses even if you keep your hair short and clean there's still going to be some oil on it and it has a lot of surface area that can accumulate the viruses so you might consider using one of these painters boot fonts it's not only protective but it's sexy and in addition to that you might want to think about the fact that your eyes are a port of entry for the virus when I take off my glasses at night they're covered with a bunch of particles and dirt and dust and if you don't wear glasses all of that dust that lands on my glasses lands on the surface of your eyeballs and then because you're not making tears that are running down your face all the time those tears are washing those particles through your lacrimal ducts into your nasal pharynx and into your respiratory system so you might want to consider in any environment where you're thinking about wearing a mask to wear a pair of goggles like this even if you're wearing glasses these are better now these don't have filters and they're not rated but just like they protect you from sawdust they're going to minimize the amount of material they could get into your eyes now also there's clothing when you walk around outside you sit on a boss set in a restaurant bump against people your clothing could potentially become infected and so when you come into the house it might be a good idea to take off those clothes and put them in a dirty laundry bag and when you're cleaning those clothes a good idea would be to use some bleach in order to sterilize them or to disinfect them typical sodium hypochlorite and 6% solution if you follow the manufacturers directions about using the bleach you'll get to about a point 1 to point 2 percent solution in a typical washing machine and it's an excellent disinfectant it's also very inexpensive downside is it'll wash out a lot of the colors and it can degrade the fibers so you probably want to think about your outdoor clothes being junky clothes things you're willing to wear a few times and throw out and this brings up the whole idea of disinfectants last time I talked about the benzalkonium chloride and I didn't focus our emphasize the idea that when you make up a solution of benzalkonium chloride in alcohol that the real workhorse in this solution is the alcohol itself high concentrations of ethanol or isopropyl alcohol like around 90% are very versatile or bacteria sidle they denature they dehydrate the outer shell of the virus and at very high concentrations they denature it and they sort of lock it down they burn it at a very shallow depth they do it almost instantly but if you dilute that alcohol down to about 70 percent concentration the alcohol is still quite lethal but it will dig deeper into the shell and it will actually do a better job at killing off the viruses that's why when you go into the pharmacy you'll see typically a 70% alcohol solution that's about the peak balance between effectiveness and depth of penetration now the reason for the benzalkonium chloride is that it's a relatively weak to moderately moderately weak antiviral antibacterial agent but what it also is is a pretty decent surfactant which stands for surface active agent it allows the alcohol to wet the surfaces more effectively and get into the viruses so when you put pure alcohol onto a surface it will kill about 99% of all the viruses within about thirty seconds of contact time if you add point three percent of the benzalkonium chloride to that you will increase the 'kathy kill rate to ninety-nine point nine percent plus so benzalkonium chloride and alcohol mixed together is what's in a lot of these surface wipes the wet wipes the Clorox wipes and it's what's typically used in hospitals to wipe down non absorbent surfaces now you might say well I can't get this anymore you could about a day before we did our last video but if you can't get this it's just an enhancement you can still use the alcohol it's still going to work it's just going to be a little slower you're gonna have to leave it a little longer and it's not going to kill quite as many viruses the other alternative you could use is the same bleach we talked about before a thirty to one dilution of the six percent sodium hypochlorite in here we'll get down to about a point two percent concentration and it will have the same 99% kill rate in about 30 seconds it's probably the cheapest thing that you can use and I use it frequently to clean off the inside of fish tanks and brewing equipment the downside is it stinks if you don't wear good gloves with this if you get this on your hands this is going to make your hands smell like a public pool for about three days so you probably have this it's very inexpensive it's very effective but if you don't want the smell you might consider to use using hydrogen peroxide the typical three percent solution is a pretty effective killing agent it'll take a couple of minutes to do the same sort of kill that these will but you can enhance it it's actually called enhanced hydrogen peroxide by adding a small quantity of sodium stearate which is the sodium salt of stearic acid it's very inexpensive you can buy this in bulk by the kilogram and it's in liniments and soaps and lotions because it's a very powerful surfactant and operates kind of like the benzalkonium chloride to improve the wetting action of the hydrogen peroxide this is a similar formula to some of the commercial cleaners like v rocks there are other brand names but this is also used in medical environments it's very effective it also doesn't stain it doesn't stink it will discolor your fingers little bit and it can affect some colors and some some cloths you might want to be a little bit careful about that now a lot of people had commented that they didn't want to take a spray bottle and put some isopropyl alcohol in it and spray it around and it's toxic and you don't want to get it in your eyes so it is possible to make a distal disinfectant solution that isn't really toxic and the trick to that is booze a [Music] Everclear which is 151 proof is 75 and a half percent ethyl alcohol so it's right about at the peak effectiveness of the alcohol and this material although it's not cheap if you take this and you put a quantity of this let's say about a hundred and fifty CCS and you mix in with this citric acid this acidifies this and improves the kill rate on this alcohol similar to the benzalkonium chloride by about tenfold this will dissolve pretty quickly and again citric acid is very easily available online it's inexpensive it'll take a minute or two for this to dissolve we'll give this a couple of minutes because it's cold in here and while that's dissolving there's another agent D Lima lean and it is the fragrance that is you that is obtained from oranges or lemons or grapefruit and it's often used itself as a cleaning agent and so when you take this and add just a few one or two cc's of this to this mixture here and then you stir this up the deal I Moline doesn't add any kind of necessary disinfectant properties to this but what it does do is it makes it smell like tangerines a relatively non-toxic disinfectant now once you've made this up you can take a little plastic bin with some cut up shop towels and pouring this mixture in here like this soak them in you've now made yourself a non-toxic wet wipe that's good and the only thing you have to worry about is if the traffic cop stops you have to convince him that you're a prepper I don't want to give you the impression that you shouldn't follow the advice of agencies or departments whose responsibility is our safety but at the same time I don't think that you should accept blindly what they say if you understand some of the principles behind what we're doing you can balance those and decide to do what's best for your own safety because the most powerful tool we have against this virus is not some department or some agency it's the power of your own mind so before I leave you I just want to say that I believe I don't think you should worry because I believe we're actually overreacting to this situation now the caveat is that we're never really going to know if I'm right until after the fact so it's probably a good idea to wear a belt and suspenders then to not do so and let your favorite pants fall down so if you found this pretty interesting please take a look at some of our other videos because we've got more on the way and we've got some interesting stuff out there and it's got the time to look at it it'll help out the channel to subscribe it'll also help us out if you share what you've seen here and I really want to tell you as Douglas Adam said don't you take care stay safe ever season [Music]
