hi the last few videos we've done have been pretty serious videos and some pretty serious topics but today I think we're gonna have a little bit of fun so for something completely different fog machines [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] fog machine [Music] all right so let me give you a little bit of an insight into how the machine that I built to do this fogging is put together basically we use dry ice this is a large parts cleaner Basin and it's containing right now about five or six kilograms of ice I'm going to add some more dry ice because this does go through this pretty quickly and we're gonna distribute this around here so that it fills up the container nicely and then if you take a look inside of there you'll get an idea of what's actually happening unlike the units that you can purchase that dip the ice down into some warm water we actually use pumps to spray the hot water on top that way when the water stops flowing you don't end up getting any additional smoke being produced when you don't want it so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to end up loading the ice in here and putting the part back together again there are some little holders that hold this up off of the water it keeps it nice and secure and then rather than letting those water jets dig holes through the ice I made this little spreader plate out of some thin aluminum sheet and just punched some holes in it this then goes on top inside of here and allows the water to be distributed by these holes so that we don't end up digging any holes inside of there then there's a top with removable hinges this gives you a lot better access to the inside of the unit when you're loading it and you're putting things together you're cleaning it and once these then flip down like this we can then put little latches on that hold it against a little o-ring to keep things nice and tight and then very lightweight PVC fitting into a hole that's been bored and then sand it a little bit so there's a little bit of compression fit and now we can aim this wherever we want either the wheels or actually with the top whichever way you like let me show you how this works little button for the pumps and when I spray the water it takes a few seconds but then you'll see something interesting pretty impressive huh now because this is cold it falls to the floor on like a typical fogger or a Heiser now you might not want in any kind of a demonstration to have this big machine in front of you so another little trick you can use is to replace this with a flexible duct now one of the nice things about these smoke machines is because unlike foggers and hazers they don't make a lot of messy sticky smoke there's no residue other than a little bit of humidity so they're kind of pleasant to use plus because they sit down as opposed to floating up they're a lot more useful for different kinds of theatrical environments like say dancing on the clouds or trying to produce sort of a neat spooky mood in any case in a few days what we're gonna do is I'm going to post the second video where I go step by step through the actual construction of this machine will give you all the parts will link to some drawings will give you the dimensions will give you the suppliers and I'll go through some tricks and how to use it and just basically how to operate it but for about a hundred and fifty dollars worth of equipment you could build a machine that costs about fifteen hundred dollars to buy commercially so I want to thank you very much for watching stay tuned and if you like this kind of video please subscribe tell your friends about it and we'll look forward to seeing in a few days some of the stuff we do here can be a lot of fun you have a great day and we'll see you soon [Music]
