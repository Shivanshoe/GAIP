[Music] hi in a couple of our recent videos i used a vacuum system to demonstrate different principles in the video that i did on the can crusher i used this vacuum system to produce a low pressure mercury vapor plasma in order to demonstrate the effects of magnetic fields on plasmas and in the video that preceded that which was the plasma tube i go through some of the tips and the tricks of setting up a vacuum system to get the optimum performance out of it and in that video i touched on a subject that i want to expand about on today and that is surface de-adsorption it's a big deal unless you have a true failure in your system you've got a hole in your vessel or you've got a tear in your tubing this will be the source of most of the gases that will contaminate your system and in very high vacuum systems ultra high vacuum uhv systems this is the real bugaboo in trying to reach very low pressures or very high vacuums because it represents a large reservoir of residual gas already in your system that has to be eliminated now the cause of this is that every surface that's immersed in an atmosphere me the room cameras everything it has a thin layer of very loosely bonded molecules water and atmospheric gases and those bondings are very very weak but they occur because of an interesting principle the glass surfaces say in a vessel the silicon dioxide has a silica and an oxygen nucleus that's surrounded by a covalently shared cloud of electrons and the air molecules or nitrogen molecules consist of two nitrogen nuclei that again share a cloud of electrons they're bonded covalently when those two materials move very closely together the nuclei from the surface have a very loose attraction to the electrons in the nitrogen and the nitrogen nuclei also attract the electrons in the glass now this is not a bond it's not a covalent bond it's not an ionic bond it's not a magnetic bond it's not an electrostatic bond it's due to the slight distortion in the electronic orbitals that causes this slight stickiness the reason it's significant is because it's weak enough that the gases that are on the surface are in equilibrium with the gases in the environment so that at all times gas molecules are hitting the surface and some of them are sticking and then due to thermal vibrations some of those gas molecules are boiling away from the surface and so you have this equilibrium layer and as the pressure is dropped inside of a chamber as the gas molecules are pulled away from the the environment those gas molecules that are attached to the surface over time boil away and continue to contaminate the inside of the vessel producing gases that have to be pumped out this is a real problem because it can take a very long time to get those gases out now there's two ways that vacuum technicians will deal with this the one the first way is to try to eliminate the surface area or reduce the surface area because it's linearly related or proportional to the amount of surface you have so you want to use a vacuum vessel that is no larger than the experiment demands secondly you want to make sure that the surfaces are both clean and smooth if you look at this table or you look at me the overall surface area you can kind of estimate it's a couple of square meters but the actual surface area from the molecular point of view from that scale is much larger because of pits and grooves and irregularities in the surface so if you have a very smooth clean surface you're going to have the lowest surface area for a given vessel size the other way that they deal with this is using heat if you produce a vacuum and you generate heat warm the surfaces they will thermally boil away more of those gases more quickly and so instead of taking days in order to reach a very high vacuum you may take hours and so most ultra high vacuum systems incorporate heating elements to bring the surfaces up to several hundred degrees centigrade in order to be able to drive those gases off now almost any physical principle can be treated either like a hassle or a problem or a challenge or as potentially a tool and in this case what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you that we can take advantage of that principle to produce a solid state vacuum pump without any moving parts it depends on the use of a material called a molecular sieve now in our recent video that i did on the virus i demonstrated the performance of a molecular sieve to review that very briefly what it does is it consists of using an aluminum silicate mixture that is formed into a sort of a clay-like paste it is dried and then it is baked and depending on what other kinds of chemicals are added at the time some potassium salts or sodium salts you can actually control the pores and the defects and the cracks that begin to develop as it's baked and you can very carefully control the size of those pores and those defects so that you can produce a very selected range of increased surface area just to give you an idea of how significant that is if you look at this little beaker here that contains about 200 grams of this aluminum silicate material you can estimate or guess that this probably has a gross surface area if you just look at the surface of the beads of maybe a couple of square meters but for any item or any particle or atom or molecule that's able to access the very small spaces inside of the beads the actual surface area is close to 200 000 square meters it's enormously higher and so this can be used in order to be able to separate uh different kinds of chemicals for example when we did the virus video i used this property to be able to separate out the alcohol and the water using a 3a molecular sieve which stands for three angstrom pore size water molecules are about two and a half to two point seven angstroms across isopropyl alcohol and ethanol are up around three to three and a half angstroms across so when you take a mixture of water and alcohol and you pour it onto here the water and the alcohol will soak the outside of the beads but only the water is able to access that enormous surface area inside of the pores inside of the cracks so then when i pour the liquid off of this most of the alcohol will leave only the stuff on the surface will be bound to these particles but most of the water will stay behind and so as a result you're going to end up with a concentration of alcohol and depending on the size of the particle the defects you can use this in chemical or pharmaceutical manufacture to separate solvents and chemicals from each other they make this in a 3a 3 angstrom 4a 5a and in this case 13x i'm not sure why they use the x but this has a 10 angstrom size and what's nice about this material is it's very very cheap this entire container here costs about twenty four dollars but you could get about ten times as much of this for about seventy dollars you can buy it by the drum it's very very inexpensive and it not only can separate out for chemical purposes in liquids it can also separate out gases because those forces that cause that attraction of the molecule to the surface those van der waals forces van der waals forces differ between different molecular species for example oxygen is a little stickier than nitrogen there was an interesting legend back from a couple decades ago on mauna kea the observatory up at about 4 000 meters and there was a maintenance worker that was dealing with some ice storm damage that had occurred to the outer structure of one of the observatories so we went over to the observatory he cut out the damaged section took the measurements brought it back to the shop and cut out some sheet metal in order to do the repair brought the sheet metal back and found that it was too short so i went back to the shop cut off some more material brought it back and it was still too short brought it back to the shop cut off some more material and it remained too short and eventually he decided that his brain wasn't working properly and that's what happens even to very fit people when you go up to very high altitudes you can't function very well and it's an interesting thing if you ever have the opportunity to do this it's worth trying if you go up to a very high altitude site like mauna kea about 4 200 meters and you look at the sky the clear sky at this premier observing site it's really not impressive it looks worse than it does in many towns it's very palette very very dim but if you put a mask on and blow a little oxygen at yourself for about two minutes all of a sudden the entire night sky lights up with stars because the brain and the retinas are very very sensitive to the level of oxygen so what we discovered is that at another observing site that we were working with a few years ago we were able to get a donation of what are called oxygen concentrators medical oxygen concentrators and they're very interesting devices they involve a series of cylinders stainless steel cylinders filled with a 5a molecular sieve and a compressor and some valves what they do is they compress and put a few atmospheres of surrounding air into the cylinder and because the oxygen is a little stickier than the nitrogen when you open the valve and begin to bleed off that compressed air the first gases that leave are the nitrogen and the last gases as it's decompressing are the oxygen and so by cascading these you can actually achieve oxygen concentrations up around 90 percent and it's a heck of a lot easier than lugging bottles up to the top of a mountain so this kind of a process this sort of surface absorption with gases is what we're going to use to generate the vacuum pump that we're going to demonstrate right here now when i told you about this vacuum pump in the previous videos i really like the yellow jacket pumps and i've got this hooked up in such a way that what we're going to do is i'm going to evacuate this i'm going to show you the pressures that we can reach with the meter with nothing in it so we're just the surfaces of the glass and the capabilities of the pump and within a couple minutes i'll show you how good a vacuum we can achieve so we'll start with me turning on the pump it's going to get a little loud now if you look at the meter over here it's off the scale basically there's atmospheric air in there when i open this valve you will hear the sound change and you'll see the vacuum pressure very quickly drop here now we'll give this just a minute or so to be able to drain the pressure but you'll see how low a pressure we can get with this pump now when they talk about microns or millimeters that's the theoretical pressure of how high the atmospheric pressure would lift a column of mercury at these pressures it's theoretical but that's sort of the relative measure that this is comparing to so when they say microns of of pressure that means how many microns you'd lift lift a column of mercury now you can see within just about 20 seconds we're already down to 30 microns and the pump which is spec at only 25 microns that means straight into a meter is under spec kind of unusual for most products nowadays about 22 we might get to 21. now what i'm going to do is i'm going to turn off the pump and i'm going to fill this with some molecular sieve 20. now we'll take this flask out and i'm going to fill this with some molecular sieve little trick for the funnel is because there's a um vacuum grease here i don't want to get the particles on that that can damage the seal when we try to put this back on one eternity later not bad all right now we'll close this and now we're going to pump it out again now you watch the vacuum valve and you'll see what kind of vacuum we can reach [Applause] now the only thing i've changed is i've just added the desiccant everything else is exactly the same now you can see it's starting to slow down a little bit i know this may be boring but the reason i'm doing this real time is simply because you can see how much longer i'm pumping and how much less we're getting down to that 20 that we saw last time i'll never get there so you can see there's a clear difference i mean this thing is just maybe we'll get to 80 and you know another 10 minutes or so nevertheless this is this is the starting point now in order to create a pump out of this what we're going to do is i'm going to raise this up i'm going to put a little insulation around here and we're going to run the temperature up around this to about 300 degrees centigrade the desiccant will tolerate or the molecular sieve will tolerate about 350 degrees centigrade and the glass will tolerate about 550 degrees centigrade so with my little probe and my little heater i'm going to run this for about a half an hour under vacuum at about 300 degrees centigrade to drive off all of that gas and then i'm going to show you what happens so let's put this up okay a little bit of this fiberglass rope around here and now we're going to turn on the heat okay you can see it's been about a half hour maybe 35 40 minutes and the temperature as it's continually risen has driven more and more of the gas into the chamber and this pressure has continually raised slowly as that gas is being driven off there's no leak this is just the gas that comes off of the surface as it's being driven out thermally now what i'm going to do is i'm going to turn the heat off and we're going to take this out and we're going to let it cool closer to room temperature by lowering the heating element the mantle here and then once this gets closer to room temperature so that i don't crack the glass i'm then going to immerse this in liquid nitrogen and we're going to bring the temperature way down to 77 degrees k and with that we'll be able to absorb adsorb sorry a lot more gas so we'll give this about 10 or 15 minutes to drop down to room temperature and then we're going to immerse this in the nitrogen i'll see in a little bit all right giving this a solid 45 maybe even 50 minutes to heat and then to cool down to room temperature and we're down to about 55 degrees centigrade and now what i'm going to do is i'm going to immerse this in liquid nitrogen to bring the temperature way way down you'll notice the pressure right now is at about 27 so that's the baseline of the pump and just about what you can do without any desk in it at all science is fun isn't it now this will take a little while because of the vacuum in there in order to conduct the heat from the beads that are in the middle they have to be conducted through the material rather than say through air and so it's going to take a little while for them to drop all the way down to the baseline temperature but when they have been cooled we should stop seeing this boiling action occurring around the vessel now you can see the temperatures already dropped down i mean the pressure's already dropped down to 15 14 13. we're now below the spec of the pump and lower than we even got with an empty empty uh glass vessel now give this about five minutes for all the heat to distribute and then i'm going to show you how this can be used as a solid state pump now the pressure right now about 12 microns and this has been sitting here for about five minutes and you can see very little is boiling off here so we're probably pretty much at equilibrium temperature throughout the particles throughout the molecular sieve so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to turn off the pump seal it turn it off now what's interesting is the pressure will hang around here for a fairly long period of time just based on you know leakage from my fittings but what i'm going to do is i'm going to open up this valve and i'm going to add some air in here and you're going to watch what happens to the pressure when i do that watch the meter carefully you also see some of this bubble when i do that because the air is going to heat it [Applause] now i'm going to close it again and we'll watch what happens to the pressure no pump now why this is significant is because this kind of a pump is actually used commercially it's called absorption pump or a cryo pump typically in those kinds of pumps they will actually take sheets of stainless steel and bond to them or mount on them some of this molecular sieve or something similar to this molecular sieve and then they will actually cool them off all the way to liquid helium temperatures much colder than liquid nitrogen and they will then absorb gases that are adsorb gases including gases like oxygen and nitrogen and even hydrogen and neon and argon carbon dioxide because it will not only stick but it will also condense and they have a very very high pumping speed and they're also very clean and there are no moving parts they're using particle accelerators and fusion generation systems and so it's an interesting kind of phenomenon because it really does work it does pump where it matters to us is that this will not substitute say for a diffusion pump or a vacuum pump based on say a turbo molecular system because it's obviously dead end you're going to fill up the beads and then they're not going to work but for relatively low pumping capacity or if you're trying to evacuate a low a small vessel that contains dangerous materials mercury heavy metals toxins solvents things that you don't want to get into the air you don't want to get into the vacuum system you can use a system like this to draw the the toxic materials into the beads and then when you're done with the experiment the process you can actually just take the beads and throw them in a hazardous waste bin you can just dispose of them because this is probably about two bucks worth of molecular sieves so it's kind of a neat thing to have as a tool in your armamentarium of vacuum systems and if we wait a little bit longer we'll see that the pressure will actually continue to drop so hopefully this is kind of interesting and as we get on with other kinds of experiments with these systems we may go back and visit revisit some of
