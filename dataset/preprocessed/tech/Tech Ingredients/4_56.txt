hi we decided to do a video tonight because of what's going on in the world today with the corona virus and the kovat 19 the infection that's spreading around the world [Music] [Music] I wanted to approach this from the point of view of safety I don't want to spend any time tonight talking about the virology I also don't want to theorize about the socio-economic the political the the conspiracies that surround the the source of the virus primarily I want to look at this as an engineer would in terms of how you can keep yourself safe and an engineer looks at understanding the basic principles applies the available tools and then tries to get the best results for the least expense the most bang for the buck so to understand how we can avoid getting sick is to understand how the virus gets us sick the virus attacks the respiratory tract there are receptors inside the lung that are vulnerable to the attack of the kovat 19 virus and so if we can keep the virus out of our respiratory system there's a good chance that we're going to get through this and the best way to sort of begin this is to look at the most direct way that you would be able to contract the disease and that would be a direct transmission of the viral particles from one individual to another now what's interesting is if you go into a room or you go into some sort of a public space where you're gonna be around other people at some point you're gonna find somebody who's sniffling or sneezing or coughing and understand it Koff can actually transmit viral particles as much as six feet twice the distance from my fingers to my my face and the very smallest particles can actually move as much as eight or nine feet in other words two or three meters and the smallest particles because they are so small we're talking submicron they can persist in the air for a fairly long period of time because of thermal vibrations Brownian motion as well as the fact that when you expel these these droplets your breath has been warmed inside of your body and so it tends to rise so even though the particles are heavier than than air that rising air and those very tiny particles can persist in the air for minutes so when you are exposed to somebody who is within that kind of that kind of distance which is basically inside of a typical room the first thing that you should do is stop inhaling and if as quickly as possible you want to put some sort of a barrier between you and the source of the the virus turn away and walk out of there I mean that's the most direct way that you can try to reduce the amount of particles that you're going to ingest you're still probably going to be exposed but what we're trying to do is reduce the exposure if you go into a public space where there are multiple people or you're not going to be able to sort of predict and you can't act like some sort of a kung-fu master a good idea is to wear a mask and a mask unless you've got something like say a fighter pressurized fire mask it's rheumatica ly sealed with a separate oxygen or air tank they're all going to inhibit the virus being able to enter you but they're not going to be able to prevent it the classic of the popular n95 mask that's one of these down here this mask is called n95 because it has a 95% chance of reducing or eliminating particles that are larger than 300 nanometers or 300 or 0.3 micron but he can't stop all of the particles and because the virus itself is as small as a hundred nanometers the reason that this is able to stop viral particles that are that small is because the vast majority of them are not going to be naked they're going to be either adsorbed on the surface of droplets or absorbed absorbed absorbed inside of droplets and those droplets are going to have a range of sizes all the way from millimeter sized all the way down to nanometer sized and the way a mask will stop the virus from moving through it is not because it acts as a membrane or a grid it acts more like a labyrinth and so even though the pores themselves may be larger than the particles because the masks themselves are hundreds of times thicker than the size of the particle itself it provides a labyrinth so that the particles are likely to be caught just like if you go bow hunting in the woods even though your arrow is going to be a lot smaller than the spaces between the trees and the twigs it's very unlikely you're going to be able to hit your if you're firing through a long distance through a lot of brush and a lot of sticks and that's how these masks work and that's also why they're statistical they're not absolute guarantees against blockage but even the cheapest painters mask is still better than nothing and it helps to reduce the amount of particles that you're going to ingest and we'll get into that in just a second now I wear glasses as you can see and so as a result I tend to prefer the surgical style masks the reason that these masks are kind of nice is because first of all there are two points to be able to tie them on your on your head one going up above the glasses so you don't pull your glasses down secondly because of the fact that they tend to have a larger area surface area they provide less restriction for the same amount of blockage of particles and also you could get them to conform very nicely around your face to help provide a more comfortable living environment as opposed to say these cup shaped masks masks which have a lot of gap around the side and in addition they don't tend to conform as easily and the other thing about these things is they're more compact it also has a second advantage and that is kind of subtle and that is it makes you facially aware because just like tying a ribbon around your finger when you're going shopping to remind you to buy something because this thing is in front of your face you're thinking about your face and the other way that the particles can get into your body is through contact with your hands so the great big thing that you can take away from this whole video is do not touch your face it was interesting that there was a government scientist out in California a few days ago that did a speech a public safety announcement and she was talking about the importance of washing your hands and avoiding public spaces and also not touching her face but during the the video she actually touched her own face three times in addition to licking her finger to turn the document over that she was reading from now I'm not saying that she was hypocritical it's just that people don't realize how frequently they touch their face there was a recent study that shows that a typical average person touches their face 90 times a day and you don't think about it so you're doing to video like this your glasses come down you kind of reach up like this and before you know it you've touched your face and when you touch your face what happens is that any particles any material that's on your hand can be wiped into the area of your mucous membranes and you can adjust the particles and they can get into your lungs your hands are your connection with the world and that's the way that you can get a lot of material onto your hands and then into your body so do not touch your face and your hands are a lot less dangerous the danger that's associated with these particles is the fact that because of the fact that not only do they persist in the human body for as much as twenty seven days before they begin to show that you've got the infection and the fact that you can shed these things while you're sick and even while you're recovering they can survive on dry cold surfaces for as much as nine days so even though you you go into a room that you don't think anybody's occupied every time you touch something there's a good chance that you may wipe viruses onto your hands and then potentially onto your face so keep your hands away from your face now there are certain instances when you're not going to be able to avoid that and that's why I used to always carry little hand wipes with me whenever I was in the car just simply because you go to a fast food place so you get some grease on your hands and you want something moist to wipe your hands off but the point is now I'm carrying gloves with me and the way a glove works is not as sort of a good luck charm or a talisman it's simply a removable piece of skin that if you contaminate it it allows you to remove it so say you're gonna go get gasoline at the the at the gas station what you do is you take a glove you don't need to you can conserve by just putting it on one hand take the glove get out of your car open up the gas cap then put the glove on go ahead get your gas do everything that you're going to do with a public surface and then when you're done paying for the gas go ahead and take your glove off and then go ahead and touch your car close your gas cap and keep your surfaces pristine another nice thing about these latex gloves as opposed to say them my trial gloves is because they're very thin and very stretchable if you're in a complex area and you know that you might have to go between clean surfaces and dirty surfaces you can actually do like we did in some of our epoxy videos you can do what's called double gloving so you put two gloves on when you're done contaminating the first layer it's now as dirty as your hand would have been come you then remove this glove and you now have another clean glove that you can work with this is a great way of keeping your hands as clean as possible by simply not contacting another kind of nice thing to do is to use a disinfectant these wipes these Clorox wipes have a lot of inert material in them there's some alcohol and lanolin but what's the active ingredient in here is benzalkonium chloride it's a relatively low irritation pretty safe antiviral antibacterial agent that is present in this in this material it soaks into these towelettes at a point point three percent solution and because like I said I always keep these in the car I went to the Walmart a couple of days ago and I noticed all the shelves are empty so people are starting to stock up on this stuff so if you find that it's the case you're not stuck because it turns out that you can order and you can buy benzalkonium chloride we have a lot of this and it comes in a fifty percent solution so by diluting this down a hundred and fifty fold you can actually prepare a little spray bottle with say 50/50 alcohol atwater isopropyl or ethyl alcohol doesn't really matter in water pour in enough so that you end up with a point three percent solution it's not irritating doesn't smell doesn't seem to cause any kind of dryness of your skin that the alcohol wouldn't spray a piece of paper towel and you've got an almost infinite number of wet tell s and the towelettes not only tend to be bacteria Seidel but they also just tend to be a mechanical elimination so like the old chemistry theory which is the solution to pollution is deletion if you can wipe off mechanically ninety percent of all the material that has the viruses what's left behind is then weakened and a little bit less likely to cause contamination now you stay nice and clean like this one of the things that you have to consider is that because this virus is so widespread around the world right now and because of the fact that there is such a long incubation period surfaces that have this on it will will be will allow the surface surfaces to be dangerous for as much as nine days it's very likely that over a period of another year or two you're probably going to come down with this this is probably going to become an endemic infective agent that we're gonna have to live with going on into the future and so at some point there's a good chance that you may get sick and so the real question that you have to think about is like geez if I'm going to come down with this how bad is it one of the problems that we have and trying to determine really how dangerous this is is because we don't really have a good handle on the denominator how many people actually have this because a large fraction of the people that come down with us do perfectly well they don't get tested they they can pass it on but they're part of the infective numbers and so we don't know how risky it is because when you think about it more people die from influenza than die from Ebola but the reason that is not because Ebola is less deadly if you get it it's simply because so few people get it if we look at the best studies that are out there and those I believe are from South Korea they have a huge number of test kits and they decided unlike the United States and Europe to use a test kit that has a very high accuracy it's reported to be about 95% accurate and they've tested over a million people it appears to be that the death rate associated with this the mortality rate is somewhere probably around don't touch your face probably somewhere around 0.5% one in 200 people now those one in 200 people represents about five times the death rate associated with the flu so it is definitely more lethal but it's more lethal than something that is relatively not lethal not very dangerous nevertheless because of the fact that you're talking about huge numbers of potential infected people the impact it's going to have on the world and on the world support system the hospitals and and the medical community is going to be a problem because a much higher than half percent mortality rate involve people that need hospitalization need ventilators ICU care and so if you're going to get the infection it would be good to get it when not everybody else is getting it in other words the rest of the community is able to support you that's part of the argument behind quarantine and trying to slow the spread of the disease because we have a greater amount of duration over which we can spread our resources in order to give you the kind of care you need now if you do decide that you want to try to eliminate your your risks you want to try to eliminate your contact with other people and that means sometimes staying at home if you have the option or maybe just minimizing the number of times that you are in contact like going shopping now we live in a fairly rural area we have our own water we have our own power and we have a big house so we can store a lot of supplies we just pack away enough in our pantry that we really don't need to go to the store for long periods of time and at this point because of the virus we've just kind of boosted up the supplies we have if you're in a different situation where you live say in a condominium or an apartment and you really don't have a lot of room you want to think about how can you store up enough so that you're not necessarily living like you know the boy in the bubble but maybe you don't go out as often and maybe you have a little bit less chance of getting sick and so one of the things that I want to sort of cover here is there are some things that you can do to save up or prepare that are relatively easy and sometimes not talked about as much the density and the quality of of the proteins and the foods that you need are based on the fact that you want something that's gonna last a long time something that doesn't cost a lot and something that's compact now everybody seems to talk about rice and pasta but one thing that they often don't talk about is just plain sugar sucrose it's extremely dense it's very low in terms of cost and lasts years and you can cycle through it if it turns out that you never need it but storing up sugar is sugar it is energy and keeps people alive another thing is you need oil and you can think about using either peanutbutter or nuts but a couple of interesting alternatives is chocolate cocoa it's got a lot of fat in it it tastes nice you can use it with other things that you've got on storage and it gives you a little bit of variety in terms of what you're gonna eat but also pure oil you can cook with it it's very dense again inexpensive and lasts basically forever so having a lot of oil available is important protein beans are a great source of protein no question about that again lasts a long time dense and inexpensive canned meats last years and are also dense and you don't need a refrigerator for them another one though to think about is protein powder you know bodybuilder protein powder it's relatively inexpensive it's based on a whey protein it comes in flavors well last year's and is dense it's a nice alternative to give you some some variety with your other materials and then certainly very highly processed meats because of all the nitrates and nitrites and things that people generally want to avoid they tend to last a long time even if not refrigerated and in a freezer can last for years you can put 50 or 60 pounds of this in a refrigerator or freezer and it'll store for a very long period of time now because that kind of a diet is gonna keep you alive but it's going to be sort of skewed one of the things you might also want to think about is vitamins and they don't have to be sort of Centrum Silver's they can be fun you can make them gummy bears or you can have you know Flintstone vitamins something fun but this will help to balance a somewhat unbalanced diet and also I have a little bit of a prejudice against the idea of or in favor of the idea of zinc there have been some reports some theories that zinc can help to inhibit viral replication and the lozenges that people will use the the zinc gluconate put in the back of your throat are reported to reduce the severity of viral infections and maybe inhibit them I don't know that that's true but intracellular zinc is definitely something you don't want to be deficient in so making sure that you have some supplement maybe in the form of a an oral vitamin it's water-soluble you're not going to intoxicate yourself with that and it's kind of a nice thing to add in order to keep your balanced nutritional state as high as possible the other thing I would also avoid is don't stock up on toilet paper it seems that there's runs all over the place people just running in and getting hundreds of rolls of toilet paper and I'm sorry you can't eat toilet paper and for hundreds of thousands of years people didn't need toilet paper let's be serious you got soap you got water you don't need toilet paper okay so just don't bulk up on that that's something you really don't need if you don't have a lot of room that's basically what I wanted to cover in terms of the sort of preparations and what I would tell you to do is don't get crazy don't get fearful about this just think ahead and approach this as an engineer or a scientist what logically how do I maximize the safety and how do I minimize the inconvenience and if you like the kind of stuff that we're doing here subscribe because if you do decide that you're gonna end up self quarantine E or you're gonna end up being limited to just YouTube is your entertainment will be around so I wish you a good evening I want you to stay safe and don't touch your face [Music]
