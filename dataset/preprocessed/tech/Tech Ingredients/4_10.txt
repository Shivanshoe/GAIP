hi a couple of weeks ago we did a video on solar concentrators and if you're interested in the overall project and the purpose of these concentrators take a look at the video because i think you'll find it pretty interesting [Music] my [Music] we got a number of comments from people about just the assembly or the fabrication of the particular model that we built and demonstrated in the video and so i thought it might be interesting to take a few minutes and go through some of the tricks and techniques that we use to build these very lightweight concentrators and even if you're not building them you might find some of the tricks that we show you useful for other projects as a recap the system is based on these wise weize 100 watt solar panels that we purchased from amazon they're really nice panels i really like them and you can buy them in quantity for a relatively lower price but in single unit quantities they cost a hundred dollars a piece you can get them for about eighty dollars a piece if you buy larger quantities they're rated at 100 watts meaning they put out about 18 and a half volts at about 5.5 amps at one solar flux or in other words one kilowatt per square meter which is the kind of solar flux that you would see on the equator at noon the purpose of the concentrators is not necessarily just to try to push these things as hard as you possibly can but rather to take panels that are operating at lower flux levels like you might find at high latitudes where we live or in the morning or in the afternoon and bring the total harvesting energy up closer to the spec range for a longer period of time that's the real purpose not to burn these things out the type of solar panel that we built was based on a couple of flat reflector panels that bring a much larger area of light down to the down to the the functioning pv panel to generate that additional flux and hopefully bring you closer to about 100 watts average output now the system itself is quite straightforward but i thought i'd go through some of the details we take advantage of the fact that these particular panels are mounted on a stamped aluminum frame you can see the back of this panel i have over here gives you a better idea of what what it looks like this thin aluminum is formed into a multi-layer stamping that provides a lot of rigidity to the panel as well as mounting points if you're going to be bolting these or hard hard bolting these to a fixed installation in addition to that they also provide a lot of access for us when we're going to be mounting these solar concentrators right directly onto the frame itself now the particular panel that we're using here has a couple of hinges that i mounted on the side of the panel taking advantage of that thin aluminum stamping these little hinges that we're using right here are just a couple of bucks stainless steel hinges we bought them from a local hardware store we've just drilled a couple of holes we've screwed them in and put nuts on the back of the screws to attach them to the side of the frame and then attached to that we have these articulating doors or reflectors that are built to bring in the additional sunlight they are based on a highly reflective material called miro m-i-r-o silver from a company called animet they're located both in canada and the us i think they have a european outlet in germany but this material is remarkable it's a half millimeter thick aluminum that has an overcoating of highly reflective silver and then over that several layers of a hard dielectric enhancement that bring the reflectivity over 97 percent over the wavelength that these solar panels will respond to because they are so thin they are very flexible and so to mount them on the sides here we have to give them some additional reinforcement so that they'll form a flat surface and won't tend to lens or concentrate the light into a small hot spot on the solar panel so to do that we fabricated an aluminum frame this frame is built out of three millimeter thick or eighth inch nominal thick one and a half inch or about three and a half centimeters l shapes in 6061 aluminum and then what we did is we cut them and then we mitered them at these corners to form this u-shaped frame that's very lightweight and is also waterproof water resistant and relatively easy to fabricate now if you looked if you saw the welds on the bottom there you might think i can't work with aluminum like that i don't have the welding skills i don't have the machine tools to do that actually you could build this out of fiberglass they make the same sort of shapes in fiberglass you could even pay a little bit more and save a little bit more weight and go to graphite if you wanted to really lighten the the load but aluminum is really easy to work with and it's relatively inexpensive and a lot of people think that in order to work with aluminum you need to use metal working tools that's not the case in fabricating these corners we produced a 45 degree miter that allows us to produce a 90 degree very neat corner that when welded together forms a very strong structural shape but at the same time is very flat and easy to mount the anime miro silver panels to now to form these nice 45 degree miters you can actually do that in a chop saw and i'm going to show you how to do that safely so let's go over here and let me show you how to do that now this is a typical woodworking chop saw and with very fine teeth you can use this for cutting aluminum but there's a few things you want to watch out for when you do that if you can clamp all the parts down very securely you can use this almost the same way you would cut a hard wood like oak but in our particular case because we're going to try to save some metal i've clamped one of these aluminum frame pieces into the saw very close to its end so what i'm going to cut off is going to be a small fragment of aluminum and that potentially can fly out it can get caught in the teeth and act as a piece of shrapnel so even though the general guideline whenever working with machine tools is not to use gloves because they can actually pull you in in certain cases it's not a bad idea so in this case what we're going to do is i've got on a face shield here and i've got some gloves and i'm going to put on headphones when cutting aluminum these loud saws become very loud that's probably the only real significant difference when working with aluminum in woodworking tools loud so a little bit of a warning to you and let me get all suited up here all right here we go [Applause] [Music] i don't know if you saw that little piece of metal go flying but that's why you wear the extra equipment now if you look i'll unclamp this and show you what the material looks like once you've cut it take this out of the clamping and you can see that you get a pretty straight cut it looks pretty nice the final little trick is to take a little piece of sandpaper and we're going to smooth this out get rid of the little burrs that we have here so that we have a nice surface for welding so just drag this across a piece of sandpaper it doesn't matter what grit you can use fine you can use coarse get rid of some of the sharp edges and you have a very nice surface for being able to do the weld now when you're finally welding this up be aware of the fact that welding aluminum is unlike welding a lot of metals it distorts a lot i'm not very good with a welder but my son has a good wire feed aluminum mig welder and can produce a very excellent weld on this take a file and cut across here a little bit to produce a little bit of an inset so you got some place for your weld and you can do this on aluminum very very easily and in addition you can cut much thicker and heavier pieces of aluminum especially if you're cutting them farther up into the structure because you can clamp both sides and then you don't have to be so concerned about that piece of shrapnel flying at you but remember it's loud all right now the next step is after you've formed the miter joints and you have prepared for the weld be aware that whenever you're welding aluminum it distorts a lot you want to clamp the surfaces down very securely tack the weld and then fill in the dis the spaces between the tacks preventing a lot of bending and warpage aluminum is particularly prone to warpage when you do the welding and if best yet see if you can find somebody who's got experience with it and then you don't have to tell them what to do now the next step is you're going to want to mount the uh very thin flexible material on top of here and so you want to make sure that you grind the surfaces on the top where you've placed the weld so that you don't have some sort of a bump that the aluminum is going to be sitting on just a piece of sandpaper if you've got some patience or a little dye grinder or something or even a file just to smooth this out make sure you have a nice flat surface now the material here this animate material is very flexible as you can see it bends a great deal and so to be able to drill through and form very nicely shaped holes in this material without creating a crater or a pucker there's a trick to drilling through very very thin materials that produce a ver produces a very nice hole the first thing is have something you're going to drill into this helps to support the back surface of the material when you're putting the pressure on with the drill in addition the other trick is to drill uh very high speed but very low pressures i start by marking out where i'm going to be producing the holes let's assume i've marked the positions i take a punch and i'm going to put a little bit of a dimple where i'm going to be doing my drilling i don't want to make this particularly large because i'm going to create a crater the material is so soft and the wood is not that strong so once you've formed a little bit of a dimple that's going to keep the drill from wandering take the drill place it in the position you're going to be drilling don't push hard just like that and as you can see you get a very flat drill hole and you don't see any sort of cratering and the reflection of the light are you able to see that alex and you can clean both sides up take a little file or take a little deburring tool but again we don't create a distortion which is going to distort the overlying material now let's assume you know how to do this now and you have marked and you have carefully drilled out the underlying material now you're going to want to mount it on the frame and there's a little bit of a trick to doing that let me show you we're going to get this stuff out of the way first now assuming you've gone ahead and you've marked out and positioned where you're going to be putting the holes you also have to trim the material these individual sheets are not very expensive you can buy enough for this project for about forty five dollars these two sheets together are part of one larger sheet but obviously you have to cut it and you have to cut it to fit the frame cutting this thin material and still retaining a very flat surface and not distorting or peeling it up is a little bit of a trick as well a typical cutter like this is a sheet metal cutter and it has the ability to cut very effectively but what it does is it tends to bend both surfaces away from the cutting surface because there is no favored upper or lower surface there's no off-cut versus main material so it cuts well but it can produce some distortion in the cut edge of the material you want to retain there are specialty cutters that are that are available like these these are left and right hand cutters you can see they're different from each other and as a result you can cut a left or right hand side of a surface of material without creating that kind of distortion in the main material because it produces all the curl or all the distortion on the offcut side at the expense of the offcut you leave the main material unaffected now the way that that works is let's say for example this cutter here is designed to produce the off cut as sort of a spiral that comes off of this side so if i take this piece of material that i drilled into and i place it into the cutter like this and cut through it you can see that the curl is beginning to occur in the surface that we can see it's folding it up out of the way so that the cutter can get through but the underlying material remains almost perfectly flat a little bit near the start where i got a bend but there is no up or down bending to this that you have to spend a lot of time to try to flatten out if you have this sort of a little defect here just simply have a little extra material that you can get rid of or this material is soft enough you can almost straighten this out in your hand if you don't have these types of specialty cutters they're not expensive they're probably about 20 25 bucks but when working with sheet metal it's really nice to have them to produce very high quality cuts in very thin material you can also go to a local machine shop where they have a sheer that can cut through like a huge paper cutter a very very nice quality edge for a few bucks or a favor you can save a little bit of work and maybe not invest in the tools now let's assume that you've carefully sized the material you've cut it nice and flat and you have marked where you're going to be putting the screws through and you've drilled your holes you notice that this material here because it is so thin it is very flexible and depends on the frame to provide a nice flat surface when i lay this on top of here i can use the holes that i've already placed in this overlying mirror silver reflector to position the holes that i'm going to be using to mount it to the frame now i have a choice i could just drill the holes out to a sufficient diameter and then place a screw and a nut on the other side to fix the material to the frame the problem there is to get a very nice neat tight packing i really can't have anything protruding through the bottom of the frame i need it nice and flat so the other way to do that is to simply take a couple of these fasteners here which are fine thread machine screws that are going to actually be driven into tapped holes so when i transfer the hole from the mirror silver into the frame i drill a slightly smaller hole tap it for this thread and then place this threaded into the frame and even though i'm only getting three or four threads attaching this to the frame it's plenty strong for the little bit of load that this is going to be under and gives me a nice flush surface underneath to allow a nice nesting now one of the things that you'll notice in this particular frame here if i pick up this rod so you get a good view you can see that because the outer surface here is not framed in it's not a full complete square we do that again to allow the two frames to book together to frame to pack against each other and if i had something sticking down here that wouldn't work so i need to leave that open the problem is this very flexible material as you can see is sags under its own weight and we would tend to produce a concentrating effect on the solar panel we don't want that so i'm going to show you a little trick to allow us to fix that you could bend the metal down or you could create a little bit of a bead but the problem with that again is you're producing some sort of protrusion to the back surface you can see this particular frame over here is much flatter and the way i achieve that is by doing this in two stages i attach the underlying holes down here i marked a few holes down here on the frame i drill them i tap them and then i actually attach some of these screws into these holes to start with tighten that one down i'm going to put two more in here now we haven't transferred these holes yet we've only done that to these base holes in the center of the rigid part of the frame i'll explain why in just a second now if you look at the frame down right around here you'll see that i bored out a rather large diameter hole and the purpose of that in each side of the frame is so that i can take a threaded rod with a nut at one end and i'm actually going to place this all the way through like this feed this in and then with a nut on each end what i'm going to do and i'm not going to tighten this all the way down because that'll be boring for you but the point is by using these two nuts i can actually distort the frame you can see that it's relatively flexible and i bring it in about three or four millimeters between an eighth and a quarter of an inch literally distorting the frame then i transfer the holes to their proper positions on either side of the outer part of the frame and secure everything down what happens is when i then remove the threaded rod the frame puts the mirror silver under some tension and that's what produces the very flat surface in the other side without needing to do any kind of machining at the other end it's a very effective technique and it can be used for a number of different flexible structures where you pre-tension things so that when you remove the tension you get the shape that you actually want okay so now what i want to show you is the little technique that we used for supporting these panels we're going to assume that this frame that i'm building here is for lightweight transportation purposes and so in order to be able to get the maximum output you not only want to have a lot of light hitting the panel because of the reflectors but you also want to mount the entire panel at the correct angle based on your latitude so that you're facing perpendicular to the sun so we took advantage of this frame here and attached to the top of the frame a couple of these articulating ball joints that have female threads in the end of them you can get them very inexpensively at mcmaster car i think they're about six bucks each and these little receptacles can allow a threaded rod to be inserted in the field like this as little legs and when attached like this they can move around you can adjust the angle depending on the sun you can eyeball it and then if you want to you can just push these into soft ground or if it's very very springy and kind of unlevel and you want to support this a little bit more securely you can actually use a little nut to keep this at a specific distance and just place this into a board to form a little bit of a foot or you could bring these in at an angle and create somewhat of a tripod effect but what's nice about these threaded rods is you can get them in aluminum so they're super super light and because they come apart again everything can go back in a backpack or in the back of an rtv with a couple of your panels makes things super flexible finally in order to be able to adjust these panels for maximum output we showed this when the panel was facing directly at the sun but if for example you want to optimize say morning light or you want to look at afternoon light or you don't want to cook the panel and you want to line up the reflectors so that they don't produce any concentration we took advantage of the same um uh frame spacing to place a couple of holes in the top edge of the panel and that allows us to place this aluminum rod or this aluminum bar that can be used to adjust the angle on these panels manually we have a lot of holes in here that allows us to get all different kinds of angles and by mating with a receiving hole in the frame that's been drilled to the proper position using one of these ring mounted ball detent rods you can place this inside of these holes that make them to nominal diameters quarter inch or seven millimeters or whatever you want they will go inside of the hole easily but they're retained so they won't fall off on their own but when you want to take things apart you can just pull them apart and put them in your pocket or put them on a tie wrap or something and keep them together this makes it very easy for you to adjust this in the field and again this entire structure pulls apart and can be transported very very easily and it's obvious you could fabricate this in aluminum you could make it wood or fiberglass or whatever you like nothing fancy about this all right so that's pretty much it for the build if you're interested in this take a look at the previous video because we give you some performance numbers and show you how well this works for people who've commented about the fact that they are afraid that they're going to cook their panels by using these concentrators keep in mind that the purpose for this build was to allow you to take a single panel and try to get the most amount of light energy or electrical energy out of the sun as possible in other words extend the hours over which you can accumulate energy not necessarily to try to break records and by doing it in this fashion you produce a very very light weight adds only about 20 to the weight of the underlying panel low cost easily transportable system that would allow you to take one or two panels out to a remote site and still harvest more light than you would with just bringing one or two plain panels now we're producing a lot more videos nowadays we're trying to produce at least a video a week and almost routinely posting videos on sundays if you like the kind of material that we're
