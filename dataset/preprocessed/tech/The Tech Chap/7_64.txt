hey guys i'm from the techchap and this well you can probably guess is the new macbook pro 16. i actually have two of these uh apple very kindly sent a review sample which i uh set up earlier have been having a bit of a play with i've also got a couple of the map books here which i want to talk about uh but this is the one i bought as well because my editing team and i so my brother pete and my friend james and also myself hopefully we'll be switching to these as our main editing and work pcs definitely a bit of an investment but hopefully it pays off so let's get this unboxed i'll show you around talk you through what's new do some comparisons and give you my first impressions and well just have a bit of a chat about these new macbooks so let's do the best bit let's get this unboxed so so where do we start there is about a million things to talk about with this but i guess the design that's obviously the most obvious change up front and actually if we bring in uh the old 16 inch version straight away you'll be able to see quite a few differences uh this is the space gray of the old model this is this silver new one we've got this black on black keyboard which is very striking i'm not sure if i love it straight away it feels like someone's just squeezed in a logitech keyboard or something into the center here elsewhere we've got these much thinner bezels as you can see and also well that the notch love it or hate it but we'll come back to that in a second it is a bigger 16.2 inch versus 16 inch screen so a little bit more screen real estate because of those thinner bezels but in pretty much the same overall form factor and of course also going back to the keyboard no more touch bar i must admit i did get used to using this perhaps a bit of stockholm syndrome or something but i am going to miss it uh but we are now back to this full height keyboard with uh these full-size function row keys touch id at the top right no face id of course and also i noticed there's no key for the keyboard backlight up here actually i noticed if you put your hand in front of the facetime camera it actually automatically dims it so there must be a light sensor in here that adjusts that backlight which is kind of nifty we've also got improved speakers and if we put these on the side you'll see these ports look at these we've got ports very unapple like but we've got hdmi 2 not 2.1 sadly but it will still do a 4k60 and hdr thunderbolt 4 sd card reader we've got the new magsafe 3 port alongside two more thunderbolt 4s and a headphone jack and you can see it is quite a bit chunkier than the old macbook pro 16 and we've got these little feet on the bottom so it stands off the desk just a little bit to give it more airflow we still have that on the old one but it's just a bit more obvious here let's talk about this screen because i think after the new m1 pro and m1 max chips inside this is the biggest update to the new macbook pros so if i jump into the system preferences you can see this is the apple xdr display we've got a p3 1600 nits so that's the peak brightness when you're watching or looking at hdr content normally it tops out at 1 000 nits and you can also see we've got this pro motion 120 hertz although you can also specify it to one of these frame rates if you prefer and to be honest you notice it straight away even just with the cursor on the home screen but if you jump into a website like this it just feels so much smoother and this will dynamically adjust the refresh rate based on what you're doing so if you're watching a movie then it will go down to 24 or 30 frames per second but that really is glorious and even though generally on laptops we associate high refresh with gaming not necessarily a strong point for macbooks in terms of just everyday productivity use how quick and fast things feel to use it really is a big quality of life difference you've got to try it for yourself and of course also it is mini leds so if we jump into a video and this is actually a clip from gemini man but straight away you can see with that dolby vision logo just how inky and deep those blacks are i think this is maxed out brightness there we go and actually unlike the ipads i'm not seeing as much blooming around the screen which is great to see although there will always be some because it's not an oled display [Music] first thing i noticed watching this wasn't how bright it was or colorful but it's because the 16 by 10 aspect ratio of the screen means that that notch completely disappears even this with a bit of letterboxing if you had a full screen 16x9 video that notch still wouldn't get in the way because of the taller aspect going back to blooming just for a second and this is a really good example and you can see there's just a little bit of light bleed either side but i don't think it's even as bad as i say as we get on the iphone not the iphone the ipad pro 12.9 that is actually very very impressive for a mini led screen so it's brighter we've got that pro motion refresh we've got that mini led panel which obviously gives us much more contrast as well so it's a huge screen upgrade but let's get to the good bit let's talk about performance because i've actually got the top spec model here which costs like three and a half grand i think it is the apple m1 max with 64 gigs of unified memory and also a whopping four terabytes of storage i think it's like the one spec down from the top spec which has eight gigs so how fast is it well this is going to be an entire video by itself i'll compare the pro and the max and also versus the older models but i do want to just give you a couple of quick benchmarks so let's jump into my geekbench results and we'll start with the processor and if i bring in the old i9 this is uh also got 16 gigs of ram so this is the outgoing top spec macbook pro and that is quite a big difference 1000 versus 1700 6400 versus 12 700 so almost twice as fast multi-core as the previous top spec i9 macbook pro and also about 70 faster single core but what about uh opencl so this is 61 000 versus drumroll please 32 367 so that is again almost twice as fast in terms of the compute opencl test but i also ran tomb raider we've gone from average 48 fps at full hd plus high settings with the amd radeon pro 5500m uh to 90fps with the m1 max how often do we see a doubling of graphics performance it's pretty insane actually so 48 versus 90. if you want to play shadow of the tomb raider you're gonna want to get yourself a new m1 max macbook pro 16 for like three grand there must be a better way but let me bring in the macbook pro 13. so the current one with m1 to see how much faster which way around is it the m1 max is with 64 gigs of unified ram versus uh just a basic m1 with 16 gigs so 19 000 opencl versus 60 000 so three times more powerful with the top spec m1 max versus the basic m1 but in terms of the cpu we're actually getting the same single core score uh although about a 50 percent higher multi-core score so that's kind of interesting one of the big upgrades for me aside from the new m1 pro and max chips is the fact they also have a dedicated media engine and also a dedicated prores encoder and decoder but the media engine handles h.264 265 and all that good stuff so for me as someone who shoots 4k 10-bit 422 h.264 content uh which is a struggle even on my desktop pc with an rtx 1390 i still have to use proxies because the codec is just horrible it struggles so i'm really curious to see how this handles it and also how this does as well so this is my pixel 6 pro edit which i'm sure apple will appreciate me bringing up as i'm demonstrating these new apple laptops instant on that one a couple of seconds there that's crazy look at that [Music] so place your bets half an hour of 4k 10-bit footage how long do you think each one will take let's find out encoding we're at one percent already 23 minutes estimated versus 43 minutes estimated so this looks like it's going to be about twice as fast and not only that but already i can hear the fans were up on the intel i9 uh it's getting quite warm underneath let's try this one a tiny bit it's not cold but it's nowhere near as warm also both are running on battery here so that is a pretty big win for the new macbook so let's put this old one away because there's a couple more things i want to show you on the new macbook and actually if you are looking to use this as a real powerhouse workstation then one unique feature exclusive to the 16-inch version this is not on the 14 but we have this energy mode option and by default it's in automatic mode you can also put in low power to save battery or high power so that actually doesn't change the clock speeds or anything as far as i'm told but it unlocks some of the restrictions on the fans so you'll get that peak performance for longer now let's talk about charging because with your macbook pro 16 you get one of these it is a 140 watt fast charger and you also get this it's a magsafe three connector so on this charger you've got usb c one end which you plug in like so that is how you plug in a usbc port cable thing and magsafe on the other end it's quite a nice long cable as well also obviously being magsafe it's in the name if someone trips over your charger it will just pull out which is nice and easy and something we used to enjoy with all the macbooks now uh this is the only way to get the fastest 140 watt charging you can use a regular usb c cable with this uh but it will top out at about 97 watts via usbc now on the 14 inch version of the new macbook pro you get a 67 watt charger by default but you can pay an extra 20 quid or 20 dollars for a faster 97 watt charger to get fast charging bit complicated but we do now have fast charge options although the only way of fast charging the 16 is via magsafe or else it'll just be slower if you use usbc and then we also have this little guy the new 1080p facetime camera despite the notch no center stage or face id sadly but it is an improvement in the quality it does still look quite soft it's not that sharp i'm noticing even though the lighting is pretty good actually but the colors look accurate natural and there's not a lot of noise so in terms of laptop webcams it's probably one of the best outside of maybe a microsoft surface so there is an awful lot going on here the mini led pro motion screen the notch with the improved facetime camera the keyboard without the touch bar we've got the better speakers and also the extra ports although really they've only added two the sd and the hdmi a usb a would have been nice perhaps given how chunky this is now but certainly it's an improvement also of course the m1 pro and max chips so this is very much a first impressions it's going to take me a while to fully get to grips with this do all my tests and benchmarks and comparisons but i'm very much looking forward to it because i don't think there's been a laptop this exciting for quite a few years actually it's not just like another dell xps 15 or another macbook pro with a new intel chip that's 10 faster this is a proper revolutionary update but what do you reckon are you tempted to buy yourself one of these or do you think it's a little bit too expensive and overhyped let me know what you make of the new map books in the comments below if you've enjoyed the video then a little like and subscribe will be lovely and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
