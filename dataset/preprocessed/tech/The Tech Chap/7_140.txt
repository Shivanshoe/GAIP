if a tv and a monitor somehow had a baby i'm not quite sure the logistics of that but i think this would be it hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this is the new samsung m7 uh samsung sent this over for me to have a bit of a play with they are also very kindly sponsoring this video but as you guys know always my opinions are my own uh but i want to give you my thoughts on this and also just basically walk you through what is this smart tv albeit without the tuner and a traditional 4k 32-inch desktop monitor and it goes a step further because unlike a regular tv or monitor we also get built-in office 365 you can remote access your work computer if you've got a recent samsung phone you can use dex to have more of a desktop ui for your phone then there's wireless dual display which allows you to use the smart monitor as a second screen for your macbook or your windows laptop completely wirelessly and it also supports screen mirroring via airplay 2 on your iphone or by tapping your phone against the screen and all this is without needing a pc or a laptop attached and i think maybe the biggest surprise is that this costs just 400 pounds or 400 dollars which is suspiciously cheap uh given all the features you get for it i mean as i say it's a 32 inch 4k hdr 10 certified display i'm going to call it a display because monitor doesn't really do it justice and there's also even cheaper 1080p 27-inch and 32 models of this the m5 although i haven't tested those but i think 1080p at 32 inches would be a bit of a stretch so for me i think this 4k 32-inch m7 model is the way to go so this smart monitors kind of come at a good time because i think most of us have been stuck working from home for such a long time now but i think space in our homes and our well home offices has to be more flexible to maintain a healthy work-life balance and if you're stuck in front of a martyr all day which i think most of us are why shouldn't that be more flexible for both work and play now i must admit i was and still i'm a little bit skeptical about just how often i would actually need these features i mean i think the vast majority of us would probably already have a laptop or a pc hooked up to our display anyway and from that you can access well the internet and get all the streaming services and all the productivity features that way and also pretty much any recent monitor can be made smart just by adding a streaming stick like a roku amazon fire or chromecast and those also have streamlined tv style interfaces with all the smart apps you could eat but i suppose the point here is convenience and it's all neatly integrated into the screen without the cost or the first of setting up a separate streaming device and for most people who just need a nice big screen for a home office that's good for working and for streaming i think this could be a great choice now i get to all this smart streaming stuff in just a second but i want to focus on what i think is the more interesting aspect of this and that's the kind of work productivity features and a standout has to be the built-in office 365 support which allows you to access and work on documents from the cloud without a pc or laptop so there's obvious remote working advantages to this although i'm not quite sure how often you wouldn't be without your pc or laptop but if you are using the m7 by itself for working then trust me you'll need a bluetooth mouse and keyboard you've never experienced pain until you've tried excel with a tv remote but then again we're all getting used to the idea of working remotely sorry it also gets samsung's wireless deck support which lets you use your samsung phone to power a pc style desktop ui with compatible apps for a more office like experience again though a bluetooth mouse and keyboard is a must but you can use your phone as a giant touchpad and then there's screen mirroring via airplay 2 on iphone which is really easy to set up or if you're on android you can use a tap view feature which requires samsung smartthings app to be installed but you just simply tap your phone on the edge of the screen to set it up although sometimes i had to give it more of a whack to activate and actually the on-screen prompt even suggests a case if you're worried about damaging your phone which doesn't seem ideal wireless dual display basically lets you use the smart monitor as a second screen for your macbook or your windows 10 laptop connecting via airplay 2 or bluetooth respectively in both cases connection is really simple i didn't have any dropouts even when i took my laptop into the next room and not having to plug in a display cable is obviously more convenient and allows you to sit further away compared to a normal wired connection though the image was nowhere near as sharp and there was a little bit of lag as well though this isn't particularly noticeable outside of say gaming so while this wireless display is pretty nifty i think i'd stick to wired when you can and then there's remote access which lets you log into your work pc or mac from home and provided that machine is also set up for access it's a pretty cool idea if you're working remotely without your laptop or pc with you and you can even remote access a pc in another room if you want to as for the smart tv side of things well you've got pretty much every smart app you can imagine uh amazon netflix uh disney youtube we've even got iplayer and itv here which obviously is for the uk and as i say this is basically just been lifted off their uh most recent samsung tvs as well so it's incredibly intuitive to use and obviously you can use this from a lot further away than having to physically use the on-screen display with most monitors so if you've got this at the other end of the room or maybe you're a college student with this in your bedroom you can use this as your smart tv well everything really from a distance from the comfort of your own sofa or bed so aside from not actually having a tv tuner built in although i'm not quite sure how often you need that anymore everyone's using smart apps this is a pretty good 32-inch 4k tv as well plus you can use the mic button on the remote to use voice commands another advantage of this is the sound quality which i'd say is in line with regular tvs of this size it is lacking in bass and some richness a little bit but it's still better than pretty much any other monitor for the [Music] money so far so good then but i do have a couple of little niggling issues with it and i think one of the areas samsung has compromised on with this perhaps in order to get that lower price is unfortunately the screen quality itself the colors on this va panel aren't particularly vivid brightness peaks are just 250 nits which is below average even for a basic monitor and it's frankly rubbish considering it supports hdr10 and as i say color accuracy is only mediocre so it's not really the best choice for graphics professionals or video or photo editors who really need a high quality ips screen for the best results but i think a lot of that is kind of missing the point this is a big high resolution 4k affordable tv slash monitor which i think is going to be great for most people yes we're not getting professional levels of color and also the viewing angles aren't the best but it's not bad and for a 32 inch 4k display for 400 yeah i think this is actually incredible value for money also 32 inches is fast becoming my favorite monitor size maybe outside of ultrawides especially if they have thin bezels like this so they don't take up a ton of room on your desk and they also offer a lot of screen real estate so you can have multiple apps open side by side one caveat of samsung's do-it-all marketing claims for this monitor i think is when it comes to high refresh gaming because unfortunately this is limited to 60 hertz there's no high refresh rate here which is a bit of a shame but i think again we have to take into consideration that price um maybe it would have been nice if there was a 600 pound option with slightly better colors and a high refresh rate i would really like to have seen this because i think this well concept is a really good idea and i kind of wish there was a higher level as well for people that can afford it but yeah sadly we are stuck at 60 which again is absolutely fine for the vast majority of people but if you're a enthusiast gamer then maybe look elsewhere as for connectivity around the back we get two hdmi 2.0s and also on this 4k m7 model uh we get a usbc port which also supports displayport 1.4a if you plug in a compatible laptop or pc and this also allows the monitor to act as a usb hub it's a bit of a shame though that we're not getting any thunderbolt 3 support with this which would also mean that you could charge your laptop out of the same power cable that's uh while powering the monitor and also you can have high resolution daisy chaining there's a few advantages to thunderbolt 3 but it does up the price if you look for even 27 or 32 inch 4k thunderbolt 3 monitors then you're looking at at least 600 or 700 pounds again this is 400 432 inches plus you've got all these smart features also the stand for the smart monitor is another area i think they've chosen to save some money because while it's stable enough not to fall over there's very little flexibility to it it only tilts a little bit and it can't rotate or be used in portrait mode plus there's a fair bit of screen wobble so with all that said is it actually worth buying this samsung smart monitor this m7 mod well i think for the average user yeah i mean if you don't care that much about tip-top professional color accuracy and you can get over the slightly iffy viewing angles if you want a big 4k resolution display which can act as a monitor and also a tv and a little bit more with all the smart apps like office and wireless decks then i think for the price this is actually an incredible bit of kit so the next question then is if you are thinking about using this for its smart tv features why not just buy a tv well you could do and i've made some videos about that recently but then no tv really comes with a usbc port which also supports displayport 1.4 so in terms of the connectivity and also the response times and the modes this supports it works much better as a monitor than a lot of tvs especially at this price range this is a nice combination of small uh for a tv but big for a monitor that kind of nice crossover of 32 inches while having that 4k resolution a good range of connectivity reasonable image quality and so i think for the average user this is kind of like the best of both worlds of course for similar money you could go with say a quad hd so 1440p ips monitor which trades this resolution for better colors brightness and hdr performance and then maybe just plug in a separate streaming stick for the smart interface or of course just leave your laptop connected there's always that option so i think a lot of people maybe myself included are thinking that's really cool but i'm not sure why i would need it but if you do need it if you're watching this thinking that's perfect for my setup then well i'll leave a link in the description and i would highly recommend it but what do you reckon could you see a place for this in your setup and also would you use any of those smart productivity features like uh the built-in office 365 and wireless decks let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you want to see more from me then don't forget to hit that subscribe button below again a big thank you to samsung for sending this over and also sponsoring this video and i will see you next time right here on the tech chat
