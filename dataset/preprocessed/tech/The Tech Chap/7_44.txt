hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and it's been nine months since i made my first unboxing and review video on this guy the 77 inch lg g1 and since then i've played hundreds of hours of games probably watched thousands more tv shows and movies you can even see on my remote control if i put it right up to the camera some of these buttons have started to fade and i think with a point now where i've said to my wife oh look at those blacks and that contrast during a dark scene of a movie that now whenever she plays her og nintendo switch or we go to a movie theater she says it's good but it's not oled a big thank you to lg for sending this review sample over and also offering to sponsor this video but as you guys know with all my content all opinions are my own but do you know what the best thing about this tv is right now it's not the fact that it has the oled evo panel and ai gen 4 processor 4k it's not even the flush wall mount even though i've kind of ruined that by adding a phillips u gradient strip behind it the best bit about this tv is that it is now about 20 maybe 25 cheaper than it was when it came out back in april it was a whopping 4 800 quid now you can find it for a little under 4 grand the 65 inch was 3 000 now it's 2200 and so the thing is we've seen all the shiny new tvs unveiled at ces 2022 including the successor to this tv with the new g2 series with new processors and potentially even higher brightness but these won't come out until probably april and as with any new piece of tech you'll be paying top dollar at first so sometimes last year's model may end up being a better buy so it's cheaper now we've also had a whole bunch of software updates for example the game optimizer menu has had a full design overhaul since i made my first videos they've also added a few new streaming apps including geforce now for game streaming which was added in late november i have to say though i do have one criticism about this tv in fact any current lg tv and that is web os 6 this home screen menu which as you can see takes a few seconds to populate it is a good idea show all the recent and popular shows across different apps up front so you don't have to then go into each one to browse it's just a bit too slow i would love an option whereby we just get a smaller lower third menu like older web os versions it would be faster it would let you keep watching what's on in the background while you navigate if lg's watching then for me i would love a full screen option and a minimized option for this home screen what do you guys think also while this isn't something that's affected my g1 quite a few people have been reporting issues of the c1 and the g1s made in september and october not supporting htcp 2.3 correctly now my friend vincent to hdtv test made a great video about this and lg has rolled out updates over the last few weeks to fix it it is a software fix so it is good to see that we're getting continued support from lg but while there's always room for improvement and i have just noticed that sylvie the cat is looking at the birds on the tv i don't think there's a better tv on the market yes you can pay a lot more money for something like the 8k z1 series from lg but realistically it's maybe the c1 and the g1 that you're gonna be considering and actually i recently renovated my studio which was my garage and in there while i had been using a review sample of the sky glass tv i've definitely been spoiled by oled and i wanted to buy one for the new studio so i was looking at the sony a90j the samsung qn95a both absolutely fantastic tvs and on the samsung even though you have brightness advantages with that qled panel there's no dobby vision support i know it has hdr 10 plus but for me there's just so much dobby vision content that it's a bit of a deal breaker so after a lot of back and forth i actually ended up going with the lg c1 it shares almost all the same features as the g1 but it's a fair bit cheaper i felt the c1 was the right fit for the studio however if you're happy to pay a bit more the g1's oled evo technology does noticeably boost the brightness which is one of the areas oled can fall behind their q-led competition essentially it's the processor combined with the evo panel which actually uses different materials that lets it run more efficiently so then it can hit higher brightness levels without ramping up power consumption or increasing the risk of burning and in my tests it's between 10 and 20 brighter across the board not just peak brightness the other big advantage of the g1 the gallery design is of course that flush no gap wall mount and it does exactly what it says on the tin it also might mean that you can get away with a bigger size because if this was on my tv stand like a foot or two closer then yes i know it'll be bigger for me so maybe then you don't need the bigger size but because my living room our houses here in the uk aren't that big being able to wall mount this tv and even though i've got the gradient strip have it right up against the wall just means i can get away with a bigger size tv without the misses telling me off i'm just kidding she loves this tv if anything she wants a bigger one the g1 also comes with built-in far field microphones for hands-free voice control i haven't really found myself using it that much if i'm honest outside of maybe adjusting the volume or turning the tv off when i can't find the remote i think if i could pinch one feature from arrival it would be samsung's one connect box because even though we do have the four hdmi 2.1 ports here which is great rooting them around the back and then somehow hiding them as they come down unless you're willing to drill more holes in your wall and route them through the back that way i really do like samsung's solution of having all the inputs on a separate box you then just have one clear cable going to the tv although if you do have any other better options for hiding a bunch of cables here other than my painted piece of plasticy wood thing let me know in the comments speaking of ports as i say we've got four hdmis and they're all the latest 2.1 spec and this helps make it more future-proof and it's exactly what you want for hooking up your ps5 or your series x and one of these is also an e-arc hdmi which i've connected to my sonos arc lg do offer their own range of sound bars and actually some pretty tempting deals to go with it but i would recommend some kind of external soundbar or speaker system the inbuilt speakers are okay but for a tv that looks this good you want it to sound pretty good as well one question i do get asked a lot actually is what picture mode do i use and 95 percent of the time i use the isf expert bright mode occasionally switch it to the dark if i'm watching it at night and it's getting a bit too bright and that's about it everything else is handled automatically when you're playing games the auto low latency mode try saying that three times after a few drinks the alm will switch you to game optimizer which obviously has the fastest response times lowest input lag turns off all the back processing and that's what you want and also if you're playing hdr content it'll switch to an hdr or dobby vision preset as well so you don't have to worry about anything and also the filmmaker mode which a lot of people do love and it's supposed to show the movie as the director intended personally i find it just a bit too dark and also a bit sort of sepia tone so i don't tend to use it let's go back to games because in a separate video i did call this and i still maintain it's the best gaming tv you can buy it checks every box oled hdmi 2.1 120 fps g-sync vrr alm low response times and input lag they've also updated this handy game optimizer menu which shows you what your fps is and also if it's using g-sync or freesync you can even switch between game picture modes like fps which raises the shadows to help you see enemies it's worth mentioning that of course the lg c1 has all those gaming features as well and is a lot more affordable but the advantage of the g1 is it's a bit brighter which means games can look a bit more vibrant okay just a couple of quick tips and in general system and an additional settings you can turn off home promotion that actually hides sponsored advertisements i did that straight away you do also have the option to use the tv as a kind of iot hub for your smart home tech although i don't have a smart fridge or washing machine just a bunch of philips hue lights and to be honest i do find the interface a bit slow sometimes so it's not something i've really felt the need to use but this thing is jam-packed with features chromecast airplay 2 alexa and the google assistant you don't have to use any of these but they're nice to have so far so good but what about burn-in there's an entire menu dedicated to oled care with pixel cleaning screen move adjusting the brightness of static loops screen off timers even energy saving modes all reduce the risk now i can only speak from my experience but i've not had any problem with burning ever and that's even having used a 48 inch c1 or led as a desktop monitor so realistically as long as you don't abuse it turn off all those safety features and just have a static image on there 24 hours a day running you're not going to have any issues so it almost feels like we've reached peak tv the only ways this could maybe be improved is maybe if it was even brighter perhaps over a thousand nits if the menus were a little bit faster and more responsive and perhaps if 8k prices continue to fall so then becomes a bit more realistic to get 8k oled tv outside of the crazy expensive z1 series you do of course have 8k nano cells which are great but i still prefer oled so maybe that's something we could see in the future as well still while i would say the c1 offers the best value i think the g1 is a great option for the best image quality brightness and design for an oled tv and it is significantly cheaper than when it first launched so now is a great time to buy one if you enjoyed the video a like and subscribe would be lovely and if you've got any questions at all let me know in the comments thanks for watching and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
