hey guys i'm tunnel tech chap and this is a packed table asus rog sent over a bunch of their brand spanking new gaming laptops for 2022. these have just been unveiled at ces but i've been given a bit of a sneak a big thank you to asus for sponsoring this video although as always with my content all opinions on my own and i can't wait to show you these and give you a bit of a first look but no touching well not no touching but i'm not allowed to show gameplay i can't run any tests or benchmarks because these are pre-release non-final versions it very much is a first look so let's kick off with this it's the new rog flow z13 or z13 for my american friends and it's the world's most powerful gaming tablet it's kind of like a surface pro 8 but on excuse me it's kind of like a surface pro 8 but on steroids this is a proper gaming two in one we've got a detachable keyboard which comes with it it is not an optional extra but all the gubbins is inside this 1.1 kilogram tablet it's absolutely ridiculous what they've managed to squeeze in here we're talking up to an rtx 3050 ti the latest 12th gen intel cpus and that's not your usual low power u or new p series of chips we're talking full 45 watt h series processors in this guy so front and center is this 16 by 10 4k 60 or full hd 120 screen both options are 500 nits both with adaptive sync support and also both touch screens so i've got the 4k60 model here and which is right for you really depends on whether you're gonna primarily use this as a sort of work productivity tool or for you know gaming i think for me as i probably would use this for gaming i would go for hd120 you want that smoother refresh rate and we're getting a whole bunch of nice extras with this like dolby vision and dolby atmos support two cameras including this webcam and this rear eight megapixel camera we get wi-fi 6e 16 gigs of lp ddr5 ram a terabyte of pcie 4 storage proper vapor chamber super quiet cooling and it's all housed within this metal chassis but it's not just about the tablet the keyboard also gets a 1.7 mil of travel for the keys so it actually feels pretty good to type on obviously the touchpad isn't that big so i'd still use a separate mouse but it is rgb just a single zone but we are getting some nice backlighting so the idea is you've got your nice thin and light tablet which is pretty capable by itself and you can also connect up to the keyboard but then to really unlock the performance out of this you can buy the optional xg mobile dock which connects via this little proprietary port on the side and that can come with up to an rtx 3070 or 3080 so it's literally plug and play and then you're getting a proper desktop gaming pc experience it is all very rog cyberpunk style particularly on the back with cooling vents everywhere and actually we also have this really unique little window inside that lights up i'm not sure how often you'd actually notice it but it's a nice touch but for now obviously i'm very curious about how much this is going to cost it's not going to be cheap especially when you do pair it with that dock but there's nothing else quite like this on the market it is very cool so that is well that but let's move on and now i want to show you this guy the invisible laptop it's actually pretty light what was supposed to happen uh is we're supposed to send me the new rog zephyrus duo 16 but they couldn't get one in the country in time for this video unfortunately but asus did share some of their own very tasty footage of the laptop and this thing looks insane the thing is my biggest gripe with the current or well now previous zephyrus duo was that huge chin but now the 14.1 inch second screen the screenpad plus not only lifts up but it also now slides back and actually we have an almost seamless transition between the two screens so we're getting a pretty big design update with the new zephyrus duo 16 but we're also getting a spec bump with the latest flagship cpu and gpus a new dual spec mini led screen which i'll come back to in a second as well as faster ddr5 ram you can inspect this with up to 64 gigs there's also the new rog intelligent cooling liquid metal then there's wi-fi 6e hdmi 2.1 an ir camera with windows hello six speakers all the bells and whistles you could ask for actually one of the most interesting parts of the laptop is the screen so basically rog have introduced a new rog nebula display standard which basically guarantees a certain spec for their displays brightness response time whether it supports a mux switch and mux which means you can go between the integrated and the dedicated gpus if you want to save battery but uniquely the zephyrus i don't know why i'm pointing this way there's nothing here the zephyrus jr16 comes with not only a quad hd 165 hertz option but also a dual spec screen it's a 4k 120 screen like last year actually still one of the very few laptops that supports that but technically it's a 4k 240hz panel which we just haven't seen before and actually due to bandwidth and uh panel connector limitations you still can't get that full 4k 240 so what you can do is actually change it down to full hd and then you get 240hz so you can either use it like a workstation at 4k 120 just a pretty impressive workstation or switch it to full hd 240 and that is pretty cool i mean obviously in an ideal world we'd have 4k 240 but we're just not quite there yet so with all these upgrades and refinements this is probably the laptop i'm most excited for but just be prepared it's not going to be cheap okay next up we have this guy it's the new asus rg zephyrus g14 and the big news for 2022 is that we're finally getting a taller 16 by 10 aspect ratio honestly i think every laptop should be 16 by 10 we're also getting a spec bump as you would expect but actually interestingly this is going to be an all amd systems so amd cpu and gpu we get two screen options either 144 hertz full hd at 400 nits of brightness or 120 hertz quad hd at 500 nits but it's also not just about the specs because actually this is a whole lot more comfortable to use now they've doubled the size of the track pad you literally couldn't squeeze a bigger one in here and also they've actually just made the palm rest a bit more comfortable they've trimmed the bezels but also still found room for an ir webcam with windows hello support they've also added a micro sd card slot as well as wi-fi 6e vapor chamber cooling plus as you can see we have a full 180 degree hinge which you may be thinking well why is that useful some marketing reps will tell you oh so you can share your screen upside down and you can uh collaborate on projects i'm not actually sure who would do that but it does come in handy if you're using a laptop stand because often they're quite high angles so then you want to push your screen back a little bit more than most allow you to so that's actually quite useful but what truly makes this a next-gen laptop is of course the optional anime matrix on the back which now has 20 more leds and is brighter than before i know it's a little bit gimmicky but i think it's kind of fun all right so moving on and also well moving up the lineup this is the new orig strix scar 15. so this guy is aimed at your more high-end enthusiast esports gamer we're talking full hd 300 hertz screen there's no messing around here this is all about those fps's this is all about it's all about the best performance although we do get dolby vision and dolby atmos support which is a nice extra and also like all new rg models we're getting updated cpus and gpus as well as ddr5 ram pcie 4 memory wi-fi 6e thunderbolt 4 fast usb c power delivery charging and also that new super fancy grizzly conducting all liquid metal cooling the only thing missing let's see if you can tell is a webcam but then again it was never gonna be that good squeezing in a thin bezel like this and if you are going to be streaming then you'll want a dedicated camera anyway the top and side bezels are ridiculously thin although we do still have a fairly chunky chin but on the whole i really do like the design with this translucent portion of the chassis giving us a glimpse into what's going on under the hood the touchpad also doubles as a numpad which is handy and also these little armor caps are replaceable you get a few options in the box and you can even 3d print your own and of course we still get that go faster rgb strip underneath so as with all these laptops there's a whole bunch of different skus and models and specs you can go for this is the strict scar 50 and there's also it's bigger brother the strix car 17 and there's also the standard scar 15 and 17. but having said that one laptop which i think will sell a lot more actually is this guy the new asus tough gaming f15 there's also a bigger 17 inch model of this and we have very similar designs to the strix car just a little bit paired down as the tough range is all about being a bit more affordable while still giving you great performance okay so right off the bat the f in f15 stands for intel f for intel obviously whereas the a series the a15 can you guess a4 apple a15 that would be a weird one uh no a for amd but this tough range has really come a long way in the last few years we are still getting a plastic rather than a metal chassis and it misses out on some of the fancy extras like wi-fi 6e dolby vision and the ultra highest end specs but realistically this is all most of us need so inside we're getting the latest intel 12th gen cpus as well as the latest nvidia rtx 30 series gpus which actually now are up to 140 watt tgp so actually pretty beefy variants of the cards and despite being the more affordable option we are still getting a mux switch in here if you're using this for a bit of work on netflix and you can switch to the igpu and save a ton of battery and of course we're also getting ddr5 memory thunderbolt 4 pci 4 storage in fact we get two pci 4 ssd slots in here which means it's really easy to add a whole ton of storage now the screen comes in two flavors we have a full hd 300 hertz which i have here or a quad hd 165 hertz display screen monitor panel thing there's also a bunch of upgrades to the chassis in the design but they're a little bit more subtle for example the whole footprint is now 4.5 smaller thanks to thinner bezels so it's a bit more compact the speakers now support dolby atmos the touchpad is actually 26 bigger which is great to see full rgb keyboard and even more durable military standard for toughness and we also have improved cooling with four exhaust vents down below and on the inside we have new 84 blade arc flow fans if you do fancy something like this but in a slightly more portable form factor even more portable than this then that's where the new tough dash f15 also a15 series comes in we're talking 10 lighter 20 slimmer than this i'm doing lots of hand signals and gestures because unfortunately i don't have the model with me but crucially unlike last year's tough dash f-15 which came with the intel h35 series 4 core quad-core chip which was okay [Applause] please work the new tuff-dash f-15s come with 12th gen intel processors with up to 10 cores which is what you want so hopefully we'll see a bit less bottlenecking i think the touch to touch the tough dash f15 is actually now definitely worth considering so asus anarchy have about a billion new laptops coming out this is just a handful just a taste but hopefully gives you an idea of what's to come some of the improvements and as i say i will leave links to these and other laptops and well everything needs to know in the description below but
