[Music] doesn't even fit hey guys i'm tom with tech chap and apple just had a massive mac event a big mac event if you will where they unveiled the new m1 pro and m1 max chips which will be powering the brand new macbook pro 14 and 16. so the rumors were pretty spot-on but it really does seem like apple have actually listened to what we want they've brought back the magsafe they've got rid of the touch bar they've given us the more powerful m1 pro and m1 max chips we've got the mini led high refresh screen basically stolen from the ipad they've even added more ports including an hdmi full size sd card reader alongside thunderbolt 4 and that new magsafe 3 charger connector so it really feels like they've gone back to basics everything we used to know and love about macbooks but then supercharge them for 2021. as you would expect of course these are i watching the expensive laptops but for the enthusiasts and the professionals this is what we've been asking for no more gimmicks and touch bars no more limitation of ports where everyone has to bring adapters with them and if you forget it then you're screwed which i think we've all been there with uh macbooks the last few years so regardless of the three form ten times performance boost and whatever you know numbers they're throwing out with the new m1 chips it's actually the usability there's quality of life improvements with the mini-lady screen the ports lack of touch bar that really i think are gonna make these pretty much the best laptops you can buy if you can afford them okay so let's break this down a little bit let's see what the options are and some of the specs and maybe see if you are attempting to buy one of them which one you should go for so hopefully apple have laid out a bit of a comparison so you can quickly see the difference between the models although what i would recommend is if you click on compare and then actually select the models that you're interested in so if you put the pro 16 we've got the pro 14 and let's keep the pro 13 in as well which is 600 pounds cheaper than the entry level 14 inch so that's definitely still worth considering so straight away the two new models are bigger we've got a 14.2 and 16.2 inch screen respectively they both share the same display so it's not like the ipad 11 and 12.9 where only the bigger one gets the mini led they are the same so the resolution is a little bit different but to make sure they're just as sharp as each other surprisingly both the 14 and 16 can be specced with the m1 pro and the max i had kind of expected that the max might be limited to the big one but no you get both options on both which is great and so we're looking at up to 10 core cpus 32 core gpus now up to 64 gigs of unified memory which is essentially ram but as you can see that is a big step up over the 16 gigs uh which we maxed out with the 13 inch pro also up to eight terabytes of storage which apple didn't even mention in the conference but that's four times more than the previous model although it seems the only area the current macbook pro 13 does keep up is in terms of battery life but the compromise is you still have to deal with that touch bar so these new m1 pro and max chips are really interesting because they are just scaled up versions of the m1 it's still the same five nanometer architecture but it's significantly faster pretty much across the board and not only in terms of more cores and more performance but we're also now getting a dedicated media engine which is designed to be a much more efficient way of processing decoding and encoding video scrolling down to memory and as you can see we've got the three options here and actually the 64 gig is exclusive to the max although both models have the same storage options all the way up to that ridiculous 8 terabytes in terms of design we now of course have this notch and the much thinner bezels and also the touch bar is gone but we're looking at 1.6 and 2.1 kilograms respectively for the new laptops it's not exactly a headline feature but i must admit one of the big upgrades i'm really looking forward to using is this new facetime hd camera it's 1080p up from 720p before and along with the isp and the m1 pro and max chips video quality should be a lot better both new laptops also get a six speaker sound system which itself is a big upgrade over what was already probably the best sounding laptop you could get the previous mapper pro 16 with higher fidelity speakers and much more bass interestingly both the new 14 and the 16 have the exact same range of ports which is great uh you're not sort of limiting yourself by going for the smaller 14 but one area the pro 16 does stand out is with battery life which as you can see it does last quite a bit longer than the 14 inch with its huge 100 watt hour lithium polymer battery so that's the easy bit because when you then go to spec your shiny new macbook pro there's about a billion options and it can get a bit complicated let's start with a 14 inch which costs 1900 pounds or 2 000 and if we go into the advanced spec you can see we've got five different options for the processor which get progressively more unwatchingly expensive maxing out with the m1 max if we start with the m1 pro the base one we can still get 32 gigs of memory i reckon one terabyte is probably a better option and also if you want i thought this is quite interesting you can actually pay for the higher wattage power adapter so presumably slightly faster charging although if you do go for one of the maxes that's the power adapter you get by default so right now we are in a kind of wait-and-see place for how these different skews and spec combinations will compare to each other is it going to be worth going for the higher core cpus and gpus and sort of what's the best middle ground that's something that we're going to have to test and i'll be making videos on myself so stay tuned for that but right now they're all going to be ridiculously powerful so probably for most people i reckon that base m1 pro is probably gonna be good enough then i would pay the extra for the 32 gigs of memory and then probably a one terabyte ssd but then let's look at the 16 which starts at 2 400 pounds or two and a half thousand dollars and as you can see we actually have three skus for this right up front i should say that both new mapper pros come in the usual silver and space grey although i think for me i reckon space gray might be the one i go for so jumping into the bass 16-inch pro we actually only have three options this time one pro and two maxes and again if you want that 64 gigs then you do need to go for a max core and if we just max everything out because this is always fun it turns out the most expensive new macbook pro 16 is about 5 900 pounds or about 6 grand which is not as crazy expensive maybe as i expected given you have eight terabytes of very fast storage maybe just the one so to sum up we've got the two new macbook pros including that brand new 14 inch version uh we've got that slight redesign with the thinner bezels and the notch we've got that high refresh mini led screen the m1 pro ammo max better speakers better 1080p facetime camera the extra ports much better battery life and no touch bar so that's a pretty big upgrade but one thing's for sure we are now going to see a billion copycat laptops with notches in the next few months it's not a bad thing especially as it seems that the menu bar actually uses that space either side of the notch and if you're in dark mode you might not even see it very often so first impressions i am pretty blown away by how good these seem as i say we're gonna have to wait and see uh how the different chips compare i'm really curious to see how much faster it is than this outgoing intel macbook pro 16 because i reckon it's gonna be a lot faster and also a lot quieter and also a lot longer batteries so make sure you have hit that subscribe button because i'll be doing a ton of reviews and comparisons trust me but what do you reckon have you bought one already are you tempted or is it all just over the top and apple hype and really it's not that interesting let me know what you make of the new macbook pros in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat you
