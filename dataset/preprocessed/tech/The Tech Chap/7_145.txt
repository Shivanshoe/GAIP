hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is my biggest battery test ever i've got every single iphone 12 and also every galaxy s21 including both the snapdragon and the exynos models of the ultra plus the iphone 11 pro max and the note 20 ultra and the s20 ultra to keep things fair i'm matching the brightness to 150 nits across all the phones and if i bring up the information here you can see i've had to shorten some of the names because cramming in 11 phones into a video is a bit of a challenge but you can see all the battery sizes what chips they're running and also you can see every samsung is set to 120 hertz at full hd which is how they are out of the box this is the default setting and so i think how most people will be using it and after our first hour of youtube well on the left hand side the iphone 12 mini is in last place at 86 percent with the 11 pro max taking the lead with 96 remaining moving on to a bit of instagram and here we've got well it seems 11 supersafs which is uh a bit creepy actually but i'm gonna just be refreshing and using instagram babysitting these phones uh for an hour of social media as we go through this test keep an eye out for the two s21 ultras because i will be doing a full snapdragon versus exynos video as well but i am curious to see how they compare when it comes to battery life onto the first gaming test and this is armor mobile ops which is quite a demanding game and it does support up to 120 hertz which may have a small impact on the battery on the samsung phones but again this is how the phones are set out of the box and how i think most people will be using them and then following half an hour 4k video recording we're now three hours 30 into this test and in geekbench 5 you can see how all the phones stack up with the iphones generally coming out on top and the s20 ultra with the xbox 990 on the far right coming in last place what's really interesting to me is the size of the batteries actually if you look at the specs the iphones generally have much smaller batteries than the galaxy phones so without a doubt apple's bang for buck when it comes to battery or should i say bang for battery is much better than any other android phone [Music] five and a half hours in now and going to our second gaming test this time we've got company of heroes and you can see we've got a couple of phones in the dangerous orange territory pretty much everything else is in the yellow category except for the 11 pro max which still has over 50 of its battery but then after almost a fire of gaming at 6 hours 29 the 12 mini is out of the race which is not that surprising really since it has the smallest battery although it does also have the smaller screen so one down 10 to go but there's a few of them that aren't far behind if we go back to our video test and then about 25 minutes later the galaxy s20 ultra gives up which considering it has the joint biggest battery on test coming in second from last place pretty disappointing and i think a lot of that comes down to uh the inefficient pretty terrible exynos 990 chip that we've got inside here carrying on with our camera test but it's only five minutes later uh that the galaxy s21 also gives up so not far behind the s20 ultra but considering this has a much smaller 4 000 million power battery yet outlasted the s20 ultra i think goes somewhere to show just how much more efficient the new xnos 2100 chip is in here all right back to youtube for an hour just going through my reviews playlist you know trying to boost my views wherever possible but then at the seven hour 29 marks so actually a full hour after the iphone 12 mini we have the iphone 12 pro and this is actually been neck and neck with the standard 12 throughout so i think depending on your use this could go either way they have the same size battery but then just when i thought the iphone 12 would be next actually it's the note 20 ultra that gives up this is the snapdragon x65 model with a 4500mah battery and it gives up just a minute after the iphone 12 pro so there's not really much in it there at this point it feels like they're dropping like flies because just seven minutes later the iphone 12 gives up so just eight minutes after the 12 pro although in my experience they really are neck and neck generally six phones down five remaining and it's a bit of a close race between the ones in the middle but then if we take stock at the eight hour mark so this is pretty impressive for all of them actually but the s21 plus and the s21 ultra exynos are neck and neck for going next with the iphone 11 pro max on the far left still not quite in the dangerous red zone just over half an hour later though and it's time for the s21 plus which lasted over an hour and a half longer than the standard s21 so if battery life is important to you i think the jump to the plus model is definitely worth it switching back to our first gaming test and the s2 on ultra is on three percent uh but it does last another half an hour until it finally kicks the bucket at an impressive nine hours and four minutes leaving the snapdragon version with seven percent remaining and just one point down compared to the 12 pro max it actually goes on for another 22 minutes of this intensive gaming test before it finally runs out of juice at 9 hours 26. so it's not a night and day difference between the xnos and the snapdragon but unfortunately there is still a difference and you're getting a better battery with the snapdragon model which means it's now a two-horse race between the two iphone pro maxes and it's another half an hour until the pro max finally calls out a day at 9 hours and 51 so between all the latest models the 12 pro max wins but it's actually beaten by the iphone 11 pro max which does have a slightly bigger battery clocking in at a staggering 10 hours and 2 minutes but as you can see from my clock this was a very long video to make and i had to babysit them throughout because i wanted to make sure this was as fair and accurate as possible in fact i um well i'll be honest with you i ran this twice the entire previous day i did the exact same test but i had a few anomalies some brightness issues so i thought that's not good enough i want to do it all again but hopefully you guys found this helpful and i think my big takeaways were just how much of an improvement the s21 plus is over the standard s21 and actually similarly the iphone 12 and 12 pro coming from the mini and between the two s21 ultras with the different chips inside it is still a shame that we're seeing any difference at all because these should be the same phone but during the test we were seeing up to six or seven percentage points different between the two models but i think the award for the biggest disappointment goes to the s20 ultra with that size battery it should have done a lot better but i think that exynos chip is holding it back but make sure you are subscribed and stay tuned for my full snapdragon versus exynos video and if you've got any questions at all or feedback do let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and i'll catch you next time right here on the tech chat
