hey guys i'm tom of techchap and it's uh well two for one today i've got a couple of the latest acer swift three laptops we've got the standard swift three here and then it's friend the 3x which looks a bit more familiar looking but there's actually quite a big difference between them and it's kind of tricky to decide which is best the big news is that the swift 3 finally gets the screen that it deserves with a taller 3x2 aspect ratio which gives you a bit more screen space along with a higher quad hd resolution and also better color accuracy whereas the new swift 3x gets intel's very clever new ios xc max dedicated graphics which actually works in tandem with the regular integrated graphics to boost performance but the question is as the prices of these guys have been steadily going up for the past couple of years are they still worth buying also which is best between the two and is having more than one swift technically a flock now i really like the swift 3. you see it all the time in lists as one of the best mid-range thin and light all-rounder ultrabooks and for good reason the entry-level amd ryzen-based swift 3s are great value even if they don't get this snazzy new screen on these higher end versions but this new 2021 swift 3 and also the 3x with intel chips are more expensive than the amd and also the older intel versions starting from about 800 and 900 pounds respectively and it's about the same in dollars with a top spec 3x going for around 1100 so what do we get for the money well the swift 3 is as i say a good sort of do-it-all all-rounder ultra portable we get a lovely screen as i say this three by two aspect which i think i actually prefer even over a traditional 16 by nine and as you can see we're getting intel's little evo sticker here which basically guarantees a good level of performance and features whereas the 3x is a bit more of a traditional looking laptop with its 16x9 aspect ratio i would have liked to have seen maybe 16 by 10 here but it's a little bit more premium you could argue than this guy and also we are getting the faster xe max dedicated graphics but they're both 14 inches although you can also get the swift 3 in different sizes and they both come with intel's 11th gen tiger lake processors we're also getting an aluminium chassis on both which feels nice but it flexes enough in places to give it a slight plasticy feeling although we are getting a good range of connectivity options including dual usb 3.2 an hdmi wi-fi 6 and even an ultra fast thunderbolt 4 type c port i think the standout for the regular swift 3 though is that screen it's really good not quite pro level but for everyday work and even photo and video editing it's ideal it's bright we get decent color accuracy and contrast and having that three by two aspect ratio instead of the regular 16 by nine means we're getting an extra eighteen percent vertical screen space which for me at least makes this feel much less cramped to use although you do get fairly chunky black bars when watching video considering the price of these two though i kind of wish the bezels were flush with the screen the slightly protruding plastic bezel just makes it look a little bit cheaper and also as you can see the swift 3 has a glossy finish to the screen whereas the 3x is matte i actually thought they'd sent me the swift 5 because this color the material they're using just well the whole thing really looks eerily similar uh to the more expensive swift five but this is where things get a little bit strange because you'd think this would be the better laptop in almost every regard it's more expensive we get the faster graphics uh the slightly more premium design i think but we're actually getting a screen that's not as good as this it's not as bright it's not color accurate it's also full hd rather than quad hd so it's just kind of an old combination that makes me want bits of this one and bits of this one but with neither of them being really perfect so really the premium you're paying for this is because you're getting the faster graphics so it doesn't really make much of a difference well as you can see from this fancy new sticker we're getting the iris xz max inside here and if you hear the words dedicated gpu and then think that maybe this could be a nice gaming ultrabook then you might want to dial back your expectations a little bit because this isn't going to come close to a laptop with say a rtx 30 series mobile gpu so xe max is basically a second graphics chip uh that we're getting in here uh albeit with a higher clock speed over the integrated one and the really clever part is they actually work together the max chip and the standard xe chip can work together uh to boost performance assuming the app or the game has been updated to support it and all while keeping power consumption less than a regular graphics card not just that but the swift 3x also uses intel's deep link power sharing tech which allows the laptop to divert more power resources from the processor to the graphics and this also works the other way around if the system detects high processor load and lower graphics utilization and so altogether this can mean a worthwhile boost in games or say video transcoding converting a 4k mp4 video and handbrake was about eight percent faster than on the regular swift3 and all this is actually pretty fast anyway thanks to intel's quick sync hardware encoding and so actually i think the 3x encoding abilities makes it a pretty effective live streaming machine the problem is leveraging both xe graphics processors isn't automatic for all games it actually requires windows to keep an updated list of which programmers use the integrated or the discrete gpu although it can intelligently decide for itself plus you can force it to use the higher performance gpu for each program manually or add them via intel's graphics control center which also offers more graphical controls to tweak your experience but what about games because these two swifts actually have identical specs say for the xe max and the 3x so this should be a really good way of telling what kind of a difference the xz max chip makes and if we use hitman 3 as an example at 1080p with low settings which is the only way to make it reasonably playable i recorded a whopping 33 fps boost which made a huge difference to how smooth everything felt and then in shadow of the tomb raider i averaged 30 percent higher frame rates with the xe max in the 3x 3dmark time spy got a 16 improvement whereas i saw barely any boost in rainbow six siege even after setting it from automatic to performance gpu mode on either laptop though it hits around 60fps with high settings at 1080p which is pretty good exporting video in premiere pro wasn't any faster on the 3x unfortunately despite being so much quicker in handbrake so my guess is that the big boosts we saw in hitman and tomb raider are due to using both graphics processors while 3d marks more modest games are maybe down to the xc max's higher clock speeds but it is worth remembering that this is brand new tech and intel are working to expand compatibility so even if the programs you're using aren't getting a boost right now it may come in the future but what about battery life well in my standard youtube test with 50 brightness using the better battery saving mode interestingly both the swift 3 and 3x lasted the exact same time around 7 and a half hours which is pretty average and definitely not the 17 and a half hours mixed use battery life that asa claims as for the backlit keyboard both machines have very similar layouts including these irritating page up and down keys which i keep brushing every time i went anywhere near the arrow keys but typing feels good on both although there is a bit more key travel and feedback on the swift 3. both precision touch pads worked well as well although the swift 3 also gets the 3x2 treatment for its touch pad which makes it a little bit bigger and i think easier to use however on both machines sound quality was pretty weak to be honest vocals and music sounded tinny and the bass was well almost non-existent as you can see though the 720p webcam at the top is in a decent place but uh the quality isn't fantastic really it's quite noisy the colors are a little bit well bit too saturated they look very red so it's not the best webcam in the world but it's fine it's passable so with all that said are they actually good value well i'm not so sure anymore because while the materials the design the screens all suit laptops in sort of the seven maybe 800 pound region i must admit by the time you expect a slightly higher end version of this they do start to look and feel a little bit cheap considering how much they cost and when you consider the top end 3x has the same pretty average 1080p screen as uh the base swift 3 which costs about half the price from this 1100 or pound asking price it's a little hard to swallow and you could get a slightly better spec swift 5 for similar money or if you don't mind going to a mac i think for most people the m1 powered macbook air would just be a better buy although of course you are losing out on the xe max graphics and if you do want to do a bit of light to moderate gaming on an ultra portable laptop then this is still a good option because of course mac doesn't have the same game library but i can't help thinking that the swift 3 has maybe just lost its edge a little bit when it comes to value for money but if it is gaming you want then you don't actually really have to pay that much more anyway in fact i've just been testing the new asus tuff dash f15 uh which starts at 999 and comes with an rtx 3060 and intel's new h35 chip [Applause] please work fair enough that's not exactly the same kind of laptop but maybe it puts the swift's price into perspective a little bit but between the two i think i would probably go with the standard swift three because well not only is it cheaper but i also prefer the three by two aspect ratio and also we're getting a much nicer screen which actually makes quite a big difference i found and light gaming is still possible on the regular iris xc graphics so overall i think they're both good laptops and i think personally i would probably go with the swift 3 if i were to buy one myself but what about you which one would you go for between these two or well known the above let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you did enjoy
