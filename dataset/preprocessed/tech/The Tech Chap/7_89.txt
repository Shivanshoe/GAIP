hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this is the new msi creator z16 or well z16 for everyone outside the uk and it feels a little bit like msi made this just for me so msi sent me one of the very first models of the z16 in the uk and together with nvidia are very kindly sponsoring this video but as always all opinions are 100 my own the good and the bad so the z16 is essentially a crossover not like one of these which no one likes this is the good kind it's kind of like a gaming laptop meets a premium workstation which is exactly what i want as a creator i know i hate that word as well but it's true i want the performance of a gaming laptop but also with a high quality screen good range of connectivity decent battery life all those extra sort of bells and whistles and also in a subtle but premium styling that's also reasonably portable and this takes pretty much all those boxes i should say though that as you can see i'm actually running windows 11 on this although out of the box it ships with windows 10 which is where i did all my testing for this but because i've actually switched to it as my main laptop i've upgraded to the public beta of windows 11 just because i quite like using it so that's what i've got going on right here so let me give you the walkthrough and for gamers we have an rtx 3060 in here that's a 65 watt tgp variant as well as the latest 11th gen intel i9 processor plus a 120 hertz refresh screen per key rgb keyboard and also impressively good cooling which maintain performance throughout plus you can upgrade the ram and storage yourself if you want to take it to the next level but then for us creators professionals we have this absolutely gorgeous screen which msi are calling their true pixel display it's nothing fancy it's no oled or mini led it's just an led lcd but it is a top notch screen and we're getting a quad hd plus resolution so that's 2560 by 1600 which makes this a 16 by 10 aspect ratio they're calling it the what's like golden ratio 16 by 10 the marketing suggests things like fibonaccis sequence and renaissance art marketing waffle aside this is i think the best aspect ratio although feel free to disagree do you prefer 3x2 or your regular 16x9 let me know which you think is the best in the comments and so it's a terrific screen and also a touchscreen which may be helpful for doing some electronic signatures or if you want to pair this with a stylus or a pen then you can get some proper doodling action going on it's also impressively color accurate measuring 100 of the srgb and 99 of the dci p3 gamuts so this is ideal for video editors however you can't escape just how reflective this is which is fine if you've got a nice blacked out background as this lady's uh staring you down but as soon as you bring it into any cal lighting or even put your own face in front of it in a normal environment it gets a bit distracting this is very very glossy which does help the colors pop a bit more it feels a bit more vibrant more contrasty i don't know i'm kind of on the fence do you prefer matte or glossy i think when it comes to gaming matt is the way forward but then the glossies can nice for you know creative workloads it's a balance i'm not sure what i was really surprised by though is the speakers they are very very good on this genuinely punchy with a surprisingly wide sound stage and then inside powering everything we have a big 90 watt hour battery so we're looking at about six hours of light use or about two if you're editing a 4k video in premiere pro on high performance mode we also get a pretty solid range of ports including two thunderbolt 4 type cs and a couple of type a's as well the latest 3.2 gen 2. also a micro sd card reader which is fine i'd rather have a full size sd if possible and also a headphone and mic jack and it's all in a chassis that's just 2.2 kilograms which isn't bad at all for a 16 inch laptop because for context the slightly larger xps 17 is 200 grams heavier than this and the razer blade 17 is half a kilogram heavier than this yes they're a little bit bigger but in its category in its class this is one of the lightest uh performance laptops you can get so you will feel it in your backpack but it is definitely a good travel companion as well so we're getting an all-aluminium chassis this is in uh luna grey and we also have this msi dragon logo laser etched into the lid and as you can see there's this big exhaust fan at the top of the keyboard it's not the speaker grille they're downward firing speakers at the front but i do have a couple of niggles uh for example the bezels are quite chunky especially this chin at the bottom so next to something like the xps 17 it doesn't look quite as futuristic also why do we have a separate fingerprint here couldn't they build it maybe into the power button like we see on some models and also as we are down here the trackpad is fine it's microsoft precision so it's nice and responsive but i do feel like maybe they could have made it a bit bigger utilize this space a bit more and also it presses in quite a long way particularly on this lower right it's not quite even and so you can actually get your finger under the lip of the body a little bit so not my favorite but it's certainly functional you know there's nothing to the side of the keyboard here perhaps they could have squeezed in a numpad that would have been nice but it is a classy laptop and it would look just as good at the office uh maybe without the rainbow rgb keys though or at home in your gaming setup so the z16 is an nvidia studio certified laptop which means msi have worked with nvidia to pick the best components and test it with the broadest range of creative apps so whether you spend your life in the adobe suite like me or you're developing say in the unreal engine or rendering in 3ds max it's all been tested and nvidia have certified the z16 and of course having an rtx 3000 series card the 3016 here we have all the gaming benefits of ray tracing dlss ai upscaling nvidia reflex which reduces latency and also nvidia broadcast improving the quality of your streams whether you're on zoom microsoft teams twitch and it's handy for blurring or switching backgrounds and reducing ambient noise so obviously this isn't the only crossover creator laptop on the market most of the big brands have something like this but as far as i know this is the only laptop that has a 16 by 10 high refresh display on a create a laptop like this so that does make it stand out as does the price actually which i'll come back to at the end it is very expensive but it's either on par or actually a little bit cheaper than its rivals but i've made you wait long enough let's talk about performance and the z16 comes in two specs they both have the 360 but then either an i7 with a full hd plus screen or an i9 and quad hd plus screen and i've got the higher end model here although only with 16 gigs of ram but it can be specced with 32 or as i say you can upgrade it yourself and while so far i've been waffling on about how you can use a gaming laptop's performance for everything else this is still a capable gaming laptop at full hd with high settings we're getting triple digits in all of my games on test well except for cyberpunk but that's still a decent 51. now of course nvidia's dlss technology helps out here in games that support it and that's just one of the benefits of having an rtx card in here and overall the 360 is a properly solid gaming card at 1080p and we're near enough maxing out that 120 hertz refresh in these aaa games at high settings but then at the same time this 8 core i9 and 3060 combo gives me a smooth 4k editing timeline in premiere pro i mostly still use proxies because i shoot 10 bit 422 but scrubbing through footage and rendering is nice and fast as you'd expect and thanks to the dedicated nvenk encoder on the gpu a 10 minute 4k project takes me about 8 minutes to render using the 3060 compared to a whopping 52 minutes using only the cpu and that's the power of rtx gpu acceleration plus the ai smarts of the card speeds up features like auto reframe and scene detection in premiere pro or say speed warp and davinci resolve so for my workflows in premiere pro and lightroom and a bit of photoshop and also a little bit of gaming maybe in the evening this does the job so if you do pick one of these up and you jump into the geforce experience uh you will see that by default we have nvidia's studio drivers downloaded and these are slightly better optimized for a wider range of apps or if you want the absolute latest uh game drivers then you can still switch to the game-ready drivers now you might also be able to see that we have this whisper mode which is 2.0 now because we've got the 3000 series cards uh not every rtx laptop has that it's up to the manufacturer whether they include it and we do get it with this so you can turn that on select different acoustic profiles and that will limit well the sound coming out of it but one of the best things about this which i found out in my testing is that it doesn't get very loud i've never actually needed to use whisper mode because even under load you can hear the fans but it's reasonably quiet actually so it's doing a really good job the only downside really is it gets quite toasty at the top here so uh this is a fan exhaust not the speakers which are actually uh downward firing at the front this gets quite warm i measured sort of mid high 50 degrees celsius so keep your hands away from that although i have found when i was doing some touch screen stuff and my palm rested there it was a bit uncomfortable generally though it's not been a problem the keyboard and the touchpad itself never got uncomfortably warm uh but yeah just stay clear of this area now the webcam isn't amazing i've seen better i've seen worse uh it is on the top bezel so it's in a good location i think it sounds okay a little bit soft a little bit noisy uh of course you can use nvidia broadcast uh to sharpen it up and remove the background this is just being shot with the camera app uh for some raw footage from the webcam it's okay does the job that's about it so that is the z16 and i know what you're thinking great stuff how much well it starts from about 900 pounds and goes up to 2600 but honestly that bass spec is probably the best choice and of course you can always upgrade the ram and ssd yourself later if you want to and if you do fancy checking this out for yourself i will leave links in the description below i'm using this now as my main laptop at least until msi uh takes it away from me because it's just a review sample but i've had a really good time with this it's not perfect i think if they maybe trim the bezels sort of sorted out that trackpad a little bit and also maybe offered a 30 70 perhaps with a 4k screen that could be nice but beyond that there isn't really much to criticize and i think msi's done a really good job with this uh so hopefully you enjoy the video let me know what you make of this in the comments and also let's say you did have two and a half or three grand to spend on a laptop right now what would you buy let me know thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech jam
