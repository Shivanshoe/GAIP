hey guys I'm Tom a tech chap and I'm actually pretty excited about this video because when Nvidia first launched their D LSS AI upscaling technology with our TX cars last year I thought it had a lot of potential but it turned out that while yes it did boost frame rates particularly when using ray-tracing it could offer make graphics look a little blurry and low res and they will just kind of smooth everything out too much so now entered ELSS 2.0 which and video are promising offers similar increases in frame rates which can be pretty massive ones in some cases but this time it shouldn't compromise image quality sounds great but is it too good to be true well I ran a whole bunch of tests in a variety of DL SS to enabled games and to tell you the truth I think in videos cracked in so I've actually teamed up with Nvidia for this video they are very kindly sponsoring it but I I'm not doing very well back there I should say that all my tests are my own these are impartial results a hundred percent and all my conclusions are my own they just wanted me to basically cover this topic because they're so proud of it but before we dive into the numbers a bit of background on DL SS and what exactly it is well it stands for deep learning super sampling and it uses dynamic AI and a whole lot of deep learning thanks to NVIDIA supercomputers to take a low res image and then intelligently build it up to look like a native high res ttp 1440p or 4k image and the upshot is this then boosts frame racing games in some cases more than doubling it now to be honest when I first tried the LSS in battlefield 5 last year it kind of looked a bit smudgy and a lot of the background detail was missing DLS s also needed to be trained on each game individually which was pretty time-consuming and costly but over the last year DSS has been learning and improving and now Nvidia have completely reworked it for DSS 2.0 this time it's faster image quality is clearly much better and now we can train itself on general game content so it doesn't actually have to be pre trained on a per game basis so we should see rolled out with a lot more titles like the upcoming cyberpunk 2077 and minecraft with arti eggs so essentially if you have a desktop PC or a laptop with a Nvidia r-tx card or even a RT x max cue card and laptop and then you play one of supported games in the game's graphic settings you'll be presented with three options performance balanced and quality so if you're playing at ATP with DL s s set to performance or quality then the game is actually running at 5:40 p or 720 p respectively and then intelligently up scaling back up to 1080 now I must admit I always assumed that DL SS s dl SS SS d 2 s is d r SS now I must admit that I always thought DL SS went hand-in-hand with ray-tracing RT and that you always had to have R T to have DL SS but that's not the case and actually Dale says one and especially to can offer significant performance boosts even without rate racing but anyway what does this all mean for gaming because it's all well and good if you've got a 20 80 super or 20 80 TI and you've got more frame zucchini for breakfast but what about something more affordable like a RT X 2016 this is the cheapest way to get DL SS to and I want to know if it gets meaningful boost to frame rates and how much better is image quality this time around so for each test I've kept graphical settings the same and simply switch between DL SS or standard taa anti-aliasing as available and in the interest of keeping this video to a sensible length and not boring you all to death I'm going to concentrate on T Ellis's quality and performance settings so I want to start with control because actually I was able to test the LSS one before the patch updated it to DL SS 2 so we can actually use control as a control to see what the performance and visual difference is between the old and new versions of DL SS it's a good-looking game and ray-tracing definitely makes it worthwhile difference here but in my experience they almost halves the frame rate now the original deal says definitely boost if frame rates but it introduced a lot of artifacting and seemed to smear and blow everything particularly backgrounds and around edges now first impressions of DL SS 2 other things are much better the image is a lot clearer and the blur has been minimized so for example at native to ATP this chain-link fence looks a little ragged but it's obvious what it is when I switch to DL says one that is higher setting the frame rate jumps from 43 to 77 fps but the fence is well kind of gone things are obviously a lawless to find them you've got noisy artifacts on top of that move to DL SS 2 though and everything is much clearer compared to the native we've actually gained detail particularly on the fence and the handrails and we're still up at 77 fps from the native 43 switching to TLS s twos performance mode makes things look a little bit too noisy with some distracting aliasing around the edges if we zoom in on this logo at native 20 we can see it's kind of noisy and a little bit with DL says one it gets even blurrier although again the frame rate jumps massively from 38 to 66 fps by switching to DL SS 2 on quality mode and everything is so much clearer although it can look a little bit over sharpen sometimes and the frame rate is up to 72 FPS compared to 38 without DL SS 2 moving to this office scene and we can see just how much detail is present with DL SS - especially the binders the desks and a notice board on the wall finally if we look at the chart we can see that the overall frame rates are pretty similar between TL SS 1 & 2 at both ttp and footing full EP and it was the same story with ray tracing turned off similar image quality and around the same booster performance all right next up Wolfenstein Youngblood now this is already a great performing game even with ray tracing which I definitely recommend using as adds much more realistic surface reflections now ray-traced native 1440p with ultra settings average 57 FPS across both benchmark scenes but then with DSS set to quality we saw this jump up to 83 that's a 40% improvement and to my eye pretty much the same image quality at 1080p with ray tracing and ELSS in quality mode we go from 94 to 121 FPS on average and switching to performance mode takes it up to 137 which is a 45 percent boost and close to maxing out a 134 host monitor even with ray tracing on as for image quality well zoomed out at ATP things look pretty similar but if we zoom in is clear the DSS offers a little bit more detail especially on the pipes in the background with performance mode again being a bit noisier moving on to deliver is the moon and retracing adds things like real-time reflections here especially to surfaces like windows which looks great but again it has the frame rate so does DSS to help well at ATP with ray tracing and ELSS set to quality we see a 70% uplift in frame rate and selecting performance takes up to another level two and a half times the native frame rate and the image quality is pretty similar as well the gloves look maybe a smidgen sharper with the LSS but it's close as for backgrounds find details like Tex definitely look more legible with the LSS especially on quality mode turn on TLS without weight racing and again things look very similar at 1080p quality mode boost frame rates by 29% and performance by 47% jump up to 1440 and then quilting performance modes give you 32 and 61 percent boost respectively next up is MechWarrior 5 mercenaries which actually offers TLS s2 but without retracing now compared to native 1440p I got around 41% higher frame rates using TLS as performance mode however TTP results weren't as exciting with only a 7 percent increases in performance and about the same as native raised with quality mode native 1440p and both TLS has two modes look well pretty similar actually here and lastly image quality in this low life final shot looks pretty similar as well but if we zoom in we can see how deals has changes the particle effects from the welder making the sparks much more dramatic looking but here we can see some slight artifacting from TLS trying to interpolate between pixels so far then all my tests have been running using the r-tx 2060 but what if you were to say used an RDX 20 ATT I cranked up all the settings and then turn on TLS to in control at 1440p with ray-tracing and high settings the 20 TTI averaged 44 FPS which shows just how demanding this game can be but turn on t else has quality mode and jumps up to 74 FPS back to Wolfenstein again at 4040 with ultra settings and RT and we're looking at 110 FPS but with TLS as quality this jumps up to 135 while performance hits 148 that's a lot for a maxed out arty game deliverers the moon is surprisingly taxing on the ti on max settings with RT at 1440p in averaged 46 FPS fortunately Dell says quality and performance brings it up to a much smoother 73 and 100 FPS respectively just think about a 46 to a hundred frames per second and finally in MechWarrior 5 again a 14 Phillippi max settings but no RT where a 115 FPS but with TLS has enabled this goes to 120 or 133 for the quality performance settings still pretty worthwhile games okay so that was a lot to take in so I appreciate you bearing with me and also listening to me say DL SS about million times and to be honest I didn't really know what to expect when going into this test but I have to say just looking at the results it's seriously impressive stuff and I found that DL SS 2 in quality mode and when playing a 1440p broad the biggest benefits so I think at the very least it's an other option for gamers like me and you to get basically free performance out of the highway we already have in this crazy time we can't all go out and spend tons and tons of money on the highest and kit you want to get the most out of what you already have and so if you do have an RTS card in your desktop or your laptop and then you're playing again the supports that I definitely recommend turning deals as two on down sides well to my eye I think sometimes it can over sharpen the images which can then sometimes like a little bit noisier particularly with the performance mode but that's pretty much it so just like with ray tracing in video we'll continue to add DSS support to more and more games over time and as I say I'll put a full list in the description below so hopefully you found this video useful and I'd love to know what you make of DL SS and also ray tracing in the comments below do you think Nvidia have made enough progress you think it's worthwhile now I'd love to hear your thoughts thank you so much for watching guys and if you do want to see more from me if you're not sick of my face my voice just yet and have them hit that subscribe button down below and also give me a thumbs up if you enjoy the
