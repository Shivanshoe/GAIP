this is the new redmi note 10 pro from xiaomi and while we are only a few months into the year so far at least i think this is the best budget phone you can buy hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this will save you back just 279 when it launches in early april and for that you're getting a 120 hertz amoled screen a snapdragon 732g a big 5020 milliamp hour battery quad camera setup with a 108 megapixel main lens dual sim micro sd dual speakers even a headphone jack and an ir blaster so this is pretty jam packed with what you'd need but of course being a well mid-range phone we are missing a few bells and whistles that you get from higher end flagships such as there's no 5g or wi-fi six it has gorilla glass 5 rather than the latest victus fairly basic ip53 splash resistance although that's better than nothing and the snapdragon 732 g while more than capable is of course still a mid-range chip so yeah there's always room for improvement but keeping that price tag of 270 pounds in mind i don't think there's a better phone out there for that kind of money now it does kind of feel like xiaomi releases a new phone every five minutes it's kind of hard to keep up to be honest but the redmi note series has always been a highlight and now we have the note 10 pro this is actually quite a big upgrade over last year's note 9 pro lcd becomes amoled 60 hertz becomes 120 the snapdragon 720 g is now the 732 g and the 64 megapixel is now 108 and considering it's launching at the same price that's not bad at all and i also think it looks a lot more expensive than other phones at this price point for example the poco x3 is one of its closest rivals but i much prefer this more subtle styling so i do like the look of it if i can get that to focus in but firstly you can see it does pick up the odd smudge or fingerprint and also this onyx gray color well it's not the most exciting really i think i'd rather go for the glacier blue or the gradient bronze colors of this so on the front we're getting gorilla glass 5 with a plastic frame on the outside and a curved glass back on the right side we're getting a fingerprint reader built into the power button you also have the option for face unlocking but i still find this much more reliable than say a cheap optical in screen reader and it's just one press to power and unlock it as the youtuber cliche goes it does feel good in the hands but one of the highlights of the note 10 pro is this 6.67 inch screen it is full hd plus but unlike the note 9 pro it's 120 hertz and also amoled so we're getting much richer and inkier colors thanks to the higher contrast ratios along with much better viewing angles and actually diving deeper it turns out we're getting the same samsung made amoled panel that's used on the s21 and the xiaomi mi 11. so this is a very good screen i must admit though when i first unboxed and started testing this i didn't have the spec sheet with me so it was a pleasant surprise when i went exploring in the display settings to see this 120 hertz option although it doesn't appear we're getting any kind of adaptive or auto mode with the refresh rate so unlike higher end phones that can dynamically adjust the refresh rate to save battery here you pick 60 or 120. it makes such a big difference though especially combined with the 240hz touch sampling so whether you're gaming or just swiping around the menus and home screens because i know miui isn't everyone's favorite android skin but at 120 hertz it's much smoother and more responsive i really don't mind it and there's tons of options for customization but i think my only criticism would be that we're still getting lots of bloatware and pre-installed apps so there's actually three versions of this the entry level spec gets you six gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage uh the mid tier one the one that i've got here uh also has 60 gigs of ram but 128 storage and then there's a top spec one which gets you eight gigs of ram but also 128 storage but don't forget we do have that micro sd card support so you can expand the storage on any of them so you could probably get away with going for the cheapest one now just a quick mention of the battery and it's actually the same 5020 million power battery as the note 9 pro albeit with air versus slightly faster 33 watt charging now i've only had a few days with the note 10 pro so i will need a bit more time to fully test the battery but so far i'm finding i have about 30 of my battery left by 11 pm of course the jump up to 120 hertz will have an impact on battery in the order of around 10 but then again we are getting a more efficient amoled screen along with a full hd resolution and a good size battery so the note 10 pro will easily get you through a full day and then some okay camera time and the 2020 trend of just chucking in macro and depth sensors to pad out the marketing so we can say it's got a quad camera set up is still going on but to my surprise they're actually pretty good i don't usually start off camera tests playing with a macro lens because well they're usually terrible but these 5 megapixel f 2.4 photos from the so called telemacro lens are actually surprisingly good plus in these couple of portrait mode shots you can see the edge detection and also that natural looking bokeh behind me it all looks quite good and it's presumably helped by that depth sensor a good start then but i think a proper telephoto lens would have been nice to see we're only getting a digital zoom here but the main and the ultra wide lenses are the most important and so far i like what i'm seeing so the main lens 108 megapixels although the nine into one pixel binning means we're actually ending up with 12 megapixel photos unless you switch to the full high resolution mode and importantly not only is this a higher resolution than the note 9 pro but we're also getting a new and crucially bigger sensor it's still not quite as good as the sensor used in the flagship mi 11 or upcoming mi 11 pro but that's to be expected given the price and with the f1 9 aperture photos are bright we're getting good dynamic range and close-up shots offer a really nice depth of field swiping over to the more tab and you'll see a whole bunch of different modes including night mode which i'd actually edit and put on the main carousel for quicker access xiaomi are calling it night mode 2.0 which uses and i quote advanced raw multi-frame algorithms so essentially multiple raw photos combined into one to give us brighter and sharper low light shots around the front we're getting a 16 megapixel camera although again that's pixel bin down to four megapixels with an f 2.45 aperture but photos portraits and even night mode selfies on the note 10 pro overall quality is very impressive cute or creepy what do you think so i'm shooting this at 4k30 i'm also using the microphones to well record my voice uh this is a little behind the scenes of my uh surprisingly small living room and uh desk office setup i try to cram in all my filming in this little space uh but this is being shot at 4k 30 and if i start walking you can really feel that jutter it's not the smoothest at 4k although in good light quality is actually really nice and also uh the focusing is pretty fast let's go from uh the flower to that uh british dog thing in the background whatever that is so let's switch to 1080p to see if the stabilization is any better okay same again now shooting at 1080p and even just looking at the screen as i'm filming this it looks a whole lot smoother than the 4k so i think most of the time you're probably going to want to stick with 1080p if you are walking or moving around so uh let's switch things around and now we're shooting this from the front facing selfie camera it tops out at 1080p there's no 4k selfie video option unfortunately let's go over to my desk where i'm transferring some files for actually editing this video i've just shot some b-roll uh i'm using premiere pro this is my desk setup which is a well crazy mess behind the scenes at the moment but yeah what do you think of the video also the microphones uh let me know in the comments below back to work so xiaomi's camera tech has well come a long way in the last couple of years of course this still won't compete with your galaxy s21s or your iphone 12s but for the price it's very impressive and the other nice thing is that not only are we getting a better camera than before but actually viewing your photos and videos back on this amoled screen is an even better experience downsides well phones like the poco x3 are very similar and actually about 50 pounds cheaper although you are missing out on that amoled screen also while the 732g chip is slightly faster than last year it's not a big upgrade it still doesn't support 5g so it would have been good to see something like the newer 750g which came out late last year and it's also a shame we don't have a proper telephoto camera lens but i think other than that there's not a whole lot to complain about so i think you can probably tell by now that yeah i really like this phone it does remain to be seen how the competition will stack up in this 300 price range because this is actually one of the first good budget phones to come out in 2021 so far but with some really significant upgrades over last year's model a fantastic screen a solid camera and also the same competitive price this is the budget phone to beat so far but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy the note 10 pro or are you maybe going to hold out and see what other mid-range and affordable phones are coming out let me know what you think in the comments below and if you do want to check this out i will leave links in
