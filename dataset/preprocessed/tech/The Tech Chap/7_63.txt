[Music] hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and it feels like i've got my own little genius bar going on here because i'm surrounded by macbook pros because i want to find out if there's really that much difference between the m1 the m1 pro and the m1 max and so to find out hopefully i've got the macbook pro 13. this is the current one you can buy although it's about a year old the standard m1 along with 16 gigs of ram or apple's unified memory and then we've got this guy which is the entry level spec macbook pro 16 with the m1 pro and also 16 gigs of unified memory and then finally we have the money no object basically pretty much top spec macbook pro 16 m1 max the very top skew and also 64 gigs of unified memory and so your first thought is tom that's not fair because these have 16 gigs and that's 64. and you're right this would be a little bit fairer if this also has 16 gigs of ram but well these are the three laptops i have to test also when you do go for the m1 max regardless of what amount of ram the bandwidth is double so there's always gonna be a difference there and also probably if you are to go with a max then most likely you'll upgrade to at least 32 gigs of ram anyway so yes i appreciate it's not completely laboratory scientific but hopefully this will give you an idea and an impression of the difference in performance between the three and also in terms of the inch which i don't have here at the moment you can get the 14 inch in both the pro and the mac specs but there are three small differences firstly the base 14 inch macbook pro only comes with a 8 core cpu and a 14 core gpu whereas the base 16 comes with a 10 core cpu and 16 core gpu so like for like the base 16 inch is a little bit faster also the size difference means we have this extra surface area and probably a little bit more thermal headroom with the bigger models although that's gonna be harder to quantify but one specific difference with just this one which is the m1 max macbook pro 16 is we have this energy mode option in the battery this is the only model that comes with this and you can switch between low automatic which is on by default or high power mode which doesn't change the clock speeds or anything but it unlocks some of the fan restrictions so you'll probably hear the fan wear up a bit more and you'll probably get better sustained performance but for this test i'm gonna leave it in automatic which is by default but let's kick off with a bit of cinebench and geekbench and immediately you can see that the single core is pretty much the same between all three chips but in terms of multi-core going from the m1 to the pro there's a good boost there but then nothing really gains going to the m1 max but then switching to the opencl compute test this is more of a graphics benchmark and you can see some massive differences here we're going from 20 000 to 37 that's almost double but let's switch to blender because a lot of people use this and it's a really good benchmark of overall system performance particularly the graphics as well so as i was running these tests this was by far the best sort of visual demonstration of the performance difference now to render 500 frames of this project it took five minutes on the max 13 minutes 49 on the pro and 23.49 on the base m1 i also played a bit of shadow of the tomb raider on these three which obviously is the industry standard benchmark for testing your macbooks but it's one of the few games with a benchmark tool that runs on mac and the full hd plus we're getting 22 fps on the m1 51 on the m1 pro and 90 on the m1 max but really if you want to play games then you should please get a windows pc and finally firing up a bit of the 3dmark wildlife extreme benchmark which is technically an iphone ipad app but it is available on the mac store and i thought i'd give it a go but looking at 28 fps versus 56 versus 106 frames per second but what about video editing i think for me this is the most important area as i spend half my life in premiere pro and actually having just recently updated to the 2022 version i did notice some significant boost to performance so make sure uh you are running the latest premiere version and in fact pretty much the whole adobe suite is now optimized for m1 but obviously the pro and the max not only do we have that raw performance with the more cpu and gpu cores but we also have that dedicated media engine but just watching these side by side playing back on the timeline the max is consistently a lot smoother we do see more as you can see right here juddering and slow downs even on the m1 pro and the standard m1 as well so in my experience even just scrubbing around the project the max is noticeably smoother i had to test this like three or four times because i couldn't quite believe the results but i ran a export test of my 10 minute project 4k photo 2 as i say and the results are pretty crazy we're looking at 20 minutes 36 seconds on the m1 versus 11 minutes 58 on the m1 pro versus just a hair under seven minutes on the m1 max and actually before i updated to the 2022 version this max was actually around 12 minutes as well so it seems there are a lot of m1 pro max optimizations with the most recent version so definitely get that now of course the extra unified memory in here will also play a role in that so if you just have the m1 max with 16 gigs of ram which i don't know if i'd recommend that really that difference won't be quite as significant the m1 max does seem to be worth it in premiere pro and also final cut pro but not quite in the same way i used a very similar project ran the same export test which took 12 and a half minutes on the m1 macbook pro 13 but then on the m1 pro it was only a minute faster eleven and a half minutes compared to the m1 max which was just under seven minutes so it's five minutes quicker which may not seem like a lot in the grand scheme of things i mean you could go make a cup of tea or make a thumbnail or something but that adds up over projects so i didn't know if this would be the case but if you are a video editor then it seems like the mo max is the way to go however not so much if you're a photo editor i loaded up 500 raw photos in lightroom and timed how long it took them to convert to jpeg the m1 took 2 minutes 58 the m1 pro took 2 minutes 3 and the m1 max 1 minute 46 which makes sense really and i think the advantage there with the max is having that extra memory it's a cpu intensive task and the biggest gain in terms of cpu performance of course is from the m1 to the pro the max is much more about the gpu but the best bit about all these macs is that you get the exact same performance regardless of whether you're plugged into the charger or you're using it on battery which is a massive deal for me as someone who likes to edit on planes and trains and out and about i don't always have a charger around me so let's wrap up which one should you go for well i would say none of them i think for 90 of the people out there the macbook air is the best one to go for the pro 13 yes it has a fan and you get slightly better sustained performance and well the touch bar isn't really a selling point anymore i would save you money go for the air get 16 gigs of ram and maybe a 512 storage with it but for me at least the pro 13 doesn't really make much sense for most people for just you know general use get the macbook air between these two it's a bit more straightforward how important are the graphics for your workload if you're a video editor graphics designer game designer 3d artist one of those things then yes definitely get the max it does make a big difference it doesn't compromise on the battery and i would probably get 32 gigs of unified memory with that so for me as a video editor given how actually it did improve uh my premiere pro and final cut experience i would go with an m1 max but that is also very expensive and if you're not editing multiple 8k streams or designing games then just get the m1 pro in either the 14 or the 16. this is such a good laptop they're all fantastic laptops you can't go wrong with any of them really but i think the 16 with a terabyte storage 32 gigs unified memory and the m1 pro while expensive is probably the go-to spec and breathe that was a lot and i appreciate that wasn't a fully scientific analysis between them but hopefully gives you a rough idea if you've got any questions then just leave a comment below and i'll do my best to answer them and i will see you next time right here on the tech chat thanks for watching you
