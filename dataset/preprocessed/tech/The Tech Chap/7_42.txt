hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is an absolute monster rtx 3080 ti intel i9 12900k 32 gigs of ddr5 ram four terabytes of storage and the smooth as a baby's bum 360 hertz screen this could well be the most powerful gaming laptop in the world right now which is not surprising at all given those drool worthy specs although of course this does also come with an accompanying eye watering price this brand new top spec msi ge 76 raider will cost you over 4 000 pounds so the question is just how fast is this does the new hardware really make that much difference and this is actually worth buying well to help answer that question here's one i made earlier this is last year's ge 76 radar if i uh move my plant out the way so very conveniently this 2021 model comes with the rtx 3080 and the 11th gen i9 whereas on here obviously we have the 380 ti and the 12th gen i9 so this is going to be really interesting this thing is still 4 grand but i imagine it'll get a bit cheaper when the new models come out and in fact here's a full spec list for both laptops i've got here so what's the bet how much faster do you think this is actually going to be over this well let's start with a couple of cpu tests and between cinebench and geekbench we're looking at average 22 boost in single core and 62 boost in multi-core that's actually very impressive good job intel although of course the new 12th gen i9 does have 14 cores and 20 threads to the 11th gens 8 and 16. so that's where a big part of the multi-core boost comes from but even the 22 single co-op tick is nothing to be sniffed at but what about the graphics card is this soup top ti version of the 3080 really anything to write home about well across multiple 3dmark time spy and wildlife benchmarks the average increase is just 8 not exactly night and day but then again this is just a ti not a whole new generation of card bear in mind though that the 3080 in last year's model is a 165 watt tgp variant whereas the 3080ti is 175 watts so part of that extra performance is just simply because the card in this is drawing more power although it does mean the ti can have a higher graphics boost clock speed and also faster memory bandwidth even though they both share the same 16 gigs of gddr6 and 256 bit interface but how does that translate into games well both models of the g76 radar are 1080p 17-inch 1080p although we'll come back to that in a second but i am also going to test uh 1440 and 4k by using an external monitor because a lot of new laptops with this flagship gaming card are going to have those higher resolutions even though these particular ones are limited to 1080p but first let's see if it really does help max out that 360hz refresh at full hd and the answer is uh kind of across the six games on test at 1080p we're looking at a decent 15 uptick in performance although there seems to be a negligible difference in call of duty warzone remember though this is with a new cpu new gpu and faster ram although i guess that's a bit academic because unlike a desktop pc where you upgrade individual components when you buy a new generation of gaming laptop you tend to get new cpu fast around faster storage you know the whole shebang all together so while you can't really uh pinpoint the difference just between the gpus of previous and current gen you are getting a whole new package well i say that but actually this is the exact same chassis in design it's just the internal spec bump now to be honest with you 1080p on a 17.3 inch screen isn't my favorite although i do appreciate this is meant for esports and to get you the highest fps possible but more to the point i want to see if the 3080ti has a bigger impact at higher resolutions so i hooked it up to an external monitor and ran all the tests again and this time at 1440p we're seeing an average 11 boost in performance and finally moving up to 4k which realistically i think this is best reserved for desktop setups with a 32 inch or bigger screen but on the ge76 we are seeing the smallest gain just a 9 optic so the ti and well i guess the laptop as a whole offers the biggest improvement to performance at lower resolutions especially 1080p and my guess for that is it's just the new 12th gen intel chips genuinely having quite a big impact and removing some of that bottleneck at the lower resolutions which is something we've run into in the past but i guess this is all about managing expectations as i say this is just a ti update for the gpu and also you're not going to be upgrading this from a 3080 laptop realistically you might have a 2080 or 1080 or something even older but even coming from the 3080 an average 12 boost across all resolutions it is impressive for the thermal and size restrictions of laptops but not a mind-blowing upgrade and i think most of the credit does actually go to intel although of course i haven't tested amd ryzen's new 6000 series mobile cpus yet but i do think maybe intel is back in the game my other takeaway though is how these two laptops are nearly identical it's literally just a spec bump which is a little bit underwhelming as some masseuse rog models for example have new displays or refresh designs something more than just the extra performance which by itself may tempt me to actually look at one of last year's models which we may see discounted when these new ones come out over the next few weeks also bear in mind i haven't yet tested the 3070 ti card and also i haven't yet put this through its paces with creative apps like premiere pro or run some extensive battery tests but based on performance alone this is right up there with the best most powerful gaming laptops in the world right now and i think especially if you are an esports pro super enthusiastic gamer and you are playing at 1080p where you want the highest frame rates possible then this may actually be worth considering for everyone else maybe let's see what the other options are how much cheaper last year's models are and also how that 3070 ti compares to this also just quickly with this ge 76 i would recommend going into the msi control panel and turning on cooler booster mode as well as the extreme performance option when i ran tests without cooler boost mode on the performance was around five percent lower so it does make a difference and you can even tinker with overclocking the gpu if you want to squeeze a little bit more out of it but what do you think impressed tempted to upgrade or not really let me know what you think of this
