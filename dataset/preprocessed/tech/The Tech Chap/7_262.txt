alright hey you guys hope people doing well I'm Tom Sager and welcome to my camera comparison between the Huawei p40 Pro and the samsung galaxy s 20 plus now I'm shooting this intro bit with the rear cameras at 4k 13 I'm also switching between the little speaker icon below so you can tell which microphone I'm using so hopefully you can get idea of the audio quality and also the video quality now these two are direct competitors they both cost about 900 pounds they both have quad camera setups and well below the flagship phones we also have the s20 ultra and the people Pro Plus but I reckon these two are gonna be the most popular models and I think they offer the best value for money and as always I'm gonna give you my opinion throughout but then at the end of the video I want you guys to vote in the poll the top right and let me know which one you think wins and also with me know white in the comments below now in this example what stands out for me the s20 plus seems to be just a little bit over sharpened some people may prefer that but I can't like the one natural look at the p40 but just look at the color difference in the sky it's blue on the s20 versus well gray and kind of blow now actually on the p40 I think the s20 handles the dynamic range of those bright highlights and the clouds are a little bit better the other thing to know is the s twenties all true wide lens does have a wider field of view than P 40 so you are getting more in the frame but how do they compare when it comes to focusing well let's get right up to this blue yeti microphone and then pan across and then back [Music] but what about stabilization if you're doing something a bit more active like going for a quick jog just to know that I am by myself here I'm social distancing and this was part of my exercise for the day but you can see the s20 with its super study mode while it's at ATP is much more stable than the p40 Pro again that's also at ATP here but it only uses is a is an oh is it doesn't have any dedicated super study Ultra study mode but I think one area that p40 Pro kicks the Samsungs butt is in slow motion now this is at 960 FPS on both super slow motion or the P fully pro as you can see is much higher quality it's actually 1080p vs. 720p on the s20 plus but that's not all because the people you Pro can actually record in up to seven thousand six hundred and eighty fps what that means is one second of real time becomes 256 seconds of slow motion now this is only at 720p and technically it's actually interpolating up from 1920 fps so while the quality isn't fantastic it is a unique feature to the far way and if you time it right you can get some pretty cool effects moving on to photos and this is taken with the ultra wide lens and while the p40 shot is brighter with better dynamic range it's nowhere near as wide as the s20 then on to the main lens and the photos are more comparable although you can see a big difference in brightness and vibrancy onto the telephoto lens where we get a 5 times optical zoom on the p40 Pro and three times on the s20 Plus and finally 10 times hybrid zoom on both and I think that p40 is the clear winner here is it's much sharper and more detailed at the full zoom here's another example first with the ultra wide then the main lens then five times and three times zoom respectively and finally ten times and you can see the sign the window behind it it's much higher quality on the p40 on the one hand the people he does handle color accuracy bets if you look at the petals yes it's a fake flower and also the tabletop it's much more true to life the Samsung again is definitely sharper seems that the s20 send a much better job here especially in the background you can see the window is much more evenly exposed if we zoom in by 300% the s20 is also much more tailed here now both photos look great here but you can see that consistent over saturation of colors on the s20 plus now I don't mind that but you could argue it's better to have a more natural photo then edit an observation yourself afterwards if you want cropping in by 300% the s20 is certainly sharper and there's more fine detail you can even make out a texture on the label now here's a totally natural and definitely not posed photo of me but there's a striking difference between the colors that detail the brightness but overall I think that people eat is superior here and yes twenties higher contrast means we do lose some information in the darker areas particularly on my shirt and around my right eye okay let's switch to some low-light shots and this is using just a regular photo mode not night mode and even without the longer exposure of my mode the p-40s is much brighter and more evenly exposed just look at the side table on the lamp on the desk now some times where it is low light but not too dark night mode only has a minor effect it is best used in super low light so here it's almost pitch-black in my living room except for the RGB fans and my PC in the background this is a normal photo and then this is with night mode which makes a huge difference to the s20 Plus although looking at the detail on the plant and the dog I think the p40 does come out on top now this is just a regular photo but the thing is even if you switch to the s 20s dedicated night mode if it doesn't deem it dark enough it still won't give you a longer exposure and so there's no difference in photos back to me again and I really do like the s 20s wider field of view but overall the p40 is sharper I think it's handled the bright LED light behind the desk a bit better and while neither photo looks great I think Huawei's is a bit better I absolutely promise you I have zero bias this is not sponsored I'm just looking in the photo side-by-side and giving you my subjective opinion but the p40 again clearly wins here with this low-light portraiture but what about low-light selfies well they've both done a pretty good job here given the lighting conditions and the s20 is definitely sharper and more detailed but at the expense of some noise as for portrait selfies while the angle of the photo isn't identical you can see the p40 sage detection mist a little bear spy on the building behind my head although it is a similar cards my hair ok last photo of me I promise and firstly I think yes 20 selfie actually has got the colors right here the p40 is brighter and actually it's a little bit reminiscent of the iPhones HDR which tends to brighten and also flatten everything a little bit but I think it still looks better overall but what about selfie video because well the big upgrades this year are the people hiepro is the ability to shoot up to 4k 60 with the selfie camera previously even on the main 30 Pro we were limited to just 1080p so that's a real big upgrade for the Huawei although Samsung phones have been doing it for a couple of years now I'm shooting this at 4k 30 and just walking around changing the light conditions but what do you reckon how do they compare just looking at the screens it does look like the Samsung has a wider field of view that's definitely a little bit more on the scene and it seems to cope a bit better with the lighting obviously is quite backlit there but just looking at the 4way it's very dark but what do you reckon which one takes better selfie video one of the Samsung's unique features is live focus video you can tell the front or rear camera but it gives you that sort of blurred bokeh effect behind me which doesn't always work the edge detection isn't some times the best but it's a nice extra feature to have in something you may want to use now one thing yes twenty-plus can do which the why we can't is shoot in full 8k resolution now I don't know how often you're gonna want to do this yourself it's only at 24 frames per second the stabilization isn't as good and of course you get huge file sizes but there are some advantages like you could pull a 33 megapixel still from it if you do have a fancy 8k TV which I don't he could stream it natively to that and watch it in high quality now we also get single take mode on the s20 which over 10 seconds takes a bunch of photos videos boomerangs and then gives you all the options afterwards it is kind of financially but I don't think it's something I personally use that often now in the Huawei camp we get a few special features as well including the reflection removal tool once you take a photo in the gallery tap edit and remove reflection it doesn't do a perfect job but it's definitely an improvement and I can see it being useful for say taking photos out of an aeroplane window whenever we're allowed to fly again that is there's also a removed passerby option which actually I struggle to get to work you need to enable live photos and in the option come up in the gallery edit but it just wouldn't detect passers-by in my photos but then my good friend Michael Josh from getcha match saved the day and sent over an example which did work for him so you get the idea and finally we have jeweled video where the p40 can record with the main and ultra wide lenses at the same time it's limited to TP and quality doesn't seem to be as good as if it was shot individually but it's a feature nonetheless overall that which phone do you think came out on top I'd love to know what you guys think in the comments below however one fact it could be that I'm using the Exynos version of the S 20 plus I have found the Snapdragon to offer better image quality thank you so much for watching hit
