hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this completely over the top tv is the 77-inch lg g1 perfect for your ps5 your series x or even your gaming pc so we'll dive into the g1 specifically in just a second but what actually makes a great gaming tv what should you be looking for well there's five things really you want 4k at 120 hertz hdmi 2.1 support for variable refresh rates whether it's through the hdmi g-sync or freesync also low latency modes or allm and finally low response times and low input lag i'll explain what all that means but really most mid to high end 2021 tvs should have most of those now and of course also last year's flagships uh will have those features but obviously because they're a year old they'll be a little bit discounted so that's worth looking at but i'd say a good rule of thumb is if the tv has at least one hdmi 2.1 port then it's probably got all the other features as well and you're all set but what about 8k i hear about two or three of you murmuring in the back well yes i mean that technically will be more future-proof and these next-gen consoles do support it but there's nothing to play right now at least i think unless you have money to burn 8k it's still a bit of a waste of time for gaming at least because you will see some upscaling in picture quality for uh tv and movies but not with games so really unless you're hooking up your gaming pc with a 3080 ti or a 3090 and then playing games on medium or low with dlss if it supports it it's just a bit of a waste of time i would put your money into either getting a bigger tv or one with a fancy oled or q-led panel that will make a much bigger difference and conveniently i actually have an 8k lg nano cell tv and also a 4k oled and 99 of time i would take the 4k oled you just don't really need 8k right now maybe in three or four years but let's get back to the g1 and i've had this for a little over a month now and i love this thing i've been playing a whole bunch of ratchet and clank with eternal resident evil mass effect there's quite a lot to play now especially with all the next-gen updates for games like the brand new ff7 remake which just looks so good on this now the benefit of this g series the g1 over the more popular c series like the c1 is twofold actually firstly we have this zero gap wall mount it's part of their gallery design that means you can wall mount the tv and it's flush against the wall which looks great although as you can see here i've got my phillips hue light strip so it does sit proud a couple of centimeters more importantly though exclusive to this and their super crazy expensive zed series is this oled evo panel which in my tests is between 10 and 20 brighter across the whole screen versus the c1 or last year's tvs and as you guys know the biggest sort of limiting factor to oled tvs still is the brightness at least compared to the qled competition so i'll take all the extra knits i possibly can however with a peak of a little under 700 nits as i say this still doesn't come close to the two three even four thousand nits you can get on some of the super high-end q-led competition i've been talking about this whole oled versus q-led thing for years now i was even at the launch of the original q-led in paris back in what was it 2017 now and since then there's been this ongoing debate of which is better well this isn't that video but in my experience it comes down to how bright is your room if you have a really bright room you can't control the lighting then i would go with a q led which is brighter and in the case of samsung tvs you get a much better anti-reflective coating so that gives you a better experience but if you can have a proper movie or game night in darker settings then personally i would always take an oled over anything else because you just can't compete with that near infinite contrast those deep inky colors and of course that lack of blooming compared to traditional led or even mini led tvs and having just played through resident evil village with all the tunnels and dark areas that game was made for oled it just looks incredible but let's talk about money and for this 77 inch g1 you're looking at paying about 800 pounds more over the c1 with a 500 pound difference at 65 inches but crucially in terms of gaming besides the slight improvement to brightness which is occasionally noticeable but sometimes i think i'm just convincing myself and it's a placebo effect they are virtually identical and to be honest i would probably just save the cache and go with the c1 because both have pretty much instant 2.3 millisecond response times even beating samsung's latest mini led neoq leds by a few milliseconds so we get minimal motion blur and inputs feel instantaneous however whichever tv you're using whichever brand if you have a game mode make sure you're using it because this turns off a lot of the background tv processing and gives you the fastest response times but then we have vrr or variable refresh rates and this is where things get a little bit more complicated but again you don't really need to worry about it all happens behind the scenes it'll automatically be turned on although some tvs do have these game optimizer menus where you can check vrr essentially allows the tv to adjust its refresh rate in real time to the frame rate that's being output by your console pc gamers are pretty familiar with this and it helps to reduce screen tearing and smooth out your frame rate unfortunately right now the ps5 doesn't support any kind of variable refresh but it is expected to in the future the xbox works with freesync and if you're pc gaming on this then you can take advantage of either freesync or g-sync lots of fancy tech working mostly behind the scenes just to give you a smoother and better gaming experience but when it comes to thinking about what the best gaming tv is we actually have to go beyond the tv itself because just as important or at least almost as important as a great picture is great sound so i would highly suggest you pair your new gaming tv with a proper speaker system or a soundbar because i can tell you from personal experience going from the built-in speakers of the g1 to a sonos arc and then adding a couple of sl1 surrounds and eventually a sub because i've moved house and it's now detached so i'm not pissing off my neighbors and it just gives you that extra oomph of firing a gun or blowing something up in games that even the best tvs just can't match [Music] internally [Music] so with all that said i know exactly what you're thinking you are thinking tom that sounds great but not everyone has a spare four and a half grand or so to drop in an lg g1 77 inch and you are absolutely right this is completely excessive and well beyond the budgets of 99.9 of us so everyone's budget and setup is different but my top buy right now for a properly future-proof all-singing all-dancing gaming tv would be the 48-inch lg c1 which costs about 1300 pounds or so right now still not exactly cheap but this video is all about the best gaming tvs although i would also highly recommend looking at last year's models or even waiting until november and black friday because new tvs come down in price an awful lot but it's all relative and a basic 4k hdr tv is more than good enough for most of us but if you are a keen gamer and have some pretty deep pockets then something like lg c1 g1 sony z90j samsung's qr94a or similar are all incredible gaming tvs if you do fancy checking out this stuff and my setup for yourself i'll leave links to everything i've talked about in the description below and i would also love to hear what tv you're using right now and also if you're thinking about upgrading this year what models are you considering let me know in the comments thank you so much for watching guys hit that subscribe button if you want to see more from me and i'll catch you next time right
