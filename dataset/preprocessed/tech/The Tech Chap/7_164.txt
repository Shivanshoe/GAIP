hey guys anton the tech tap and obviously everyone and their dog is talking about cyberpunk right now for some reason i have a collector's edition keanu reeves here with me but i also have an rtx 3090 and there's been a question on my mind of can i play cyberpunk in 8k let's do this so um for some reason that takes ages to explain my dad has an 8k tv but i don't so he's very kindly lent me his living room for the purpose of this video i'm very fortunate to have a nice 4k oled tv but this is a 75 inch 8k lg nano cell i did that obviously debate between 4k oled or ak nano cell which would you choose so the first thing i'm going to need is a hdmi 2.1 cable it even says 8k on it because it's the only way we'll get 8k 60 uh otherwise it's restricted ak-30 and of course we have 2.1 on the new ampere cards as well i'm just want to see if this works like it should run but how well living room pc barely notice it it works but i don't think that's an ak yet or at least it needs scaling let me grab my keyboard there we go here it is my razer black widow pro v3 i think it is listen to the sound of this by the way [Applause] my favorite why am i nearly on the floor i actually bought an office chair in here so let's bring this in where's 8k 4k 120 which suggests it's using hdmi 2.1 that's a good start but part of this video is for 8k but i just read that you actually have to enable it in the hdmi settings so if we jump into additional settings there uh there we go so that should have done the trick let's have a look there we go ak60 so obviously without hdmi 2.1 this would be limited to 30. actually you know what if we go to the display settings let's scale it to 100 so this is native 8k scaling let's i was looking for it to pop off oh look at that [Music] so the reason we actually made this video let's try out cyberpunk again rtx 1390 i9 10900k 30 gigs of ram this is installed on a fast m2 ssd this is the best chance really outside of a maybe a dual 3090 setup i've actually been able to play as snake king and we're in cyberpunk it runs the settings it runs the main menu there we go 7680 by 4320 that is 33 million pixels compared to 8 million for 4k we're getting exactly half the screen aren't we [Laughter] what's happening um nothing's ever easy especially with cyberpunk i just want to get into the game wait let's see if there we go it's just the menus that don't work oh god look at that frame rate to be expected this is maxed out so yeah clearly cyberpunk does not play well at 8k in terms of the menus but importantly at least the game is uh i was going to say fine but that doesn't look exactly playable it's very sharp as you would expect so the only way we can change the settings is by taking out of 8k because we can't access the menus um so let's try and get 30 fps 38k seems reasonable rt ultra dealer says auto which i guess would have put us in ultra performance but let's start with that still maxed out settings not psycho lighting mode but that's kind of silly oh wait look at that bang on 30. 32 31 it's pretty stable actually and this is all thanks to dlss i'll turn it off in a minute so we can see the difference around enjoying myself 8k living the dream this is awesome obviously we've got 24 gigs of vram in the 30-90 and that's obviously going to come into play uh at this kind of crazy high resolution can you jump out where you drive yes you can that's very gta 5. okay now let's see what happens if i turn dl says off uh still maxed out settings six which i would say is unplayable obviously that's ridiculous so dlss ultra performance which obviously is scaling from 1440p up to 4k no up to 8k which is 3.6 million pixels up to 33 million pixels so that's about nine times scaling you're getting with that that's insane but it makes it makes all the difference i know ultra performance dlss isn't the sharpest in the world but actually at this resolution i don't think you'll notice that much and it just turns what is completely unplayable to something that's getting 30 fps so maxed out with ray tracing is nice but let's see what we can get with ultra performance dlss but without rt so just sticking to regular ultra settings so we're going from 30 with ray tracing up to holy moly no wait i forgot to that was like 100 fps i forgot to change the resolution back because i keep having to edit this out of these settings in 4k because the menu doesn't like me at 8k as you can see okay and we're looking at 44 45 fps so that's about 50 percent higher except it's just crashed and i got a blue screen of death [Laughter] so 30 fps with ray tracing 45 without but either way you absolutely need ultra performance dlss that stuff just is magic and it saved the day here so what do you guys think of 8k gaming is it the next generation or is it just kind of a waste of time you can't really see the difference anyway let me know what you think in the comments below and also if you put some time into cyberpunk what you make of the game thank you so much for watching guys if you want to see more of me and random videos like this don't forget to hit that subscribe button and i'll catch you next time right
