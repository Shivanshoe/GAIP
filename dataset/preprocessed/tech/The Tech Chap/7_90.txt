i can barely fit this whole thing in the frame look at it hey guys i'm tomatek chap and this absolute beast is the new samsung odyssey neo g9 and it takes the already bonkers g9 from last year with its massive 49 inch extra curvy super duper ultra wide 5k 240hz display to the next level with a brand new mini led panel so not only is this the brightest monitor that i've ever tested peaking at over 2300 nits it also has darker blacks than a regular led lcd way better contrast and actually there's a lot less blooming and haloing around bright objects than you might expect however with a spec sheet as long and as crazy as this it doesn't come cheap the neo g9 will launch for about 2 200 pounds or 2 500 and that's a lot of money especially when you consider you can pick up the original g9 for less than half of that never film and drive kids it's just it's just too dangerous so first of all a big thank you to samsung for actually sending this over for me to have a play with and also sponsoring this video but as always all opinions are my own and i was just really keen to get this in to test what kind of a difference mini led actually makes and the bottom line could i actually get used to using something this big you can also see i've got windows 11 running on this which i'll talk more about in a second but if you do enjoy the video and appreciate the early access look at the neo g9 then a cheeky little like and subscribe will be lovely okay so first things first and we have to talk about this curve when i was setting this up on a desk i could fit my whole head under it and i have a big head seriously hats just don't fit me now samsung says this is a 1000r curve meaning it tracks the curve of a circle with a 1 meter radius i mean you can see just how curved this is but it also means that actually if you had four of these around you you could have a proper 360 round desk setup but this is a much tighter curve than most ultra wides and super ultra wides and while it may look a little bit ridiculous at first glance when you sit down in front of it everything just starts to make sense the curve means the screen really does wrap around you and it keeps the whole panel a more consistent distance from your eyes however being so curvy it also picks up pretty much every reflection you've got going on behind you and it can give you a sort of stretched 3d kind of reflection effect which isn't ideal so really you're going to want to take this down to your basement mancave if you've got one at least block out all the lights behind it so just like last year's g9 samsung again have gone with this proper sci-fi with a design there's a glossy white plastic body and this circular rgb area at the back or what samsung calls core lighting in fact this has just been upgraded to core sync which means the lighting changes to match the on-screen action but otherwise it's identical to last year's g9 is there anything more glorious than a 32 by 9 5k age of empires 2 definitive edition if i knew this is how i'd be playing this game like 20 years ago when i first started playing it i don't think i would believe you this is kind of ridiculous actually like last year's g9 though we still have a lot of adjustability with the monster you can adjust the height it goes as low as that so lower than my mug in fact so you could probably maybe visa mount a couple of these maybe three for your stock trading and your gme stocks and all that stuff uh you can go as high as that you've also got uh rotation what's that pivoting i forget which one it is and also a nice bit of tilt and it's actually a reassuringly stable stand given just how ridiculously big this is but let's take a step back because why would you actually want a super ultra wide anyway when there's so many fantastic regular gaming monitors already out there well for one you're getting twice the screen area and field of viewing games as you get with a traditional 16x9 monitor and still 50 more than a 21x9 ultra wide so that means we're getting more visual information like enemies coming into view sooner which genuinely could give you a competitive advantage and it makes games especially ones with incredible game worlds and vistas feel all the more immersive super ultra wise are also good at replacing multi-monitor setups the neo g9 is basically two regular 1440p monitors stuck together without the ugly bezel in the middle which means you can effectively run native 1440p apps side by side and this is the best bit with windows 11 i've installed the developer preview here you can see the start menu is now in the center by default which is a lot more comfortable to use than having to go right to the bottom left and also the snap tool is more flexible now so it's easier to actually organize and multitask with different apps across the screen now if we jump into the settings menu i'm still getting used to windows 11 a little bit here but display resolution 5120 by 1440. so samsung are saying this is a 5k display because we have well over 5000 pixels on the horizontal axis but it is only by 1440. i say only that's still pretty good but it's not as sharp as a proper 4k display so obviously you'll still get a sharper image on a 27 inch 4k display but given the size of this i think the pixel prints density is more than enough and of course the other thing to think about when it comes to high resolutions like this is whether your pc is actually powerful enough to fully take advantage of this and crucially max out that 240hz refresh rate because you'll need a seriously beefy gpu to get high frame rates out of the latest aaa games and even with an rtx 3090 my build i can barely hit 240fps in most games with maxed out settings although older or less demanding games like you know age of empires dota starcraft overwatch or rainbow six siege i have been able to fully max it out however this isn't just good for pc gaming because while you won't be able to take advantage of the ultra wide aspect ratio on console we do get a brand spanking new hdmi 2.1 port so it's properly future proof for any potential 4k 120 hertz modes on ps5 or series x we also get patreon picture mode and also picture by picture mode where you can divide the screen between two separate input sources so maybe from a laptop and a desktop or more fun i think a pc and a console so you can have your series x or your ps5 running on one half of the screen up to 1440p which you can specify on the series x and then essentially a full 27 inch 1440p desktop with your youtube or your spotify or your discord on the other side of the screen so the size is one thing but we already had that with the original g9 what's different now is we have a screen with samsung's quantum matrix technology which is a combination of mini led and 2048 dimming zones so it's a va panel and we get an ultra smooth 240hz refresh rate but i should say to get that full 240 you will need a recent gpu that supports displayport 1.4 with dsc or display stream compression but that is true of any 240hz monitor but the benefit you get going from a regular led lcd monitor to mini led is obvious blacks actually look black rather than a muddy gray and that's partly thanks to the panel which allows for more gradations of greater black but it's also the massive increase in dimming zones that makes the biggest difference so regular led lcd screens are backlit uh using a matrix of led lights which are then grouped into different areas different zones which can then be controlled and dimmed according to what's on screen which is fine but mini led takes that to the next level with i think 1 40th the size of the leds which means they can cram a whole lot more in and with more individually dimmable grooves meaning the processor can then dim or brighten smaller local areas of the screen at a time so lighter areas don't then bleed into darker areas creating that bloom or haloing effect that we all know and hate so where the old g9 had 10 dimming zones across the entire 49er screen now we have 2048 200 times more dimming zones there's still some halo wing which is made more noticeable by the darker blacks but this is a massive improvement and it's not just about better contrast because having more leds means brightness can be higher as well and samsung claims this can hit a whopping 2 000 nits of peak brightness in hdr content which is double what the older g9 could manage and they're calling this the quantum hdr 2000 standard so i was a little bit skeptical but i tested it and yes the neo g9 can do it and then some i actually measured a peak of over 2300 nits that is seriously bright however this is peak brightness and the display does start to dim after a few seconds leveling out at around 900 nits which it maintains and is still very bright how long it maintains the full brightness seems to depend on how big the peak brightness area is because in my video test the smaller the area the longer it maintains the full brightness and so streaming hdr tv shows and movies looks incredible on this although while we do get hdr 10 plus support sadly there isn't any dolby vision although of course this impressive brightness is limited to hdr content whether it's movies or games and obviously pc hdr gaming is well the support's a little bit patchy still but when you're back to sdr content which is what you're probably going to be looking at most the time then we're getting a 400 nit brightness which is still pretty good but really you're gonna want to use hdr to get the most out of this color accuracy is impressive though i measured 100 of the srgb 99 adobe rgb and 94 of the dci p3 color gamuts i should say though that samsung's official figures state 125 srgb but that's essentially just a different way of measuring it gamut coverage 100 versus gamut volume 125 but either way that is very impressive for a gaming monitor and also being curved means there's a lot less color shift when you're looking at the edges although like most screens if you move off center then there is some shift from white to gray one issue i have found though is that you can't manually set the response time to its overdrive setting if adaptive sync is enabled and it's the same with low input lag mode which means i'm probably not getting the fastest advertised response time having said that being 240 hertz response times are pretty speedy anyway and ghosting artifacts were minimal but back to gaming and while the size and the curve are still styles of the show here having mini led does make all the difference looking at the sun in a game with hdr on almost hurts it's so bright you know in a good way and the greater contrast helps colors to pop and the combination of that huge amount of peripheral vision running at high refresh rates it really draws you in and it's as close to a kind of vr experience as you'll get outside of strapping a headset to your face surprisingly i didn't really find myself moving my head to look at the sides of the screen as it was more for just my peripheral vision now unfortunately i don't have the time to play as many games as i used to i would like to i spend about half my life in premiere pro and just look at the size of that timeline it's beautiful although really what it means is i can have my project files and media browser to one side and then maybe split the screen half i know it's a cliche term but there's just so much screen real estate to play with and if you are using something with a timeline like this while this is primarily a gaming display it's also going to be a fantastic work monitor for me as well there are a couple of niggles with this though because not all games actually support 32 by nine some like rainbow six siege actually max out at an ultrawide 20 one by nine so it's hello to those black bars again and for work i think i'd prefer it if it was a little bit taller maybe 32 by 10 rather than by nine which would give us a 51 20 by 1600 resolution instead of 1440 just to help things feel a little bit less letterboxy and there also aren't any speakers with this which would have been nice given the price okay let's wrap up and i think the jump to mini leds one of the biggest upgrades to gaming monitors that we've seen in years it really makes a big difference and while of course mini led isn't exclusive to samsung this is one of the first ones we've seen on a proper super ultra wide and i'm very impressed it is of course very expensive but i'd argue you're getting a lot of screen for your money here and while last year's odyssey g9 was fantastic at launch and still very good if you want the absolute best picture quality then the neo g9 is in another league entirely and then there's the odyssey g7 which is smaller and cheaper either with the curved or new for this year a flat screen version so this thing literally turns head and i think it's pretty much unquestionably the highest spec most over the top super ultra wide gaming monitor you can buy it's not for everyone of course and also you'll need a pretty powerful pc to get the most out of it and also where possible i would recommend trying to play or watch stuff in hdr so you can really take advantage of that crazy brightness but when you're sat in front of this thing it is a genuinely draw dropping experience but what do you reckon would you be tempted to have one of these on your desk would it even fit on your desk let me know what you think of the neo g9 in the description below know in the comments below even in the description is my link to this if you fancy checking it out for yourself thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right
