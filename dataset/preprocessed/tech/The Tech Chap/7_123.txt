okay so today is a bit of a sad day actually lg have confirmed they're closing their mobile division a strategic move they say in the face of stiff competition and presumably not wanting to lose any more than the four and a half billion dollars or so of losses they've incurred over the last six years fair enough they're losing money the competition's getting stronger and they just can't keep up it was a similar story with blackberry and htc and nokia although they're back now actually i'm sure they won't be the last i mean sony's xperia division hasn't really been doing that well for a few years but it is a real shame lg made some of the very best phones ever going all the way back to the lg g2 and the g3 with their big screens and thin bezels the g3 by the way is a personal favorite as it was my first ever review on this channel so that phone will always be special to me and i still keep one around just to see how far i've come and also phones and technology and the best bit look at this replaceable batteries it was a simpler time now i've been doing this for about six years now since the beginning of 2015 and every single year in february i would go to mwc the mobile world congress in barcelona one of the best trade shows of the year by the way and the big two companies to look for were samsung and lg the constant back and forth between the galaxy s6 or the lg g5 and even back then they were taking risks trying something a bit different as google were experimenting with project ara a fully modular phone the g5 launched with a handful of modules you could switch out b o play speakers the cam plus with a shutter button an extra battery and even a 360 cam it didn't really catch on and i think the biggest problem was the lack of third-party support because beyond the handful of lg's unofficial attachments there wasn't really anything else but they were trying something different and in a world of copy and paste rectangular slabs of glass even gimmicky features to some extent are good and it pushes the industry forward even until a few months ago the lg wing was one of the most exciting phones of 2020 with the second screen that twists around to give you a full t-pose smartphone it was really cool and there were some nifty use cases for it but again it just didn't sell very well then we had the dual screen cases for phones like the v60 thingq as well as the g8x and the snazzy looking lg velvet and this genuinely made these otherwise good but not exceptional phones stand out and maybe was even a precursor to the microsoft surface duo and even this year we were finally expecting to see the launch of lg's first rollable phone which sadly is now unlikely to ever see the light of day so we've had some really good phones some proper unique innovation and a pretty loyal fan base so where did it all go wrong well i think there are three big reasons firstly the camera the cameras on lg phones were always good but just not quite good enough and never quite uh kept up with the latest from samsung or apple secondly they kept struggling to get third party support uh even going back to the modular g5 but even recently with apps for the dual screen cases or the lg wing beyond lg's own applications there wasn't really much else coming and finally the biggest reason really they were just too expensive so they fell behind i think if lg had gone with more of a one plus strategy of knowing their flagships are never quite as good as a competition but giving us a good high-end phone for a more affordable price that would have been key and crucially the value of lg phones dropped like a stone a month or two after launch you could probably get uh the latest lg for like a third off if you waited a few weeks but if they launched at that price and undercut samsung huawei and apple and maybe competing more with one plus that could have made all the difference now lg have said that uh phones will continue to be on sale and if you do own an lg phone they will support it although they haven't said for how long and i can't imagine it would be much more than six or twelve months or so the flip side of that i suppose is that if you do fancy yourself a cool new lg wing or a v60 you might be able to get one on a good deal since i suspect some people wouldn't really want to buy a new lg phone without that future support but it's not like lg's just completely gone out of business so you will still get some support for your phone but yeah it's the end of any new devices so lg mobile may be closing but lg itself is not going anywhere with their fantastic oled tvs their gram laptops gaming and professional monitors and also one of the biggest players in home tech from fridges to washing machines so fingers crossed that some of the employees working in the mobile division can be transferred internally because while we can be sad about not seeing any phones people actually losing their jobs is a really sad thing but as with any good movie franchise dead is never really dead and as we've seen with nokia a bit of reinvestment from hmd global they've come back fighting and actually nokia produced some really fantastic affordable budget phones and also basically own the feature phone market right now so maybe one day we will see another lg phone but not anytime soon unfortunately so it is sad i've got a lot of memories tied up with lg i know it's just phones and technology but this is my life and i know a lot of people when you buy the phone or the product and you have that with you for two or three years you form a bit of a bond with it so it is a sad day and i really do hope not many people are going to lose their jobs at the lg mobile division but what i would love to hear are your lg stories the phones that you've owned what you've thought of them and your experiences and also how lg mobile could have done things differently to stay in business let me know your thoughts in the comments
