look at this it's so cool if i slide these little buttons at the top here they pop up the magnetic triggers button goes up button goes down bed goes up bed goes down this is the new black shark 5 pro and its combination of super duper high-end specs but also a very reasonable price i think makes this stand out and definitely worth considering so black shark have launched two new phones the black shark five and the 5 pro which is the one i have here and is their new flagship and actually it's a decent upgrade even over the 4s pro that came out back in october so not even that long ago with a new processor a better camera faster charging a refresh design and also all new accessories speaking of which black shark also sent over their magnetic cooling fan to go with the phone and also a pair of their new active noise cancelling joy buds pro earphones which are actually surprisingly good their snapdragon sound certified they have a special low latency game mode and you get about 30 hours of combined battery life now a big thank you to black shark for sending this over for me to have a bit of a play with i've been testing it for a couple of weeks now and also for offering to sponsor this video but as always all opinions are my own it's tricky what makes a good gaming phone i was gonna say there's like three core key features that you have to have but really it's like five or six it's got to have a comfortable design that you can use for a long period and also with shoulder triggers those are pretty fundamental these days also i do think you need a fan or some incredible built-in cooling to prevent throttling obviously all the best specs possible for the highest frame rates as well as a high refresh and also a high touch response screen so the inputs feel immediate and you also need solid battery life and fast charging so you can enjoy gaming sessions without worrying and i can tell you this checks pretty much all those boxes i only have a couple of minor gripes so let's get those out the way first and i think the big one maybe is the battery life because while it is fine and we have actually a decent sized 4650 million power cell in here which is actually a bit bigger than the previous 4s and 4 which came with a 4500 but not best in class some of the competition do have bigger batteries and will last longer however the upside of this new battery is it's a new dual cell design which means thanks to this guy as well we have much faster charging 120 watt charging in fact you can fully charge the black shark 5 pro from 0 to 100 in just 15 minutes which right now makes this the fastest charging gaming phone you can buy so charging has had a big upgrade but in terms of actual battery life well half an hour of gentian impact at max settings used 17 so we're looking at around three hours of battery life for demanding games of course regular non-gaming use is gonna be a completely different story this will easily get you through a full day and really it does depend on what games you play if you've got roblox or candy crush or angry birds or something running then it's going to last a lot longer than gentian or apex now specs wise this boasts a snapdragon 8 gen 1 as well as 8 12 or 16 gigs of ram i've got the 12 gigabyte version here along with either 128 or 256 gigs of storage although no 512 option here like we used to have and also no micro sd card support but both models do use faster enhanced ufs 3.1 storage now sadly we don't have qualcomm's just announced snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 their naming conventions are just awful uh but that only has just been announced actually right now there are no phones that support it and those that do come out are likely to be a lot more expensive as well and the entry level model which i reckon is all you need eight gigs around 128 storage costs just 639 pounds which makes it one-off if not the cheapest snapdragon 801 gaming phones that you can buy right now now for any gaming phone the screen is kind of just as important as the specs and the performance and with this we're getting a 6.67 inch 144 hertz 720 hertz touch sample oled display and it is gorgeous and as you'd expect incredibly responsive it's not an ltpo panel so it doesn't actually dynamically adjust the refresh although you can choose the refresh you want in the display settings so just how fast is this well let's start with a couple of benchmarks now for some context let's bring in the galaxy s 22 ultra which has the same chip as this and already you can see a pretty big difference between the highest and lowest 3d mark score and that stability which is actually remarkably impressive given that wasn't using any kind of active fan cooling that was all down to the new anti-gravity vapor chamber cooler that you've got inside here that's what they call it and to be fair while i did notice the phone still gets quite warm especially around the edges playing some very demanding games for longer sessions it did at least on the inside keep things nice and cool and prevent it from throttling now as i mentioned black shark also sent out this magnetic cooler fan accessory thing the only trouble is that this is primarily designed for iphones with magsafe there are adhesive attachments so it can stick on the back of the black shark or any other phone but even with that there actually wasn't enough power coming from the usbc port when i had it plugged in to actually make it work the good news though is that there is a whole arsenal of black shark accessories that you can buy controllers active cooling fans and while i don't have them here to test if you want to regularly game in the ludicrous performance mode then it does recommend you use a fan with it so i'll withhold judgment on fan performance until i can get one that properly works with this now any good gaming phone has shoulder triggers but as far as i know black shark hardly any brand using magnetic pop-up triggers you simply toggle the switch beside the triggers to make them pop up and black sharks say they've tested them over a million times for durability so while you're gaming you can either swipe in or long press both triggers to open up the new shark space 4.0 game center then tap on master control and you can map the a and b triggers to any on-screen virtual buttons you like for say aiming down a scope for jumping reloading handbrake turns whatever you like if you're wondering can these slider buttons be used for anything else well the answer is yes if you jump into the settings menu you can actually customize what those slider buttons can do after they've popped up or retracted the shoulder triggers but wait there is more because we also have a dual zone pressure sensitive screen and so you can get some seriously precise inputs with up to seven levels of sensitivity now there is no doubt this is quite a big phone as i say six point six seven inch screen it's also nine and a half millimeters thick and it weighs 220 grams we also get some incredible sounding stereo speakers sadly we don't get a headphone jack but the black shark 5 pro is in fact the number one phone on the dxomark audio rankings which is very cool although to be fair i still mostly use earphones when i'm gaming [Applause] also unlike most gaming phones the cameras on this aren't half bad actually we've had a pretty big upgrade particularly on the back we have a new 108 megapixel main camera lens there's also a 13 megapixel ultra wide and a 5 megapixel macro plus a 16 megapixel selfie camera up front and while i haven't spent a great deal of time with the camera so far i've mainly been playing games on this in good light the black shark 5 pro can take some really nice shots [Music] now in terms of the software this runs black shark's own joy ui 13 software on top of uh on top of on top of android 12 although if i bring up the recently used apps uh menu here there's only one other software like this that goes vertical and that is of course xiaomi's miui this is very heavily based on miui 12 and that is absolutely fine no complaints from me there is surprisingly little bloatware it's nice and fast there's a good amount of customization but it really is that shark space 4.0 game command center whatever you want to call it that is the real software highlight not just for mapping different triggers but you can also program macros in games so if there's any repetitive actions in games you'd rather automate plus there's motion sensing which uses the phone's gyroscope to track its movement so you can actually assign up to seven different gesture inputs which is pretty nifty so that is just a quick look at the new black shark 5 pro also have a look out for the black shark 5 which uses the snapdragon 870 which is still a very capable chip and is cheaper than this of course but if you're after a good flagship phone that does not cost a fortune which a lot of them do and gives you top-notch performance some actually very impressive internal cooling thanks to that vapor chamber but on the whole it is a really good all-rounder and there were just so many input methods with this that you can really customize how you play the games that you play but what do you reckon would you be tempted by the black shark 5 pro and also if you've got any questions or anything you'd like me to test let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat [Applause]
