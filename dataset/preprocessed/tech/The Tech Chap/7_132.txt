when i show people the find x3 pro the reaction is a little bit like marmite you either love it or you hate it just like me then but there's also more than a passing resemblance between this and this the iphone 12 pro max particularly in this color and actually if i bring it up to the camera it is very similar they've mirrored the camera module and then kind of melted the edges around it or that's what it kind of looks like but in a world of big bulky phones with sticky-outy camera bumps there's something refined and a little bit grown up about the 5x3 pro and i think next to the s21 ultra it's much nicer to hold it's thinner it's narrower it's a good deal lighter and it's just more comfortable to carry around in your pocket although despite oppo's awaken the color marketing campaign for this i can't help it feels just a little bit well dull i'll tell you what though this actually kind of makes me miss last year's phone i think i've got it yes i do there it is it's almost like i prepared for this video this guy this is the oppo find x2 pro from last year in this very snazzy uh orange vegan leather design and love it or hate it it does kind of stand out but what do you reckon between these two which one do you think looks better let me know in the comments so i've really enjoyed using this for the past couple of weeks so i fully switched to it as my main phone and there's a whole lot to like here but spoiler alert after this review i'm probably gonna take my sim out and put it back in the s21 ultra well actually more likely the oneplus 9 pro but that's uh that's a different video that's not to say that this is a bad phone at all in fact is a really really good phone but i think for the price and what you're getting it just doesn't quite keep up with some of its rivals and uh well hopefully by the end of the review you'll either agree or if you indeed disagree and think i'm a complete idiot let me know in the comments as well and if you do enjoy the video don't forget to hit that like and subscribe button so this will set you back a cool 1099 pounds i would give you the dollar price but sadly it's not coming to the us at this point and that's the exact same price as the iphone 12 pro max and just 50 pounds less than the s21 ultra although once you factor in the x3 pro comes with 256 gigs of storage as standard which is great it's actually a hundred pounds cheaper than the equivalent samsung but that's still an awful lot of money for a brand that doesn't really have a whole lot of brand recognition here in the uk at least of course oppo is huge in china and asia but in the uk you've probably more likely heard of one plus than oppo still the x3 pro does a lot really well and you're getting flagship specs a beautiful 120 hertz quad hd plus 10 bit screen a premium albeit divisive design fantastic battery life and also one of the best cameras on any phone although i am almost shamed to admit it the standout for me is this 3 megapixel microscope lens which i've genuinely had a lot of fun with yes it's a little bit gimmicky and it can also be really awkward to use sometimes as the focus is so narrow as you're handshaking and you're trying to keep your subject in focus plus you'll probably end up forgetting about it after you've well shoved your camera into every surface around your house but it is genuinely unique and it's kind of fun to relive your honey i shrunk the kid fantasies so far so good then but if we dive a little bit deeper into this for the 1100 pound price tag we are missing a couple of features that you would expect firstly it's using older gorilla glass 5 rather than the latest victus which protects its rivals we're also not getting 8k video which is a bit odd because the snapdragon 8 chip does support it plus the selfie video around the front tops out at 1080p they've also downgraded the zoom from last year's find x2 pro the five times optical is now a two times optical although to be fair most people prefer closer range zoom anyway so that is a sensible choice but for this kind of money and looking at what samsung and huawei are doing why not both also this isn't actually something i expected but it's slower than every other snapdragon triple a phone i've tested it's not a nine day difference but in benchmarks and even some real world app launching tests it just falls behind a little bit and finally oppo says that they'll only support this with android and security updates for two years which isn't a lot when most big brands now are offering at least three but it's not all bad news and actually one of the surprising highlights for me of this is the battery life in fact i've just finished filming a big battery rundown test which includes a couple of phones i can't show you just yet hence the blur but despite having a smaller 4500mah battery versus the 5 000 million power cell on the samsung it came out they were neck and neck and in my real world experience by 11 pm i still have about 35 percent of my battery left and of course with the 65 watt super vook 2 charging 0 to 100 takes just 30 minutes plus we're also getting reasonably fast 15 watt wireless charging which we didn't get on last year's phone x2 pro this 6.7 inch screen is also one of the highlights of this phone in fact it's probably one of the best phones i've best phones best screens i've ever used on a phone it has an ever so slight curve just enough to look good but without any of the normal curvy accidental touching issues it's also bright peaking at nits with hdr it's an ltpo panel which means we get an adaptive refresh rate that can dynamically adjust between 5 and 120 hertz depending on what's on the screen and that goes a long way to help improve battery life but the real geeky stuff is the 10 bit support so the camera the software and the screen all support the wider color gamut uh and the 1 billion colors you get with a 10-bit display so you can snap a photo in 10-bit it'll save the file in a very awkward to use heif file format and then you can view it back on the screen with the full 1 billion colors compared to the usual 16 million you get with an 8-bit screen so it's technically very impressive and of course looking at videos and photos or even watching movies on this it looks incredible although i don't think this feature alone would be enough to convince me to upgrade as i say that heif file format is incredibly hard to work with don't expect to share or edit them as easily as a regular old jpeg and to be honest i'm hard-pressed to notice any difference that i can see at least between an 8-bit and a 10-bit photo that i've taken on the phone although that doesn't take away from the fact that the screen is just stunning to look at 10-bit or otherwise and particularly when you put it in quality resolution with that 120hz refresh mode and paired with the pretty slick coloros 11.2 software which is on top of android 11. the oppo is just lovely to use and i think overall their software has come a long way in the last few years although it's still not quite as lightweight or slick as say oneplus is oxygen os but it's not far behind okay let's talk about this camera because while this microscope lens you can see here with the ring light around it is fun what's actually more useful is the fact that both the main and the ultra wide lens use the exact same 50 megapixel camera the exact same sensor albeit with a slightly different aperture but the result is where you'd normally accept that ultra wide shots don't look quite as good as ones taken with the main camera here they look just as good as each other detail colors white balance so switching lenses while you're filming feels more seamless or if you're just taking an ultra wide photo because you want the wider field of view you're not sacrificing quality which i think is a really smart move and i'd love to see this set up on more phones however the telephoto lens feels like a bit of an afterthought we're getting a two times optical zoom with five times hybrid so it does struggle a long distance although up close it fares better but i still had a few issues with some photos lacking in detail so overall quality is really good and in my s21 ultra camera comparison it traded blows although ultimately i still prefer the samsung for its better zoom and its video options plus the oppo's colors were sometimes a little bit off some photos looked far too saturated and also in low light the white balance and a couple of shots completely missed the mark but most of the time i was pretty happy and finally around the front we get a 32 megapixel selfie camera here photos can look a little bit flat and lacking in detail sometimes and highlights often look overexposed and a bit blown out so there's definitely room for improvement but on the whole i still think it takes nice selfies so with all that said i do think the front xd pro is a great phone i really do but i don't know how many people would pick this over say the s21 ultra in fact let me know in the comments which one you would go for although bear in mind this is about 50 pounds cheaper and actually not only that because also at this price point as i say the exact same as the iphone 12 pro max i'm also expecting the upcoming oneplus 9 and 9 pro to undercut this and offer similar if not slightly better features so once again i'm a bit afraid that the x3 pro might just get forgotten about however with the microscopic camera the uncompromised ultra wide lens great battery life stunning screen and a design that at least sparks some debate you definitely won't be disappointed if you buy this and i think it's great to see some genuine competition to samsung's hold on the high-end android market but i think to be really competitive oppo just needs to be more aggressive with the price but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy one of these and if not well why not let me know in the comments below and if you did enjoy this video as i say give me a thumbs up and tap that subscribe button and the notification bell all those annoying things and i'll see you
