hey guys i'm someone tech chap and this is the brand new infinix note 12 vip very important and i have to be honest with you when i test phones like this which crams so much in for actually under 300 it really makes you think why do you need to spend more but first things first let's get this unboxed and that is over to you tom boom look at that seamless editing hollywood magic right there i'm sure you'll agree now on the back of the box we get some of the key specs of the note 12 vip you can also see this is the 256 gig storage model along with eight gigs of ram we also have some of the key specs on the front here including that 120 watt charging which i will show you later just how fast this charge is but i'll tell you what the first thing i thought when i unboxed this was how premium this felt for the price it kind of reminded me of another phone i recently reviewed one that rhymes with the tivo and also costs like three times more and it's also ridiculously thin now elsewhere in the box we have a protective case which is always welcome as well as stickers and an invitation to infinix's social club we also get a pair of earphones which is a nice little bonus as well as a usb-c to usb a cable and of course this 120 watt fast charger considering you don't even get a charger in the box with a lot of phones these days this is really good to see now this packs in a lot of tech but before anything else we have to talk about the charging because this is the world's thinnest phone that supports fast 120 watt charging now infinix claim you can fully charge the note 12 pro vip in just 17 minutes from zero to a hundred percent and well i want to put that to the test and straight away you can see we've got this kind of nifty charging animation but already just two and a half minutes into this test we're already at 21 which is pretty crazy actually and at five minutes we're up to 41 then at 10 minutes we're almost three quarters of the way there it's 73 percent and we're so close 95 at the 15 minute mark but look at that just 16 minutes 20 seconds to fully charge the phone so this was actually faster in my real world test than infinix's claim 17 minutes not too shabby just over 16 minutes to fully charge this and it costs under 300 and you get the charging bundle in the box you don't see that very often so this speed is only possible because we have a dual cell battery inside it's a 4500mah battery which is a little bit smaller than the infinix 12 which i tested a few months ago but we do have much faster speeds but just as importantly as the speed infinix are putting a lot of emphasis into the safety and also the longevity of the battery which is why they've added 103 different protection features and also they use materials with the charging that are uncorrosive and there's also 18 different thermal sensors that monitor the phone's temperature in real time to make sure that nothing is overheating and actually they've tested this in over 800 charging cycles and even after that it still retained 85 percent of his batteries so even if you charge this once a day for over two years you're still going to have most of your battery left which is particularly impressive because that's comparable with other phones on the market but that have much slower charging all in a phone that's just 7.89 millimeters thick and also it weighs just 189 grams which is pretty incredible actually given the fact we have this big 6.7 inch screen so let's talk about this display because again keeping that price in mind about 299 dollars we're getting this 6.7 inch full hd plus 120 hertz amoled screen and we're also getting 360 hertz touch sampling which makes gaming or indeed just any touch input feel more responsive the bezels are nice and thin with this small hole punch cut out at the top for the selfie camera around the back we have this big camera module with a triple lens setup and also this nice contrast between the glossy and matte finishes on the right side we have the power button which doubles as a fingerprint reader as well as the volume rocker we're also getting stereo speakers and a three and a half mil headphone jack and if i pop open the sim card tray you can see we get dual sim and micro sd card support so i've actually been playing a bit of apex legends which is now on the google play store and i've got to say it ran well it was a really good gaming experience the mediatek helio g96 is not by any means the fastest chip on the market but it is surprisingly capable and even these latest aaa games run really nicely and of course with that 360hz touch response and in games that support 120 hertz it's a really nice smooth experience what i would recommend doing though is jumping into the settings menu and then scrolling down to special function where we have lots of different modes and then in memory fusion you can see that we have this virtual ram option which takes some of the storage and then boosts the ram when it needs it particularly for speeding up apps that you regularly use now by default this is set to 3 gigs but i've changed it to 5 gigabytes because i don't really need all that storage especially as we also have that microsd support also while you're gaming you can swipe in to open up the game center which is where you can turn on screen recording turn off notifications and actually i think most importantly you can even assign the volume buttons to whatever you like in the game perhaps looking down your site or reloading your gun so we're essentially getting a proper shoulder trigger for gaming okay let's talk about this camera and we're getting a 108 megapixel main lens with a one over 6.7 inch sensor and also uses nine into one pixel binning so again considering the price this is actually quite impressive and that's alongside a 13 megapixel ultra wide lens and also a 2 megapixel depth lens and in good light i think it does a pretty good job here are some snaps i've taken over the last few days as i've been using and testing the note 12 vip and i've come away pleasantly surprised although one criticism i do have is the video the stabilization even at 1080p it's pretty shaky so that is one thing you'd like to see improved next time now while we are talking room for improvement uh there is still quite a lot of bloatware on the phone pre-installed apps but you can always just remove them or hide them i do also appreciate that actually helps infinix keep the cost of the phone a little bit lower because they make some money from that and also as i say the battery has shrunk from 5000 lane powers on the infinix 12 to 4 500. we do of course get the much faster charging while still in a nice thin chassis but as i say a big battery is always nicer as well but having said that let's take a step back for a second three hundred dollars there abouts for a 6.7 inch 120 hertz amoled screen with a high touch sampling rate with a triple camera setup 108 megapixel main lens micro sd card and dual sim headphone jack fast charger in the box in fact this is the world's thinnest 120 watt charging phone as well as up to eight gigs of ram plus the memory fusion to boost it up to 256 gigs of storage and also a pretty nice looking design obviously we don't have 5g the g96 chip doesn't support it and also it's not the fastest processor in the world but it's still pretty capable i still think on the whole this is one of the best value phones you can buy and if you do fancy checking this out for yourself then i'll leave a link in the description below and if you've got any questions at all let me know in the comments thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat you
