hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is the brand spanking new oneplus nord ce25g and oneplus challenged me to go to iceland for the most epic unboxing ever and to put the nord ce2 5g through its paces with three incredible challenges to find out if this really is the new mid-range killer so the nord is all about oneplus going back to their roots their goal of sharing the best technology with the world and the ce or core edition goes a step further packing some impressive tech into a cheap package but we'll come back to that all i can say right off the bat though is that this is more affordable more accessible and gives you a little more than you expect for the price so a big thank you to oneplus for partnering with me on this epic video and also make sure you stay to the end as i'll be telling you how you can win one of these there will be a giveaway but first let's see if this phone can live up to its name i'm gonna need this come with me [Music] welcome to the nord pole it's actually iceland but it's a lot more fun to say north pole and i'm here in this epic beautiful country with this epic phone i've got the oneplus nord ce25g it is very cold right now and i get this unboxed but really we've come to our true north just to see what this can do this is definitely the most extreme unboxing extremely cold unboxing the things i do for you guys i think i've ever done but i think the phone's gonna be worth it i've never done an unboxing in front of a boiling geezer before but here we are in the box just quickly famous oneplus cable you can even join the red cable club now uh and actually really importantly this guy the new supervooc charger this is actually a really big deal we'll talk about charging later on but this thing charges ridiculously fast but now for the best bit actually unwrapping this guy that is beautiful look at that the way the light hits it so this is the bahama blue there is also a mirror grey if you want a little bit more understated and you can definitely see the sort of design inspiration coming from the flagship oneplus phones definitely feels more premium than the price and actually that is by far the most exciting part of this phone it starts from 349 euros or in the uk 299 quid less than 300 quid for that and bear that in mind as we talk about the specs and we put it through its paces for today you also notice on the bottom here three and a half mil headphone jack you don't see that nearly enough anymore and actually on these more affordable phones i know a lot of people want it especially the oneplus community we've also got stereo speakers dolby atmos tuned it is a 6.43 inch display so really nice comfortable size and on the back main lens ultra wide and then a selfie a 16 megapixel selfie on the front as i wipe away the raindrops you can see this is super thin it's just 7.8 mil thick actually that's the slimmest phone since the oneplus 6t also nice and lightweight and actually well i don't want to pop out the tray right here we do have dual sim 5g of course and it supports microsd card so you can expand the storage so for under 300 quid this thing's packed with features you really are getting a little more than you'd expect i'll tell you what i really do appreciate about oneplus though is they do actually listen if you go into the settings on the phone you'll see credits to people you know everyday users who suggest things and then they implement changes the headphone jack the expandable storage stereo speakers all those nice things but then also obviously with oxygen os for me that's one of the big reasons to buy a oneplus bloatware free no horrible pre-installed apps really really fast since we are in iceland we should probably put to the test as well not just unbox it let's take some photos and test this camera out [Music] so i'm sure you're the same as me one of the most important features on any phone is the camera so with this we have a 64 megapixel main lens 8 megapixel ultra wide no telephoto on this one but you can see we get this beautiful landscape with the ultra wide 0.6 times zoom so some pretty good specs considering the price and actually it goes a little bit further because we have this ai enhanced camera so this uses a mediatek demensity 900 chip part of that is something called the dora ai architecture door the explorer maybe even and what that can do is use things like the accelerometer and just basically enhance the camera a bit beyond what you might expect for this hardware so we've got dedicated night modes for low light obviously now if we switch over to video this can shoot in up to 4k30 with the rear camera but we do also get some ai smarts as well so if you tap this little button we get ai highlight video now particularly in low light or at night time this actually comes in really handy uh to improve the lighting to stabilize the white balance so it doesn't flicker as much really really nice although it does limited to 1080p you've also got this ultra studio mode again at 10tp much better if you're walking around or walking off a geezer in iceland or something or a mountain really quite a nice setup and lots of options and then finally of course on the front say hi everyone 16 megapixel selfie and i do quite like this little uh notification led there so everyone knows where to look i hate when you get phones and you just can't see where the selfie camera is so overall a nice little setup what do you reckon [Music] the geezer was intense but we've now driven up to a glacier what am i doing here snowmobiles should we go on one of those [Music] this is insane but i want to talk about what's powering this thing because inside we have the mediatek density 900 chip which is not only faster than last year the usual ce but also more power efficient that's paired with eight gigs of ram 128 gigs of storage plus microsd of course but that's only part of the story because we've got that 90 hertz refresh rate screen as well and that's a full hd plus allowed 90 hertz and then of course on top of that you've got oxygen os so no bloatware really lightweight and even on the back covered snowmobile i can just about see what i'm doing here but it's just like it's so fast [Laughter] how has it come to this [Music] oh my goodness i'm exhausted oh what a day i've never done snowball bailey before i've never seen a geyser before that was incredible i've actually never been to iceland either and if you haven't i definitely recommend it absolutely beautiful country and also some local delicacies uh are here in front of me with some uh well i've been told this is a kind of sheep's head pate i think it's called uh sveta solta that's actually quite nice uh but back to the phone that's why we're here we are looking at 60 battery life left and i've been abusing this pretty hard today and actually really interestingly it's got a dual cell design 500 million powers and so with this superfood charger 65 watts it actually means we can top this up for a day's use in 15 minutes or to 100 in half an hour which is not something you see very often in a phone in this price range it's a really unique phone and you just don't get these kind of features at this price point very often so i've got a few more thoughts it's been a long day so come back with me to the [Applause] studio okay we're back now when my friends and family ask me what phone should they buy very rarely are they looking for a recommendation of a phone that costs over a grand you know like one of these proper flagships that are just so ridiculously expensive so i'm always looking for the best mid-range phone and so when oneplus asked if i wanted to go on this epic uh unboxing adventure with them in iceland for the nord ce2 well i jumped at the chance normally i unbox and test phones here in the studio with you know heating i've never done it by an exploding geyser before which was actually an incredible sight and also very very cold and then the second challenge of actually using this and seeing how fast it was while on the back of a snowmobile in a complete white house blizzard by a glacier i was told the glacier was there but i couldn't see anything i think we drove three hours to what seemed like the middle of nowhere and i couldn't see anything it was a very surreal experience but you know what this was the hero it survived everything we threw at it and it performed really well actually and then for the third challenge back at the hotel where we had some icelandic delicacies i think maybe i was the hero for that one but we saw the super fast charging and the fact that it still had a good amount of battery left after the end of a really long day in freezing conditions it really did stand up to the challenge of course when you are making a phone at this price point there are certain choices you have to make for example we don't get an official ip rating although it can withstand places and cope with light drizzles and clearly it survived the onslaught of my icelandic adventure in fact oneplus told me that all their devices go through durability and water resistance tests so the oneplus nord c25g can withstand splashes and easily cope with sweat moisture and light drizzles with no damage also in my experience video stabilization when recording at 4k is all right it's fine but really i would suggest uh filming at 1080p most of the time it's a lot smoother with that eis we also don't get wireless charging and some competitors do offer 120 hertz versus the 90 we get on here and it's a small point but the slightly thicker chin at the bottom means the bezel is a little bit asymmetrical but that's about all the negatives i can find with this but what i would say is while this does have strong competition what keeps me coming back to oneplus is that lightweight bloat-free software oxygen os it just makes such a difference to how nice this feels to use and in your daily life the experience of using the phone is what you'll notice and so together with the new chip the solid camera and impressive charging the oneplus 9 ce2 5g really does give you a little more than you'd expect so is this the new mid-range killer well quite possibly i need to do more tests and proper camera comparisons and benchmarks and things but first impressions are very good and like those top gear or grand tour specials where they become really attached to the cars they've been driving through the challenges i become pretty attached to this as well now at the start i did mention a giveaway and all you have to do is head on over to oneplus uk's instagram account make sure you follow them and you'll see a post on how to win and also link to it in the description below this video and i'll also
