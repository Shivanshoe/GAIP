...that's the card then we've gone for oh my 
goodness that was close this desk is too small   anyway how much do you actually need to spend to 
get yourself an awesome rig for 1080p or 1440p   gaming and i'm not talking about bargain basement 
to get you by i mean something that gets you high   frame rates and aaa titles at high settings has 
the latest tech looks great runs cool and quiet   and every component has great reviews could 
you actually do it for around a thousand   pounds well it turns out yes actually but only 
just hey guys i'm Tom The Tech Chap [ __ ] and   i'm just about squeezing into my little pc setup 
here i definitely need to get a bigger desk but   as you guys know building or upgrading your pc 
can be very very expensive uh not least because   components right now are just ridiculous in terms 
of the pricing but also when you actually come to   spec what you want it's really easy just to go 
well if i spend an extra 30 pounds or 40 pounds   for a slightly better cpu or gpu then it just goes 
on and on and eventually you're looking at two or   three grand for a pc so i set myself a challenge 
what would be the best pc that i would buy and   build uh hand-picked specs for around a thousand 
pounds or so and this well this is what i've come   up with here and actually i'm really really 
happy with that it turns out you can actually   build yourself a great pc assuming the components 
are in stock without completely breaking the bank   so the real key here is a great value cpu and gpu 
combination and i've gone for this six core 12   thread intel i5 11400f and also nvidia's rtx 3060. 
now the 360 in here packs a pretty serious punch   and then pairing it with one of intel's 
new lower end chips like this i5 actually   is a bit of a performance bargain compared to 
their higher tier models and also ryzen chips   which actually can't compete at this price and 
despite the moderate price this actually has   quite a few nice extras that makes it feel much 
more expensive for example we've got this great   looking mesh fronted mid tower pc a fast nvme 
one terabyte ssd 16 gigs of speedy megahertz ram   wi-fi 6e corsa rgb fans with a controller hub as 
well as an aftermarket cooler on the gpu i've got   the kf a2 360 model here along with a great 
cpu cooler and also a fully modular watt psu   but i know what you're thinking tom that 
sounds great but where can you actually buy   a card like the 36e for retail price this kf a2 
card should cost you about 330 pounds but right   now on ebay and on a lot of websites it's double 
that or more i think the technical term is a bit   of a show actually but i've gone ahead with 
the build anyway for a few reasons one because   if you are buying now on a budget this is still a 
great example of the kind of system you could get   even at inflated prices two if you're watching 
this maybe in the future at a time when the market   has calmed down a bit and also three if you've 
got the patience to put in multiple pre-orders and   maybe keep an eye on stock refreshes from 
retailers then there is a chance you can   snag yourself a gpu for something close to retail 
prices so let's dig in a little bit deeper because   the best part of building a new pc is choosing 
the components going through pc park picker and   different retailers spending hours and hours going 
between different components figuring out what you   can afford and what will work well with your build 
honestly that's the best part of it that's the   most fun for me however while i wanted to keep 
this as close to that 1000 budget as possible   if i were you i would definitely pay the extra 80 
pounds or so to get the 3060 ti which is a good 20   to 25 faster than the 360. and definitely worth 
it if you're playing at 1440 and you can still   pair it with the i5 11 400 or eleven six hundred 
but whatever your setup looks like i definitely   recommend using surf shark vpn it genuinely is the 
only vpn i use i have installed on all my devices   and it just helps keep you safe online blocking 
ads and malware hides your location and there's   some fun stuff as well i can go from my uk netflix 
then log into say a new york server and then i get   access to the us netflix and you can get south 
shark on pretty much every platform there's even   a handy chrome extension tool so if you do fancy 
giving this a try click the link below or use the   code tech chat at the checkout to get 83 off and 
also three months extra for free and if you're not   convinced then they also have a 100 money back 
guarantee so why not give surf shark vpn a try   but as you guys know it's not just about 
the raw performance with these cards   really the big magical leap forward in terms 
of performance is dlss the deep learning super   sampling and it's just incredible stuff and really 
the biggest reason if you are still rocking a 10   series or older to upgrade if you can and to be 
honest it's essential for getting playable frame   rates out of games like cyberpunk especially if 
you are gonna turn on ray tracing as well and it   also boosts others like fortnite into proper high 
refresh territory dlss is genuinely the best thing   since sliced bread i just realized never actually 
took the side off let me give you a better view   so that's the card then we've gone oh my goodness 
anyway as for the cpu i've gone with intel's 11th   gen i5 11 400 f i think i've got that right 
which costs about 150 pounds 150 dollars and   i think it's a really good value chip it's fast 
and being six core with 12 threads it's good for   both gaming and productivity and also crucially it 
won't bottleneck the 3060. now the only downside   with the 11400f is it's non-overclockable but 
if you want to spend an extra 80 pounds or so   you could get yourself the 11 600 k or kf which 
do support overclocking as well as having faster   clock speeds so that would be a good choice if 
you can afford it and pay a little bit extra over   the thousand pound budget of this build of course 
you could consider team red with say amd's 5600x   uh which is competitive to the 11600 from intel 
but really value i don't think anything can beat   the 11400 right now as for the motherboard 
i've gone with msi's mag b560m mortar i know   what you're thinking it's micro atx why spend 
extra for that but it didn't need to be this   just fits my feature criteria and my budget and 
also b560 boards are really good value offering   most of what you get from a full fat z590 except 
for overclocking and with fewer pci4 lanes but the   pci4 graphics card slot is still a time 16 but 
then you only have one pci 4 m2 slot but we are   getting some nice extras as i say like wi-fi 6e 
plenty of usb ports on the back including a type c   along with rgb headers although for this build 
i did need an extra fan connector hub but i'll   tell you what when it comes to picking a pc case 
there's only really two things i think about the   price and does it have a mesh front you can get 
some beautiful high-end uh glass or plastic builds   but unless you have a ton of fans and some good 
cooling elsewhere really for this kind of budget   you're gonna want a mesh front so you've got that 
good airflow through the fans onto your components   and therefore you get the best performance so 
that's why i've gone with the phanteks p360a   we've got mesh front and top it's a good size i 
like this white color as well and it doesn't cost   a fortune we also get this tempered glass side 
panel and it comes with two rgb fans as well as   an rgb strip along the side and i found it really 
easy to build in with plenty of room for the gpu   downsides well there's no usbc or dust filter 
on the front and also the build quality is good   rather than amazing as for ram i went with 16 
gigs of crucial ballistics 3600 megahertz which   is actually pretty fast for a budget build like 
this although only cost me a few pounds extra   over the 3 000 megahertz and if you do want a 
bit of go faster rgb then i'd spend around 15   quid extra for something like corsair's vengeance 
rgb pro or similar for storage i went with the   data one terabyte pci three drive it's not pci4 
but it's still seriously quick and you can always   swap it out later now as much as i really do like 
a good all-in-one water cooler if you're scrimping   and saving you really can't beat the value of a 
good old-fashioned tower air cooler and i think be   quiet make some of the best ones and sure enough i 
couldn't even hear this over the other system fans   there are plenty of other options at this price 
range but this is a solid well-reviewed choice   as for fans well first i was going to go with 
the noctua sf12b redux these shift a ton of air   and also being noctua they do it quietly and at 
this price i think they're a steel problem is   i'm a bit of a sucker for rgb which is why 
instead i went with these corsair sp 120 elites   which also comes bundled with their node core 
rgb controller but i think as long as you're   not spending a fortune adding a bit of color and 
flare to your pc is all the more fun and actually   these fans help illuminate the interior and make 
this look like a much more expensive setup these   two cost a little bit more but you are getting 
three fans and i also move the bundled fans up   into the roof although of course they won't work 
with corsair's iq control app for the power supply   i went with the evga supernova 650 g3 nvidia 
recommends a 550 watt system with the 360s so i   think 650 is fine so i expect it i've built it now 
how well does it actually perform in games well   i've actually tested a ton with this and in nearly 
every case you can expect a solid 60 to 100 fps at   quad hd with max settings in pretty much any game 
you throw at it and also my quick overclock got me   anywhere from a five to twelve percent fps boost 
so there you have it the official mid-range-ish a   thousand pounds thereabouts tech chap recommended 
build and if you do fancy buying or building this   for yourself i'll put links to every component 
i've used below and while i will admit that i am   no master pc builder i'm no pc centric uh marcus 
would definitely uh show me up if he built one of   these himself but everyone's different everyone's 
budget is different and also depending on   where you live the availability of these actual 
components well who knows so uh yeah i'll leave   links below check them out hopefully you can get 
them for a good deal and build yourself a tasty   little budget pc like this thanks for watching 
hit that subscribe button if you want to see more   from me and i'll catch you next time right here on 
the tech chat oh and just quickly don't forget to   check out surfsharkvpn i've left a link below 
use the code techchap to get 83 off and three   extra months for free and even though they are 
sponsoring this i would genuinely recommend them
