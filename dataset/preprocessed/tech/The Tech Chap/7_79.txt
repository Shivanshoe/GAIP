hey guys i'm tunnel tech chap and this is the brand new infinix zero x pro and as you might be able to tell this is not my usual studio in fact i've come with infinix to the royal observatory here in greenwich london home of well time with greenwich mean time which has acted as a reference for all other times around the world and also a bloody great big telescope although this one is more of a museum piece now this is what they actually use much smaller and more modern and so here's a picture of our lovely moon and another and i'm sure you'll agree they're pretty decent especially as it was taken on this not a fancy telescope handheld no edits taken in central london with up to a 60 time zoom in this super moon camera mode and it costs around 319 plus it fits in your pocket okay to be fair the telescopes at the observatory are maybe a touch better and also a big thank you to dr emily drabek maunder expert astronomer from the observatory who showed me around and put up with my stupid questions i call myself the tech chap but i wouldn't this is like well so this is the annie monder astrographic telescope okay or a map for shorts this particular 14-inch telescope it gives us a high-resolution view of um solar system objects like the moon sun and planets but the point is even if it's not something you'd use all the time it is pretty cool to have this capability in a phone and particularly one that's this affordable okay let's bring this back to earth and this is the xerox pro it's infinix's flagship in the new zero x range and while it's not currently planned to be released here in the uk sadly you will be able to buy it internationally for about 320 i really do hope they properly launch these soon here in the uk as their incredible value for money [Music] specs wise we have a big full hd plus 120 hertz amoled screen and it's nice to have both the high refresh and the amoled on a phone in this price range around the back we have a triple camera setup with a 108 megapixel main lens an ultra wide and a telephoto with a five times optical zoom we do get a headphone jack which is great to see and it also supports dual sim and a micro sd card to expand the storage the only downside is we don't get 5g support there's this little hole punch cut out for the selfie camera and also for unlocking we have an in-screen fingerprint reader and you've also got face unlocking there's definitely a theme here i think because i've got the xerox pro in nebula black which has a sparkly night sky design on the back kind of like the milky way galaxy it's usually pretty subtle but in the right lighting it really can pop and it kind of feels like you're holding a galaxy in your hands now on the inside we have a mediatek helio g95 which is definitely more of a mid-range chip but it handled everything i threw at it that's paired with eight gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage and finally powering everything we have a good size 4 500 million power battery plus we have that fast 45 watt charger bundled in the box so it's a pretty good all-rounder and actually android 11 with infinix's xos software on top is nice and fast there's a decent amount of customization and extra functions to play with i actually really like this smart panel menu that you can swipe in from either side for your most use apps and functions now personally i prefer having the google news feed left of my home screen but this zero screen has some pretty handy widgets and feeds it's also par for the course that there's a fair few pre-installed apps but you can of course just hide or remove the ones that you don't want okay let's talk about this camera because this is usually where we see more affordable phones really fall down but in my experience over the past couple of weeks with this i've been genuinely impressed with how good it is you've got the 0.6 times ultrawide the main lens and then the five times telephoto which you can digitally punch in up to 60 times there's a whole bunch of other modes as well including this short video mode for 15 second clips with a variety of filters and so on maybe one for the kids ai cam is your default photo mode and has scene and object recognition plus you can shoot in the full 108 megapixels if you do want the highest resolution i also quite like that beauty is its own separate mode so i don't have to turn all that off in the main camera mode super knight does a really good job in low light scenes with longer exposures and as you can see side by side it makes a world of difference versus a regular photo but wait there's more because if you swipe up there's tons of other options here but certainly one of the most eye-catching is super moon and you can go from five to sixty times zoom and then this little reticule will go green when it's locked on and you can snap a surprisingly good luna photo you'd struggle to get this quality on most phones perhaps something like the galaxy s20 on ultra could give it some competition but that's also five times the price up front we have an eight megapixel selfie camera i wouldn't say it's anything to write home about but in good light it does a decent job and finally video tops out at 4k 30 and detail and dynamic range is solid but as you can see it is a little bit shaky and surprisingly dropping down to 1080p doesn't make that much difference to it although this is filmed with pre-release camera software so updates may improve things so overall i think the infinix 0x pro is a properly good all-round phone i know that's a bit of a cliche term but this does do everything you need i mean it looks good it's fast enough has surprisingly good cameras a lovely 120 hertz amoled screen a headphone jack don't forget and even if you aren't bothered about moon shots for 320 or so i think it's incredible value for money if they could have added one of mediatek's newer dimension chips with 5g support maybe a second speaker and slightly more stabilized video that would have been ideal of course but at this price point it is all about balance here's a challenge for you though next time you have a clear night sky take the best moonshot you can with your current phone and let me know how it turns out in the comments or you can tag me on twitter at the tech chat and see if you can take a better photo than this but what do you think of the xerox pro would you be tempted to buy it let me know in the comments below and again a huge thank you to infinix and the royal observatory greenwich for helping make this video happen cheers for watching guys i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat and probably back at the studio this must be fun do you ever just come up here and just play absolutely i mean you know it's just one of those things when it is a clear day which you know a lot of times in london no you've chosen a terrible place for it um but you know we just uh open it up and and try to observe what we can when we can it's amazing it's incredible
