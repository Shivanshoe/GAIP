[Music] so [Music] all right let's do this hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this ridiculous monster of a tv on my living room wall is the new lg g1 oled evo tv i've got the top end 77 inch model here and it's absolutely stunning as you would hope for the hefty sum of 4 800 pounds so that is an awful lot of money but when you consider that last year's equivalent g10 cost 6 000 pounds in a world of phones laptops graphics cards getting more and more expensive the fact that this is 20 cheaper and also better than last year's model you can't really argue with that and that's before any discounts or sales coming later in the year and in fact all three 55 65 and 77 inch models are significantly cheaper than before however you are still paying a premium for the g series aka the gallery design and there's a couple of reasons for that oh and by the way if you guys do enjoy the video then a cheeky like and subscribe would be amazing cheers so what makes the g series and this g1 special well firstly it has this nifty super low profile wall mounting bracket both the tv and the bracket are exactly the same design as last year's g10 but it means the tv can sit flush against the wall and it is all thanks to this guy now you don't actually get any feet included although there are some optional extras although they sit right at the edge of the screen so if you are getting a bigger model then well make sure you've got a big tv stand as well but the gallery really is designed to be wall mounted although i have to say that routing the cables and then hiding them can be a little bit finicky i still wish lg would offer a separate i o box but once you're all set it looks incredible and there's just no wasted space [Music] i am actually moving house in a few weeks but at the moment my living room space is pretty small what i like about this is that if i had a regular 77 inch tv on my tv stand because it would be a couple of feet forward it would look even well more excessive for the size room i'm in but because this is wall mounted and just a little bit further back from where i sit which is actually right here i can just about get away with having the bigger screen size although as you can see i do still have this tv stand and a sound bar because while the tv's built-in speakers are pretty good they do lack in bass so i would recommend pairing this with a good sound bar or speaker system especially as the hdmi ports support the higher quality erc standard as well as dolby atmos but now there's another big reason why you may want to spend the extra cash on a g or even a z series is these two are the only models to feature lg's next generation oled evo technology and this combines the evolution of the panel and also the new processor to give us a brighter and higher quality picture now what's interesting is that i actually only measured about a 10 higher peak brightness over last year's g10 but across the full screen i measured up to 20 higher brightness which does make a difference so i think lg's marketing is actually pretty bang on by calling this the oled evo it's an evolution rather than a revolution and really it's the cherry on top of a tv that delivers a stunning picture with the same inky colors and impressive viewing angles as you would expect from a selfless oled where each pixel can turn itself on and off oh and actually if you haven't watched it yet definitely check out above all mankind on apple tv i've just finished season two and that whole show feels like it was made for oled so it's cheaper it's brighter and we're also getting a new processor with this it's the uh let me get this right the alpha 9 gen 4 ai processor 4k catchy now it's always a little bit tricky to show this stuff off as it's partly just about the tv detecting what you're watching and then automatically choosing the right picture in cell modes and it's also partly about ai upscaling using lg's deep learning tech to identify faces and now objects and environments to enhance the picture and prioritize what we're focusing on so that's all well and good but aside from maybe when this automatically switches to uh filmmaker mode or game optimizer it's hard to really tangibly see the difference with these ai of scaling features you kind of just have to trust it's working behind the scenes and giving you the best optimized image for what you're watching although side note the ai improvements don't apply to certain copyrighted content or with say games consoles or pcs however even if the effect is only subtle i do still leave the ai modes turned on and then just forget about it and that's kind of the point the only options you really need to think about are the picture modes and i would recommend using the isf expert bright or dark modes most of the time although by default i do find them a little bit too warm so i adjusted to a more neutral color temperature but i do also have auto filmmaker mode enabled so when i watch movies it switches to this which is ideal for you know movie purists in terms of color accuracy and also turning off all the background processing the most obvious change this year though is this it's the whole new full screen dashboard we're running on web os 6 which replaces the uh well pretty familiar pop-up dashboard that we were used to and now we get this full screen home page and the idea is the more you use it the more curated and relevant the recommended content will be essentially it'll figure out what you like to watch so it's more about the tv finding the content for you rather than you having to navigate all the apps and find it yourself but i have to be honest i don't know if i love this new full screen dashboard firstly because as you can see i appreciate it's a bit out of focus but it takes a few seconds to populate everything because there's so much content on screen i also prefer the pop-up dashboard from before as it meant you could still watch what was playing in the background and also i just don't know why the top third of the screen needs to be dedicated to the weather and some hints and tips for using the tv i mean it's not bad i just liked how it was before although i might get used to it and also as i do use it for longer hopefully these suggestions will become more personalized to me i just kind of wish maybe there was an option to have either the full screen mode or just that sort of lower third or lower quarter pop-up dashboard that we're used to oh and also i have found adverts to be a little bit more pervasive now but if you jump into the settings menu you can turn off tracking and promotional ads for the home screen so it's a relatively easy fix but it's not just about this home screen because web os 6 also streamlines the menus we still have the same quick settings bar where you can jump between picture and sound modes but then we also have this new look full settings menu which feels a lot more streamlined and easy to navigate all the important options and modes are front and center but you can still go deep and fiddle around but as you can see we've also got this new grey theme to the ui including the magic pointer speaking of which we also have this all new magic remote and actually this is the first big redesign of this in quite a few years actually here is the previous one which you may be familiar with if i can bring it to the camera i actually really like it it does feel similar in the hand but this deeper groove underneath for your finger is more comfortable and there's just lots of little refinements that make it look and feel better to use we do still have this dedicated mic button but unique to the g series is the fact that we have far field microphones built in so what we can do is go hey lg switch to ps5 did you hear the beep and there we have it ps5 is ready to go which very neatly brings me into the next question of is this a good gaming tv well this won't take long because as we've come to expect from lg the gaming credentials for this are top notch this is genuinely one of the very best gaming tvs you can buy 4k 120 hertz variable refresh rates all to latency modes g-sync freesync premium fast response times and with four full fat hdmi 2.1 ports around the back this is perfect for your series x or your ps5 or even your gaming pc particularly if you have one of the latest rtx 3000 series cards with a 2.1 port one of the coolest features though is this game optimizer menu which shows you whether the game is using g-sync or freesync or the variable refresh and you can even adjust the picture modes to suit different games so fps for example brightens the shadows and makes it a little bit easier to see your enemies i mean i'll take any help i can get so all together the g1 is an incredible tv as you would expect although i would say it's more of a modest upgrade coming from last year's g10 but at the same time it's also significantly cheaper as i mentioned in the beginning better and cheaper is like the best combination so that flush wall-mounting gallery design the higher brightness and all the bells and whistles you'd expect from a flagship tv for both well watching tv and just as importantly to me gaming my only two wishes would be having maybe a separate i o box it would just make the cabling and hiding it all a little bit easier and also perhaps that option to have either the full screen or just a lower third dashboard but aside from that i'm loving every minute with the g1 and if you do want to check this out for yourself i will leave a link in the description below but what about you what tv are you using at the moment and also if you are thinking maybe about upgrading this year what model would you go for let me know in the comments below and also if you've got any questions at all about the g1 or lg's oled range again let me know in the comments i read every single one and i'll do my best to answer it thank you so much for watching guys tap that subscribe button and ding that bell to be the first to see my new videos and i'll see you guys next time right here on the tech chat
