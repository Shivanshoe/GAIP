hey guys i'm thomas techchap and this is the oneplus nord well in here this is the fancy reviewers packaging uh we have the regular retail box in here so uh for this video i thought i'd do a quick unboxing for you guys uh if i actually can do that and give you a bit of a sort of walk through of what's new first impressions and just an idea of what actually the nord is with nord basically being like one plus coming back to their roots they say like nord is sort of north it's like their true north as you guys know oneplus phones have been getting better and better but also more expensive so the oneplus nord starts at just 379 pounds here in the uk or 399 euros with the higher spec version for 469. now considering the oneplus 8 starts at 599 that's a good deal cheaper pull this down and there we have it so this is as you can see a genuine unboxing i've not even seen this phone yet except for my little virtual pre-briefing last week so i'm actually pretty excited for this and you can see on the front there in this matte black text we've got nord written there so let's open this up and there we have it this way this way nord so let's open the plastic oh look at that look at that blue marble that's shiny so you can see straight away this is quite a unique design actually they've gone with a glossy shiny back here but which one do you think looks better the nord or the oneplus 8 let me know in the comments below although of course bear in mind this should be a good deal cheaper so if we put this down just for one second and have a little look in the box and as usual with the oneplus phone we get this clear sort of rubbery plastic case which actually has a bit more of a design on it than usual that's how it looks so this comes in the box you don't have to go out and bind on the case if you don't want to which is a nice touch it looks pretty good and then we have the usual usb a to usbc charger cable as well as the power plug this is the uk outlet model and it also supports the warp charge 30t technology so the same as the oneplus 8 we still have oneplus signature little uh what do you even call that vibrators silent mode toggle which i really like i use that before i go to bed every night to put it into silent mode we've got this dual hole punch cut out the top which is quite reminiscent of the huawei p40 pro with its dual cameras up there camera module on the side it's a quad camera setup we'll come to in a second and importantly i know a lot of you guys will be pleased to hear this we have a flat screen no headphone jack unfortunately but on the bottom we have the dual sim card slot as well as the usb-c port the speaker grille although unfortunately the nord doesn't have stereo speakers this little one up here is just the earpiece for calls so that's a little bit disappointing we also don't get any form of ip rating here although oneplus say it will survive in 30 centimeters of water for up to 30 seconds so it's splash proof basically once you're up and running though with android 10 oxygen os 10.5 and a 90 hertz screen it feels fast responsive it really is lovely to use left of the home screen is the google news feed and during the setup you can choose between the nav keys or gestures which i prefer although the first thing i do is jump into the customization menu then change to the dark tone you can actually fiddle around with a whole bunch of different options here so you can really make it your own then i go into the display settings screen calibration and i like to change it to amoled wide color gamma under the advanced settings so the screen itself is a 6.44 inch full hd plus 90 hertz fluid amoled display it's a tiny bit smaller than the oneplus 8 but the most obvious change is this bigger hole punch cutout we also get an optical fingerprint reader under the screen plus there's the usual face unlocking which i tend to use so far so good then but let's talk specs and as you can see we're getting the snapdragon 765g here which is the first time we're not getting a flagship chip in a oneplus does it really make a difference well i'll leave that for my full review but importantly we are still getting 5g support with this so even though it's a mid-range phone that does make it a little bit more future-proof now of course i'll run full benchmarks and comparisons in my proper review but i do think that we focus too much on you know geekbench scores when in reality when you have fast lightweight software like this and you're not pushing a quad hd 120 hertz screen this may well be all you need the good news though is they haven't really compromised on the ram and storage the node comes in two different flavors uh we have the eight gig model eight gig of ram plus 128 storage and also the 12 gig of ram 256 storage option which i have here which is great although bear in mind that they are slightly slower it's the ufs 2.1 and lp ddrx4 ram as opposed to ufs3 and 5 ram plus having a less power hungry chip and also combined with this full hd resolution and the 90 hertz screen rather than say 120 hertz may actually help conserve battery because inside we get a 415 milliamp hour battery which is a little bit smaller than the 4300 milliamp hour cell in the oneplus 8 so we'll have to see how long this lasts with some proper testing in my full review and of course then we get the 30 watt charging oneplus is 30t warp charger uh which as i say will get you 70 in half an hour but unfortunately it doesn't support any kind of wireless charging which is a bit disappointing and finally let's talk about this camera setup starting with the front and for the first time on a oneplus we get two selfie cameras a 32 megapixel main lens and an 8 megapixel ultra wide round the back we get a 48 megapixel main lens and an 8 megapixel ultra wide we can zoom in but it's a two times digital zoom as we don't have that dedicated telephoto lens but instead we have a two megapixel macro and a five megapixel depth sensor which should help with more natural bokeh blowing shots importantly though the main lens is using the sony imx 586 sensor which is the same one as the more expensive oneplus 8. now as well as my full review i'll be doing camera comparisons with the nord so do let me know in the comments below what phones you'd like to see tested against this so i guess you could think of this as a kind of oneplus 8 lights although i do appreciate they went with the nord name it's a little bit different and it also suggests they're going back to their you know true north of having a good phone that is good value as well because that's always what oneplus we're about you know more choice is good i love seeing great budget phones although this has a lot of competition so do stay tuned for my full review this was just more like a extended unboxing uh which i hope you guys found useful if you do want to see more from me and of course watch those camera comparisons and battery tests and all that good stuff make sure you do hit that subscribe button below but what do you reckon of the oneplus nord would you be tempted to buy one of these yourself or not let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat you
