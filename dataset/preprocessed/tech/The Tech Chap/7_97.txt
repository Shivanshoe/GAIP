hey guys i'm tom of techchap and what do you think of the new studio well it will be the new studio in about two months when it's been converted from what is uh currently a very dark and damp garage this is gonna be the new space it's about two or three times bigger than the rooms i've been using in the past although currently i am working out of the guest bedroom in my house i recently moved so it's a bit of a temporary setup at the moment but yeah i can't wait to show you guys this if you've got any ideas for sort of decorating or sets or how i should actually make this space what it should be then do let me know in the comments right now i've just got some contractors to come in to make it habitable but beyond that it's uh well it's up to us really what we want to do with it which is quite exciting but in the meantime i still thought i'd give you a bit of a home setup tour a house tour and not just talk about the phones and laptops i use because we talk about that all the time but some of the other smart home tech that i have around the good stuff stuff you don't really need and if you've got any great home tech recommendations that maybe i've missed let me know in the comments below okay first up i'm using the ring video doorbell 3. now there is a 4 which adds pre-roll capture but it's not really a big difference and this thing will set you back about 160 pounds and we get a 1080p camera and two-way audio so you can give instructions to delivery drivers when you're out or you can just use it as a bit of a security camera and see what's going on outside in the stream i bought the plug-in chime as well so it's fully replaced my doorbell plus i have the app which pings me whenever someone rings the door although i must admit i do find the app a bit finicky i often completely miss notifications for some reason and the design itself is a bit chunky and not the best looking thing in the world but on the whole it's been really useful having it especially as i've just moved house so there's lots of deliveries at the moment and so far i've been using it on battery which i've had to charge about every five weeks or so so assuming you've rung the ringed doorbell and i've let you in the next thing you'll see is this the delonghi prima donna sol coffee espresso machine hilarious name eye watering price this thing costs about 1200 pounds it's definitely a guilty pleasure and as you'd expect for that kind of price it has all the bells and whistles you can just tap americano and 45 seconds later you have a delicious black coffee although you can do that with pretty much any coffee machine or you can go crazy and customize pretty much everything it certainly looks the parts there's a fancy touch screen and it's as seamless as a process as i've ever had on a coffee machine a couple of things to note though and there is an app which lets you remote control it which is great in theory to have a coffee brewing as you get up in the morning but you'll need to make sure you have your mug underneath already set up and possibly fresh milk in as well depending on what coffee you're having so unless you're just having a basic black coffee in the morning it's not that practical it's fully self-cleaning though which i love although you do need to clean out the coffee grounds tray every now and then and also wash out the milk container each time you use it so the prima donna sol cringy name aside is definitely a luxury and of course it's all about the beans anyway when it comes to coffee you don't need to spend this kind of money but now i have it i would definitely miss it if it was gone also in the kitchen i've got amazon's echo show 10. i actually find this really useful to have when my wife and i are cooking mainly for timers or playing music plus in the morning i come down and it shows me my calendar events for the day it's just a nice thing to have around although i can't say i've ever actually used it for video calls i would just tend to use my ipad or laptop for that and i almost immediately turned off the motion which kind of is the big selling point of this because there's just so few spaces in my kitchen where it wouldn't bump into something so it's basically a great echo speaker with a big 10 inch touchscreen and video camera that can swivel and follow you around and it costs about 240 pounds i think i would recommend it but maybe wait for a prime deal these things are often on discount alright let's get to the good stuff and you've probably seen this set up in a few of my recent videos but i'm currently using the 77-inch lg g1 as my main tv this is the fancy wall-mounted gallery design which should have no gap it should be completely flush although i've got a phillips hue gradient strip behind it so it's a couple of centimeters proud of the wall but this is an absolutely stunning tv and i'll pop a link if you want to watch my full review to be honest with you i always thought 77 inches would be too big and that 55 or 65 would be my max but now i'm used to it it actually feels just the right size although again like everything in this video it seems it's pretty pricey at about four and a half thousand pounds although the latest tvs always have big price drops about six months or so after launch or around black friday but i think if i was going to recommend a tv to someone right now i would actually say get last year's lg oled c10 which now costs about 1600 pounds for the 65 inch i think that's the best buy because really there's not that many significant upgrades with 2021 models there's a few but nothing night and day but that's only half the story because audio is just as important and i've been through a lot of sound bars and speakers in my time and while this can be very subjective and there's a lot of professional audio files out there who may well disagree with me but in my experience i'm very happy with the sonoff r [Music] fantastic soundstage hdmi 2.1 with e-arc support and it costs about 700 pounds you can absolutely get away with just having the ark by itself but i've paired it with a couple of one sl speakers for some better surround sound and also because i've just moved house and it's a detached house so i'm not pissing off my neighbors i added the sonoff sub as well which also costs like 700 quid it's an awful lot of money but actually does make quite a big difference as for gaming i've got my ps5 and the series x hooked up in terms of which is best well it all comes down to which exclusive games you prefer and also where your friends play online but for me i would say 90 of the time i'm grabbing the dual sense and playing the ps5 there's just more games in the moment and i love the controller plus these midnight black and cosmic red new ones look pretty tasty you've probably also spotted this the dyson hot and cool air purifier it's the hb04 model and i'm a bit on the fence about this actually because while it looks great and i mainly bought it to help purify the air as i get quite bad hay fever although it's tricky to quantify just how well it works in that regard but it is quite satisfying when it warms up because it's detected contaminants in the air as a fan though well i think i'll say i'm not a big fan you'd get a stronger breeze from the cheapest five pound fan on amazon and it needs to be on level five or higher to really feel it and then it gets annoyingly loud i think it works a little bit better as a heater and i appreciate it can do cooling and heating so maybe consider it as a luxury air purifier but as a fan i just don't think i could recommend it and welcome to the bedroom which is not something i thought i'd be saying on the channel but here we go uh and i've got an echo show on my little bedside table which i quite like and also philips hue bulbs in the lamp obviously uh but the main reason i've brought you in here is to talk about this well actually not this not any of this let's get out the way not that not even this but that and while mattresses aren't something i would normally talk about on the channel this simba hybrid lux is a little bit different so this is a uk king which is a us queen i believe and it's their top of the range mattress which costs about 1350 pounds at the moment but bear with me though because firstly it comes in a box which makes a lot easier to move around and bring up to the room just make sure you let it air out for maybe a day or two but without a doubt this is the most comfortable mattress i've ever slept on how it all works goes a little bit over my head or maybe should i say under my head but it's a combination of about 10 layers of aero coil springs foam support layers and a breathable wool top it's ridiculously comfortable and you don't just sink into it like a normal memory foam mattress it has some support as well and to be honest with you while this is a lot of money you spend about a third of your life in bed so if you can make your sleeping experience better i highly recommend it okay moving on to the office well the temporary office it's still a great space but this will be a bedroom at some point so i don't want to go crazy turning into a full studio when i'll have the garage in a couple of months anyway ikea desk you know the classic 2016 youtuber set up it's fine but i'd like to change this up soon and if you do have any recommendations on a good big desk do let me know in the comments and i'm also still using the noble chairs icon i've had this for like four years now as for my actual pc setup well i just posted my big uh pc upgrade video a couple of days ago where i talked about all this good stuff in detail but basically the setup is a 38 inch lg ultra wide we've got an rtx 3090 and a ryzen 9 5950x build mostly corsair peripherals an elgato light strip at the back and a baby yoda or grogu should i say now when it comes to filming my videos this is my snazzy new white desk where i get some product shots but i've also got these acoustic panels to help reduce the echo echo echo echo i will eventually wall mount these but right now it's actually quite handy to be able to move them around between rooms and they work really well speaking of audio i'm actually using a rode lavalier mic and a tascam audio recorder which i then sync up with the video i shoot on my sony a7s 3. and most of the time i'm shooting with a sigma 24-70 mil lens i also have a atomos shinobi monitor on top and for my main light i use an aperture 120d i would quite like a bigger one for the new studio but for now this is quite a nice setup oh and i also have this little rgb led light panel to give some background color to shots as for the question of what's in my backpack or maybe even what's in my pocket right now i'm using the s21 ultra as my main phone i'm testing the sony xperia 1 3 as well so that's in my pocket and most of the time i also have an iphone with me just because i still prefer the cameras on the iphone especially for video i'm also using a macbook pro 13 with m1 chip as my daily kind of travel laptop but i think i'm most excited about a refreshed macbook pro 16 maybe with an m2 chip around september or october and that is most of the good stuff actually actually there is one more thing this just like every other tech youtuber since the beginning of time um i bought myself a tesla model 3. i have never actually owned a new car before and um i decided to splurge a little bit the wi-fi needs a second car so she could take the other one to work and i've gone for a long range model 3 2021 so it's got the fancy chrome delete and the heat pump and a few extra bits and pieces around the wireless charging uh for your phone which is nice and i am loving it obviously i'm still in the honeymoon period because i've only had it for a couple of weeks i'm getting a wall connect to the tesla wall connected uh connector installed this week because currently it's drip charging through a three pin socket on the side of my house which takes 20 hours to top up so if you would like to see a full video on my thoughts and impressions and all that of the model 3 do let me know in the comments below thanks for watching links below for everything i've talked about and i will see you next time right here on the tech chat
