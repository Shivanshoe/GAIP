hey guys anton with tech chat and this is the lg g10 you may have seen my video from a few weeks ago where i unboxed it set it up and also play some games on it and well as you can see it's a stunning tv 4k oled hdmi 2.1 all the bells and whistles i genuinely love this thing and because it's the gallery edition uh you can see that it's completely flush against the wall it's a lovely bit of kit as you'd expect for about 6 000 pounds but what could be better than that maybe an 8k tv maybe lg's signature z10 series with an 8k oled but that costs about 25 grand so maybe not just yet but then lg got in touch and asked if i wanted to test out one of their new 8k nano cell tvs which is about a fifth of the price of the z10 and still with that full 8k resolution so as a massive tech nerd uh i was gonna jump at the chance but then the problem is i don't really have the room as you guys know i live in england and my house is pretty small and i'm not sure if i could get another huge tv past the wife so instead i came to my dad's house this is well what was his dining room but now it's his uh it's his 8k tv room so this is the 75 inch 8k lg nano cell tv the nano 99 and we get support for dolby vision iq variable refresh rates hdmi 2.1 so it's ready for next-gen gaming as well as dolby atmos surround sound support richer and more accurate colors thanks to the nasal filter which i'll come back to in a second and importantly ai upscaling thanks the new alpha 9 gen 3 processor we also get the latest version of lg's web os ui which is fast and intuitive and works well alongside the excellent magic remote and this here gives us a big revamp of the home dashboard where you can switch between your inputs and control your smart home tech now this is still pretty pricey it's five and a half grand which is about 500 less than my g10 oled tv so you kind of have to weigh up do you want oled with you know the infinite contrast the slightly richer colors or do you want the higher resolution the extra sharpness now it is worth pointing out that none of my main cameras can actually film in 8k and chances are you're not watching this in 8k either so it's tricky to show you just how much detail you're getting here while 8k sounds like it's double 4k it actually has four times as many pixels so we're getting just over 33 million compared to 8.3 million pixels on a 4k screen putting another way you're getting 16 full hd 1080p screens squeezed into one panel seriously getting up close to this thing the fidelity is just unbelievable so it's impressive stuff but i must admit that i always thought of 8k as kind of overkill but even from my sofa which is about two and a half meters or eight feet away honestly there was a noticeable difference between high quality native 4k and 8k youtube content so this i actually shot myself with the s20 plus which i have to say i'm really impressed by i didn't think shooting 8k on a smartphone would be anything like this but in person it's really really good and actually uh more and more cameras and phones are going to support 8k canon just announced the r5 the eos r5 which shoots ak-60 so it's going to become a lot more commonplace that you can actually create your own 8k content and then watch it back natively on something like this so while native ak is still a clear improvement i don't see it as quite the same step up we got from moving from full hd to 4k but it is a case to some extent of diminishing returns for example as i moved further from the tv the extra detail in native 8k footage became less obvious so unsurprisingly the bigger the tv the more benefit you'll get from 8k so lg's now cell tvs use an led lcd panel which are cheaper than oleds but these have had a ton of enhancements this year with a new nano 90 series which go all the way up to 86 inches looking at lg's marketing it seems everything is nano except the size so the nano cell name actually refers to the nano particle size filter layer which removes what lg call impure colors by blocking part of the wavelength so it only displays color true to the original source now it's difficult to know how much of a difference this is making but to my eye colors appear true to life and they're pretty vivid in brighter scenes also the greater contrast this year makes darker scenes appear more detailed now my first question coming from the oled tv i have at home to this narrow cell which is obviously still based on lcd tech is can it key pop because obviously with oled you get the pixels that can turn themselves off individually so you get the infinite contrast and super deep blacks and rich colors well the answer is yeah actually this is seriously impressive and lg have come a long way even with the new 2020 models improving brightness improving contrast and so with the full array local dimming i'm sure you'll agree even just looking at these tech demos which are actually meant for oled tvs that this looks very impressive and then of course the fact that we do get the option to have 8k at a relatively affordable price with a close to oled panel type it's very good and unlike oleds lcd panels don't run the risk of potential burn-in although that's not something i've suffered with my oleds even after a couple of years so lg are calling this real 8k they've plasters it all over the box and while it's not an industry standard they're basically saying that this has hdmi 2.1 it supports you know 4k and 8k video processing to a high quality and also a higher degree of contrast modulation although we'll come back to that in a second but what does an 8k nano cell tv look like under a microscope well you can clearly make out the individual rgb pixels but then let's compare it with my 4k oled at the same magnification and the first thing that jumps out is just a sheer number of extra pixels on the 8k tv but you can see if we move over a half white and half black area of the screen we can see that the oled and the nano cells pixels in the black part appear off which is why the apparent contrast and both seem so good it's only when we zoom in further do we see some light leak from the nano cells pixels so while oled still has an advantage the nano cell is very impressive now while native 8k content is honestly pretty breathtaking most of what you'll be watching for the next year or so will be 4k or full hd so importantly most 2020 now cell tvs use lg's new alpha 9 gen 3 processor the same as the oled models which use their ai picture pro technology to upscale low res content to 4k or 8k so for example lg told me that the ai knows what say a tree looks like in 4k or 8k so it'll build up the image based partly on that which means it can then be more accurate and more detailed with less noise it also learns as you watch more content honestly my first thought was i wish they could sort of add a feature where you could toggle it on or off instantly so like i don't know in the new command and conquer games you can see what the new graphics look like versus the old graphics with the press of a button because sometimes it is hard to tell if i'm just convincing myself when it's a bit of a placebo effect or if it is genuinely noticeably sharper but of course it's not just about the resolution and we also get dolby version iq which is the latest and greatest version of their hdr we also now get filmmaker mode which reflects the original intention of the director and the filmmaker and kind of works like cinema mode plus sports modes also use smooth motion which makes everything look fluid not great for films but great for sports but what about gaming well the good news is that this is a proper future-proof tv as we're getting four hdmi 2.1 ports which offer 8k at 60hz or 4k at 120 which means this is ready for the ps5 and xbox series x as well as high-end gaming pcs we also get variable refresh rate tech to smooth out motion and games as well as also low latency mode for low input lag to make gaming more responsive and i believe the range will also be getting freesync premium through an update soon design wise it is a little chunky especially compared to their oled tvs particularly the fancy gallery design g10 led which sits flush against the wall when mounted but the tapered sides do help to make it look thinner and the bezels are razor thin now i've got the 75 inch model here and as you can see the feet sit almost at the edge of the screen so it only just just fits on this tv stand so bear that in mind as for sound well the speakers are pretty good actually although i always recommend a sound bar or a good pair of external speakers if you can afford them especially as we now have e-arc and dobby ammo support but if that's not an option then the inbuilt speakers should do you for a while while you save up so this is a stunning tv but the main issue i see here is the lack of native 8k content right now as far as i know there aren't any plans for an 8k blu-ray format and while there will be more streaming options in the future right now you're basically limited to some youtube videos anything you shoot yourself in 8k and of course relying on ai upscaling plus you'll need at least 50 megabytes per second speeds and an unlimited data cap for high-res streaming now the good news is that the just announced h.266 video in code format should help with this as it uses half the data of existing formats but the bad news is this is still a couple of years out and you'll probably need a new tv that supports it so i think for me i'm gonna have to spend more time with this over the next few weeks and months to really get an appreciation of what 8k is like to live with but first impressions it's a stunning tv i mean the resolution is cutting edge it's super premium and you can tell a difference in some content and assuming you're not sitting too far away but more importantly it's just a good tv the ui the panel the narrow cell filter with the colors the biggest surprise is how close this comes to oled i mean i have an oled tv the g10 in my house um and actually just coming to this the contrast this year it's very very impressive and much closer than you'd expect and of course with hdmi 2.1 it's ready to go for the next gen consoles so i wouldn't say 8k is exactly essential right now but if you're impressed by these nano cell tvs then there's a whole range of 4k models as well obviously which are a lot cheaper and probably for the time being a better buy but what do you think would you go 4k oled or 8k now cell or something completely different let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys i put links in the description if you want to check out these tvs and if you
