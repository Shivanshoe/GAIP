hey guys Anton the tech chat and when it comes to mobile gaming seeing the enemy before they see you and then reacting fastest can be a matter of life or death okay so I don't want to be overly dramatic but competitive gaming even on mobile is serious business and if a high refresh rate screen and also a high frame rate in your game means that you can potentially see the enemy before they see you then versus a regular 60-hertz screen well it's quite a big difference actually most recent mid to high end phones can play mobile games pretty flawlessly so the next bottleneck is your phone's refresh rate which is basically how fast it can update the on-screen image but with new phones offering high refresh 90-120 or even 144 hurt screens compatible games look and feel so much smoother to play and in some cases the extra speed and responsiveness can even give you a competitive advantage so most phones are 60 Hertz which means the screen refreshes 60 times per second but on a 120 Hertz screen for example it refreshes well 120 times per second twice as often so all the motion looks a lot more smooth fluid and realistic and it's not just games that benefit the whole UI feels more snappy to use and text is easier to read while scrolling as there's less blur think of it this way having a high refresh rate screen is basically unlocking extra performance that your phone already has let's say you're playing a game and you have a 60 Hertz screen and you're getting 60 FPS great you've maxed it out but if that game supports 90 120 or even 144 Hertz then assuming your phone is powerful enough you're going to get all those extra frames and a smooth experience and it's not just phones where this is a big deal I mean gaming PC's you know the next generation of consoles high frame rates high refresh rates are a big deal now the tricky part is actually how I show you the difference between the different frame rates and different refresh rates because this video is being shot at 60 what the gameplay is this little bit here is 30 so you're not actually going to be able to see higher than 60 but through the miracle of editing and slow motion on my Panasonic gh4 I've camera and also some nifty software called game bench which I've got installed on my PC so I just plug in my phone and I can no sort of run some tests on it hopefully you should be able to see the difference this is modern combat versus which supports up to 120 Hertz and I'm getting a fairly solid 120fps if we then slow the footage down you can see we're getting double a number of frames and their movement and animations look a lot more fluid so the big question is does having a high refresh rate phone actually make you any better in games does it make a difference well I've got a few I'm gonna test out the s20 plus it does have a 120 Hertz screen but this is the UK model with a slightly iffy Exynos processor so I'm not gonna focus on the red magic 5g here snapdragon 865 eight gigs of ram and actually a 144 heard screen although we'll talk more about that later on so does it make a difference well the time between frames adds a lot to the lag that you perceive between say making an import and then seeing the action on-screen so as the time between frames at higher frame rates is lower you see the results of your or others actions appear on the screen quicker but that's not the whole story though as the screens touch sampling rates which is basically how quickly it can detect inputs is also a factor and tends to be higher on high refresh rate phones so if we go frame by frame we can see the enemy emerge earlier on the high refresh screen and we can see more of them sooner now this might not sound like a lot but getting more up-to-date visuals can then help us react that bit quicker which can be the difference between winning and well usually in my case not so winning another advantage of higher frame rates is reduced blur which is most noticeable when moving quickly in games to be clear though there is a difference between refresh rate and frame rate you know even if your phone can refresh 120 times per second you're gonna have to get 120 frames per second in your game on the mobile phone to fully take advantage of that if you need getting 60fps on a 120 Hertz screen basically you only go see 60 Hertz and hopefully my hand gestures in the air have made that clearer so it does depend on how powerful your phone is and also whether the game itself is capped at say 30 or 60 FPS to maintain a consistent level of performance so high refresh is still new but more and more Android phones are supporting it and if the rumors of the upcoming iPhone 12 series are right which I think they are then we could be seeing 120 Hertz on the new iPhone range which kind of makes a new standard especially for developers so we should see a lot more phones and most importantly a lot more games optimized for high refresh rates and it was a similar story with all the 120 Hertz compatible games I played even for night and it makes a huge difference to playability unfortunately 120 Hertz in fortnight is limited to the iPad pro for now but I'm hoping we'll see this rollout for other phones as well but what about 144 herds with this guy well maxing out the 144 Hertz panel in shadow 5/3 and Real Racing 3 looks well just incredible slow down we can see 2.4 x number of frames compared to a 60 Hertz screen and then when sped back up it feels seriously slick this is dead trigger 2 and if we compare the refresh speed side-by-side we can see just how many extra frames were getting with the animations I even found it easier to aim and shoot accurately playing at 144 as my imports felt more immediate on the screen so I think 120 hurt screens are gonna be the new standard for mid to high-end phones going forward but as for 144 I think this has to be more limited to dedicated gaming phones like the red magic or you know the Suze ROG phone hopefully we'll see the third generation in the next couple of months but hopefully as developers do start to offer higher frame with compatibility with eight games in some cases either they'll develop for 144 as well or they'll essentially give us an unlocked frame rate so it'll max out whatever phone you have this also seems to be the case with Minecraft which topped out at 1/3 for FPS but this is a demanding game so most of the time it runs at a lower frame rate which varies quite a bit this is where we run into an issue with games that can't reliably max out a set frame rate meaning motion can feel a little bit more inconsistent it does vary between phones though but usually you can dial back the refresh rates of 90 or 60 if you have any compatibility issues or want to save on battery because battery life is an issue running these screens at Full Tilt takes a lot of power and in some cases like with the galaxy s 20 series you can only run at a full refresh rate and a reduced resolution okay lastly and well Leslie 90 Hertz the extra 30 frames jumped from 60 Hertz is still well worth having and for me it still enhances the overall feel of a phone for the most upgrades like a faster processor or more RAM and I think it's great we're seeing 90 hub screens in slightly more affordable phones like the oneplus 8 also like the Huawei P 40 pro where while we've kind of want to balance that sort of smoothness versus the battery life so it is still a big step up over 60 you won't be surprised that I'm a big fan of high refresh rate gaming I mean it's been the standard for enthusiasts PC gamers for years now but we're finally seeing the next generation of consoles the PS 5 the Xbox series X and also of course phones offer high refresh rates so with phones it does drain the battery faster and also you may get inconsistent frame rates depending on how powerful your phone is and how graphically claims speak how graphically demanding the game is but we are starting to get the option and if you're a competitive gamer or even just a casual gamer like me but want a better experience then a high refresh rate phone whether it's 90 120 or even 144 Hertz like this makes a big difference but what do you reckon are you excited for high refresh rate phones and if you already have one how much of a difference did it make to your gaming thank you so much for
