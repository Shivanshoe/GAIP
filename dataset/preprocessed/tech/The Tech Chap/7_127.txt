all right it's battery test time i've got both new oneplus nines the oppo find x3 pro the rog phone 5 s21 ultra note 20 ultra and also the iphone 12 pro max to see which one has the best battery i'm matching all the settings on the phones including 100 nip brightness all background apps are closed these are all pretty much brand new phones none have been used for more than a couple of weeks so let's kick off with youtube i'll be going through uh youtube gaming social media filming uh to really get a sort of intensive real-world-ish test of the phones now if you look at the specs under the names you'll see we've got a variety of battery sizes the iphone 12 pro max is actually the smallest next to the rg5 which is the biggest with a 6 000 million power battery but above that you'll also notice the refresh rates and this is a big question every time it comes to battery tests do you stick them all at 60 hertz because the iphone's at 60 or do you use them in their either default or optimized modes there's no right or wrong answer but for me i like to test these as people would use them so i'm using them in their automatic or adaptive high refresh modes where possible but crucially having a high refresh rate with an ltpo panel so you're getting variable refresh rates can actually be an advantage because it can dynamically adjust the frame rate between usually 1 and 120 hertz so if you're watching videos or on a static home screen it can reduce that to save batteries so my answer to the question of why not have them all at 60 hertz is because you'll be losing that ltpo advantage which some of these phones offer so uh hopefully that goes some way to explain it the rog phone is really interesting because while it does have the biggest battery and actually this is important i've left it in its dynamic mode you could go between x mode ultra durable or advanced where you can customize it and if you want to put in x mode it would just destroy the battery instantly i've left it in the default dynamic mode so we're two and a half hours into the test and that seems like a good time to talk about surf shark vpn which as you can see have installed on all the phones because well you can get the app on pretty much every device and also an unlimited number of devices which is handy and i genuinely do use surf shark all the time mainly because it has this clean web feature which helps reduce tracking and malware and ads and those horrible sort of things but it also means i can access us netflix or hulu for example and it's just super simple to use so if you want

stays fair looking at the results so far the iphone 12 pro max is clearly in the lead with the oneplus 9 pro at the back of the pack closely followed by the note 20 ultra and actually while we're here let's run a quick geekbench 5 cpu test just to see how they compare in terms of performance now comparing iphones and android phones in benchmarks it's a little bit tricky because there's lots of variables but it does come out ahead in geekbench with the note 20 ultra with the previous gen 865 plus chip in last place but actually there's not much in it between the androids it looks like in geekbench release to jump up to the triple eight isn't that significant all right so back to youtube we're four hours into the test now and we're in the uh orange category for the oneplus 9 pro and the note things are getting a little bit dicey there the iphone 12 pro max is doing incredibly well and that really is credit to apple's efficiency i mean you can see has the smallest battery and yet at this stage we're still seeing the longest battery life i'm not saying who's going to win although you could probably place your bets at this point but it does get to show that the size of the battery while important isn't the only factor you've also got the screen size and the software efficiencies wow that 30 minute 4k video recording test made a big dent in the batteries the oneplus 9 pro 5 left both the oneplus 9 and then 20 on 10. iphone's still way out in front i think we know who's going to win this but yeah 4k video recording really does have a big impact on the battery you know what i miss huawei phones it's such a shame about the software situation because it's quite difficult to get the apps on the phone to match the ones i'm testing on here but until the last you know year or so whenever i featured a huawei phone in a battery rundown they've always done incredibly well if not actually one so it's a shame i don't have it in the mix here i would also very much like maybe having the xiaomi mi 11 but i don't have a sample of that uh hopefully i will include the pro or the ultra when it comes out but don't worry i'll be making more of these when i get more phones into test that's it first one to die the uh note 20 ultra six hours 31 minutes one plus nine pro what was uh 13 minutes behind 12 minutes behind uh the dropping light flies now oneplus 9 on just one percent this is uh this is close but yeah we've got our last place and then at uh six hours 59 we've got the oneplus 9 so surprisingly the cheaper oneplus 9 lasted 16 minutes longer than the more expensive 9 pro i guess that's because it's got a smaller screen although it doesn't have the ltpo panel which is surprising then we've got the s21 ultra at seven hours six so that lasted a good deal longer than the note 20 ultra which is the snapdragon version and now we're down to three and uh it's between the rog phone and the oppo to go next and there we go seven hour 16 the fine x3 pro finally kicks the bucket leaving the rg phone five with two percent left and giving it the silver medal let's see how much longer it can last seven hours 26 done leaving the iphone 12 pro max with 12 of its battery and everything else dead now that's pretty impressive i do know that in mr who's the boss's battery videos the iphone 12 pro max battery is a lot closer to the s21 ultra and some of the other phones but i'll tell you right now in fact i'm going to pause that and just talk to you directly this is the third time i run this test the first time the rog phone was on x mode throughout so it died really quickly and i thought that's not really fair you're more likely to use it in dynamic mode the second time i ran it the iphone torpedo max actually had its auto brightness on it was varying its brightness throughout as the lighting changed and it got dark so i thought that's not good enough either i want this to be as scientifically real-world as possible but i can tell you from my experience of running this test three times that in every single one the iphone 12 pro max won with between 10 and 15 of its uh juice remaining so that's pretty consistent so my takeaways well firstly i can't wait for the iphone 13 which fingers crossed it will have a high refresh display i can't wait to see what kind of impact that has on the battery life and if they can include an ltpo of sorts panel and therefore give us the variable refresh rates because that does make a difference the battery life although not as much as i thought we'd see based on the oneplus 9 and the 9 pro it's also fair to say that these are pretty much flagship phones except for maybe the oneplus 9 which you'd call high-end none of these are offering a bad battery life this was a pretty intensive test and they all lasted over six and a half hours screen on time intensive use so you can't go wrong with any of them but if you do want the best battery out of these phones it's the iphone 12 pro max and of course the other thing is i would like to include more phones so let me know in the comments below which other phones you'd like me to add next time i'm going to try and get the xiaomi mi 11 series as i say hopefully the pro and the ultra the upcoming sony maybe a couple of other phones and if you've got any other feedback or suggestions do let me know below if you enjoyed this and also appreciated the fact that i've done this three times now so i'm gonna have a break from battery life test for a few weeks uh but hopefully you enjoyed it and i'll see you guys next time right here on the tech
