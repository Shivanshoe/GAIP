[Music] there's two phones that i carry around with me i think you're the same iphone 13 pro max and the google pixel 6 pro that is correct i should explain uh saf supersaf uh from supersoft tv my good friend and uh i think you may have a youtube channel are we there yet colleague call it proximity co-worker uh he's got a fantastic channel um and if you haven't already subscribed then um don't bother you're not actually missing much [Laughter] ouch i'm tommy techchap and uh we're talking about these two phones what do you think which one is your main sim card in i have two main sim cards and i have for the past like seven years right because you've got a burner phone for you for your messages and then if you're not supposed to expose me like this dude come on no so um for me i always have had one android phone and one iphone so we have review samples of these phones um and my wife sarah she was on the pixel 4 xl for the longest time she was so excited about this uh that she's actually taken my review sample temporarily and is using it yeah i need this for work because i don't care no matter well we've got my pixel here so yeah i've been using both of these and there's certain things that i like about both yeah let's talk about design which one do you think looks better and feels better to use okay so i would say that the pixel is the overall more comfortable device to use and that's because of the curved edges i like the look of the flat edges of the iphone and don't get me wrong it looks great but it's heavier yeah and it is boxier kind of like when you when you're holding it for long periods of time it's i mean it's not a big deal but it's not as comfortable as the pixel i also like that the pixel has a fresh design the iphone i like the design but it's very much the same as the iphone 12. it'd be difficult to for the average person to see the difference if you've got an 11 or 12 or 13 yeah exactly but this is like this looks very distinctive and i like that what i don't like about it is that it's got the glossy finish right yes whereas with this you've got the matte finish which i which i much much prefer if i'm giving points for overall uh comfortability and design then you know i i would lean towards the pixels do you say comfort comfortability comfortability is that what i don't know well it should be a way i love it i agree it's a little bit taller a little bit narrower and a lot lighter um and as you say the curved edges make it nice not a lot of people not everyone loves a curved screen i don't mind it i'm kind of over it i don't i i don't mind the curved screen but i think more so the curve at the back it just makes it a little bit more comfortable the thing is these are two of the best phones you can buy but what's really interesting and it kind of skips ahead a little bit is that these are not the same price and actually the the pixel is about 850. so really goes up against the 13 pro ish and maybe 13. it's halfway between the pro max being 1050 significantly more expensive but these are kind of you know phones at the top of their game yeah and that's something that i have to keep reminding myself because you know the pixel does for sure in a lot of areas compared to the iphone that actually it's because it is cheaper so let's talk about some areas that we don't like about the pixel because everyone is saying lots of great things and it's fantastic and it's a little bit more affordable but there are some downsides yeah um i i think my biggest one is the cameras are inconsistent i wish they had face unlocking it's bizarre that it doesn't okay and that's probably it so the face unlocking is not something that i'm really you know like i i don't really use face unlock because it wouldn't be as secure anyway the fingerprint scanner initially in my experience it wasn't so bad it's not as fast as some of the others i like face id but then the face id thing is that right now we've been having sms yeah now i've got an apple watch so it's okay for me because i can just unlock the phone with my apple watch but you do have to consider that if you're going to be wearing a mask a lot then it can be a little bit annoying the one thing that i always say is that i would have loved if apple put a touch id scanner here oh i know i know i mean it's on the ipad air and they put it they double it into the power button so if they could do that on here it'd be fantastic i think you know considering how things are it's just nice to have that option thing that i absolutely love about the iphone is that it is i would say the most consistent set of cameras on any smartphone right now and it picks all the boxes yes it might not be the best in certain areas such as obviously zoom and things like that the ultra wide um i do prefer the s21 ultra for example you've done some uh camera comparisons i have between these two so give me like the what are your thoughts in the next in a nutshell i think it's easy to say that video the iphone is just significantly better than you know the the pixel not to say that the pixel is bad but the iphone's just very consistent you've got 4k 60 across all of the cameras hdr video as well looks really really good and that's something that you really can't go wrong with this isn't going in the video this is this is a family family you better get in the video it's a family friendly channel oh no launch the new channel fitness boy i'm so sorry everyone i'm so sorry how's it going stuff it's been good we did a 12 mile hike yeah just about survived and now we're about halfway yeah it's been tough but we can do it we can do this we can do this obviously uh in field testing of the phones this is the pixel 6 pro selfie video 4k yeah only at 30 fps that's true let's see how stabilization looks but then let's now switch to the iphone and we're back here we are iphone store 4k30 but as you say we can do 4k 60. the option is there i'd be curious to see as we're walking up this uh bit of a hike how it handles the stabilization how the mic picks up our out of breath panting beautiful it's been 12 miles so far so far we're incredibly athletic sarah let's get back to the hotel yes that sounds good let's do it [Music] uh with the pixel um i think it takes really good pictures it's got the pixel look a lot of people like that and i think it looks really good and you know i do like it for for a lot of photos but one of the things that you don't get is that same consistency that you get with the iphone the one thing with pixel phones is they always do improved software because google is a software company sometimes when it hits it's good but a lot of times it's almost like it's like a hundred and fifty dollars something's going wrong yeah it's it's like that cannot come out from this the iphone on the other hand because of the lidar scanner some of the portraits that i've shared um people are like no way that's taken on a smartphone it is just spot on but i also like the focal length because you've got the 3x which is the equivalent of around 70 to 75 millimeters when you're taking a portrait on a professional camera and i think that's a really really good angle for portraits the way the compression and everything works so this is something that you've got on the iphone on the pixel you've got a 4x camera but that 4x camera cannot be used with portrait mode you can take normal pictures with it and they'll have some form of bokeh because of you know that focal length but it's not got the portrait mode you've just got one and two 2x on the pixel is actually digital so what it does is it cranks up the sharpness to make up for it and it just ends up looking really really bad so the pixel camera is really good and a lot of people will like that but if i'm picking a camera between these two and looking at the overall experience it's going to be the iphone for me i wish they had improved the selfie camera a little bit more yeah on the iphone i think that's the only thing not bad but it sort of feels like it's held back a little bit yes and some of the selfies that take a bit soft and and and sometimes the the white balance on on faces can be a bit off what is this video sponsored by by the way oh actually that's a great point the lovely people over at subshark are sponsoring this

what do you think about software this is the big one obviously this could be a whole video uh android versus ios let's keep it to a tight minute okay if you could only use one android 12 or uh ios that's i can't answer that this is two different i do like both one thing i will say is on the pixel is it's been very buggy in my experience there's a lot of apps uh the youtube creator studio is one which is an app by google as well which is kind of like weird if i'm taking the screenshot i can't crop it it just pauses and then i have to go back into photos to crop it which is something that's again seems like something that should be really basic so i think android 12 will improve with time but at this point you know i'm very tempted uh and i think i will switch back to my s21 ultra when i get back we do have android 12 on the s21 now that's yeah that's just just come out so i want to have a play with that yeah i do like android 12 but it does feel quite fresh and there's something about the iphone that still feels quite dated in terms of obviously we have widgets now and it's it's it's fine and with promotion uh on the on the screen it does feel fast but there's just something more instantaneous i think it's the quicker animations i think it's the the fresh look of android 12 that going to the iphone just feels a bit old-fashioned yeah i think that's kind of deliberate with apple they like to keep things consistent they don't like to make any drastic changes one of the things i always complain about on my iphone um 13 pro max is it's a large screen right but you still have these very large icons you could easily have a row of like five i know five columns and you know you could fit in a lot more but they're just so big and spaced out and i get that that's because of consistency across the other iphones they're all in the same format but i'd like the option like i have on the pixel where i was like actually no i want five five by five or five by six or something exactly and there's no there's no split screen or multitasking which is incredible and it works so well even on the ipad mini i'll be honest with you i very rarely use multi window on my on my smartphone okay i'll just i'll just leave yes but it's these lack of options as you said the simplicity to the iphone as a consistency to iphone but and as you say there are some bugs still with the pixel but it has just come out well that's not excuse really if you're buying i mean if it's retail if you can buy if you right now you can go out and buy a pixel so it should be fine yeah and a lot of the tweets i'm getting from a lot of followers as well is that there's so many bugs right and you know they need to be fixed very quickly because youtube for example if i've got youtube connected to my car and i'm listening to a podcast for example it'll cut off and it will just close the app and that's it right and i'm like i'm driving so i can't even like go to it because obviously i'm driving right and i've never had that with any other smartphone before but again there are lots of other good things as well the display is actually really good it is and actually we didn't really touch on this in the the design point but obviously this hole punch is significantly smaller than a notch it is and that's something that is a bit of a plus when you're full screening a video and you want to sort of zoom in i was watching a bit of uh narcos on the plane on my downloaded netflix and i wanted just to to fully zoom in to make it as big as possible and then you get the thing and 99 of the time i don't care about the notch and we're all used to it now it's been here for what three years but when you're playing games when you're full screening a video like oh yeah i i totally agree like when we're looking at the overall design obviously the punch out with the overall smaller bezels is yes better here on the pixel this feels more modern yeah but the iphone is also brighter but at the same time even though it's brighter and both of these have 120 hertz the battery life on the iphone is significantly better yes this is still good and actually one of the big problems we've had before with pixels is they've been pretty bad so it's so interesting because a lot of people have had either good experience with battery life like me and you i'm getting through the day absolutely fine others have had terrible experiences right now i think i figured out what it is when i'm out and about um you know the battery life is not significantly hit because 5g is not so prominent if i go to london the battery life drops significantly quicker i mean that would happen on both but more so on the pixel interesting so that's that's something that i personally notice on my pixel is if i am in 5g areas it does seem to affect the battery life more and the people who have been kind of saying that the battery life hasn't been excellent yeah are in the cities like that yeah like new york and places like that so again i think it comes down to personal ex usage but i think we can very safely say that the iphone has much better battery life i think there's a better battery on a mainstream phone than the 13 pro max and obviously this does last significantly longer than even the 13 pro and again that comes back to this is not necessarily a direct competitor to the max back to the price back to the price and so this whole time we have to keep that in mind that this is 2 2 300 pounds cheaper or something like that significantly cheaper maybe not over a two three-year contract maybe it wouldn't make that much difference but you can't expect exactly the same performance across the board uh but i would say battery i'm getting maybe 25 left at the end of the day versus about 40 yeah so i would say you know the way i kind of calculate it is i'm getting around uh 20 25 better battery life on the iphone compared to the pixel now you mentioned the price so there's an interesting point that i want to mention in the price right now the samsung galaxy s 21 ultra is available for a very good deal right now yes right yes if i was to choose between that and the s1 ultra i would personally go with the s21 i would it's a more fully fledged phone yeah i i would agree i do like elements of this and but now we have android 12 on the s21 yeah um i i i would agree with you on that and obviously we've got the s22 probably coming in just a couple of months a couple of months so if you're looking to buy a new phone you're like should i get the pixel you could either get the s21 ultra discounted or just wait a little bit and see what that new flagship 2022 phone's gonna look like exactly this is coming out at a kind of awkward time obviously with one thing we've not talked about is it's the tensorcore chip uh google's own chip which obviously has a lot of well they presumably we've seen the efficiencies uh the the integration between apple's hardware and software that's paid dividends in terms of uh of power performance efficiency hopefully that's something we'll see more of in the future but it at this point it's there's nothing really to it it's the first it's the first generation right yes it's the first time they've done it so you're still gonna have to have some time a few generations before it becomes because this doesn't quite compete with a snapdragon triple a so you know brand new not quite hitting even the current phones so obviously they're going to have a lot of isp camera stuff going on which they can tailor and they can work with but it's not really a selling point like i'm browsing reddit i see tons of these pixel ads and it's like uh got a new tensor core what does that matter to the average person the average person what does that matter like you know how how is that going to affect my day-to-day usage yeah it's not as fast as yes 20 multiple of the iphone yeah and you there's nothing except you know what i just thought one thing i do love about this magic eraser have you used that okay i've got some i feel like you have some strongest thoughts on that about magic eraser because sure it's a cool feature which other apps already did now it's integrated sure i like that it can work i've had some good experience but generally speaking like in terms of the stuff that i would use it for it doesn't do great okay so it's never going to be perfect like yes they'll give you the ideal scenarios where you've got you know a person in the background very clearly that's standing on the beach in the sand so then it's very easy to cut around that person but it's you know coming from somebody who uses photoshop a lot um it's almost like the healing brush tool where you just kind of like paint over somewhere it's gonna look at things around it and it's gonna make up for that yes it's a cool feature i don't think it's a huge selling point i'm not really like i don't even talk about it in my my videos because it's like it's cool but it's kind of been around already and it's yes it's integrated but it's not great i know we talked about cameras but i would say the same thing about cinematic mode and photography modes we spent a lot of time talking about that when they first came out yeah have you used either since nope and you know i mean you're saying that we spent a lot of time talking about those i did not spend a lot of time talking about those um in my camera comparison of the iphone i was like here are the photographic styles this is what you get but the iphone takes great shots already already just trust it to do it now you can like if there's a particular style that you want sure but i already like it if i want to make some tweaks i'd rather make those in post i don't want them baked into my photo right so that's something with the photographic styles cinematic mode you know apple did shout out about it a lot let's be real here it can look okay but you're going to use it once for your review and yeah yeah my entire review was shot in it which was great and it does work but i'm not having a 24fps option which is what cinematic people would want to shoot in or 4k but we do get pro res and actually one thing i've loved about the iphone since we've had that prores update i've got the 512 gig one using up the space but shooting pro res video on this and then air dropping into my mac meal to edit it it's so clean the noise there's minimal noise and the stabilization video on a smartphone the iphone is king and that's something that i think is universally agreed upon amongst pretty much all uh tech reviewers but you mentioned airdrop and prores files right okay i like airdrop what i don't like is that we still have a lightning port right yes and this is something that i've ranted about before a lot but you know if you do have a lot of prores files and you've got like you know how to get them off you know airdrops fine but you don't want to be you just want something that's going to you know if it's usb-c you'd get it and apple themselves in the ipad mini presentation made a big feature of it being 10 times faster and it was like a selling point it was a selling point that is 10 times faster the reason why it's 10 times faster is because they're using usb type-c right now we're here in laguna beach i've i've been going with one cable usbc for my macbook pro for my pixel uh 6 pro i can't use it for my iphone i can also use it for my ipad pro so i've got my ipad pro and again i can use that single cable for all of these things i can't use it for my iphone and it is time i think you know i get it there's a there's an ecosystem around the accessories and all of that but that's not a reason not to innovate like me is now outdated we need to move to usbc it's slow it's dead nothing else uses it not even any other apple device except the cheapest ipad yeah and that's like a compromise because of it and yet on these thousand pound phones it's like okay lightning i've gotta bring another cable not the end of the world i use magsafe charging primarily but you're right for getting stuff on and off it particularly those prores files it's a pain in the backside especially when you've got a couple of minutes of it it's like 20 gigs you mentioned the charging i mean yeah magsafe something that i really do like uh i personally just use wireless charging it's not the fastest out there no but overnight who cares exactly because the battery life is so good on here anyway there's not been a single day where i've kind of run out of battery dropping around it's the only phone i've ever had i have not had any battery anxiety and that for me is possibly the selling point yeah we can talk about software features we can talk about camera differences but if one phone you know isn't gonna die before the end of your night out or you're gonna be able to get your uber home yep it's this and and that is absolutely fundamental to us as totally power users and what made me appreciate this a lot more was uh i was in munich and i had my z3 flip with me okay and that died by about 5 p.m it's pretty poor battery and i was just like it just made me appreciate this so much more so yeah the iphone 30 pro max i think apple have picked a lot of boxes sure it's not perfect but you are paying that additional price for it yes the pixel i would say you know if you are somebody who wants that google experience it's a very good phone you get that google pixel look for images as well which a lot of people like it is a good overall phone i would argue better value for money i think for them i think you're getting a flagship device and not quite a flagship phone this makes me think why would anyone still buy a oneplus 9 pro yeah i mean i like their devices but 100 i would go for this for the camera yeah and the updates because obviously one of the key selling points of pixels is you are the first to get new androids yeah and security updates so that's a real safe haven three years minimum with uh five years of security updates as well the tricky part is the s21 ultra has been discounted so much and the s22 is coming out soon and this is significantly cheaper and has some benefits to it as well yeah so it's kind of a hard time to pick a best phone i'm happy i get to carry around both and actually at this tech conference we're at i'm seeing on the tables everyone has an iphone 13 everyone has a pixel these i have a few a few galaxies thrown in there but if i'm completely honest with you when i get back i will be switching back to the s21 ultra which doesn't sound like a great ending for the pixel but i'm just gonna leave you with the fact that my wife has a six pro and loves it my brother has a sex pro and my dad has a six pro and they've all bought them individually themselves so they want sponsors you want sponsors so this video is sponsored by google now this site is supposed to be athletics no sponsorships there except shark who very kindly provided integration um but my family have all upgraded to the pixel and they love it and and they're like i don't really want an iphone and so it all comes down to ecosystem what you're familiar with they're both fantastic but i think in terms of an overall best phone it has to be the iphone yeah i would say i would agree yeah well thank you so much serve thank you for that i'm having a chat about iphones and pixels and what do you guys think if you had to go for one of these would you go pixel 6 or iphone or not in the above and we will see you next time right here well i'll see you not him he's never coming on the channel again let's see this is this is the last one just go over to my channel and you'll see a lot more of me see you next time
