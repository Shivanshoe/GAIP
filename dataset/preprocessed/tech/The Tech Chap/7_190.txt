this is such an exciting video because it's pretty rare that we have three new phones like this that really do go head-to-head so i've got the new google pixel 5 with me here along with the samsung galaxy s20 fe that's the fan edition and the all-new oneplus 8t and these all cost around 600 pounds or 700 give or take and if you do find this video useful then a little like or subscribe down there would be amazing i'm also like this close to a million subscribers so if you can help get me there qriket before christmas that would be incredible all right so let's jump straight in and side by side you can see the pixel 5 is quite a bit smaller than the samsung and the oneplus so if you are after a smaller more compact phone then the pixel 5 is the way to go but which one do you think looks best i must admit the pixel sorter sage color is growing on me but it has a kind of papery recycled cardboard texture to it although underneath it is aluminium now the s20fe actually looks and feels a lot like the note 20 with what samsung calls this glastic body which is just a fancy plastic really i think it looks pretty good although this cloud navy color is definitely one of the less interesting flavors you can get it in and finally the oneplus 8t looks a lot like the nord albeit with a beefier camera setup and it's the only glossy finish of the three but which looks best is all down to you really it's very subjective if i had to pick my favorite oh they're all kind of different i reckon i will go with the fe and probably in the red color there's not a curved screen in sight though they all have flat screens which i know a lot of you guys do prefer now you'll notice all three phones do have fingerprint readers but while the oneplus and the samsung use optical in screen readers the pixel goes for a physical one on the back which i must say i do find slightly more convenient weirdly though there isn't actually any face unlock option with the pixel which i guess isn't the end of the world because you can just use your finger to unlock it but i do tend to use face locking quite a bit although i get these days with everyone wearing masks all the time it's less helpful but it just seems like a weirder mission we also get stereo speakers on all three phones but while i'd say the oneplus and the samsung are pretty much neck and neck quality wise the pixel does fall down a bit in terms of quality and also the fact that the bottom firing speaker is quite a bit louder than the under screen earpiece speaker at the top so when you're watching movies or videos the sound is a little bit one-sided if you're after a headphone jack though unfortunately none of these phones have one now in terms of water resistance both the s20 fe and the pixel 5 give you full ip68 water resistance which means if you wanted to you could take them in up to a meter and half of water for half an hour however unfortunately the 8t offers no official ip rating one plus say it's still reasonably water resistant though and you know splash proof but yeah i probably wouldn't take this swimming with me and finally before we get to the fun stuff in terms of connectivity all three of these phones are 5g although the base model of the s20 fe is actually 4g which is 100 pounds cheaper but then you also get the slightly rubbish exynos chip instead of snapdragon it really is hard holding three phones at the same time i'm completely failing here i was trying to show off the screens because now i want to talk about the displays on all three of the phones i'm not gonna do that because i'll just break it but the point is in terms of screen quality i think the pixel 5 does fall behind the other two a little bit because while technically it is the sharpest as they're all full hd plus but the smaller screen size means we get the highest pixel per inch density what you will notice though is the refresh rate both the samsung and the oneplus are 120 hertz which also comes with 240hz touch sampling whereas the pixel is just 90 hertz so for gaming in particular the pixel probably isn't the best option so design while subjective screen quality probably a tie between the s20 and the oneplus but now let's talk about performance which one of these phones is the fastest well in terms of raw processor power the s20 fe just about takes the win although it's pretty neck and neck with oneplus but sadly as you can see the pixel is really lagging behind and then finally in 3dmark running the slingshot benchmark and even just watching the test run you can see the difference the pixel is nowhere near as smooth and the results paint a pretty clear picture the pixel's snapdragon 765g chip just can't keep up i must admit it is a little bit disappointing to see that can i performance from the pixel 5 because while i do appreciate google sort of changing track a little bit and giving us a more affordable flagship phone which they have but maybe they kind of forgot about or didn't realize that the competition was getting better as well i mean for similar money with these two phones we're getting the flagship snapdragon 865 which is a lot faster so they've obviously compromised on the processor the chip to make this more affordable but then for the same price we're getting it in these phones so it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense it is interesting though that even though this top spec model of the oneplus 8t this is the one with uh 12 gigs of ram so actually it's got double the ram of this uk version of the fe we're only seeing sort of one to two percent difference in those benchmark tests so in reality while if you're a super enthusiast multitasker then maybe it will come in handy and i guess to some extent it makes it more future proof but really it shows that ram difference well doesn't make much of a difference at all really now the good news is that all three phones can comfortably play the latest games but the extra performance with the samsung and the oneplus means you get better graphics settings and higher frame rates which is important if you want to take full advantage of that 120 hertz screen although of course the game will also need to support 120. after playing some games for a while on these phones i did notice the pixel got quite hot i recorded 41 degrees celsius on the back versus just 31 on the 8t and 35 on the s20 so the oneplus is the coolest and the pixel is the hottest the thing is though the hardware and the raw performance is only really half the story when it comes to software well i think this is where the pixel could sort of claw itself back a little bit because we get pure stock android 11 and while it's not the fastest phone in the world it's actually really responsive and smooth to use i didn't notice any slowdowns at all plus with a pixel you'll be the first to get new updates which is a pretty big selling point by itself but for me i think my favorite phone to use is the oneplus 8t because we get android 11 out of the box and also this runs uh oneplus his own oxygen os 11 software which actually is one of the biggest sort of revamps to the uh sort of ui and the design in quite a long time it actually feels a little bit more like a samsung phone but as always with one plus it's still incredibly fast and it's kind of like a good halfway house between the stock android or the pixel and the slightly heavier one ui on the samsung the s20 fe is still very fast though but samsung's software updates always lag behind so we're still on android 10 here so in summary the pixel 5 is lovely to use we also get updates first but it is significantly less powerful the s20 fe has great performance but uh the software perhaps isn't the slickest and also it's the last to get updates and i think the oneplus 8t is kind of like a happy medium it's fast uh it's pretty quick to get updates and it's kind of like stock android but with a few extras that are actually quite useful now before we get to the all-important camera test let's talk about battery life which one of these lasts the longest well i ran a pretty intensive battery rundown test i matched the brightness and the settings on all three i went through hours of youtube instagram gaming and 4k video recording this test alone took me all day but by the end we have a clear winner and a clear loser and so as the pixel 5 finally gives up after nine and a half hours into the test the s20 fe still has 12 percent of its battery left and one plus a whopping 20 remaining so best battery life goes to the 8t and as well as that we also get the fastest charging with this guy there aren't actually a ton of upgrades with the 80 over the eight uh from about six months ago the big two are the fact that we get 120 hertz over 90 hertz and also now much faster charging we get 65 watts warp charge and unlike some other manufacturers we get the fast charger bundled in the box you don't have to pay extra the only downside though of the oneplus is you don't get wireless charging or reverse charging something both the pixel and the s20 do support now to be fair the pixel does have the smallest battery it's milliamp hours versus 4500 on both the oneplus and the samsung but then again this does have the smaller screen uh the least powerful processor and hardware inside it's also 90 hertz not 120 yeah not the best performance although thinking back to my pixel 4 review from last year the battery was also not great with that at the start but then over time after a month or two of use it actually got quite a lot better like an extra 20 or so so while i expect all three phones to improve with time i did notice the pixel especially getting better as i used it and finally which phone has the best camera well let me show you a few pictures side by side and starting with the main lens then switching to the ultra wide all three phones do have a proper ultra wide camera which is great to see and then finally switching to a zoom unfortunately the pixel doesn't have a dedicated telephoto lens so this is a two times digital zoom versus three times optical on the s20 and two times optical on the oneplus now if i run through the lenses again and then zoom in as far as they can go you can see a pretty big difference so the s20 fe is the clear winner when it comes to zooming followed by the pixel surprisingly despite not even having a telephoto lens now in terms of actual picture quality in good light they all take fantastic photos but there is a pattern with the s20 giving us more vivid slightly over saturated colors par for the course really with the samsung whereas the oneplus has a good natural tone but can be a little too contrasty sometimes giving us a darker look but in my opinion i think the pixel 5 is the most natural and accurate overall switching to portrait mode and these were all taken from the same point but by default the samsung and the oneplus used the ultra wide lens for portraits although you can switch to the main lens if you prefer so the sun is really beating down on sarah in this shot but you can see the pixel does the best job at sort of evening out the highlights on her skin and also her jacket the samsung is the most punchy aka instagram ready but a little bit unnatural looking and the oneplus is not my favorite it's the least detailed and again the shadows and the contrast are just a bit too dark moving on to some lower light tests and wow what's going on with the oneplus here the white balance is just completely off and it's got a yellowy hue to it both the pixel and the samsung do a pretty good job here though next up and we've got our first night mode shot the pixel 5 does really well here managing to keep the color of the leaves pretty close to their natural white the s20 fe is also pretty good although you can see despite me focusing on the plant that it's dimmed the candles in the background more than brightening up the foreground but it's sharp but it looks good the oneplus well again the colors are just way off although to its credit the plant pot is a little bit brighter and more detailed another nice shot here of my desk setup and actually the oneplus does much better here perhaps it's just the warmer hues it struggles with but still i think the pixel is the clear winner it's the most detailed and color accurate it is good to see though that all three phones support night mode with their ultra wide camera as well and actually the quality and the colors are pretty similar to the main lens which is good now leaving all that crazy rgb for a second and outside with night mode i think again the pixel takes the win now switching things around to the selfie camera and i must admit i look pretty unwell in all these uh maybe it's just the lighting but i must say i really do like the one plus here all beauty modes are turned off on all three phones but the samsung is just far too soft and a little washed out and the pixel has a slightly unnatural purple hue to it as for low light selfies well the oneplus is actually the only phone not to give you a night mode for the front camera which can let it down sometimes it's bright but by far the least detailed and a bit washed out the s20 is sharp but just a bit too dark while i think the pixel does pretty well overall but we still have some of those sort of purpley hues and finally one super dark selfie outside again with my mode except on the oneplus sadly but what about video quality well i'm shooting this at 4k 30 on all three phones uh although the samsung and the oneplus do actually top out at 4k60 although you can't on the pixel but hopefully this will give you a bit of an idea of the video quality we've also got this very bright sunlight some sort of darker contrasty areas there so we should really get a bit of an idea of the dynamic range now what we can also do is change the lenses so this is with the main one but then if we jump to the ultra wide on all three you can see the samsung is a little bit wider with a 0.5 times ultra wide whereas the other two are 0.6 times and then if we jump to the telephoto lens well at least the zoom because the pixel doesn't actually have a proper telephoto uh although it's digital zoom is actually quite good so we've got two times on the pixel the three times optical on the samsung and the two times optical on the one plus now if we go for a bit of a walk you can get an idea of the stabilization this is still with the zoom lens but then if we jump back to the main one i'm also switching between the microphones and all three phones throughout the little speaker icon switching so you can see which phone's recording the audio and then finally to the ultra wide now all three phones deserve a full review by themselves i can't cover every single feature of the phone in this video because well we'll be here all day but hopefully by this point you've got a better idea of which phone is probably best for you i've been going back and forth and which is my favorite throughout this whole video i don't think there is one clear winner it all kind of comes down to what's important to you i think if you're a gamer then maybe you know don't go for the pixel 5 but if you want the best camera then the s20 and the pixel are kind of like your best bets if i had to use one as my daily driver as the youtuber cliche goes i would probably go with the s20 fe it feels like as i say the best all-rounder it does everything quite well but what about you which one would you go for the pixel the oneplus or the s20 fe let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys i know this was a long one but i hope you found this video helpful and if you do
