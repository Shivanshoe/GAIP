nearly a million of you guys watched my video from a few months ago where i switched to a 48-inch oled tv as my main monitor for gaming video editing everything really well since then i've had so many comments and dms on instagram asking how i got on with that tv as my monitor and also did i stick with it which as you can probably tell i did not it lasted about a month before i switched back to my trusty ultra wide this is the lg 38wn 95c which is both incredibly expensive at about 13 1400 pounds and also even though it's been out for about eight months still incredibly hard to find which is a shame because i think this is actually my perfect monitor so cast your mind back to last summer which i think was about two lockdowns ago here in the uk uh it's been a long year um but anyway there was a combination of brand new nvidia graphics cards the 30 series i've actually got the 1390 in here behind me although at the time uh nvidia kindly sent me there with the unit of the 3080 and about at the same time lg released their smallest ever oled tv the 48 inch c10 uh by the time that was the smallest oled and it also had hdmi 2.1 so now we're in this beautiful world where both my pc and my monitor support 2.1 which means i can get that full 4k 120 and of course that tv also supports things like g-sync the variable refresh rate much better contrast ratio of course being an oled which has its pros and cons but you're getting almost a million or infinite contrast ratio compared to maybe 12 to 1300 to 1 on this ips display and of course when it comes to hdr content while it's not really a massive deal for pcs i think at the moment tvs are generally much brighter which means you can get a much better sort of hdr effect if you're going to use a tv so i set it up i made the video and i had this 48 inch tv here for about a month as i say and firstly i was just blown away by it i absolutely loved it that sort of inky black that you got also the glossy panel even though it's not the best because you get reflections and in my fairly bright living room i could see the wall behind me which wasn't ideal coming from you know typical matte pc monitors and of course just the sheer scale of it was of sight to behold it was very very cool but at the time i did have a couple of issues i didn't mention this in the video because i thought it might be fixed with an update which it has been since uh but when i connected the 2.1 and i tried to get 10 bit 4k 120 i'd have this sort of flashing every now and then there was an issue with nvidia g-sync and the lg tv essentially but lg eventually a couple months later uh updated it so that did fix that but the other much bigger issue was as much as i loved using the tv i got headaches i genuinely did i felt eye strain like i've never felt before and i think a lot of you guys were completely right when you mentioned in the comments that i was just sitting far too close to it i think you know imagine the tv here well you don't have to imagine i can show you some of the b-roll clips from the time but this 60 centimeter desk which is a pretty standard desk depth just wasn't big enough so there were a couple of solutions that i could have done i could have wall-mounted the tv which would have set it back another few inches and i think may have made a bit of a difference although because as you guys know i review a lot of tech i also switch these monitors out every now and then that's not really ideal for me because i'd like to keep my desk set up changing or i could have got a bigger desk that sent it further back from where i sat that would have also worked and the other option that some people mentioned in comments were just to use wireless peripherals then i could maybe move the whole thing back a little bit and just you know sit further back on my chair all those were good suggestions but i'm just a little bit space limited but yeah i did get headaches and i'm someone who currently uses a 38 inch ultra wide you know i spend 10 hours a day looking at my pc but never before have i genuinely experienced those kind of headaches which i guess were just an onset from the eye strain of just being so close to that display i'm all about bigger the better usually but there is a point where it does start to hurt and i remember editing this video i was like i have to get this done i was sort of on a time pressure but two hours in i was just like oh i need to like lie down and close my eyes now of course that wasn't lg's fault nor the tv that was just my setup and a consequence of well trying to use a 48 inch tv as a desktop monitor a lot of you guys also asked about burn in well i don't think me using it for a month is really a good indicator of whether it is or not i actually have a lg g10 77 inch tv i've been using for eight months no burn in there burning is a complicated issue because most people especially most sensible people will never experience it as long as you've not got you know the same you know as long as you've not got the same screen on all the time with the same hud elements and assuming you turn off all the safety features like the pixel refreshes and the auto off functions if you turn all those things off and you leave the same display on day in day out then yes you're probably going to get some kind of burning but in real life with real world use and maybe just a little bit of sensibleness common sense i think is that what i'm looking for i don't think burning is going to be an issue for anyone really so i don't think that's the reason at all for not going for an old monitor i think really it was that 48 inch size with my size constraints which was the issue so as you guys can see i'm back to my ultra wide this i've had for about eight months uh i was using this before the tv and then i've come back to it it's still my favorite monitor ever uh you guys if you're familiar with the channel you know that i've been using ultrawides for years but the problem is until very recently or at least until this model last year they've been either focused on productivity and working so they've been you know color accurate and had thunderbolt all they've been for gaming and they've had high refresh rates but lacking that color accuracy so i've never found that perfect monitor where i could play cyberpunk or call of duty or something and then also edit my videos confidently knowing that it's color accurate until this guy which as i say is very expensive and still quite hard to find the 38wn95c but this genuinely takes all the boxes that i want we've got a 144hz refresh rate g-sync and so that's great for gaming we've also got thunderbolt 3 if you want to plug in my macbook pro but then it's also super color accurate there's custom color profiles for srgb dci p3 and adobe rgb so i can change the colors of the screen to match the content that i'm producing and it's also still a really big screen it's 38 inches uh diagonal but crucially it's 24 by 10. so the aspect ratio is a little bit taller than your normal 21x9 ultrawides which i've always found to feel just a little bit too narrow and a little bit too restricted this is a big screen size with that little extra vertical real estate thanks to that slightly taller aspect ratio it's got quite a subtle premium looking stand it does wobble a bit as you can see and also it just gives you a little bit of rotation at the top which is annoying because you can never then quite find the perfect horizontal flat level again so there is a little bit of room for improvement and it does cost pretty much the same price as that 48 inch oled tv which is why i think it was a good comparison to make you know top of the line monitor versus top of the line small tv but now i'm pretty settled with this so what have i learned well i think 48 inches is too big for a traditional normal desk setup unless you can wall mount it push yourself back a little bit or you've got a deeper desk or be on the lookout for what is rumored to come this year in the form of some slightly smaller 40-inch oled either tvs or monitors i'm still very much for an oled display so hopefully now we're in 2021 there'll be some new interesting monitors slash tvs to try out and i'll come back to you guys in a few months with some other setup options and you can give me your thoughts but it's not lost to me that i am incredibly lucky that i do have these opportunities to test these different very high-end products and i can sort of settle on the one i like that's the benefit of being able to review these sort of technologies and if you've got any other questions at all about this or my setup as a whole i love talking about this stuff let me know in the comments below i read every single comment and i'll do my best to reply thank you so much for watching guys hit that subscribe button down below if you want to see more from me and i'll catch you next time right here on the tech chat
