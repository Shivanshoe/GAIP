hey guys Anton the tech and we finally had our first glimpse and the new range of Samsung Galaxy S 20 phones credit to max wind back for this and as expected we have the hole punch selfie camera on the front the rectangular camera array on the back power and volume buttons on the right side and nothing on the left including no Bigsby button and there's still no headphone jack which isn't that surprising although the new mid-range Note 10 and s 10 light phones have brought it back just quickly guys a big thank you to fast host for sponsoring this video and also offering you guys the chance to win two tickets to South by Southwest including flights and accommodation so if you're in the UK all you have to do is answer this techie test question which iPhone first introduced the App Store to enter click the link in the description below and I'll explain more at the end of the video so right now everything is kind of leaks and reports and rumors nothing confirmed although we have a pretty good idea but we'll know everything on February the 11th that's when Samsung unpacked event takes place and there's actually a couple of Easter eggs in the invite firstly that appears to be the s20 s camera module on the left and also we have the upcoming Galaxy Z flip basically the fall 2 on the right also it may just be a coincidence but if you look at the date of the official unpacked event in the UK format we're looking at 11 to 20 11 to 20 maybe that's a slight clue to the fact that we gained the s 20 phones or maybe it's just a coincidence and I'm reading far too much into it but anyway it has all but been confirmed we will be getting the galaxy s 20 rather than the s 11 so firstly there's gonna be three new models the s 20 there's 20 plus and the s 20 ultra which takes over from last year's S 10 es10 and s 10 plus they'll all come with slowly taller screens using a 20 by 9 aspect ratio and actually here's a side by side which was clearly shown a potato or something of the s 10 plus versus the new s 20 plus and you can see how much small the hole punch is versus the corner knotch and that we're getting slowly thinner bezels as well it also looks like the new S 20 s will have more rounded corners versus the note template ear all right let's talk specs all three new phones will come with faster 120 Hertz displays quad HD plus resolutions the latest snapdragon 865 Volvox lost 990 chips in some regions along with faster ram your FST storage but really it's the s20 ultra that i'm most excited about so across the board that's a pretty big upgrade a slightly refresh design faster processors high refresh screen more RAM the better fingerprint reader and of course updated cameras which we'll get to in just a second but just quickly well there's been some back-and-forth on this it seems now to be confirm that the s20 phones won't support 120 Hertz above full HD so unfortunately you can't have the best of both worlds in terms of having a 120 Hertz wqhd plus screen instead you'll have to choose between 60 Hertz at the high res or 120 Hertz at the lower full HD plus res I think for me I'd rather go with 120 Hertz I think you'd see a bigger difference there than you with the high resolution or there was slightly annoying that we can't get both especially as the reports of the upcoming one plus eight suggest that that will have both there's a chance they could at it through a software update or maybe that's something they're saving for the note 11 sorry the note 20 plus later in the year or maybe it's just because it's gonna drain the battery too fast and speaking of the battery here's how the three new phones compared to last year's models and while the high refresh screen will draw more power overall we should expect a nice boost in battery life plus we get faster 25 watt charging across the board and even faster 45 watts on the ultra plus Wireless and also reverse wireless charging so you can top up other Qi enabled devices as for 5g reports suggest the s20 will come in 4G as standard but with an optional 5g model except for the s20 ultra which will be exclusively 5g so that's all pretty exciting but I think the biggest upgrade will be in the camera department and so this is the setup we can expect for the three phones the S 20 plus adds a time-of-flight sensor and the ultra model goes crazy with a 108 megapixel main camera and although we should have the ability to shoot full res by default this will use what's called pixel binning combining nine pixels into one to create a sharper less noisy 12 megapixel image what's interesting though is we're also getting a high res telephoto lens across all three phones the s20 and the plus get a 64 megapixel 5 x telephoto whereas the ultra gets the 48 megapixel 10 times optical zoom also thanks to the new processor and camera sensor will also get 8k video support at 30fps 4k at 120 and unlimited super slow motion so this is going to be a big upgrade for video as well so some pretty big hardware upgrades of course we'll also get Android ten and Samsung's 1ui 2.0 software which should speed things up add a few new features and also come with better gestures including swiping in from the edge to go back like you can on the pixel in the oneplus I think one of the more underrated new features though is the upgraded fingerprint reader I actually made a whole video about the 3d sight max video when Qualcomm unveiled it along with the snapdragon 86 5 and it seems like a massively forward so if you have five minutes to watch a video all about fingerprint readers and I mean who doesn't click the little pop-out card at the top right so that's pretty much everything we know so far about the s20 and I have to say I don't think I've been this excited for a new galaxy phone in years this seems like a really big upgrade still it is worth taking everything with a little pinch of salt until it's confirmed by Samsung themselves on February the 11th also along with the galaxy Zed flip zette flip Z flip is it probably the Z flip we say is that in the UK but that'll be exciting as well and I can't wait to test that out so make sure you do subscribe
