hey guys Anton the tech job but I've been checking your MSI's new 20/20 lineup of laptops monitors PCs and basically just nerding out with all the cool tech and at the end of the video I want you to tell me in the comments below which you think is the most exciting or coolest new product alright so new at CES 2020 we have these two gaming laptops we've got the GS 66 stealth which is there sort of women like slightly smarter looking laptop you could maybe take this into the office and you wouldn't get laughed out of a meeting and for me this is actually one of my favorite laptops is being updated with Intel's a tenth gen 8 Series chips as well as end videos next generation graphics cards they won't tell me exactly what it is probably the rumored super version of the RT X cards so when this comes out in a few months this will be a nice little upgrade in terms of performance and you can see it's still relatively lightweight and also very thin for a gaming laptop we also get now up to a 300 Hertz refresh rate screen now two questions firstly what games you got to be able to play the get 300 fps there's another question and also can you tell between 240 and 300 but if you're a pro gamer anyone the fastest response screen possible then you can spec this with 300 Hertz and it is crazy smooth the stealth also gets a new triple fan cooling design which msi say will provide up to 10% more airflow for better thermals so that's the stealth but if you come over here with me we then have the GE 66 Raider breaking the air stand which actually has identical specs to the stealth but it's a little bit thicker a little bit heavier we've also got this new RGB strip in the front which you can customise so it's got a bit more of a game u vibe to it so again 10th gem processors new r-tx cards the 300 Hertz refresh rate screen you also have this little bit on the back for the better cooling so along with the extra thickness of it you're gonna be able to overclock this a bit further you'll get slightly cooler temperatures than the both the stealth and the Raider also pack in massive 99.9 watt hour batteries which is actually the biggest you can put in a laptop while still be able to take it on a plane with you so we should say a nice boost in battery life as well now this has to be one of the coolest looking gaming laptops I've ever seen it's actually a special edition of the new GE 66 Raider and it's called the Dragon shield it's been designed by a chap called collie words who's a concept artist and worked on things like the Star Wars prequels Iron Man transformers and with these edged metal panels that resemble a spaceship it definitely stands out so what I do love to play games and fortunately I have an awful lot time these days and so actually create a lap tops like this which give you the performance that you get normally with a gaming laptop but in a slightly sleeker design we're not so much more color accurate screen this is the stuff that I actually get really excited about and that's when you create a 17 mini LED comes in and as the name suggests it's a 17 inch laptop and actually it's using a whole new type of display using mini LEDs so we get much better contrast ratios deeper blacks more vibrant colors and also higher brightness so we can get some properly good high dynamic range on this just look at that let's see they put it side-by-side with their previous version hopefully it doesn't fall off you can actually see a big difference when it comes to the deepness of the blacks and the richness of the colors and of course the dryness because when it comes to editing videos particularly if you're editing you know HDR content then you're gonna want to screen it that can actually show it all off natively but it's not just about the screen this is also a bit of a performance powerhouse when this comes out like MSI's other gaming laptops this will have Intel's latest tenth generation h-series processors so these are going to come out for a few months but we should see a nice boost in performance probably 10 core 20 thread chips as well as r-tx graphics if you're creative like me and you're editing 4k videos or photos then this is definitely one to look out for from crazy looking laptops two desktops I mean just look at this thing it's the new msi make ages TI 5 gaming desktop and as you'd expect it's an absolute powerhouse with up to an RT X xx atti 10th gen Intel Core i processors but without a doubt it's the design along with this quite unique looking but knob thing which they're calling the HMI which stands for human machine interface and also the fact it's the first 5g compatible desktop that's actually come in to market so the HMI wheel button thing on the front can customize the lighting switch to different game modes and also give you system information like CPU speeds and temperatures I'm not sure how often I'd actually use it but I do like the idea of its certainly looks cool now next to it we have the new msi optics meg 38 1cq are not the caches of names but this 38 inch ultra wide gaming monitor which also has its own integrated HMI there's a little OLED screen in the bottom corner it's a great game amount with a 144 house refresh and 38 40 by 1600 resolution sticking with martyrs and this is what MSI are saying is the world's first gaming monitor with a 1000 are curved so you get that cool wraparound experience and with a one millisecond response time 144 has refresh this 32 inch ultra wide is want to look out for so that's all well and good but if you need something for on-the-go when you're traveling then the optics mag 161 is an external monitor for your laptop plug it in via HDMI or USB C and you get a 15.6 inch IPS screen that supports up to a battery 240 Hertz refresh so again this is ideal for gaming so much tech so little time but MSI are also showing off a range of motherboards PC cases graphics cards and also some pretty smart looking peripherals including this the CK 40 keyboard the CM 30 Mouse and even these CH 40 wireless earbuds and they all come in their prestige white color scheme it's great to see msi embracing the more creative and professional audiences with ease okay so what do you think which of these are you most excited for let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and if you want to
