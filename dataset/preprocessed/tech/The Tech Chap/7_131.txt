now normally i'd be making a video on what we could expect with the upcoming note 21 ultra all the new features speculation rumors all that good stuff but sadly it looks like we may not even be getting one and the weirdest part is that it's not that samsung doesn't want to make it but they're not sure if they can because you may be aware there's a bit of a crisis going on in the world at the moment not even coronavirus but it's the lack of semiconductor chips this chippergeddon we're in there's a shortage and it's affecting everyone from cars i mean vw honda toyota and gm of all reduced production as well as game consoles cpus and gpus for pc builds as i'm sure you know if you've tried to upgrade your pc this year getting an rtx 3000 series graphics card for anything like retail price it's just impossible and now we're being warned of shortages for smartphones and samsung's mobile chief dj co has said that there's a serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips globally and that new high-end models might be difficult to release and it could be a burden to unveil two flagship models in one year so he was very careful not to completely roll it out but it does seem like we're not gonna get a note 21 or note 21 ultra and instead at the earliest we'll be looking at a 2022 release of presumably the note 22 which is a real shame so as you guys know samsung usually launches their new galaxy s range at the beginning of the year this year was actually a month earlier than we're used to back in february so we've got the s21 ultra here and then usually around august time we see the updated note series this is the note 20 ultra and it usually builds on the s series by adding a slightly more powerful processor if one's available uh this year we'll be looking at say the snapdragon 8 plus along with a slightly bigger screen more squared off corners although uh following a similar design from the s series potentially they would have kept in the micro sd card slot and paired that with maybe up to a terabyte of storage internally plus in terms of ram we've just seen the rog phone 5 the ultimate edition pack 18 gigabytes of the stuff so on the note series which is always the all-singing all-dancing over-the-top flagship from samsung we could have seen maybe 16 or 18 gig ram options we also usually see some camera upgrades uh in fact the note 20 ultra still is a triple camera setup compared to the quad camera of the s21 so we've only got the single periscope zoom lens on here so we would have expected a similar setup on here with the two zoom lenses but what's really interesting is that the staple of the note series is of course the s pen which as you guys know is also now compatible with the s21 ultra not to quite the same extent with this we are missing some features like bluetooth and the air gestures although a proper s20 ultra s pen pro lots of peas there is coming out which will fully work with it so maybe that was samsung thinking ahead of time if we're not going to get a new note phone let's put some of that functionality on the s series so if we're not gonna see a new note 21 this year where does that leave us well dj code did suggest that it would just be a temporary hiatus and that we would still look forward to a note 22 coming next year which is great so it's not just killing off the note series completely and of course we've also got the new galaxy a series the a52 and 872 has just been launched or at least unveiled we've also got the upcoming galaxy z fold 3 to look forward to and some recent rumors have been suggesting that samsung wants to kind of pivot away from your traditional rectangular slabs of glass these smartphones where it's harder and harder to stand out and we're seeing even better budget phones and to sort of go more towards these different form factors because uh the galaxy flip and the fold are actually genuinely really good phones uh the zed fold 2 was one of my favorite devices of last year so i can't wait to see what we can do with a new one and i think for me if i had to pick between a new fold or a new note phone i think i'd be more excited about the fold but what about you let me know in the comments below which one you'd rather see this year so never say never but with what dj ko has said he's the chief mobile officer of samsung i don't think we are going to see a note 21 this year but this also could just be the start i don't think this chip again crisis is going to go anywhere anytime soon i mean it's caused by a whole bunch of factors but a lot of it is the pandemic last year affecting manufacturing factories had to shut down also companies were ordering less because they were seeing fewer sales and so the delay of that is now affecting us and we're seeing the shortage not only that but shipping containers are in the wrong places around the world cryptocurrency mining and of course everyone is just at home and working from home so the demand is higher than ever and so all together we have this perfect storm of demand being sky high and supply being low so prices are gonna go up or indeed as we're seeing from samsung they're just gonna cut products out this year one company reported that we may actually be seeing a five percent drop in smartphone reduction this year which doesn't sound like a lot but when you consider last year 1.38 billion phones were sold that amounts to about 69 million fewer phones this year so right now in march things aren't looking too bad for smartphones there's about a million releases this month including with the new redmi note 10 pro oneplus 9 and 9 pro we've also got the oppo 5x3 pro new real me's new poco phones but i think it's going to be in the second half of the year from the summer onwards that we are going to start to see some cutbacks and maybe some delays and it is going to be tricky for samsung because while they've had a great s21 launch come september time when the new iphones come out usually they've just come off the launch of the latest note series but this year if we're not gonna get one aside from maybe the zedfold three apple's gonna pretty much dominate the last half of the year so kind of scary times not just from a health perspective but also from a tech perspective hopefully it's not affecting you guys too much although i know if you're looking to buy a ps5 or upgrade your pc it already is uh because of the police scalpers and bitcoin miners as well but would you be sad if we didn't see a note 21 this year and as i say would you rather see if you had to choose a note 21 ultra or a zed fold three let me know in the comments below and if you did enjoy this video and want to see more of me pretending like i know what's going on in the world give
