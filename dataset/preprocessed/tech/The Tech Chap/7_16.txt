hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and i have bought the wrong laptop this is the brand new dell xps 17 9720 and since i always get pretty excited about a new dell xps laptop i think perhaps i was just rushing to get an order in before the shipping times got crazy but unfortunately i kind of expect this thing all wrong and actually i am ordering another one a flagship top spec model which i plan to do a big comparison with against my top spec macbook pro 16 but in the meantime let me walk you through what i did wrong so you avoid the same mistake and also since i do have this now let me show you around the new xps and see what's new and from the outside you can't really tell any difference over last year's or even the year before's xbs17s but it is still an absolutely gorgeous laptop with this big 17-inch 16x10 screen front and center with its super thin bezels and it's all squeezed in a fairly slim and compact aluminium shell with dell's almost trademark carbon fiber palm rest and of course this gargantuan trackpad the chiclet keyboard is as nice as ever and while there is no numpad dell uses the space either side for bigger speakers which sound great there is also a pretty average 720p webcam up top which also supports windows hello plus we get a fingerprint reader built into the power button on the side we get 4 thunderbolt 4 ports plus a full size sd card reader which is always good to see along with a headphone jack a kensington lock port and overall it's just a lovely premium laptop which you can actually open with just one finger well sort of so far so good then but the problem is i said most of that about last year's xps 17 as well and there's still no fancy frost white version of the 17 like we see on the 13 and the 15 which i think looks a lot better or at least it's nice to have the option and also there's still no oled screen option like we've been able to get on the 15 for the last couple of years it's also very expensive starting at about 2 200 pounds or 1900 although the base us spec is a little bit lower which accounts for that price difference i was kind of hoping for maybe like a xps 17 plus model to come out like we're seeing with the 13 plus with its refresh design and macbook pro style haptic trackpad you still can't buy the 13 plus just yet but i reckon this maybe points to what we can expect from maybe the 2023 xps 15 and 17. now apart from the obvious benefits of having a bigger 17 inch screen the main reason you might consider the 17 over the 15 is the fact that we have the option of a beef gear graphics card up to the 30 60. also all models of the 17 come with the bigger battery cell size the lower end versions of the 15 come with a smaller battery and also on the inside we get vapor chamber cooling plus there are more options for upgrading it it is worth pointing out though that regardless of whether you go for the 3050 or the more powerful 3060 rtx gpu they are both 60 watt tgp variants which are definitely on the low end for those graphics cards and so because of this slim profile and also the thermal headroom we have to work with in here this isn't going to be as fast as other more workstation e or even more gaming oriented laptops with higher tgp variants of the cards so we're looking at the same design the same gpu options the same screen has much really changed here well the headline really is the new 12th gen intel core i7 and i9 h-series older lake cpus which are faster and more efficient thanks to a new architecture that mixes high performance p cores with high efficiency e cores and actually both cpus also come with faster intel iris xe integrated graphics which are obviously still not as fast as the dedicated gpus but they are much improved over even last year's 11th gen xe graphics one minor gripe though is that we still don't get wi-fi 6e support which is a bit of a shame although not really a deal breaker the new xps models also get ddr5 ram although this is kind of a stock speed ddr5 rated at 4800 megabytes per second and while it should beat ddr4 kits in some basic tasks like compression it's unlikely to really make that much difference to everyday use so it's an iterative spec bump upgrade this year perhaps we'll see a bigger overhaul next year fingers crossed but let's go back to the mistake i made at the start with how i actually specced this here is what i ordered the base i7 cpu the base rtx 350 4 gig gpu with the one terabyte ssd and the sharper 4k touchscreen as my only two extras fairly sensible choices then so how the heck did i manage to spend almost three grand on this well the 17 is expensive at the best of times and in my haste or perhaps just extreme tiredness i somehow specced 64 gigs of ddr5 ram adding a whopping 450 what i would recommend though if you are thinking about buying this is to stick with the i7 i don't think although i haven't had them side-by-side to test but i don't think 400 pounds extra for the i9 is really worth it what i would do is stick with the i7 and put that money towards the more powerful 3060. most people are probably going to be fine with 16 gigs of ram especially as you can upgrade it yourself later same with the ssd although that has got a bit more complicated and bit more expensive because we are talking about ddr5 and pci 4 components now but realistically i think for a 17 if this is gonna be a sort of workstation replacement 32 gigs of ddr5 ram is the best choice definitely on the 17 inch model go with the 4k screen you can get away with 1080p on the 15 inch but not really this screen size so definitely go 4k and we are looking at just shy of 3000 pounds that is the spec that i would go for if you are buying this in the us and some other countries you do actually get the option of a lower spec i5 along with 8 gigs of ram and no gpu just the integrated iris xe which may be worth considering if you don't need all that extra performance and just want a big 17 inch screen but at that point you may be better off with something like the lg gram 17 which is much lighter as well but if you want to go absolutely nuts and tick every option you're looking at just shy of 4 grand that's top spec 16-inch macbook pro with m1 max money although to be fair this can hold its own against apple's machine in a lot of situations and is of course much better for gaming alternatively consider last year's 9710 xps 17 instead you could get a fairly similar spec for a good 500 pounds less or so so definitely consider last year's model before you shell out on this also quick side note i get that dell sells a lot of products but their website is still pretty horrible to use i mean not everyone is going to understand the differences between new and old versions of the same laptop especially when they're listed side by side or sold from the same page now this isn't my full review video and i will be doing more tests when i have the higher end spec i can compare the two and also compare it to the xps 15 and also against my macbook pro 16 but while i have this let's run a few quick tests to see what kind of performance we're looking at and in general use as you would expect everything from multitasking a bunch of chrome tabs a bit of lightroom editing raw photos it is all nice and smooth although i did find editing high bitrate 60 video in premiere pro was a bit choppy so again i'm having to resort to using proxy files and maybe dropping the render resolution down to help smooth things out in premiere pro i still much prefer using my macbook pro 16. now as for games whichever gpu option you go for i would recommend dropping the resolution down to 1080p well 1200p technically to get a much higher frame rate although with the 3050 i have in here i still got an impressive 220fps in rainbow six siege with ultra settings and actually even at 4k i got a smooth 73 not too bad fan noise isn't too bad under load although the keyboard deck and the trackpad can get quite toasty after a while and you do often hear the fan wear up even under fairly light use even just with a bit of chrome open the problem is there is nothing wrong with the xps 17 it's got a nice little upgrade it's a bit of a spec bump and it is still a beautiful laptop to use but it's very expensive and i just think the competition is not only catching up but really making strides ahead not just from apple with the macbook pro 16 which i i i'm using as i say off camera here that is my go-to work laptop right now also i think other brands like asus with their zenbook pros and studio books there's just a lot more innovation there that really makes it stand out compared to this which is just the exact same laptop as last year just with a new cpu and some slightly faster ram just dropped in it feels a bit lazy but still i will reserve some judgment although i'm pretty judgy already on it for my full review and also comparison videos so make sure you stay tuned and you have hit that subscribe button so you don't miss out on that but what do you reckon do you think this is a decent upgrade would you be tempted to buy one or not let me know in the comments below and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat thanks for watching
