hey guys i'm from the tech chap and this little beauty well this 28.2 inch beauty to be exact is the new huawei mate view and along with the new mate view gt which is the more gaming focus display this is their first proper foray into the world of monitors and it definitely makes a good first impression with this ultra premium build with a slim profile and bezels a 3x2 aspect ratio 4k plus resolution color accurate ips screen wireless display connectivity screen mirroring and if you have a recent huawei phone a desktop mode like samsung's decks and we also get pretty decent speakers plenty of connectivity options and this very nifty touch bar control however at 600 pounds or 700 euros considering we don't get proper thunderbolt 3 support and there's also some brightness uniformity issues that i'll show you in a second there's definitely room for improvement but i still love having this on my desk i mean it should be no surprise really that huawei can make a beautiful monitor i mean the matebook laptops here's one i made earlier are some of the most stylish and well just good looking ultra portable laptops that you can actually buy and of course we've also got their phones this is the mate 40 pro which i'll demonstrate some of the wireless smart features in a second but they are masters of industrial design and it's great to see them bring all that aluminium clad loveliness to a monitor so we get this all-aluminium chassis which is just gorgeous it's clean it's modern but it certainly takes a page out of the likes of apple and dell's design playbook from the side the screen has a definite imac vibe and the all-round slim bezels keep things feeling modern up front the stand feels really solid as well there's a ton of height adjustment and a good 25 to 30 degrees of upward tilt and five degrees downward although it does miss out on rotation it is fairly lightweight though so swiveling the whole screen is easy enough now when you power on the mate view for the first time you get a quick tutorial on how to use the smart bar which is huawei's name for this touch sensitive strip that runs under and along the base for controlling the on-screen display options now i must admit usually i like a good joystick to control the osd uh and i didn't think i would like this at first because one of my complaints with the mate 30 phone from whenever it was um is that we had this purely virtual touch sensitive volume rocker we still have that with a mate 40 but they've also then added in the physical volume as well so i've not always been the biggest fan of their touch only uh sort of direction of ui but actually this works really well you slide left and right to adjust volume you tap to open the menu and double tap to go back or close it and sliding two fingers across lets you switch input it's intuitive and it makes a nice change from the usual fiddly joysticks or buttons and ugly bios like osd now the screen inputs are at the base of the stand and we get a hdmi 2.0 and a mini displayport 1.4 along with a usbc for power and then on the side we get three usb 3s uh two are type a and one is type c as well as a headphone jack and also the power button now sadly the usbc port doesn't support thunderbolt 3 or 4 which is a little bit disappointing given the price but it does still have some thunderbolt like benefits uh so if you connect a laptop it'll charge it at 65 watts and you can also use the mate view as a second screen at the full 4k plus resolution at 60hz over both usbc and the hdmi port okay let's talk about this screen because it's all well and good having a fancy design but this is what counts and it's a calibrated 10 bit ips panel with a 3840 by 2560 resolution so 4k plus essentially as we have some extra vertical pixels owing to this taller 3x2 aspect now if you're a regular here on the channel you know that i work with the lovely people over at surfsharkvpn all the time yes they're supporting

not give surf shark vpn a try and i'll tell you what this is the kind of monitor that i've been waiting for for quite a long time because mostly uh we see kind of like 27 inch 4k monitors which i just think are a bit small especially to really fully take advantage of that resolution and then the one up is 32 inches which may be too expensive or just too big for some people so this is a 28.2 inch slightly higher than 4k res so it's a really good size and also we have this 3x2 aspect ratio which is not something you see very often on a monitor and i quite like it although it depends on how you're using it the extra height can make everything feel a lot less constrained especially websites documents editing photos maybe any content that has a feed basically so it's funny that now it's taller and more squared off it's actually the width that starts to feel constrained putting two apps side by side makes them feel a little bit claustrophobic as do apps that benefit from more width so editing video in premiere pro felt a little bit constricted versus a regular wider 16x9 screen and also 3x2 isn't ideal for gaming and watching tv and movies as we get some quite chunky letterboxing although the image quality itself is very good and for gaming the cropped field of view really does impact that sort of immersive factor in games so they don't quite draw you in like they do on a regular screen but of course this isn't billed as a gaming monitor that's the mate view gt which is an ultra wide still though at 4k 60 it looks sharp and it plays well enough now huawei says this meets the hdr 400 standard which means 400 nits of peak brightness but in the spec and also in my tests it's clear this can actually hit 500 nits and it maintains this in my full screen test which is pretty good although i would have liked a little bit more given the price since we're getting the same 500 peak brightness in both sdr and hdr the bigger issue though with this is panel uniformity it may be harder to tell on the camera but in person you do notice the brightness drop off around the edges especially on the right hand side which is noticeably dimmer so at maximum brightness i found the center of the screen hit the full 500 nits but then it drops to 450 towards the edges and actually down to 400 nits just on the right hand side so when i move windows or apps around whites look noticeably grayer for a few centimeters from the right edge which isn't good if you need a consistent image across the screen now it's certainly possible this issue is just with my particular panel but it's worth keeping in mind the good news though is the overall color accuracy is very impressive which is great if you're a creator and your work is color sensitive although again i do worry that that inconsistent brightness will impact accuracy towards the edges pop open the smart bar menu and you can choose between srgb dci p3 and huawei's native color modes interestingly though it was that native mode that got me the best overall results with a 100 srgb 89 adobe rgb and 95 dci p3 so screens are all well and good but we have a few little extras with this because this is a smart monitor in fact huawei calls this their first standalone monitor meaning it doesn't have to be physically connected to a laptop or phone to work first up is one hop projection uh so if you have a huawei phone or tablet from the last couple of years you can tap it on the base of the stand to connect and then either mirror the phone on screen or open this desktop mode quite a lot like samsung's decks in that it lets you use your phone with a desktop style interface and you can even plug in a keyboard and mouse to use it like a proper pc so it's pretty cool to have this flexibility but how much you'll actually use this well it's really up to you and desktop mode looks a little bit squashed like it was designed for 16 by nine and of course there's the continuing issues of huawei being blocked out of much of the google ecosystem older huawei or other android phones can use screen mirroring as well but not using the nfc one hop connection and funnily enough i actually managed to get samsung's decks to work on this as well and then we have wireless projection which lets you cast your laptop screen to the mate view at up to a 2k resolution and it works reasonably well it's responsive and useful if you sat further away from the monitor and can't go with a wide connection for whatever reason although image quality is definitely grainier and it's not quite as responsive than with a proper wide connection so it's got some fancy extra smarts built in but i'm not convinced i would really use them that often although let me know in the comments if you would and which one of those would be most useful to you most of the time i'm just going to be hooking this up to my desktop or my laptop now just a quick mention of sound quality and the speakers are built into the stand sound and speech are clear enough and it gets pretty loud and i did detect traces of bass but no more than that all right then so let's sum up and should you buy the huawei mate view well yeah i think it's definitely worth considering um it's not perfect the screen uniformity issues are a problem especially at this size and i haven't had another one to test so it may just be this one it may be more widespread um also the 3x2 aspect ratio will be a massive selling point for some people so this really does depend on your use cases but personally i really enjoy using this aspect ratio it does make it stand out especially together with that 4k plus resolution so it's incredibly sharp solid color accuracy lovely build and design and actually this isn't something i say very often but i think it's priced pretty fairly at 599 pounds or 699 euros still quite a lot of money uh and it would have been nice to have proper thunderbolt support uh and also as i say screen uniformity issue but i don't think that's too bad at all for a ultra premium stylish home office monitor however i'm not totally convinced how useful those smart features are although i do quite like the touch bar but then that's like a fairly trivial thing you're not going to be using it that often i think the most obvious alternative to this though would be samsung's uh smart monitor which i reviewed a few months ago although this is much better uh while it doesn't have a ui like a tv which that monitor did the color accuracy of this the build quality overall i think it's just much better than samsung's so this is definitely worth considering but what do you make of the mate view and also a three by two aspect do you love it or do you hate it let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and if you want
