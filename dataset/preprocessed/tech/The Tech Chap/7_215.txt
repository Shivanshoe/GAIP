[Music] hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this is the new 27-inch imac so it's the 20 20 refresh and as you can see well it looks exactly the same from the outside which means this really is a internal spec bump upgrade which is you know fine although we were kind of crossing our fingers hoping that we would get a design refresh of this the fairly chunky bezels do make it look a little bit older but it's still an incredibly well-built device obviously this is an all-in-one so while you can see my desktop pc back here that is not connected to this all the gubbins all the hardware are in the back which is what you want all in one means an aio so this actually only came yesterday and i've only just got it unboxed and set up so i'm gonna obviously spend some time with it before i give you guys my full review but i want to do an unboxing and give you some first impressions and also running through what is new if you're thinking about buying this imacs so if i swipe right here uh you'll see that the new imac starts at 1800 pounds or 1800 the one i have here specked out with the nano texture glass which i'll talk about in a second 10th gen 10 core i9 processor 32 gigs of ram the fastest radio 5700 xt terabyte storage faster 10 gigabit ethernet and the magic mouse and the track pads 4 and twenty eight pounds so the best part of five grand for this which is an awful lot of money but as i say starting from eighteen hundred so what exactly is new with this well let's start from the outside as i say while the design is the same with this particular model which is a five hundred pound option we have this new nano texture glass that's something they started doing on their pro xdr display which costs thousands and thousands of pounds by itself and it's a way of mattifying the screen but without adding a additional layer on top which most manufacturers do to reduce the glossy reflection reflectivity of the screens but instead they basically etch the display at the nanometer level it all goes over my head but it actually means that this is far less reflective than your usual glossy imac and actually side by side with the macbook pro 16 you can see here i've got my led light above my camera it really does diffuse it it's much much less glossy and the bonus of this nano texture is that it doesn't interfere with the contrast or the color quality or anything like that so while it is a 500 pound extra if you are in a bright office or you are doing you know color grading then that may be worth investing in and also for the first time we're now getting true tone on the imac this is built into all new 27-inch models and basically adjusts the color temperature of the screen based on the ambient light around you so that you have that sort of natural paper white but if you're color grading you can always turn it off then we've got this guy which is a 1080p f 2.2 camera so it's actually much improved from the old 720p facetime camera and this is being shot from the new webcam not only is it high resolution 1080p rather than the 720p faceline which you still get on pretty much every other apple device including the macbook pro 16 which isn't the best but it's actually using the t2 security chip in here which is another new addition for the image signal processor so it's actually offloading some of the processing of this new camera onto the t2 which should help with the video quality but not only that they've also added three near studio microphones so hopefully you can hear my voice pretty clearly and the audio quality is good as well this is gonna be a much better setup for you improve camera and improve mics and then around the back we have the usual array of ports including four usb threes two thunderbolt three usb cs and a headphone jack but now we get a faster uhs two card reader and also now a 10 gigabit ethernet port uh which costs you a hundred pounds over the standard one gigabit i'm sure apple won't mind me using a samsung video to demonstrate this but they've also improved the speakers in the new imac it's actually technically the same hardware for the speakers but with again the t2 chip they're doing some uh processing behind the scenes to improve the bass and also uh reduce distortion at higher volumes and this thing does get pretty loud with it along with its little brother the standard note 20 which i'll come back to in a minute but while it will of course it sounds good it really does so a new now texture option we've got better speakers better webcam better microphones faster ports so quite a few upgrades already but it's what's on the inside that really counts so the entry level version for 1800 gets you the radeon pro 5300 along with a 6 core 10th gen i5 processor there's also an eight core i7 and then we've got the 5500 xt or if you do have very deep pockets and want that extra performance uh you can spec the 10 core i9 and also up to the radeon pro 5700 xt which comes with 16 gigs of ddr6 vram so if you are using apps or programs that can take advantage of more vram then it is good that we have this option the only thing that's slightly disappointing is we are looking at getting uh the next gen graphics cards i think late september uh our dna2 from amd and of course uh the 3000 series from nvidia although we wouldn't see that in here nothing you can really do about that so how fast is this exactly well i ran cinebench r20 earlier you can see here we've got the i9 10 910 cpu and then in geekbench 5 we're looking at 1173 single core 8530 multicore now you know i actually shot a little bit of this video earlier on and i'm going to edit the whole thing on here i've already got started with it as you can see and so far it's incredibly smooth this is a full 4k file of course it's pretty simple at the moment i do start to hear the fans we're up a little bit when i'm editing it does get to a point you can hear it i'd say it's about the same as my desktop back here but because it's closer to me it is a little bit louder but it's never obtrusive it's never uh you know really made me notice it and of course if you're wearing headphones then you won't know at all so overall then first impressions well it would have been nice to see a bit of a redesign i would have loved to see a 32-inch option maybe if they shrunk the bezels a bit and increase the screen size i actually use a 38-inch ultra wide usually so for me at least it's a little bit smaller but i get that's not what the average person uses and for example while you can tilt the screen and also rotate the whole thing because it's not that heavy actually as he struggles to lift it uh oh my back light just came on but there's still no height adjustment so i'm gonna probably have to put it on something to bring it up to my eye level but really the important stuff is on the inside and apple say that we're looking at up to 65 cpu boosts and 55 gpu and in some cases even more if you go for that 16 gig of vram 5700 xt so importantly the power is there and it is nice to have this now texture option improve webcam better speakers better mic faster sd card and ethernet so yeah it's actually a pretty impressive upgrade if you have any questions at all let me know in the comments below and i'll do my best to answer them and also you might notice that i'm edging closer to that one million subscriber mark so if you haven't already subscribed it would be amazing if you could help me out thank you so much for watching guys i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
