[Music] hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is going to be probably one of the weirdest unboxing first impression videos i've ever done not least because before these review samples even came which is like a good several days before they actually unveil them officially at the launch event i saw a tv advert for the pixel 6 and 6 pro so google's basically leaked everything anyway so you guys know pretty much everything there is to know about these also i'm under a very strict embargo for this video my full review and tons of comparisons will be coming in a few days but for this video i can show you a few things but i am still very excited about these because i've been waiting for a new flagship pixel for what two years now my wife as well she still uses the pixel 4 xl from 2019 she cannot wait to upgrade to one of these so let's see what we've got so this is the stormy black pixel six and as you can see the side of the box actually reflects the color of the phone uh because we've got the cloudy white six pro which you must say i think is gonna be my favorite uh but also we've got this sort of white side of the box as well so a little interesting difference there but let's get these opened up and we've got the phone straight away there we go let's put that to one side so we do have a couple of things going on here we've got some paperwork which i very uh elegantly take out some paperwork a usb c to usb c cable and also a usb a2c adapter to help you switch from an older phone that's it no charger unfortunately in the box although these do support up to 30 watt fast charging but you'll have to buy that yourself so let's now jump into the 6 pro i'm guessing it's going to be exactly the same oh look at that that does look nice uh yep usbc adapter paperwork i will let you into a little secret that most youtubers when they do unboxings they have audiobox and set up the phone i know i do because it's not very helpful uh doing this bit and then i have to go away for half an hour while i set it up put my apps on it and try it out a little bit anyway let's do the good bit beautiful that'll do that's one all right and there we have it the six and the six pro first things first i need one of these a little microfiber cloth because straight away on this black one i've already got my monkey fingerprints all over it and i actually cleaned this before i put it back in the box so um i think actually regardless of what color you think looks better they do come in a variety the black does pick up fingerprints a little bit easier than the white okay so first impressions well when i first picked these up they did kind of remind me of a huawei phone the 6 pro especially kind of like you know the latest mate 40 or p40 or something just because you've got these sort of rounded glass corners it feels a lot more premium and sort of a little bit more precious in your hand that's not a bad thing at all so it really does feel like a departure from older pixel phones uh particularly the five which had this sort of well recycled paper cardboard material feel to it i also think if jordy leforge from nextgen was going to have a phone it would probably be this one with the visor i can't unsee it now now unfortunately due to the very strict embargo this is all i can actually show you of the phone i can show you the hardware we can talk about specs which we'll go into in a second and the home screen but i cannot do anything else apparently even if i just swipe down and show you the notifications or the settings menu then some google heavies will break my door down and come take it away from me so best be careful best be on their good side so this is all i can show uh in terms of the phone just the home screen and maybe the google news feed that still counts as the home screen i guess so let's talk specs and the first thing you'll notice well the six pro is bigger we've got a 6.4 versus 6.7 inch screen full hd versus quad hd and also 90 hertz versus 120 hertz so bigger sharper and smoother on the 6 pro plus it uses an ltpo panel so it can dynamically adjust that refresh rate based on what you're doing if you're watching a video or playing a game and that can actually go somewhere to help improve battery life now design wise we have this hole punch cut out for the selfie camera which actually is a little bit different in terms of the hardware which we'll come back to in a second also the six pro does have slightly thinner bezels and also a curved screen as you can see here we've got this curved glass as opposed to the flat screen on the six but i must admit the six pro does feel a bit sort of higher quality in your hand but what do you think do you prefer a curved glass edge and that sort of fancier feel in your hand or just a good old-fashioned flat edge interestingly though despite the fact that we have this smaller screen and is a fair bit smaller it actually only weighs three grams less and it's also exactly the same 8.9 millimeters thick the six does feel a little bit sort of chunky and a little bit cheaper feeling than the six pro which i guess does make sense this is the more high-end phone but yeah it's just a bit odd that this isn't lighter and a bit more compact we also get the latest gorilla glass victus on the front screens on both although on the back only the 6 pro has victus whereas the 6 has well its namesake google 6. you'll also notice we have an extra lens on the six pro which is the telephoto uh which this one misses out also on the side you can see we've got a slightly different texture this different material google are calling this a polished alloy on the six pro versus just a tactile alloy which is basically a more sort of matte metal finish on the standard six so again i think overall the six pro does feel just a bit more premium and they're also both ip68 dust and water resistant we do also get stereo speakers on both phones which is great but that is it aside from the power and volume button on the right hand side no headphone jack and while we do get dual sim 5g of course and that's a nano sim plus an esim uh there is no micro sd card expandability which is a bit frustrating as these phones top out with just 256 gigs of storage you only get 128 or 256 options and so as a bit of an enthusiast power user and someone who's just been playing with the iphone 13s that have 512 and one terabyte storage options it is a bit surprising a bit disappointing that it does top out 256 and you can't expand it further it will be fine for most people and ourselves we'll come to in a minute about pricing these are arguably better value but still it would have been good to see more storage both phones come with google's brand new tensor core processor which is completely different from obviously the usual qualcomm snapdragon chips that we're used to along with 8 gigs of ram on the 6 versus 12 on the 6 pro not only is it a departure from the usual as i say qualcomm chips and mediatek processors and apple's a series on the iphone google are really putting effort into the neural engine and the sort of ai machine learning chops of them because while in the sort of leaked benchmarks that we've seen available publicly generally we're seeing these not quite perform up to the same standard as a snapdragon 8 but then those leaked benchmarks are obviously from pre-release models and can't be confirmed but also they don't really take into account what we might be seeing in terms of that neural performance and machine learning because computational photography all the google assistant stuff everything going on behind the scenes to give you a sort of smart user experience with these is harder to measure so it's gonna be really interesting to test these out see if that really makes much difference in terms of the processing times for the camera what it unlocks and also how developers might be able to take advantage of it going forward because right out of the box we're probably not going to see that many non-google advantages with these tensor cores so it might be more of a case of watch this space as opposed to when i can finally show you the benchmarks being blown away by the crazy high geekbench numbers the 6 pro does have a bigger 5 000 million power battery versus about 4 600 on the 6 although i think battery life will be the same this does have the ltpo more efficient panel but this is smaller low resolution and also only 90 hertz uh so i think that will probably even out both phones also support the latest wi-fi 6e which is great to see as well as bluetooth 5.2 although only the 6 pro comes with a uwb chip which we get on the s21 ultra and the iphones and it's basically a more precise version of bluetooth and the idea is it might help you unlock your cars you're sort of approaching it but in reality there aren't that many use cases for uwb at the moment now hopefully i can show you this because well it just brings me onto the home screen but the only biometric option for unlocking we have is a optical fingerprint reader there is no face unlocking on either new pixel sixes which is a bit weird because generally on most android phones we have face locking and fingerprint so you have well two options as well as your pin password and swiping that's a bit weird we do get 30 watt wired charging on both so we're looking at 0.50 in about 30 minutes and also wireless charging although the 6 pro is a little bit faster 23 watts versus 21 when you're using the google pixel wireless stand and we do also get support for reverse while it's charging so you can top up your pixel buds or something similar let's talk about these cameras because for most people you buy a pixel phone because you get that stock android experience and also the sort of latest updates and also some of the best cameras on any smartphone so the good news if you fancy yourself the smaller and cheaper pixel 6 is that it shares the exact same main and ultra wide camera as the 6 pro and finally exclusive to the 6 pro we have a telephoto zoom lens with a four times optical zoom and you can then punch in up to a 20 times super res zoom as google call it which is a kind of hybrid although that tops out at seven times on the standard six because we haven't got that telephoto lens so except for that telephoto lens the cameras are pretty much the same between the two phones although the same can't be said for the selfie camera because we actually get an eight megapixel f2 uh aperture camera on the six i'm trying to get that straight in my head versus a 11.1 megapixel camera with an f 2.2 aperture so a slightly narrow aperture although a high resolution on the 6 pro both phones can also shoot up to 4k 60 with the rear camera although on the front again the selfie on the 6 pro is a step up because we can shoot 4k 30 and 10 tp 60 whereas the standard 6 tops out at 10 tp 30. but most importantly how much well the pixel 6 starts from just 599 pounds that's the same in dollars and the six pro will set you back 849 pounds or 899 which means these new pixels are significantly cheaper than most rival flagships and actually puts them right up against the likes of the oneplus 9 series rather than the iphone 13s or galaxy s 21s these will be quite competitively priced actually which is uh definitely a good thing given that we are perhaps missing on a couple of features as i say like higher end storage options no face unlocking and really we're going to have to see how the battery the performance and the camera basically everything you want to know how they fare when we can properly test it i can show you what do you reckon what are your first impressions of the 6 and the 6 pro and which one if you are tempted would you go for let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
