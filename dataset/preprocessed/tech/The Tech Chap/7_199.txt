[Music] hey guys i'm on the tech chat and this is the new lg ultra gear 27 gn 950. it's a 27 inch 4k 144 hertz gaming monitor i can't actually see what i'm doing from here but i'm kind of in two minds about whether you should actually buy this so it's 4k 144 we get a one millisecond response time then there's g-sync and freesync display hdr 600 and even a bunch of rgb around the back to make this feel a bit more gamery basically this could be all the monitor you ever need for gaming and actually the nano ips panel has 10-bit color and excellent image quality so it's kind of all you need for most professional workloads as well but then again when they're asking 750 pounds or 800 dollars for a 27-inch monitor you would expect it to be something pretty special but the big question really is can you even take advantage of this i mean even my new pc gaming system with an rtx 3080 is brought to its knees in some games on ultra settings at 4k and if you are just gaming wouldn't a quad hd 144 hertz or maybe a 240 or 360hz 1080p monitor be a better option but we'll come to that first off let's have a look at the design and it's pretty compact for a 27 inch thanks to these thin bezels there's also a good range of height adjustment tilt and a portrait mode if you prefer but no side to side pivoting annoyingly the boomerang shaped stand keeps everything feeling solid and it has little pads to keep what's technically known as the pointy bits here from scratching up your nice new desk around the back we get a single displayport 1.4 with dsc support which is pretty important i'll come back to that along with two hdmi 2.0s two usb 3 downstreams and one usb 3 upstream there aren't any built-in speakers but you do get a headphone jack the circular rear rgb lights give out a nice glow and while it works better on lighter surfaces you'll still need to turn the lights down to get the most out of it and it's controlled by a scroll wheel underneath alongside the regular control joystick or via the command center app so being a 10-bit panel this has far more color range than other 8-bit gaming monitors so this means you're getting richer colors and more subtle gradients between them it's really accurate as well in my tests it covered 100 of the srgb although lg reckon it goes as high as 135 percent 90 adobe rgb and most impressively 96 of the dci p3 color gamut which is brilliant for a gaming monitor and as its ips it's got great viewing angles although sometimes i can just about notice the ips glow around the edges particularly in darker scenes it gets pretty bright as well at just over 600 nits which means it meets the display hdr 600 standard for high dynamic range this is better than a lot of gaming monitors but again we're paying a pretty hefty premium here so being this colorful and bright games really do pop and if your gpu is up to it 4k 144hz gaming is just stunning mind you you will need a beefy graphics card i needed something like an rtx 2070 or higher to get 144 hertz in siege although turning down settings and turning on dlss in supported games will help you get there as well but at 4k if you want to get a high frame rate you can pretty much forget about ray tracing so this is crisis remastered which is a bit of an unoptimized mess right now but on my system which i'm running this on with an rtx 3080 i'm pretty lucky that i have one of those at the moment uh we're getting what's that 50 55 fps at 4k although this is just with high settings so if we jump into the options can it run crisis mode 30 37 frames per second and this is with a 30 80 in a uh i9 10900k so crisis remastered is a bit of an exception although even in flight sim 2020 maxed out 4k i'm still only looking at about 42 fps on this although i think they are kind of outliers any other game you know uh fortnite siege call of duty you're probably into the hundreds of fps with a 3080 so you may be thinking well this you know takes all the boxes what a crazy incredible monitor with those specs but if you can't max it out you're not really taking advantage of it and you'd probably be better off with a 1440p monitor with an equal or greater refresh rate that you can really take advantage of because it's at lower resolution and then you'll be better in games having said that if you are playing something a little bit older or you're happy to drop the settings then you can get that hertz because you've got a pretty powerful pc as well then i mean the sharpness the pixel per inch density of this 4k 144 hertz in its own way i know it's not the biggest monitor but it kind of has its own uh different sort of immersion just because of how pin sharp and smooth it is come on at least kill these guys no i'm just gonna i'm just gonna leave it there and of course having a fast one millisecond response time means each pixel can update itself more quickly which cuts down on screen blur known as ghosting which makes all the motion appear sharper the problem is to get that one millisecond response time you have to put it in the fastest game mode which basically is extreme overdrive which then leads to inverse ghosting on moving objects and text which gives you this weird haloing effect which looks awful so i'd recommend just going with the default fast setting which doesn't suffer from this and keeps regular ghosting to a minimum input lag is around 4 milliseconds again a good result so overall games feel very fast and responsive with this and on top of all that it's g-sync compatible and supports freesync premium pro which means it also works alongside the hdr g-sync compatible means it doesn't have the dedicated g-sync module but still works via the adaptive sync format so technically this is a very impressive monitor but let's go back to the question of whether you should actually buy it because well on the one hand you can't really you know mark it down because it's too future-proof because your current system maybe can't you know fully max out 4k 144 but then again if we're going to see you know developments like displayport 2 you know new monitors coming with hdmi 2.1 which will support both new consoles and also the new gpus and also prices will come down because this is still pretty cutting edge tech it kind of begs the question on whether you should actually buy this right now but as well as that i just don't think you can really fully appreciate 4k at 27 inches of course it's incredibly sharp but i just think you need at least 32 maybe even 40 but just something bigger than 27 inches to really appreciate 4k and going back to the ports for just a second with this displayport 1.4 connector obviously you have to have a card or laptop that also supports it because the hdmi 2 slot on this tops out at 4k 60. there's one more thing to consider and that's that this monitor supports dsc or display stream compression which is part of the displayport 1.4a spec it means you can get 4k 144 hertz but the problem is some older graphics cards aren't dsc compliant which means you're limited to 4k 120 at 8 bit color so you'll need either an nvidia 16 series 20 series or the latest 30 series or an amd rx 5500 or better graphics card or a similarly spec laptop to get full dsc compatibility so it's worth checking that your graphics card actually supports this properly so overall the gm 950 is packed with great tech and if you can fully take advantage of that 4k 144 then you're going to have a great time with this and if you do have you know a limited desk space then maybe the more compact 27 inch size will actually be perfect for you i also really appreciate that this is a borderline professional quality monitor as well so you could use it for video editing in a day and then maybe gaming in the evening but if you're after just a gaming monitor i think there are better options out there or at least more practical options that also don't cost as much i still think a 1440p 144 hertz display like lg's own 27 gl850 would be a better bet and it'll save you over 200 pounds or 200 or if smooth gameplay is more of a priority than image quality then want to go with a 1080p 240hz or even a 360hz 1080p like this asus rogue swift but if you do have 750 pounds burning a hole in your pocket and you really do want a 4k 27 inch monitor for some reason with that high refresh rate and you've got a powerful laptop or pc to back it up then yeah i do recommend this i just don't think it's gonna be for that many people it's a bit too niche but what do you reckon would you consider buying this and do you think 4k 27 inches is fine or do you agree with me that maybe a bigger size is actually better to get the most out of it let me know in the comments below and
