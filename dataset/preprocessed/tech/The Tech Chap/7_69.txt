hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this is well as it says on the tin the new asus vivobook pro 14x oled bit of a mouthful but there's an awful lot going on here from packing some pretty beefy hardware we've also got this very nifty asus dial built into the touchpad along with this unique sort of creator meets gamer vibe to the design solid battery life a webcam privacy filter a pretty decent range of ports and a whole bunch of other stuff but the best bit is this screen 16 by 10 90 hertz oled it doesn't get much better than this and actually samsung reached out and offered to sponsor this video of the asus vivo book because samsung displays make this screen which we get on all vivo books of which there's about a billion different skus but as always all opinions are my own and having been using this for the past few weeks i have to say i am very impressed so asus make a ton of laptops we've got the slightly higher end zen book range and then we've got these sort of uh pro art studio books right at the top for creators and then we've got the rog and the zephyrus sort of on the gaming side vivobooks are generally a little bit more affordable uh but with the vivobook pro and then the x variants of the 14 and the 16 inch models which i've got here this is the 14x which hopefully is not actually coming to the uk different skus for different markets although a 16 inch version of this will be coming here and to make things even more complicated there are intel and amd versions of each one so either a ryzen 5000 series or an intel 11th gen h series but crucially all new viva books do come with these oled screens so the most affordable vivo book the pro 14 starts at about 700 pounds my higher end spec 14x is about 1300 while the top end pro 16x starts at about 1400 but let's talk about the screen not just because samsung are sponsoring it but because it is a real show stopper and going back to a regular led lcd laptop just feels a bit washed out and lifeless after you've been spoiled by an oled so there's actually a couple of screen options either this 2.8k resolution 90 hertz or a full fat 4k oled but with a slower 60hz refresh rate so it depends what you're going to be using this for but for me i reckon the 2.8k is a good balance on a 14 inch screen and even though it's not full 120 the bump up to 90 does make everything noticeably smoother and i'm also really happy they went with a 16 by 10 aspect ratio which is a little bit taller than regular laptop screens and just makes everything feel less constrained and letterboxy although you do get slightly thicker black bars when you're watching videos or movies now i measured around 530 nits of brightness in hdr mode which is actually pretty decent and also of course because it's oled the pixels can turn themselves fully off which means blacks are actually black so contrast and dynamic range in movies and games is incredible non-hdr content was closer to 400 nits of brightness which is still enough to see in all but the strongest sunlight so this is very much aimed at the sort of casual to prosumer creator and if you are a photo or video editor or graphic designer or something you will of course appreciate a color accurate screen that's pretty important but the good news is this is extremely color accurate we're talking 100 srgb 100 adobe rgb and also 99 uh dci p3 in my tests although uh samson claim 100 p3 but there will always be some minor differences between panels and it's already pantone verified meaning it's already well calibrated but that's not all because another less obvious benefit of these samsung oled panels is that they emit way less harmful blue light than regular screens which can affect your health and particularly your sleep rhythms so by putting this nifty filter in front of my camera lens next to a regular laptop screen you can really see just how much less blue light it's emitting okay let's talk about this design and i do want to give credit to asus for using recycled materials on the lid and i quite like this embossed logo area as well although i could maybe live without these corny hashtags but i would definitely be interested in seeing a fully recycled laptop chassis at some point inside we have this two-tone white grey layout and the light-up dashed pattern on the enter key now apart from the lid the rest of the body is aluminium and it feels solid with only a little bit of flex around the keys tipping the scales at 1.45 kilograms it's not the lightest 14 inch laptop on the market but given its specs and the performance it is pretty portable also the regular non-x vivobook pros get a slightly more basic but still a fairly classy looking interior the keyboard is lovely to type on and there's plenty of travel and feedback we also get a fingerprint reader built into the power button and also this glass trackpad is much bigger than previous vivobooks and it's nice and responsive now our suits are pretty famous for adding extra features to the touchpad we've had numpads we've had the full screen pad but now with a little swipe in from the corner we have the asus dial and it's basically a virtual version of this physical asus dial that we get on these pro art studio books from asus which also use samsung oled displays as well if you want to spend a bit more money on the sort of ultimate creator laptop then definitely give the new pro a look and that physical dial it's pretty nifty i'll leave a little link to my review of this at the top right functionally this is the same but it's not a physical dial so as i say you just swipe in from the top right give it a little tap and up comes an on-screen wheel with customizable controls with windows volume and brightness by default but it really comes into its own when you use it with a supported app which right now is limited to adobe lightroom classic photoshop premiere pro and after effects that's it but if you open up the pro art control hub which is pre-installed you can choose which controls you want to assign it to from scrubbing through a timeline tweaking exposure you can really set that up to how you like it the problem is though unlike the physical asu style on the pro art this isn't nearly as easy to use you have to activate it first when you want to use it and also i found i had to keep an eye on my finger or else i'd be going too far inside or outside the circle the benefit of the physical dial on the studio boxes you can feel your way around so it's a pretty cool extra and you don't have to use it of course but it's not something i found myself wanting to use long term on this that's pretty cool so we actually have a physical privacy little filter slider that you can bring in front of the webcam it doesn't stop it from recording as you can see but it does physically block it which is uh quite nice if you're concerned about privacy now in terms of ports it's a bit of a mixed bag we do get a full size hdmi 2 a micro sd card slot although a full size would have been more useful along with a headphone jack and a usb 3.1 type a and usb c port on the other side we get two usb 2 ports good old 21 year old usb 2 which is fine for a mouse and maybe older peripherals but usb 3 should really be the standard now across the board we do get wi-fi 6 though so it's not ridiculously expensive we've got quite a nice design the screen is top notch what about performance how fast is this well i can only speak for the spec i have here with the ryzen 7 5800h 3050ti graphics card 16 gigs ram and one terabyte ssd so it's a solid spec although the 3050 ti is a lower end 35 watt max q part although it can boost up to 50 watts dynamically but really this is meant for photo and video editing and maybe moderate 3d graphics work although since i shoot in 4k 10bit 422 i did use proxies for my premiere pro project but then again i had to do that as well for my 3090 desktop pc as well but the good thing about these so called creator laptops is that with these dedicated gpus they can moonlight as pretty decent gaming machines particularly with this new 90hz refresh in rainbow six siege with dlss enabled and the resolution set to 1200p i averaged 150 fps with ultra settings at native 2.8k it was closer to 100 and in fortnite i was averaging about 70 frames per second but even so we were still taking advantage of that higher refresh the stereo speakers are down and slightly outward firing which means your desk or your lap models the sound a little bit speech and music is clear and it does get fairly loud but like most laptops it's lacking a bit of bass and finally battery life and we get a 63 watt hour cell inside here and i've been getting about seven hours of normal non-gaming use out of this not as significantly as resolution or brightness but particularly with dark mode enabled or when you've got darker backgrounds on screen as oled pixels are self-emissive so they can individually turn themselves off when not needed you might see a few percent longer battery although while i haven't tested the larger 16x from reviews i've seen it does look like battery is a lot better in fact in the digital trends review they claim it lasted longer than the lg gram 16 even though the vivobook has much faster hardware so the big question should you buy one of these new viva books well yeah i think so i think it's a pretty easy recommendation i'm tempted to say that the standard non-pro vivobooks like the vivobook 14 which starts at 700 pounds might be a better value option as you still get a 3050 the latest cpus and also an oled screen but if you want that little bit extra performance then the 14x here is definitely worth considering it's just a bit of a shame this particular model isn't coming to the uk but what really sets this apart is that samsung oled screen which is just unbelievably good a touchscreen would have been nice and maybe glass bezels that are flush with the screen rather than these slightly protruding plastic ones also these usb 2s should really be usb 3s and a full size sd card reader would have been a lot more useful but aside from that there really isn't much to complain about so if you do fancy checking this out for yourself i'll leave links in the description below but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy this and what do you make of that oled screen let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you did enjoy the video a cheeky little like and subscribe would be very much appreciated again a big thank you to samsung display for sponsoring this video and i'll see you guys next time right here on the tech chat
