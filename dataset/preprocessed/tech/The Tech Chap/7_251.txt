hey guys Anton the tech chat but if you're thinking about buying a new iPhone but you're not sure which one to go for well hopefully this video will help because I've got the full lineup of new iPhones that you can buy from the brand new S II all the way up to the 11pro max what's really interesting is actually last year the best-selling iPhone was this guy the 10 are followed by the 11 so it seems that most people don't really want to spend a grand or more on the pro series and why I think the new se is gonna sell like hotcakes but what about right now which one should you buy well before we get to the proper battery and camera tests let's do a quick overview first and starting with the cheapest and also the smallest we have the new second-generation iPhone S II and this guy will set you back four hundred dollars or four hundred and twenty pounds it's essentially the body of my phone eight with a 4.7 inch LCD screen but packed with Apple's latest a 13 chip I think it's incredible value for money and if you do prefer a smaller phone then this is ideal as long as you can get over those chunky bezels and also don't mind missing out on face unlocking or having an altar wide or telephoto camera then we have the 10r which is a little bit older but it's still shown as one of the five iPhones to buy on apple's website most notably it uses the last gen 812 processor and selfie a 13 that we get on the rest here's how they compare in terms of performance for both the processor and the graphics does it make much difference in real life well not really but the newer chip will be more future proof so you may not have to upgrade us soon but versus the SE we do get a more modern design on the 10r with a 6.1 inch LCD screen thinner bezels and a notch with face ID in place of the touch ID home button and i think it's six hundred dollars or six hundred and thirty pounds it is still a relatively affordable iphone then we have this guy the iphone 11 which i think is kind of like the best all-rounder it's a hundred more than the 10r so we're looking at $700 or seven hundred and thirty pounds and it shares a similar design and similar 6.1 inch LCD screen as the 10r but we get a bunch of upgrades including a second ultra wide lens a higher-quality selfie camera that supports 4k video it's also the cheapest iphone that offers a night mode for the camera which we'll come back to in a second we also get apple's latest a 13 chip so it's a little more future-proof and a few nice to house versus the 10r like Wi-Fi 6 a slightly higher water resistance rating plus you have the option for a 256 gig storage model if you want more space then we're into the pro series and this is where things start to get kind of pricing the 11pro starts at $1,000 or $1,500 it's actually slightly smaller than the 11 and the 10 are though with a 5.8 inch screen but thanks to even thinner bezels it's only slightly bigger than the SE so if you do want to phone that you can comfortably use one-handed but want the premium features this is your best bet we get a slightly more premium design with this matte glass finish on the back ever so slightly thinner bezels but more importantly it comes with an OLED screen with a high resolution and it supports HDR so it's sharper a little bit brighter offers much better contrast and the colors are more vibrant overall it is just a better screen but I wouldn't say it's a night and day difference and something that unless it's side-by-side something most people will be that bothered about the 11pro also gets a higher quality camera sensor and the addition of a telephoto lens along with the ultra wide and finally we have this guy the 11pro max which is the biggest and also the most expensive iPhone you can currently buy at eleven hundred dollars or eleven hundred and fifty pounds it's a hundred more than the 11pro it's essentially the same phone though but with a much bigger 6.5 inch screen and crucially a significantly longer battery life which we'll come to in a second beautiful nailed it so that's the lineup but anyone can just compare specs and in fact on Apple's website there's a really good comparison tool if you want to get into the nitty gritty details but I want to go a step further and test all these properly firstly the cameras and from left to right we have the SE the 10 are the 11 and the 11 Pro which of course shares the same camera setup as the pro Mac so I've left that one out it's pretty impressive given one is $400 and the other is 1100 before we dive into image quality one of the big differences are the lenses that you get this is shot with the main lens on all four but then on the 11 series we also get ultra wide and finally on the pro and pro max we also get a 2 x 2 telephoto lens I argue the telephoto is probably the least useful of the three but the pro series are the most versatile when it comes to the camera there's not much in it but if you look closely at the road my on top of the camera you can see that the SE is a little less detailed a little sharp versus the other three and I think with the fake plant which is a YouTube essential you know everyone has to have one of these in their setups b11 and the 11pro do look a little bit sharper a little bit more vibrant than the SC in the 10r but in good light there's really not much to tell them apart although I won't say the 10r has a softer look and also it ever so slightly cooler color temperature I really thought we'd see a bigger difference in this photo we've got quite dark foreground and very brightly lit background it really is minor but if you look at the brick wall on the left and a little bit of red graffiti it does look a little bit clearer and more vibrant on the 11pro the FC and the 10 are a little bit soft the 11 is an improvement but I think the 11pro just about takes the win here obviously this is a candid photo and not at all posed for once again the 11 and 11 proton just a little bit sharper but really there's not much in it and Kreator Apple across the board the dynamic range is spot-on now this is the portrait version of the same shot and if you do just look at the 11pro on the right versus a BST on the left you can see the SE is just a little bit softer again though while the tenner doesn't look good that color is just a little bit off but it's when we get into low-light that the 11 and the 11 Pro and of course also the pro max do take the lead and that's because they're the three phones that offer a night mode so with that two or three second longer exposure the eleventh series captures much more light it's far more detailed and the colors are great the SC and the 10 are by comparison look kind of dull how do we get by without a nightmare on phones for so long it really is a literal night and day difference between the eleventh series and the SE and a 10 R so for this low-light selfie well they all look pretty badly but again I think the 11th and the 11pro do come out on top the 10 always the darkest and also the softest it's definitely key in detail but while the se is a little bit brighter it's just a noisy mess all over and actually between the 11th and the 11pro I would say the pro has slightly more natural colors and also the noise isn't quite as bad oh jeez this is a close up one I'd say the 10r is noticeably softer and that is a theme we've seen throughout but what about a selfie in good light very good light in fact I've got the Sun beating down on me here and you can see that again the 10r is a little soft but I don't know if I love that sharp and look that we get on the 11 and the 11pro however an advantage of the 11 series is we can zoom out so we get a wider field of view in selfies so there's more room for a selfie with your mates and one last photo a quick selfie in portrait mode they all do a pretty good job although I think the SE does fall behind a little bit it's got the least detail it looks quite soft but what about the selfie video well this is being shot with the iPhone se there we have the iPhone 10 R then we have the iPhone 11 which is the first one to bump the resolution up to 4k those guys are both 1080p and then finally the iPhone 11 Pro and also the pro max because they share the same selfie camera as well also a 4k like the iPhone 11 but what do you think can you tell much difference between the selfie video okay next up what about battery life well this bit took forever to test so if I can get a thumbs up for that I'd really appreciate it but with all the phone's set to the same brightness and the same settings let's see how they stack up in my intensive real-world battery test which includes rowing through YouTube videos games social media apps shooting some 4k video and then rinse them repeating until they're well all dead so at the 1 hour mark the SE is in last place with 90 percent remaining and the 11pro max is still on 98% now thanks to the miracle of editing jumping ahead to the 4 hour mark and this is following an hour each of YouTube gaming tik-tok instagram the SE is already way down to 24% significantly behind the others and then just over an hour and a half later at the 5 hour 40 mark we lose the SE with a 10 hour on 26b 11 on 30 11pro on 37 and the 11pro max still on a whopping 49 percent almost bang on the 7 hour mark though we then lose the 10 R and I don't think the 11 is far behind just 16 minutes later the 11 boughs out leaving us with only the 11 pros remaining it's a good half hour before the 11pro finally gives up at 7 hours 45 leaving the 11pro max and surprising absolutely no on the winner with 21% still remaining it just keeps going and almost hits the 9 hour mark that's 57 percent longer than the S II although it is nearly 300% more expensive so battery life is fairly straightforward among the by phones the more you pay the longer it lasts but what's the best value well a big thank you to my friend Andrew Selleck for putting these calculations together for me because I'm pretty terrible numbers and in terms of dollars per minute the SE wins at $1 18 per minute of battery life versus the 11pro which cost 2.15 per minute and it's the lease value for money so the takeaway is best battery life 11 pro max but the SE wins in terms of bang for buck and actually beyond the SC it's the 10 other offers the best value for battery life and as I say the 11pro that's the worst I thought that was pretty interesting so hopefully by this point you've got a good idea which iPhone may be best for you or if in fact it may be best to hold off because consider that the iPhone 12 series is likely to come out at the end of September maybe early October or maybe even a few weeks later because of the whole coronavirus crazy wall that we live in that could delay things a little bit but the next phones are likely to add a higher refresh rate screen so everything feels smoother even thinner bezels and a small knotch Apple's a 14 chip which will no doubt be ludicrously fast but I think most importantly 5g which would make them more future-proof but as you guys know in tech there's always something else around the corner you can wait forever so right now if you want the best value iPhone hands-down it's the iPhone se I know there's an argument about whether perhaps Apple have been a bit lazy I mean we hash in a iPhone 8 design which yes on the one hand means it's cheaper because they can retool the same parts from their factory from the iPhone 8 but then again would you expect a 20/20 Android phone to come with bezels that big but then again most people who are gonna buy this probably don't care about the bezels they want a good phone with a solid camera that's gonna last them a few years and also doesn't cost a fortune so I think the SE is a really good option I think for me they're taking everything into account from the battery the camera the design just using it and also of course the price I think the iPhone 11 is the one I would recommend it's the best all-rounder you get the modern design you get the two camera setup I think the ultra-wide is quite important to have and also it came about midway in the battery life test so for $700 or 730 pounds I would recommend the 11 and I do think that while the 10 are offers good value I would pay that extra hundred and go for the 11 if you could you get the newer chip the ultra wide lens are fewer than nice to haves and I think it's gonna be a little bit more future-proof I mean that you won't have to upgrade as soon but if you want the ultimate iPhone experience and the longest battery life by quite some margin actually then I would recommend the 11th pro max although your wallet will be crying afterwards in my opinion the two phones that kind of fall behind a little bit are the 10 R and the 11 Pro which is kind of surprising actually although I do love the size of this and it really is a good one-handed phone and also 100 less than the pro max I think the battery life that you get with the pro max also if you want that bigger screen with this or mersive experience you get from it it's worth paying a hundred more and also I don't think this is worth three hundred more than the standard 11 so again better value there the 11 is the one I'd recommend the SE is the best value option and of course as you'd expect the 11 Pro max if the all-singing all-dancing no-expense-spared option alright so that's enough of being waffling on hopefully you guys enjoyed this video and you found it useful if you did a lot of thumbs up or maybe a chi keeper subscribed will be amazing and I'll see you guys next time right here on the tech jab thanks for watching well just a quick note if you actually saw my video on the SE a few days ago and you notice that at the beginning I do a fancy shot of dropping in some water and reversing it I wouldn't recommend that because while all iPhones do have some level of water resistance whether it's IP 67 or 68 Apple don't really recommend that you go swimming with it or dropping it in buckets of water so don't try that at home because you may damage the phone you may not like I didn't but probably best to avoid it so you don't destroy your shiny my phone
