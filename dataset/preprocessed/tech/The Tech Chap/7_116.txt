hey guys i'm from the tech chap and after months of lockdown i've finally been led out of the house and i'm in london with samsung having a play with their brand new galaxy books now according to samsung's marketing these are not laptops oh no these are galaxy books there's a big difference apparently it kind of reminds me of apple's silly what's the computer commercials for the ipad of course these are laptops but the idea is they're designed to be portable and always connected with the latest wi-fi 6e and also lte support plus they work seamlessly with other samsung devices so here they are the three new laptops on the left we have the standard galaxy book in the middle we have the pro and then on the right we have the pro 360. which as you can probably guess is a two in one and actually it is the only laptop with a touchscreen and support for the s pen but of the three it's the pro that i've really got my eye on this is the 15 inch version but there's also going to be a 13 and it's kind of like the macbook air slash pro meets the lg gram the first thing you'll notice is just how thin and light this is and it's all thanks to the aluminium magnesium body and even on the bigger 15 inch model i have here we're talking about just 11.7 millimeters thick and it weighs just 1.05 kilograms or 2.3 pounds even next to the standard galaxy book the pro is a good deal sleeker and the first time you pick it up it genuinely feels like they've forgotten to put the battery in or something yet somehow they've still managed to squeeze in full size usb 3.2s and an hdmi along with thunderbolt 4 and microsd ports so it's just another thin and light laptop with a fancy design right well yes but the standout really is the amoled screen and side by side with the standard galaxy book with its regular led lcd screen you can really see the difference not only are we getting these flush glass bezels rather than the slightly protruding plastic ones but the million to one contrast and the much wider viewing angles makes the screen really pop we also get display hdr 500 so you'll get at least 500 nits of brands from this and it covers 120 of the p3 color gamut and actually what you can do is switch between srgb adobe rgb and p3 modes which is useful if you're doing color sensitive work now on the inside we have the latest intel 11th gen processors either the i5 or i7 which of course comes with their ios xe integrated graphics so it's a pretty standard affair for a 2021 thin and light laptop there's no special xe max or say nvidia mx450 chip here for any extra graphical grunt but these are really all about being as mobile as possible and to that end as i say we also get wi-fi 6e and lte although sadly it's not 5g unlike their own galaxy flex 2. now sadly i wasn't able to run any proper tests or benchmarks as this was just a sort of pre-launch hands-on event although make sure you stay tuned for my full review for all that good stuff but as the pro meets intel's evo spec we can expect at least nine hours of battery and solid performance these will also come with a pocket sized 65 watt charger that tops up over usb-c so you can also charge your other tech with it although i've been told a full charge of the galaxy book pro takes two hours so it's not especially quick we're also now getting a much bigger precision touch pad and also what samsung are calling a comfort first keyboard which sounds lovely uh and basically the key spacing is a little bit wider uh we get a scissor mechanism which makes it feel quite nice and responsive and they've also built a fingerprint reader into the power button plus as you can see the bigger 15-inch galaxy book pro gets this full numpad which the 13 doesn't now as you would expect samsung are keen to push just how seamlessly these galaxy books work with the rest of the galaxy family so you can actually use the tab s7 or the s7 plus as a second screen whether it's extended or duplicated pairing their galaxy buds this is easy as just opening the lid and while it's not yet activated when these launch we'll also have quick share so you can send files and photos to and from your samsung phone instantly so far so good then but of course it's all gonna come down to the pricing and actually it's pretty reasonable the standard galaxy book with its heftier and slightly less premium design along with that regular lcd screen starts from a not too wide watching 699 pounds the galaxy book pro does jump up quite a bit though starting at 1099 pounds for the 13 inch and 11.99 for the 15 with the pro 360 costing an extra 100 quid starting at 11.99 here in the uk so that puts the galaxy book pro right in between the macbook air and the pro so is this actually a good alternative or if we're going with the more annoying youtube clickbaity title are these galaxy books a proper macbook killer well i don't yet have one with me in the studio to do a side by side but going off the specs and the price while these don't have apple's very impressive m1 chip which is genuinely revolutionary stuff the galaxy book pro is thinner and lighter plus we're getting an amoled screen lte thunderbolt 4 wi-fi 6e so until we see a refreshed macbook pro 14 perhaps with maybe a mini led screen in many ways the galaxy book pro is a better laptop so all three new galaxy books launch on may the 14th and first impressions are really positive the pro is definitely the stand out for me though but i will hold off on my final verdict for when i get them in for review and test them out properly but which one of the three would you go for and also if you have any questions at all let me know in the comments below i always read every single one and i'll do my best to answer don't forget to hit that
