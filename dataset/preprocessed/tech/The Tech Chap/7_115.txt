hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is the new asus rog pg32uqx and it's insane 4k 144hz g-sync ultimate and most exciting of all this is using a brand new mini led panel which boasts up to 1400 nits of brightness and also 400 000 to 1 contrast in hdr now it turns out playing crisis sideways with an upside down keyboard while filming is uh not exactly ideal but my first question with this is how much is it going to be those specs are insane well it's certainly not cheap we're looking at about 3 000 or around 2 300 pounds so an awful lot of money although of course this is cutting edge stuff so the question is does mini led really make that much of a difference can you max out 4k at 144 hertz and is this the ultimate gaming monitor or just a bit overkill well you know a product must be something special when the author of asus's own reviewer's guide actually gives us his personal take on how awesome it is kind of like saying this time i really mean it so let's dive in and if you do enjoy the video a cheeky little subscribe and a ding of that bell icon would be lovely now the big deal for me is that this is the first mini led gaming monitor that i've got my hands on which promises far better contrast than hdr performance than one of your regular old boring led lcds oh and it gets better because it's actually an oled screen as well well not this one this one there's a little two inch oled screen built in to the lower bezel because why not but let's be real any serious gamer isn't going to want to buy a 4k gaming monster it just doesn't make sense the sweet spot really is 1080p at 240hz or maybe quad hd at 144 or 240 but if you're playing twitch shooters and you want the best fps possible while still 4k is just going to destroy your frame rate even if you have the most powerful gaming system out there so this isn't really aimed at pro gamers but surprisingly while official hdmi 2.1 support isn't listed when i hooked up my series x i was somehow able to access the full 4k 120 option which makes this a much more tempting choice for console gamers however without the official 2.1 spec it does leave me a little bit worried and that your experience may vary so if you're after the best image quality for gaming with high refresh this is definitely worth considering particularly with its mini led panel and also 32 inches is a great size for 4k anything smaller i just don't think really does justice to all those 8 million pixels and also 144 hertz is a sensible refresh rate for 4k it's a massive step up from 4k 60 and you can just about max it out in some aaa games plus it supports the display hdr 1400 standard which means it guarantees at least 1400 nits of brightness in hdr mode so if i jump into one of the hdr videos that youtubers always play for these kind of things to show it off you can see here in the osd we've got peak white knits 1400 it looks absolutely stunning and this is the brightest gaming monitor i've ever used there are other professional mini led displays out there apple's pro xdr display there's also asus pro art monitors but so far they've been extremely expensive and not really gaming oriented so they haven't had high refresh rates or g-sync and the 4k resolution paired with this crazy brightness and i think just as importantly the whopping 400 000 to 1 contrast ratio which is well on the way to oled levels all together this is one of the most stunning looking gaming monitors i've ever used now just a quick word on design it's sturdy and well made and i do like the overall look mostly although this lower bezel looks a little too chunky because of that oled screen and i could also do with a little less of the omnipresent rog branding in fact all the rgb on this is just the logo i kind of prefer lg's ultra gear styling with this ring of rgb instead plus if i'm honest this flashing rog logo on the tiny oled screen just feels like a distracting reflection so mostly i've turned it off although you can customize it with other gifs or system stats but i'm not really convinced it's needed also the on-screen controls are a little bit fiddly i would have much prefer just a simple joystick and then there's the stand which functionally works really well it is nice and secure also there's not much screen wobble it's well built and uh pretty heavy as well but this is a problem i've had with these rog monitors for years now but why asus insist on this triple leg layout with this back one sticking out so far i just don't understand because it means when you have it on your desk whereas a normal 32 inch monitor would be pretty reasonable on my setup but actually with this and the stand it just sits so far forward honestly this 32 inches as much as i like it feels too big and close to me you can of course visa mount it which i might recommend you do or try and push it back as far as you can on your desk because well in my setup at least it just feels too close i'm really not a fan of this stand you could even say i can't stand it okay enough nitpicking let's move on to what i'm most excited about this mini led screen why is it a big deal well the much higher brightness and contrast is thanks to thousands more leds along with lots more local dimming zones and dimming zones are individually dimmable groups of leds and so the more groups you have the smaller the area of the screen that you can dim at one time and this helps reduce the light bleed you get into darker parts of a scene it's still not as perfect as the individually lit pixels on an oled but it's close the thing is unlike tvs only top end monitors usually get full array local dimming most rely on edge dimming and it shows just how much less light bleed we're getting with this mini led colors look fantastic as well thanks to the pre-calibrated 10-bit panel accuracy is impressive almost pro level and actually this could moonlight as a great work monitor it's bright clear and being high refresh we get the benefit of an extra smooth desktop experience the contrast is also exceptional for an ips even better than va panels i've tested which is a big deal blacks actually look black not grey like on my edgelit ips lg gaming monitor here the downside is there is still a fair amount of haloing around bright objects but you can tweak the backlights and the black levels to reduce this a little bit i really wish you guys were here in person to see this because it looks incredible this is cyberpunk running at 4k in hdr although of course since this video is being broadcast at 4k but in sdr you're not really getting that full experience it's just so much more vibrant than when you're playing an sdr and everything from the deep inky blacks thanks to the contrast as well to the sort of bright searing highlights honestly going back to an sdr game just feels a bit dull but the problem is of course that pc hdr gaming just isn't really where it should be at least compared to console gaming with hdr tvs although it's kind of like a chicken or the egg situation because until you have good hdr displays like this game developers might not really put that much effort into actually optimizing their games for it so hopefully we do see more hdr games going forward cyberpunk is a really great example of it it just looks so good now asus claims a four millisecond response time with this a lot of ips alternatives claim a one millisecond response although in pretty much every case you'll only get this figure by using the extreme overdrive setting which with some monitors can introduce a ton of inverse ghosting but the good news with this is that even setting it to extreme overdrive artifacting and inverse ghosting was not bad at all although personally i'd be happy backing it off to the normal setting besides the difference between a one and a four millisecond response time is not something you and i are probably gonna be able to notice maybe esport pro gamers but then this isn't something they'd be looking to buy anyway but then the question is just how much power do you need to actually max out this 144 house refresh at 4k well i can tell you you're not going to get it in cyberpunk this is uh with maxed out settings rt ultra with a balanced dlss mode and we're getting sort of high 30s 40 fps with an rtx 3080 so really does all come down to the game you're playing if you're playing some league of legends or age of empires 2 then you're going to max it out all day long but if you're playing crisis remastered or cyberpunk then you might be best off with a quad hd but to give you an example in rainbow six siege i got over 240 fps at 4k with ultra settings so honestly at 30 60 or even the last gen 2070 would probably be fine for this but then in watchdogs legion which i'm not sure if anyone's actually still playing this but i could only manage about 100 fps on the lowest settings at 4k with rt off and dlc set to ultra i did just about hit 144 in wolfenstein youngblood though with max settings including rt and dlss so in these more demanding games i would either have to drop back to quad hd or just use the render scaling slider if there is one to reduce the internal resolution to get anywhere close to maxing out that 144 on the plus side there's not a hint of screen tearing and that's because this actually has the g-sync ultimate module built in it's a physical module which helps reduce screen tearing and the difference really between regular g-sync and the ultimate is the support for hdr at high refresh rates there's three hdmi 2 ports which as i say did work at up to 4k 120 on the xbox but not being officially 2.1 spec there's no guarantees here so for desktop pc users you'll just want to use the display port 1.4 cable which means you get the full 4k 144 as it uses a dsc or display stream compressions however due to its limitations you can only get the full 10 bit color at up to 120 hertz at 144 this drops back to 8-bit plus frc we do also get built-in speakers which are fine but they are lacking in bass and really i would still recommend a good pair of headphones so here's the deal if you have very deep pockets and a very powerful gaming pc and want the best 4k gaming monitor in the world this is it and actually by far the most impressive aspect of this is the fact that we get this mini led which makes a massive difference to brightness and contrast particularly because a lot of the time you probably won't be playing in hdr or streaming hdr videos on movies but that contrast is there throughout and as i say even though it's not quite up to oled levels you really don't have many options for oled for pc gaming the best you can do is maybe use a tv like lg's uh 48 inch or maybe upcoming 42-inch oleds lg did also introduce a oled monitor at this year's ces but i think it's going to cost like five or six grand and release minute for productivity and work rather than gaming so this is as close as you're gonna get without using a big tv but as i say it's not quite perfect and you are still going to see some haloing particularly if you are using this in hdr mode personally this is something i would actually love to have on my desk even though i'm not a huge fan of the stand but if i was going to go out and buy a new gaming monitor now i still think i'd go with a quad hd 240 hertz type deal but it wouldn't be mini led and it's almost spoiled me now especially when i've put it next to that edgelit lg gaming monitor but i am confident we will see more mini led options coming soon so maybe hold fire and also hopefully that will introduce some competition for pricing because this is not going to be cheap but what do you reckon have i convinced you uh to upgrade to a 4k mini led monitor or just made you uh convinced that it's a bit overkill let me know what you think of this in the comments below i'll also leave a link in the description if you want to check this out and yeah if you
