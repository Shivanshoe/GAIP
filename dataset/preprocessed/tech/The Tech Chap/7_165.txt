now as buggy crashy and as much of a performance hog as it is i would say cyberpunk is one of the best implementations of rt and dlss i've ever seen in a game sometimes it's quite subtle with penumbra or more diffuse less hard shadows and objects lighting that more naturally exposes the world and of course reflections from shiny desks to puddles and car windows although bizarrely your character v must be some kind of vampire maybe that's what the v stands for as you can't even see yourself in a mirror i mean even the original deus ex had that so clearly this is a beast of a game and so i've teamed up with nvidia who offered to sponsor this video as i wanted to test every rtx 3000 series card so the 360 ti 3070 the 80 and the 90 as well as the previous 2080 ti for some context to see just how well they perform in cyberpunk what kind of an impact ray tracing and dlss has and if they're even worth using and finally to help you figure out what graphics card is best for the resolution that you play on nice and simple well it would have been if it wasn't for the billion also crashes to desktop cyberpunk did not make this an easy video to make but don't worry no spoilers here at all i've only spent a few hours in night city so far and while what you're watching is my captured gameplay i'm not gonna give anything away also i'm testing the game with the day one patch and without the drm that was added to pre-release review versions of the game and i've also got an i9 10 900k processor and 32 gigs of ram in my test pc so hopefully you'll find this useful and if you do it would be amazing if you could hit that subscribe button as i'm so close to that one million mark alright so the first thing any self-respecting pc gamer will do is go into the graphic settings there's a quick preset with the usual low medium high and ultra but then it goes to ray tracing medium and ray tracing ultra these are essentially ultra graphic settings but then going beyond with ray tracing medium adding advanced shadows and lighting but your one ray tracing ultra for these fancy reflections ray trace lighting also tops out with psycho mode which gives you even higher quality global illumination and then below all this we have dlss which i'll come to in a second but is absolutely essential for any of this ray tracing to run well but let me show you what ray tracing can do so this is with regular ultra settings no rt then turning it up to rt medium and the lighting becomes more realistic and that harsh shadow on the right disappears but the big jump is when i switch to rt ultra which turns on reflections and you can see just what a difference ray tracing can make does it fundamentally change the game no but as a single player game and all about being as immersive as possible the visual upgrade is pretty impressive but what's the cost well to give you one example running an rtx 3090 at 4k with regular ultra settings so no rt i'm averaging about 104 fps switching to rt medium drops it to 76 and then rt ultra which really is the one you want for that full ray tracing experience we're down to 66. so let's bring in the full deck of cards this is every ampere card plus the 2080 ti for reference to last gen and starting at 4k you can see how rt medium ultra and psycho compare to the standard ultra settings without any rt and it is a big hit i mean this is already a very demanding game but i would suggest avoiding 4k unless you're mr fancy pants with rtx 3080 or 1390 now dropping to 1440p and everything is a bit more reasonable here the rtx 3070 breaks that crucial 60fps mark which is good to see and the 360 ti isn't too far behind and actually if you tweak a few settings you could easily hit 60 with it and finally at 1080p which is still the most popular resolution of course and i think here the 3060 ti makes the most sense unless you're running a high refresh monitor in which case maybe the 3070 is a good bet however without ray tracing you can see all the cards break triple digits no surprises there then rt looks great this is probably the best example of it but it still has a big impact on your frame rate however that's only half the story deep learning super sampling or dlss is i think one of the most underrated graphics technologies right now by rendering the game at a lower resolution and then scaling up the lss 2.1 which we have here gives us much higher frame rates than we'd normally get at native resolution now in cyberpunk we have a few different options by default it's set to auto but let's have a look if we can see any difference between the modes with the native 4k gameplay on the left as a control and then it's basically a sliding scale in terms of visual quality as you go through the dlcs options and then kind of falling off a cliff with ultra performance mode which i would just avoid unless maybe you're me or linus who are also making videos playing this at 8k so it seems dlss off and quality modes are almost indistinguishable with some slight artifacting shimmering and softening cropping up as you head towards balance and performance but at 4k it's still fairly subtle they all look quite good my takeaway though comparing the visual versus performance trade-off is to use dlss quality mode when you're playing at 1080p at 1440p i think quality or balance modes are your best options depending on the frame rate you want to hit and at 4k definitely go with dlc performance if all this seems like a lot though then the good news is that there's also an auto dlss mode i actually ran the numbers against the other modes and it looks like at 1080p it uses quality mode at 1440 we get balanced and at 4k its performance which is actually exactly what would have recommended using anyway so the best graphics combination in my opinion is to play with rt ultra settings and then leave dlss on auto and so with that let's figure out which graphics card is best for you and so kicking off at 1080p and here i think you're absolutely fine with the 3060 ti we're getting over 60 fps with max out settings including quality mode dlss and it costs just 370 pounds plus if you're not bothered about ray tracing you'll get 125 with the ti not too shabby now if you're playing at 1440 which i think is still the sweet spot really despite only scoring 48 fps here i would actually suggest going for the rtx 3070 but then maybe changing the dlss to balanced mode instead of quality the visual difference is tiny but that'll get you to 60 fps and it's only a hundred pounds more than the 360 ti and finally 4k well the truth here is only the 3090 will get you 60 fps however while the 3090 is 20 faster than 3080 it's also about twice the price so if you are gaming at 4k you may need to tweak the settings a little but i think the 3080 is the best buy assuming of course you can actually buy one stock issues are still a big problem i know nvidia is doing their best but it doesn't help if you still can't buy one of these cards hopefully you'll be able to upgrade your pc soon though and then this guide will come in handy so as probably the most hyped game in the last 10 years or so what do you think of cyberpunk so far let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys don't forget to hit that subscribe button if you want to see more of me and now i'm actually gonna go play and have some fun in cyberpunk rather than just running benchmarks and cursing its name every time it crashes check out the description for links to all the cards i've tested and i'll catch you guys in the next one
