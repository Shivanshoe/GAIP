hey guys Anton a tech job and this is the all new Huawei P 40 pro so I'm gonna do a quick unboxing and then walk you through all the new features and give you my first impressions along the way so while we are actually launching three models the p40 the p40 pro and the p40 pro plus i'll put full pricing and availability in a pin comment below but i've got the pro here which like samsung's galaxy s 20 plus will probably end up being the most popular model so this is everything we get in the box including the phone obviously a clear plastic case and Huawei's 40 watt super charger now the first thing to do when setting up the p40 pro is to clone the apps from your old phone this is the best ways to get your apps onto the phone that may not otherwise be available in the Huawei ab gallery since of course this doesn't support the Google Play Store it's really straightforward just download the phone clone app on your phone I'm using a p30 pro here and it'll transfer most but not all of your apps so on the pro we get a six point five eight inch OLED screen and the big upgrade this year is to jump to a 95 refresh rate now of course the galaxy s 20 Oppo find x2 and most likely the oneplus they all have faster 120 Hertz screens they're thinking about it like the pixel for I think 90 Hertz on the P fully Pro is a smarter balance between smoother animations and battery life the first time I unbox this the first time picked it up I thought I'd recognize this design somewhere else and actually if I grab the samsung galaxy s 20 plus you can see there's a remarkable similarity in terms of how the camera modules set up although I have to say I really do like Huawei's matte glass finish wished to be further glossy or matte floating the pulp top right and let me know personally I think this looks much more premium and it also just feels a little bit nicer in the hand but while I've got the s 20 plus here which is actually is a brand new one I haven't set this up yet you can see the difference in that little hole punch cut out Samsung's is much smaller we have this single little hole punch in the center on the p40 pro we've got this dual camera setup which does take a good chunk out of the top left of the phone screen with the selfie camera and also an IR sensor which helps I'm locking in low light so actually that is quite a useful feature but if you're playing games or watching movies I guess your thumb may cover it so it's not the end of the world now if I bring this a little bit closer to you you can see quar ways new overflow edge display and basically we have curved edges on all four sides why waste designers say that they were looking at the surface tension of a full glass of water and how it looks when it's just about to overflow and that's kind of what they were going for you just get this sort of rounding off on all the corners and it definitely does add to it sort of premium aesthetic I really do like it so we've got this matte glass finish on the back I've got it in ice white but it also comes in black and a deep sea blue which I think may actually be the best-looking version and actually it reminds me of the one +7 series which also used a matte glass finish so this is actually a quad camera setup and the module itself does stick out a little bit from the phone but not quite as much as say the galaxy s xx ultra but you still probably want to put a case on this so they don't get scratched up too easily we do also get an inch screen fingerprint reader it's an optical reader which while we see is now 30% bigger in terms of the area that you can use your finger on and also 30% faster than before although most of the time I reckon I'll just be using the face unlocking it's the little things but I'm really happy to see they've gone back to having a physical volume rocker here if I actually bring up the mate 30 Pro this sort of digital haptic virtual volume rocker which is very futuristic and cool but I have to say in practice I found it a little bit frustrating especially when you have the phone to your ear and you can't really see or feel what you're doing I'm actually personally pretty glad that they've gone back to the physical rocker on the p40 Pro the screen actually doesn't curve round nearly as much as before and also they've gone from having that sort of notch at the top to the hole punch so definitely a few different design changes there and actually if I bring in last year's P 30 Pro here's one I made earlier you can't see some quite significant differences in terms of the camera module they've gone from the glossy glass to the matte glass and also like the mate 30 they've gone from having a notch to a hole punched so between the P 40 Pro the P 30 Pro and then the mate 30 Pro certainly they mate 30 with that round camera module is pulling the most striking which design do you think looks best we also get ip68 water resistance but one thing I was a little bit surprised and disappointed by is the fact that we just get this single speaker setup it doesn't even use the earpiece as a speaker so that's probably my one criticism so far all right let's talk specs and inside we get huawei's own care in 995 g chip that's the same one used in the mate fully pro 5g along with eight gigs of ram and 256 gigs of storage so it's not a crazy powerhouse necessarily but the current chip is very capable and with that nutty hub screen everything feels fast and responsive software wise we've got emui 10.1 on top of Android 10 and have to say it is very nice to use emu eyes come a long way in the past couple of years it also supports dual 5g Sims and is the first phone to come with Wi-Fi 6 plus which I must admit I had she hadn't even heard of until this was announced and I actually can't find any reference to it even on a Wi-Fi Alliance website I'll delve deeper for my full review but suffice to say you'll get the fastest and most reliable Wi-Fi with this as for the battery we get a 4200 mAh cell which is the same size as last year's P 30 Pro for comparison the galaxy s 20 plus has a 4500 mAh cell historically Huawei phones have always been quite well optimized so while I'll test it properly my full review I'm not too worried charging comes in the form of their 40 watt super charger which should get it from zero to 70% in just half an hour but it also now supports crazy fast 40 watt wireless charging up from 27 watts before although you will need to use huawei's own charging pad to get the full speed and of course it still supports reverse wireless charging for topping up other devices okay I've made you wait long enough let's get to the best bit the camera and it seems to be quite a big upgrade it's a quad lens setup with a main ultra wide periscope telephoto and time-of-flight sensor I'm actually really excited to see what we can get Alif Huawei's new sensor which offers a good balance between the 50 megapixel resolution and the big one over one point two eight inch sensor size it also uses pixel binning combining four into one so you end up with a 12 point 5 megapixel although in a more tab of the camera app you can select high-res to shoot in the full resolution while we also say they've improved the white balance and the night mode on the p40 pro so to test this out I took a few photos with the mate study pro and side-by-side what do you make of the difference now have you ever tried to take a photo out of a window maybe you want an aeroplane or out of a car or something and of course you can see the reflection we've got pretty much the whole phone and camera module there on the fence reflecting back which doesn't look great now what we can do is take a picture and then jump into the gallery settings and you can see the outline of the phone in the camera module on the fence now if I tap the little edit icon at the top right and then click on remove reflection after a couple of seconds it almost completely vanishes it's actually really cool that I've not seen this on any other phone so far so I'm shooting this with the rear camera at 4k 30 this is with the main lens and I can switch to the wide lens if I walk a little bit you'll get a sense of the stabilization and then back to the main lens and then we can zoom right in all the way up to 15 times I'm not sure how often you want to use this and then back to ultra wide what a beautiful day now this little nifty dual view feature lets you record using both the ultra wide lens and the main lens at a to time zoom at the same time and finally around the front we have a 13 megapixel F 2.2 selfie camera which can now also shoot video in up to 4k 60 yeah it looks good it's a beautiful day it's very sunny doesn't happen a lot in the UK I also just wanted to do a quick side by side of the selfie video versus the s20 ultra as I say I'll be doing full camera comparisons all that good stuff in another video but first of all to show off the image quality difference and also the field of view you can see just looking at the viewfinder at least the s20 Ultra seems to be a bit wider important arm's length which is a little awkward but it's definitely more in the frame and the other thing is that why I am saying that the p40 series now has autofocus on the front camera which I kind of assumed most selfie cameras already had now warning this is about to get very close to my face but let's see how they both handle a changing focus going up to my eye you never thought you wanted to see my face that close up and then all the way back quickly well they both did change focus as you'd expect although the s20 was a little bit slow actually one more time right up to the eyes yeah yes twenties got that a little bit better than the p40 it is pre-release software of course it bear that in mind but let me know which one you thought performed a little bit better so first impressions of the p40 pro well there's a lot to get excited about here it's got a gorgeous screen an incredible quad camera setup solid battery life great performance really fast charging it takes a lot of boxes and I really do appreciate some of the design changes they've made including the use of matte glass finish and bringing back the volume rocker and also well the hole punch is a bit of an eyesore it is nice having that IR sensor but of course the main issue is the lack of Google and the Google Play Store now of course there are app workaround you can download apks you can use the party stores and I really do think that the Huawei tab gallery the rate is growing will be a real challenger to both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store in not too long but as it stands I am still missing out on some of the apps that I want to use so it is a concern but it's something that I hope will keep getting better with time but make sure you do subscribe because I've got camera comparisons battery tests or like go stuff with other flagship phones coming very soon and also I'm gonna do a bit of a tips and tricks video all about how to get the most out of the holy app gallery and what the best ways are to get all the apps you need on this thank you so much for watching guys let me know what you make of the p40 Pro in the comments below and I'll see you next time right here on the tech jab you [Music]
