hey guys anton tech chap and let me give you the 30 second elevator pitch for the new rtx 3080 ti and this is about eight percent or so faster than the standard 3080 so if i pop that there and about three percent slower than the 30 90 in my gaming test so in terms of performance this is much closer to the 90 than the 80 but in terms of pricing it's near enough halfway between them this is uh 400 pounds more than the 3080 and 350 less than the 90s so a touch closer to the 90 although that's rrp and in the real world who knows and time so the 3090 is still a touch faster and also has double the vram so if you're using this for workstation applications then this will definitely be worth paying that extra for for gaming if you can buy one because that's the other big question this really is the new king but it's still an awful lot of money so i think the 3080 will end up still being a better buy but we'll come back to that in a second okay let's talk specs and we're getting over 10 000 cuda cores which is an 18 bump over the vanilla 3080 and only two and a half percent fewer than the 1390 also versus the 3080 the ti gets an extra two gigs of vram taking up to 12 gigs more ray tracing and tensor cores for dlss and other ai features and also a higher 250 watt power limit you can also see the 3080 and the ti are exactly the same size which is to say pretty reasonable uh compared to the beast the behemoth that is the 1390 which is just yes absolutely massive this thing so if you are considering maybe a micro atx build then this uh 1390 is probably a no-go but you should be okay with the new atti and it looks pretty much the same as the standard 3080 as well although we do get this little etched nvidia logo on the shroud which isn't on the older cards now nvidia claims the 3080 ti is one and a half times faster than the last gen 2080 ti in both rasterize and ray trace games while retailing for a similarly eye-watering 1200 so it's not actually any cheaper than the 2080 ti it's replacing but as with any graphics card review right now it's a little bit academic because it's just so hard to find them i can't remember a more difficult time to be a pc gamer if you actually want to upgrade i would rather that they'd stop releasing new cards and just focus on building as many of the current cards as possible i'm sure you'd agree if you're uh trying to buy one for yourself although let me know what you think in the comments below on the other hand having more options is always a good thing and it means you can hopefully match the gpu to your budget but we'll have to see what it ends up being in the real world just a quick side note if you haven't yet subscribed well i highly recommend you to press that button right now because as well as this video using this pc as i say with the 11th gen i9 11 900k chip and some pretty crazy specs i've also built an amd ryzen build uh with the 5950x and also i'll talk you through my own personal setup upgrade and why i've gone for what i've gone with so uh subscribe give me a thumbs up hit that bell all those annoying things let's get to the benchmarks so nvidia sent over this fe version of the card for review i was supposed to get an rog third party card as well but it hasn't really arrived in time for this review and of course those cards have beefier aftermarket coolers and are usually quite a bit better for overclocking so that's something i'll revisit in another video soon but let's start with a game that can bring all these cards to their knees fortnite yes it's true actually turn on ray tracing effects even to medium and it absolutely demolishes the frame rate especially with everything else set to the maxed out epic setting at 4k in fairness you can make the dlss more aggressive but then this can affect the image quality a little bit so i stuck to balance and so in fortnite the 3080 ti was five percent faster at 1440 and a solid 11 faster at 4k compared to the 3080 while the 1390 was decently quicker at 1440p but only about two percent faster at 4k next up a bit of call of duty warzone and this has a fairly basic ray tracing mode so i turn that on and up most of the settings to the max as well now interestingly warzone saw the biggest gains going from the 3080 to the ti around 20 at both resolutions hitting 100 fps at 1440 and 155 at 1440p that's a pretty sizeable and worthwhile jump although going from the ti to the 1390 netting me just an extra five percent at 1440 and a more meaningful 10 at 4k just for context i'm mainly focusing on 1440 and 4k because any of these three cards will be more than capable of maxing out a 1080p 240hz screen with medium to high settings so really you're gonna want to buy these if you are playing at the higher resolutions all right let's move on to cyberpunk which is one of the most demanding games out there right now but these are top end cards so i maxed out rt and every setting i could and set dlc to performance to avoid single digit frame rates it's pretty clear that 1440p is the way to play this with all three cards getting between 71 and 75 fps although the ti and the 3090 scored the same at 4k things got a lot tougher with all three cards in the low 50s and again the difference between all three was literally a frame or two which is really within the margin of error next up we have the excellent metro exodus which has just had a total raid tracing revamp in its new enhanced edition with its new extreme rt setting being ridiculously demanding until dlc comes to the rescue again so playing at the more realistic ultra rt settings i was getting close to 100 fps at 4k with the ti which was around 8 faster than 3080 and weirdly 6 faster than 3090 and it was a similar story at 1440. now hitman 3 may not be one of the best looking games but it's still a serious test for any gpu and i love the fact that it has a built-in benchmark so here the ti was only three percent ahead at both resolutions nothing you would really notice while the 3090 was a further four and five percent faster at the two resolutions again though even against the 3080 that is an improvement but it's not really that noticeable and finally if we switch to some synthetic benchmarks in 3d mark time spy the ti was nine percent faster than 3080 and 3090 was just two percent faster than the ti all of which shows the ti really is closer to the top tier card overall it's also worth noting that during my testing the 3080 ti actually got quite a bit hotter than the 3080 and yet the fan stayed relatively slow even under sustained load infirm arc however the regular 3080 had its fans going into full jet engine mode this thing really does get loud so in reality at least when it comes to these fe versions of the cards one of the biggest upgrades coming from the 80 is just how much quieter the ti is under sustained load interestingly the 1390 was just as quiet as the ti but it managed it with lower temperatures thanks to the far larger heatsink chassis which must be in the order of twice the thermal capacity as the 3080s it's also worth noting that the boost clocks on the ti are actually a little bit slower than the regular 3080 and it throttles down to a little bit lower under sustained lows as well although all three maintain their memory clocks during my testing okay let's wrap up and it's interesting because the conclusion i've come to is buy the 3080 even though i think the 3080ti is the new flagship gaming card if you want the best of the best really because yes while the 390 is technically two and a half to three percent faster so realistically not many people should buy the 3090 which leaves these two and in my testing the 3080 ti is 89 faster than the 3080 so it's a nice little boost in performance and if you are one of those weirdos playing at 4k because 1440p is just not sharp enough for you then every frame counts so this will be worth buying and for 1200 supposedly that's the retail we'll have to see what it ends up being it's a very good card and just kind of gives you 30 90 performance for less money in a smaller package so this is the new king for me however the fact that this is only giving us a maximum of about 10 boost over the 30 80 and yet uh going by msrp is 61 more expensive than the 3080. in terms of bang for buck in terms of the card i would actually buy i would go with a 3080. or let's wait and see how the 3070 ti which has just been announced performs compared to these guys because that could be the new sweet spot especially for 1440p gaming but the most frustrating thing is that there's all this amazing tech from nvidia but no one can actually bloody buy them because they're just out of stock constantly or being scalped uh to some extent even used for mining although they are cutting that down in terms of limiting performance with updates but it's still a bit hit or miss in reality these could be 50 more expensive you may never be able to buy one for six months so we'll have to see but i do feel your frustration in some ways as i said at the beginning maybe they should just stop making new cards for a minute and focus on building more of them i'm not sure if that's how the manufacturing process works i'm sure they're doing their best but what do you think if you could buy a new graphics card right now to upgrade your pc which one would you go for and would you consider the new 3080 ti or not let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys don't forget to hit that
