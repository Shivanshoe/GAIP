okay this is actually really interesting i've been testing this it's the new asus tough dash f15 for a couple of weeks now you may have seen my video from a few days ago where i basically explained this little sticker down here because this is one of the first gaming laptops to come with intel's new h35 processors it's basically the same chip that you get in an ultrabook like the dell xps 13 but super top to draw 35 watts of power which they've put in this thin and light gaming laptop paired with an rtx 3070 but what's really interesting is that i've actually also been testing this guy it's the tough gaming a15 a is for amd f is for intel obviously also the dash models so we've got the dash f15 here is there slightly thinner and lighter a little bit sleeker versions of the gaming variants which are well a bit more traditional gaming laptops thicker bulkier chunkier bezels but actually more powerful so while you could argue that this is a whole new kind of thin and light format of gaming laptops for me it feels more like a stop gap until we get intel's proper h45 series in the next month or so to be quite honest i've already summed up why i probably wouldn't buy this i would wait for h45 or realistically just go for a gaming laptop with a ryzen 5000 series but that's not to say there's anything wrong with this at all it's still a fantastic gaming laptop and considering the tough dash 15 starts at just a thousand pounds although that gets you the rtx 3060 in a 144 hertz screen this guy is about 1500 which comes with a 240hz screen rtx 3070 it's the 85 watt tdp variant well it's actually 80 watts but we're getting a plus 5 watts rog boost so this is actually one of the lowest powered 3070s you'll get in a laptop but it's because they've squeezed it into this chassis which is just 19.9 millimeters thick it weighs 2 kilograms so the same as my dell xps 15. the performance we're getting from this is still quite impressive uh given just how thin and light it is and one of the comments that came up a lot in my h35 explainer video i do read all your comments i promise um was why go for this when you could go for maybe a comet lake laptop that's 10th gen intel not the new 11th gen h45 but why would you go down to a four core eight thread chip in here when there are last year's eight core 16 thread versions well you're basically getting some new next-gen features we've got pcie four support also four-lane pci-4 so you can plug in egpu with less bandwidth issues we're also getting a thunderbolt 4 support with a type c and also uh it supports nvidia's resizable bar which is always a pain to explain but it's basically better memory management between the cpu and the gpu so we're getting some nice 11th gen intel features in this which you don't get in the comet lake h-series laptops intel do boldly state that this should give you the fastest single threaded performance on any gaming laptop right now but how does this 35 watt quad core processor and the 85 watt 3070 stack up when it comes to actually playing games well in three of the six games i tested we are hitting triple digits in fact really it's just cyberpunk holding it back with a 42fps average but that is with ray tracing ultra settings and actually if you turn off rt that jumps up to 55. and i ran all those tests with this set to turbo mode uh which i can't currently do because it's not plugged in but in the arm recreate you can go between windows silent performance and turbo but generally i keep it on turbo just to get the best performance and actually never got particularly loud or even that hot and actually that's one of the biggest issues i had with the tough lineup last year but the good news is asus have listened and across the tough range while in their entire 2021 gaming laptop range cooling thermals are much better than before and that is in part due to the better airflow but also the more sensible choice of components because what we're seeing this year is asus have made this their dash thin and light laptop uh with a lower power 35 watt cpu and also they've gone for one of the lower tgp 3070s so they've been able to really smartly pick the components for this kind of chassis uh to give them the performance and the battery life and the thermal uh performance that you'd want and so for this thin and light gaming form factor it is making a difference and paired with the better design this is a much better all-round gaming laptop we're also getting a 240hz refresh rate screen it's got a three millisecond response time and it also supports adaptive sync my biggest issue with it is it just doesn't get that bright i measured a peak of about 280 nits which i would say is below average and also you're not going to get any kind of hdr out of this at all so not the end of the world particularly if you're gaming in a well reasonably low lit environment which i suspect most people will be but i would like to see a brighter screen also as you can see we do have these very nice and thin bezels around the screen but as you can see there is also now no room for a webcam which well i mean gaming laptop webcams have always been pretty terrible but it's better than nothing i suppose but it is something it lacks compared to the regular a15 here or the f15 which does have a webcam albeit with chunkier bezels the keyboard and trackpad are also lovely to use it is backlit but it's not rgb you just get the one color option here which is a bit of a shame but you've got these fancy transparent wasd keys which is quite a cool touch and also this much bigger precision touch pad is smooth and just lovely to use i mentioned the thunderbolt 4 port earlier but we actually have a really good range of i o with this we've got a full-size hdmi 2.0 b uh we've got three usb 3.2 gen ones a rj45 headphone and mic combi port as well as a usb4 thunderbolt 4 port which just makes it a bit more future-proof really and also if you do decide to plug in an e-gpu with this which i'm not sure how many people would do that i mean the 30-70 is pretty good already but i would worry uh you'll be bottlenecked a little bit by that 35-watt quad-core processor i say 35 watt but i have actually measured this go as high as 60 watt uh albeit only briefly so that does kind of show that the big selling point of 11th gen intel processors is just how scalable they are as i said they're using the same chip in ultrabooks like the xps 13 and also in gaming laptops like this and eventually with their h45 coming soon they are incredibly scalable and while it does say 35 watts on the tim it really can vary quite significantly based on what you're doing and as i say i've seen up to 60 watts being drawn in terms of battery life we're actually getting a 76 watt hour cell in here which isn't the biggest a lot of laptops now have 90 or even 99 watt-hour batteries but paired with the slightly lower power specs in the rest of the laptop battery life is pretty decent after an hour of youtube the f15 still had 86 percent of its battery left and you can expect around seven hours of light non-gaming news from this and we're also getting asus new smaller uh 200 watt power adapter really is pretty small and actually this supports fast charging so you can get about 50 of your battery in just half an hour of charging but it does also support power delivery through the type c port if you prefer and if you don't want to carry this with you although it's pretty small anyway so it's not really a big deal now if we open this up in terms of upgradability uh we're actually getting two pcie three ssd slots one is already filled with out of the 512 gig or one terabyte stick depending on which spec you went for but you do have this second m2 slot available if you want to upgrade it and also as you can see we've got upgradable ram up to a max of 32 gigabytes how tough is this laptop because well it's in the name even though they're spelling a different tuf but i can tell you from accidentally dropping it in my video last week onto my hardwood floor from desk height no damage no scuffs at all it's actually pretty durable but the problem is and this is the last time i'm gonna reach over and bring this in i promise but i think i would just rather buy this this is the tough gaming a15 versus the dash f15 and while it does weigh 300 grams more than this it's also about four millimeters thicker it does feel a little bit cheaper and less premium than this overall considering it's the same price when it comes to gaming laptops the priority for me and i'm pretty sure you guys as well is performance and with this we're getting a 95 watt tgp 30 70. so an extra 10 watts of power over what we're getting in the dash and also more importantly i think we're getting the ryzen 7 5800h which is an 8 core 16 thread chip and in some games like hitman i measured this uh giving us an extra 26 performance in rainbow six seed he was 18 faster the only game where the intel came on top was in wolfenstein where it was three percent faster but wait before you grab your pitchforks and head to the comments saying that that's not a fair test well you're absolutely right as i say higher tgp uh bigger chassis so better airflow and also the higher power 45 watt cpu versus 35 watt these are not quite like for like laptops but i do just want to bring you back to some synthetic benchmarks i ran between the two just testing the processor while in both cases the intel did win in single core the ryzen thrashed it in multi-core with an average of a 60 boost over the intel so take those with a little pinch of salt because it's not like the like but it is indicative of the extra performance that you're going to get with a higher power 45 watt chip and it just strikes me that if you're gonna buy a gaming laptop right now while you may want a slightly sleeker smaller sort of ultra portable gaming laptop i reckon for most of us performance is the most important so while this may carve out a small new category of ultra portable gaming laptops i'm just not convinced that paying a grand or you know one and a half thousand for something like this with a four core processor which is probably going to be usurped by the h45 series in the next couple of months anyway isn't the best idea i would suggest sticking with the ryzen 5000 series i think it's getting more for your money and in games that are optimized for more cores we're getting up to sort of 20 25 better performance and of course it's also going to come in handy if you're streaming or multitasking or using this as a bit of a workstation for video editing or rendering in conclusion for my review of the tough dash f-15 i would actually just go and buy the gaming a15 instead if that helps but i will leave links to both of these guys in the description below if you want to check them out and also let me know what you make of these in the description below do you agree with me do you think i couldn't be more wrong either way let me know what you think in the comments thank you so much for watching guys if you do want to see more from
