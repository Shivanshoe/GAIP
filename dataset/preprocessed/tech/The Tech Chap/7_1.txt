hey guys i'm tunnel tech chap and this is the brand spanking new dell xps 15 9520 you can't tell from the outside well except for this sticker here but this is the new 2022 model and it is a terrific laptop a lot of people buy these i have for many years and a lot of reviewers still think this is the best 15-inch laptop you can buy and for good reason dell have been evolving the xbs and the 15 for the past 12 years now and all the ones i've tested over the last four five six years have been pretty great and the good news i suppose is that it's business as usual if it ain't broke don't fix it which dale certainly did not and actually well no that's not good news because in some ways it is a bit broken this thing gets too hot and too loud and as beautiful and well still impressive as it is it's struggling to stand out now compared to the likes of the asus zenbook pro 16x oled and of course this the macbook pro 16. if you are a regular on the channel you know that i've been using the xps 15s as my main work and 18 laptops for quite a few years now until i switched to this late last year when it came out this is the 16 with the m1 max it is an absolute beast and actually one of the reasons i did switch to this not just because i do quite like the apple ecosystem i use airdrop all the time but the media engine in this there are no other laptops out there outside of macbooks particularly the highest spec ones where i can seamlessly scrub through premiere pro my timeline with no lag or stutter the advantage of this is that we have that cuda gpu acceleration but in my everyday life i use this all the time and there's just really no windows equivalent to it yet unfortunately this is going off topic a little bit but the seamless integration that apple have right now with their hardware and their software every windows laptop well it feels like they have to make them with one arm tie behind their back because they have to work with intel or amd and then nvidia or amd on the gpu side and then they have to put it into their own chassis optimization and efficiency is wasted but even though i've switched to this macbooks aren't for everyone they are very expensive although so is this when you spec it up a little bit but a lot of people still prefer windows they have to use windows for work and if you're gaming you're going to get better frame rates and well about a million times more games you can actually play on this and one thing you don't get with an apple laptop right now is the option for an oled screen the pros do have mini leds so it comes close and it also gets brighter which is actually quite a significant advantage but this is oled so you get those rich deep inky blacks now if this does look familiar then it's because well it's because it is we've had the same design for a couple of years now save for the addition of that oled screen which came in last year so what is actually new here well a couple of things and that's about it to be honest uh we've got the new 12th gen intel processors out of the i5 i7 i9 and actually they are a bit of an upgrade it'll come to performance in a second we also have faster ddr5 ram and also slightly improved battery life and that is about it so uh thank you for watching and i'll see you next time right here on the tech jam [Music] okay we should probably talk a little bit more about this this is a fairly minor refresh and in fact we even have the same gpus we get the rtx 3050 and the 3050 ti options still no amd still no 3060 which is exclusive to the 17 inch there's also still no wi-fi 6e which is a bit bizarre and also still no high refresh rate which is a bit frustrating but hold your horses this is still an upgrade and it is still a stunning laptop so right now the xps lineup includes the 13 the 13 plus the 15 and the 17 and the main difference coming up from the 13s is that we get a dedicated gpu in here as well as more ports a bigger battery and well a bigger screen however the 15 does lack the better vapor chamber cooling that we get on the 17 plus as i say the gpu tops out at the 30 50 ti rather than the 360. and actually the 3050 ti i have in here has been down clocked significantly compared to last year but the trade-off is the 15 is a good deal lighter and more portable so i still think this is the sweet spot in the xps range this video is sponsored

below and get started with surf shock and if you're not super duper satisfied then they also have a 30 day money back guarantee i think by now we're all pretty familiar with the aluminium chassis and this carbon fiber palm rest it still looks good although i do prefer the arctic silvery white option that you get in the u.s but actually right now for some reason is not available in the uk it could be a stock issue and with these super thin bezels and this huge touch pad it is a very smart looking laptop although the downside still is that the palm rest and the keys can get a bit grubby and fingerprinty and also watch out for the shiny aluminium edges of this because it scratches quite easily and then because it is a bit glossy you do notice it where did i put the there it is okay here we go this is the xps 13 plus i am working on my review of this at the same time so make sure you have hit that subscribe button as i'll have a video of this coming very soon but you can see we've got it in the arctic white color so actually if i put it side by side with the traditional this is gonna be tricky black carbon fiber color which do you prefer i think the white looks a lot snazzier perhaps not quite as subtle if you're going to take it into a meeting but it looks a lot more futuristic in fact the whole 13 plus looks more futuristic and that is kind of one of my issues as i say there really is no design refresh or change to be fair not everyone is going to love that uh keyboard layout the keycaps are much bigger but there's no room there's no gap between them so it's kind of hard to feel your way around it takes a little bit of time to get used to and also we have this capacitive function row at the top so in my mind this feels like the next generation of dell's designs and sort of laptops whereas this feels a bit last gens so possibly next year we'll see this can design moving on to the 15 and 17s which would be quite interesting to see but it would also mean this is kind of like the last generation of the current design and it's one of my conclusions at the end but i'll just tell you right now i think last year's xps 15 is still going to be a better buy you can get a similar high-end spec for about seven eight hundred quid less assuming you can find one than this and while this is better and i'll show you how and why in a second it's not that much better so um i still think last year's model might be the better option or indeed wait a year and let's see what the new 15 and 17 so maybe the 15 plus and 17 pluses could be like build quality is top notch though the whole thing just feels nice to hold and it is impressively slim given the power on offer here so how much is it well as always it comes down to where you live and of course the spec that you go for in the uk the 15 starts at 1549 pounds which is actually 50 quid less than the equivalent model from last year although right now there is a sale on which gets you 150 off in the us the base spec starts at 1449 however once you start going for the higher specs it gets a bit pricey my near enough maxed out model here with an i9 and a 3050 ti 64 gigs of the new ddr5 ram along with the oled screen and a one terabyte ssd we're looking at 3049 pounds and you can add a couple hundred more if you want a two terabyte ssd personally i would go with the i7 i really don't think i could justify paying 400 quid more for the i9 that is quite frankly ridiculous and if you do want the gpu then the extra 50 pounds or 100 for the ti is definitely worth it and i would also go with 16 gigs of ram one terabyte storage and personally i would go with the oled screen so altogether my recommended model will cost you about 2 400 or 2 200 pounds this is actually not bad value for money considering it's a ultra premium kind of workstation replacement laptop and it is certainly cheaper than the macbook pro 16 and although that's not an exact like flight comparison if we pop off the base you can see there are two ram modules along with the pci4 ssd both of which you can upgrade yourself so it might be more cost effective to buy a lower spec now and maybe upgrade these further down the line another carryover from last year are these fantastic speakers we have dual woofers and dual tweeters which make up an 8 watt system and it gives us one of the best sounding laptops you can buy again perhaps except for that pesky macbook pro we also get the same lovely keyboard which is actually still one of my favorites on a windows laptop with well-spaced keys and plenty of feedback and that's alongside this massive precision touchpad which is just as lovely to use as ever although we don't get the haptic feedback that we get on the new 13 plus or the macbook but let's talk about this screen because it is still one of the standout features and there really are only a handful of options out there if you do want an oled display as i say i think the best ones or the best competing ones are from asus with their zenbook lineup now this is a 16x10 so you can see here uh with my video going back to a regular 16x9 now just feels old-fashioned actually it's one of my biggest criticisms of the galaxy book 2 pro which i'm also reviewing at the moment and it is a gorgeous screen but still 60 hertz sadly unlike asus zenbooks which are oled and 90 hertz it does make this feel a bit slower that performance just doesn't feel like it's there on tap because we're still limited to 60 hertz and also it's not the brightest this oled model tops out at 400 nits and also it's 3.5 k rather than a native 4k resolution the other two led lcd options the non oled versions are actually 500 nits so a little bit brighter and also that 4k plus option will give you that full native 4k res things do get brighter with hdr content though i measured a peak brightness of around 800 nits so i think i would trade the 4k pluses extra pixels and also the extra knits in hdr for that infinite contrast and the punchier colors that you get with oled it is a touchscreen though which is nice and maybe helpful for you if you're doing some digital drawing or note-taking or you know e-signatures that kind of thing but this oled option like the 4k option they're both 200 pound 250 upgrades over the standard full hd plus so this does cost more and the other benefit of sticking with full hd is that the battery life will last you about 50 longer going to this 3.5 or the 4k options does have a quite a big impact on your battery however the downside of sticking with the cheaper full hd option is that you don't get this sort of edge to edge glass bezel you have a little bit of sort of a plastic protruding bezel doesn't look as nice it's also not as color accurate and it's matte which you may prefer but if you're looking at content and watching movies and editing videos and photos and things the glossy screen is nice to have particularly paired with that oled panel color accuracy is top notch though we're looking at 100 srgb and adobe rgb and high p3 coverage let's talk about battery life though because it does depend on whether you go for the 56 or the bigger 86 watt hour battery and of course also what specs and what screen you go for now here with the larger battery and the oled screen my xbox 15 managed seven and a half hours in my standard full screen video test which to my surprise is a nice little jump from the six hours that i got on last year's model so battery life is about 15 to 20 better this year and so with mixed use i reckon you could easily manage about seven hours out of this less in more demanding tasks and probably an hour and a half of gaming but it is still a definite improvement although if you want the absolute best battery then you're going to want to stick with a full hd screen but also go with a bigger battery that'll probably get you closer to 12 hours so far we've barely even talked about the actual main upgrade this year the cpu so let's see how fast this is and in my benchmarks we can see that while the single core speeds are slightly better than last year there is a definite step up in multi-core results nothing major but alongside the slightly longer battery it's a definite win and as you would expect it's plenty fast enough for some demanding 4k editing in premiere pro and batch photo editing in lightroom it's pretty much workstation level which again is very impressive given just how slim this is okay moving on to the gpu in this case the 3050 ti and it's worth saying that this is a 45 watt gpu rather than the 75 watt versions that you may find in some of the laptops and coupled with only four gigs of vram and of course that fairly major down clock versus the 350 ti in last year's xps 15 means that while gaming potential is there it's nothing special so i must admit it was kind of a surprise that at 1200 p the new cpu actually offsets the slower gpu making big gains in rainbow six siege with a more modest improvement in fortnite but annoyingly that underclock wipes out any more meaningful games but next to the xbs17 with its 3060 the 15 here very much comes in second place and not just in terms of frame rates the cooling is also much better on the 17 to match his components and so while otherwise this is a very well-rounded and very polished laptop i think my one criticism really aside from perhaps not being the most interesting this year is the fans and the cooling it gets hot and it gets loud in fact if we take another look inside you can see the 17's vapor chamber cooler is significantly bigger than the 15s the fans on this seem to come in even under minimal loads and it can get pretty loud and actually in my stress test using the optimized and also the high performance modes the cpu jumps up as high as 75 to 95 watts and also hits 100 degrees celsius at the initial load before then gradually throttling back over the next minute or so then both this and the clock speeds just drop off a cliff the only advantage of this quite serious throttling is that the fans quieten down but this does mean that sustained performance is severely curved after only a minute or so which isn't the case with a 17 and the difference is even more stark when you compare it to say the macbook pro 14 or 16 which just never really gets flustered and stays almost silent the whole time even under load look at that that's terrible i appreciate how thin the bezels are and we have faith unlocking and it's actually now separate the ir camera and the main selfie camera here for the webcam selfie webcam but the quality is terrible look at that so noisy and this is actually some decent lighting if i go around to the window yeah not good at all come on dale you can do better but i wouldn't say any of those are deal breakers i wish this had 90 hertz i wish they had done a bit of a design update even not just from an aesthetic point of view but to give it a bit better cooling so we get better sustained performance it's still incredibly powerful but i just would like it to be a bit less throttly and also when you do see the likes of the zenbook pro 16x oled i think that's the right name uh with its little dial built in and it's 90 hertz oled screen just little bits of you know innovation and of course what we're seeing with the macbooks as well well this is still a great laptop and if you can get it on a sale definitely worth considering it just feels a little bit boring this year and actually going back to i said the beginning if you can find a good deal on last year's model while you will lose out on the slightly faster cpu and the slightly longer battery life aside from that it's not really a big deal and you could save a whole bunch of money so this is still fine especially if you're upgrading from a three four year or older laptop but certainly not worth it if you've got one for the last couple of years and i still think last year's model is probably a better option overall but what do you think are you an xps 15 owner let me know what you make of it in the comments below and also if you've got any questions about this at all
