all right so this is the new TV the q9 50 from Samsung it's their latest their greatest 8k TV and it's all about the bezel we talk about bezels all the time thinner the better really you get bigger screen to body ratio which basically means you're getting more screen in the same footprint because I live in a pretty small house and so I want you know as thin as possible so I can get away with having a bigger TV so maybe my partner will uh she let me have a 75 inch next year cheap now she's checking ahead but as you can see this infinity edge screaming's we get a 99% screen to body ratio still okay still quantum dot I believe it's using the same quantum processors before but they've made some changes with the AI and the AI of scaling which obviously is what it's all about because there's next to no a.k content at the moment you can watch a couple of things on YouTube maybe there's some tech demos but really there's nothing in any case so we'll leave for now for next couple years it's all about off scaling actually if you follow me come with me come with me come with me looking at a wall of text is arguably a bit boring but it's actually very important because unless you have a super fast internet connection right now the idea of streaming 8k without buffering and awful compression is well it's kind of impossible almost so the idea is using things like a a scale net and a v1 will actually sort of help get to the point where we can actually watch a que content on our fancy a que TVs you can see there's a lot of people here this is the Samsung first look event and they're all focusing on the side of the TV you can see tiny little machine dots in the side of the frame of the TV and that's the new speaker system Samsung you're claiming this has the best speakers on any TV which is a pretty bold claim and of course something else test properly a full review hopefully if they send our sample but it does look very impressive on the back we've got subwoofers both active and passive but on the side as I say you can see these speaker grilles these speaker holes we should give you a nice immersive sound experience and also there's a new thing called object tracking which kind of makes sense this does where it says on the Tim but even if the program you're watching hasn't been so optimized for virtual surround sound this object tracking software will actually see where things are on screen so if a plane flies overhead you can I get very realistic virtual surround sound also not only that but they've got a new technology called Symphony so if you have a cue 9 series or cue one of Samsung's latest sound bar systems you can sync that up with the TV and then it works in symphony so you can actually take advantage of both which is pretty cool so actually even though we have this new speaker system it's actually thinner than the previous cue 900 we're looking at just 15 millimeters and also you'll notice it's got a completely flat back which obviously comes in handy if you're planning on wall mounting this the thing is though you can see that little stand at the bottom it's a very similar design to the 2019 series I actually have a 65 inch Y had a 65 inch q 90 ah and on my TV stand because the weight is so centralized it actually bent it in a bit made a bit crooked so I was kind of hoping maybe they change the stand a bit distribute the weight a bit wider because that would destroy my TV stand at the moment so we also get the new Tizen software and the first thing you'll see is that the app icons are a lot smaller so rather than to scroll through those different pages to get YouTube and Netflix and Amazon they're actually a lot smaller because you can see more on the screen and now if I actually look below that if my kind of system Scrolls up you've got this new Universal what does it call Universal Universal guides you can actually see a lot more content right there and also if you find a movie or TV show you want to watch it'll tell you where you can watch it so you don't have to go searching through Netflix or Amazon to find that movie you actually want we also know get the Google assistant and Alexa building which is pretty handy you can say things like Alexa Tom TV I play just activated you were like so I'm sorry about that I've done it again I'm gonna stop talking also we do get updated big speak which is really exciting I have to do this bit fast because there's music playing I may get license issues copyright issues but digital birla new smart home dashboard for your smart tech and also your non smart tech they say you can hook up your old air conditioning unit and stuff so a new dashboard you can see where all your tech is turn it on and off or I get stuff right stop so that's just a quick first look at the new Samsung q 950 I hope you've enjoyed it obviously my setup isn't quite as impressive as this lady over here I believe this on the BBC and he like a lighting guy as well in fact maybe him just behind you maybe he can help it can be a boom operator if I'm next to you then it's gonna make you look brighter if you're next 2 minutes from now I get more views if you
