hey guys i'm tom of techchap and this is cyberpunk streaming on a macbook pro over wi-fi uh in a hotel room and normally that would be impossible on a macbook like this so i am of course streaming it via geforce now this has been around for a few years now but they are starting to roll out one of the biggest updates to the streaming service it's an all-new top tier mode that lets you stream your game library at up to 1440p 120 hertz and from your own rtx 3080 based virtual gaming rig so between my brother pete back in the office in the uk and me uh working out of hotel rooms currently i'm in california i've been to hawaii recently as well for work i promise but we have been testing geforce now on a whole bunch of devices and so given just how hard it is to buy a new gpu at least for a reasonable price and also the consoles are still pretty hard to find is signing up for something like geforce now with this new uh top tier mode actually worth doing and if you do enjoy the video a cheeky little like and subscribe would be very much appreciated so as a quick refresher because it does feel like geforce now has maybe fallen under the radar a little bit in the last couple of years it basically allows you to play games you already own on the likes of steam epic gog ubisoft and ea although there isn't any battlenet support currently you then link or log into each of your store accounts as you boot up each game for the first time and you get cloud saves as well so you can carry on where you left off you also don't have to buy games through gfn and there's also a selection of free games to play with a lot of the usual suspects like fortnite apex legends and destiny 2. now as i'm recording this video nvidia say there's about 1100 or so games that can be streamed via geforce now but not every game can be there are some rights issues or copyright issues so do check that the game that you want to play will run on this first so how much well the free membership tier is a really good starting point for testing just how well this works over your connection although game performance and resolution is more limited than the premium options also cues to play games will be longer and you can only play for an hour at a time but it is free so you can't really argue with that then we have the priority tier which was previously the top-end founders tier and this is 45 pounds or 50 for six months and gets you a more powerful virtual rig with rtx ray tracing support in compatible games extended 6 hour sessions and a 1080p 60fps stream and finally we have the new rtx 3080 level which gets you the full 1440p 120 hertz on pc and mac with adaptive sync providing your screen supports it eight hour gaming sessions 4k hdr if you're using nvidia shield tv and of course access to a faster 3080 based rig so performance should be closer to an actual high-end pc experience however at twice the price so 90 pounds or a hundred dollars for a six month subscription it is a lot more money for this 30 80 tier and on the one hand you could say well over three years you could just buy a ps5 or a series x with that kind of money or a very basic gaming pc and then you would own that because of course this is an ongoing subscription but then on the other hand the component shortages and the pricing that goes with that also the fact that this is much more affordable it's over time you don't have to you know drop 2 000 pounds or something on a gaming pc or 500 on a console and so while i don't think this is for everyone it depends on your situation if you already have a console or a good gaming pc setup this is definitely worth considering now as for the actual tech behind all this nvidia have just taken the wraps off their super pod super computers which house around a thousand rtx 3080s each which is probably why the tier is currently only available in limited quantities and each virtual rig gets the equivalent of an eight core 16 thread cpu 27 gigs of ddr4 ram and a fast pci4 ssd but as you guys know that's only half the story you can have all those fancy fast super computers but if your connection at home or wherever you're using it like in a hotel room isn't fast stable and also low latency you're going to run into trouble now nvidia reckon that you'll need a 35 meg connection to run this 3080 tier but with the usual variances in connection quality i say maybe 60 to 100 is probably a safer bet and also bear in mind that you're looking at nine to 11 gigs of data per hour so you're probably going to want an unlimited data cap although of course you can go from one of the lower tiers which use less data so i've been testing this out on my 120 hertz macbook pro 16 a surface pro 8 as well as a couple of phones and a gaming laptop and i even tried it via an app on my 2021 lg oled tv and in most situations it is pretty impressive but really for the best experience you're going to want to connect via ethernet oh and also the full 1440p 120 hertz mode is reserved for mac pc and nvidia shield tv but more on that in a moment so how well does this new 3080 tier actually work well let's start with the best case scenario 300 meg fiber connection via ethernet i left the quality mode to the default balanced and jumped into a bit of cyberpunk which was smooth and responsive to my inputs but it didn't look like 1440p or 120hz it was still using 20p60 which actually is helpful as this is simulating how the lower priority tier will look but then in the custom settings i manually set the resolution to 1600p in the case of my 16x10 mac and 120hz and the difference was pretty huge the graphics looked much crisper the rtx effects looked good and it was close enough to playing the game locally on a pc that after a while i forgot this was being streamed occasionally and with other games i tested compression artefacts and some muddy textures would pop in reminding me that i was streaming in rainbow six siege at the max res and refresh rate it looks pretty similar to running it on my rtx 3070 gaming laptop up close it is less sharp but it's not far off and i was surprised how the input lag felt pretty similar though i am a 31 year old amateur gamer i'm sure competitive gamers would notice a difference the launcher allows you to enable manual graphics settings in games but more often than not i couldn't change the refresh rate in game so it was tricky to tell if i was actually getting that full 120 and sometimes even in less demanding titles it felt more like 60. but then over my admittedly fast wi-fi 6 connection things were more hit and miss distant textures looked lower res due to the extra compression though it was the increased input lag that was most obvious and if your wi-fi isn't that great then latency or packet loss can mean the stream is stuttery or laggy ethernet is kind of a must have on pc and mac in my experience games can also be a little bit slow to boot up over gfn but once you're in load times are very quick although of course you also don't have to worry about any long downloads big file sizes or updates it was also a little bit difficult to tell if adaptive sync was working with my display although i didn't see much in the way of tearing artifacts overall but then my next plan was to download it on my pixel 6 pro and try it out but then it turns out it doesn't support it only samsung galaxy which is a bit frustrating although i do have an s21 ultra i can test it with and it did seem to work pretty well but like the pc it's not always obvious i'm getting that full 120. you also have less control over the graphics and stream settings but even so playing games that could never run on a phone with an xbox controller felt great input lag was okay but obviously slower than if it was running locally but even so it was easily playable as for ios there isn't currently a specific app although there is a fiddly workaround installed and also currently no 120 fps support on my tv though through the new gfn app which isn't actually widely available just yet things were a little bit less rosy as my ethernet cable couldn't actually reach i had to fall back on my tv's wi-fi and it was pretty laggy and the graphics looked quite compressed but then when i retried it with ethernet it was pretty much a return to regular service so i think as with many things in life geforce now is a case of managing expectations if you have a strong reliable connection and don't already have a gaming pc or next-gen console then yeah this definitely is worth considering and it feels a bit of a niche although of course we do have strong competition from xbox cloud gaming and also google stadia but then in terms of this new 3080 tier it's a little bit tricky because it is twice as expensive although perhaps that's worth it if you are a keen gamer and want the best graphics and refresh rate but then bear in mind the hardware has to match it if you don't have a 120 hertz screen on your laptop then you're not going to have that benefit either and of course if you haven't got that connection then it looks like it will dynamically reduce that refresh rate and resolution as well so it does feel like only in the sort of tightest best conditions are you really gonna get the full potential out of this but there is still something magical about this i shouldn't be able to play cyberpunk as well as this or at all indeed on a macbook with you know no fans worrying without the battery draining because of course it's all being streamed so you're not really using the local hardware it is very impressive and playable almost to the same level as playing it locally although it all comes down to that connection 180 pounds or 200 a year for a service that does a close enough job maybe all you need especially if you just like the idea of playing on an alternative or portable device but what do you reckon would you be tempted to sign up for geforce now give it a try and also would you pay for that top 3080 tier or not really bothered to stick to the priority let me know what you make of this in the comments below and again if you did enjoy this video which hopefully you did because you watched it to the end then a like and subscribe would be amazing thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the
