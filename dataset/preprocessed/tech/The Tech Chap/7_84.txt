hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is the brand new galaxy fold three and one of the first questions i was asked when i brought this home was will i be switching from my s21 ultra which has been my daily driver for the past few months and the answer is no in fact as impressive as the new fold 3 is i'm pretty convinced the s21 ultra or indeed actually the flip 3 is a much better option for almost everyone let's start with the price and in the uk this is 1600 pounds and this is 1200 pounds for the same spec and it's actually 50 pounds cheaper than that if you're happy to go with 128 storage and that doesn't really take into account any discounts or deals that you might get on this because it's about seven months old now okay so this is a lot more expensive but then we are getting two screens five camera lenses including this very nifty under screen camera and it folds i mean who doesn't love a bit of folding action whereas this is just another glass rectangle like every other phone on the market so in terms of having an innovative design a bigger tablet screen experience and well just being able to show off to your mates a little bit the fold is definitely the winner and particularly with the fold 3's ipx8 water resistance and it's more durable screen i definitely feel more confident actually using this than i did with the previous models but the thing is as someone who's bought both the fold and the s21 ultra myself outside of samsung's review samples as much as i love how this looks i feel like it's going to be the same situation as the fall 2 where after a few weeks i'll just want to go back to the s21 ultra although i must admit i do prefer the physical fingerprint reader on the fold rolling the in-screen one on the s21 plus there is something very satisfying about being able to open it up and having that big tablet screen experience particularly if the app is well optimized for it i don't think the fold is a gimmick i think if you really do want that tablet experience i think it's a genuinely lovely device and also if you are a bit of a sort of enthusiast user and you want the extra screen real estate for multitasking then i think there is definitely an audience for this and also if you want to just show off a little bit but in day-to-day life i do find something like the s21 ultra a lot more practical it's more comfortable in my pocket because while it is a little bit shorter just tiny bit it's obviously a lot thinner than the fold that's where the flip 3 i think comes into its own because it is a lot more comfortable i also don't have to decide between a slightly too small cover screen and a slightly too big tablet screen when i'm on the go for me at least it feels like the fold is missing that kind of goldilocks screen size somewhere in between i'm often tapping the wrong letter when i'm using the cover screen but then it's always a two-handed job when it's opened up in tablet mode i also have to say i'm not as impressed by the under screen camera as i thought i'd be the compromise is samsung's had to downgrade that on the screen camera to a pretty average 4 megapixel shooter which they just recommend using for video calls and using for face unlocking not as a proper photography camera it's certainly a step up over a hole punch or a big chunky notch in the corner but it is still there it's more camouflaged than hidden and i think it feels a bit like a first generation tech the other problem with the design is the aspect ratio because this tablet is great for most games and websites but when it comes to posts that use feeds like any social media you either get chunky letterboxing or it just doesn't fill the whole space most content is just better suited to this kind of regular phone shape and size okay what about performance though because this has been out for about six or seven months now is the fall 3 faster and technically higher spec well no there's no snapdragon 8 plus it uses the same chip as the s21 ultra same ram same storage there are two caveats though because the fold tops out with 12 gigs of ram whereas this actually can come with up to 16 if you go for the 512 storage option so bizarrely even though this is probably more of a multitasking device you can get more ram on the s21 ultra and secondly all models of both the fold and the flip regardless of region use the snapdragon triple eight whereas in the uk and some countries the s21 still use the exynos 2100 but as you can see from these results there's really not much between them now and actually the exynos can be faster in some tests but it's still worth bearing in mind but whichever phone you use i would definitely give surf shark vpn a try they're very kindly sponsoring today's video and it's

there's a money back guarantee if it's not for you but why not give it a try then there's the s pen and outside of the note series and the galaxy tablets only the s21 ultra and the fold 3 support it although this is a slight win for the fold 3 here as both the s pen full edition and the s pen pro have the fastest response time on any galaxy device at 2.8 milliseconds versus about 9 milliseconds or so on the s21 ultra so doodling and drawing will be a touch more responsive on the fold but still neither feel as convenient as a proper galaxy note where you don't need an awkward carry case sleeve thing for the pen but i suppose the tablet size screen plus that faster response time does make the fold a better choice if you are a big s pen user okay lastly i'll tell you what really does stop me from switching to the fold except for the price and that is the camera because well these are very good and we do have five lenses they are not as good as the s21 ultra which came out as i say about seven months ago and side by side while there aren't a huge amount of differences particularly in good light in terms of overall quality and also having a significantly better zoom i mean up to 30 times on this is actually pretty usable the s21 ultra is the clear winner when it comes to the camera which is a little bit disappointing although on the flip side the fall 3 has that advantage of being able to use the cover screen as a viewfinder so you can more easily take selfies with the main higher quality camera and also see yourself when someone's taking your photo but putting the s21 ultra to one side just for a moment default 3 is still a big step up from last year's fall 2. it's a little bit thinner and lighter but you can't really tell the difference in your hand but the extra durability of the screen and with that water resistance the new chip the faster 120 hertz cover screen the slightly hidden camera and of course the s pen support all add up to make this feel like a real refinement i just wish we had a proper step up in the cameras and maybe a more significant price cut like we've seen on the flip 3 and it is still a bit of a chunky monkey now with all that said i have only had this for about a week or so now so i will give it some more time i've switched my sim to it so i am probably using this as my everyday phone but i can tell you already that as i say similar to my fall 2 experience i already kind of want to just go back to this it's just a bit more comfortable and practical in everyday life as much as this is very much a showy off kind of cool piece of tech when you want your phone when you're sort of running and gunning or you're late for an uber and you need to check something or you know respond to an email very quickly i kind of just want to go back to my regular phone that could be muscle memory that could just be that i'm not really fully taking advantage of the fold and you know i'm using it incorrectly don't get me wrong this is still a fantastic device for some people this will be the dream phone slash tablet thing but for me when it comes to like everyday life and practicality and also affordability to some extent this is the better option but i do want to hold out for the flip three because i think that's actually a lot more exciting it's a lot more affordable at about 950 pounds so 400 or so less than the flip last year and it's also the closest to just using a regular phone when it's unfolded plus you have that handy cover screen but outside of the flip and the fold i think the two phones that may convince me to upgrade in the next few months would be either the iphone 13 pro max whatever that ends up being called and also the pixel 6 pro i can't wait for that and to see what google does with that new tensor core chip but what do you think regardless of price let's just say put that to one side would you want to use this every day as your phone having in your pocket let me know what you think in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat oh and don't forget to give surf shark vpn a try use the code tech chat for 83 off and
