hey guys I'm telling tech Japan if you have an old or cheap or slightly sluggish laptop that's seen better days then you may want one of these little guys a solid-state drive or SSD now I know it's 20/20 and people have been upgrading their laptops with SSDs for donkey's years now but I still genuinely think it's the best and most cost-effective way of upgrading an old laptop and giving it a new lease of life so when Samsung go in touch and asked if I want to make a video all about upgrading a slow old laptop with their Samsung 860 Evo SSD I jump to the chance so why now well SSDs are cheaper and better than ever and installing one is pretty simple as well this is meant as a bit of a beginner's guide and I'll cover the basics of buying the right SSD for you how to move all your files to the new drive and go over the basics of installing it and it may mean you don't have to buy that expensive new laptop for a few more years so I've got this three-year old Asus laptop which comes with a core i3 fifth gem processor four gigs of RAM and a pretty horrible TN panel screen you can see those horrible viewing angles there and also a one terabyte mechanical hard drive now of course changing the drive to an SSD isn't gonna fix that screen or the fact that this could do with eight gigs of RAM but I still think if you're gonna make one upgrade then going to an SSD is the best choice here and so that's exactly what I did and it transformed it we went from 40 second boot times down to nine seconds the read dated space with three times higher and the write speeds were five times faster it really did transform how it feels to use it and it's not all about the speed well it's most of the speed but also SSDs are more power efficient than traditional hard drives and they're also silent as well and if you are still using an old hard drive and you've been using it a lot then this will eventually wear out so changing to an SSD is a good way to extend the life of your machine and most importantly protect your data now for me I've always tended to buy samsung SSDs and the 860 Evo here is a great choice it's exactly the same size as a regular laptop hard drive at to noff inches and it uses the same SATA 3 interface you'll also want to go for at least the same amount of storage as your old hard drive so in my case one terabyte which you can find for around 130 pounds or dollars and I put a link in the description below although my recommendation for most people who don't need a ton of storage will be the 500 gig model which costs about 75 pounds or 80 dollars you may have also come across the smaller and faster nvme m2 SSDs that's a lot of acronyms there but basically you need a dedicated slot on your laptop's motherboard to use one of these and if you're coming from a hard drive then you can pretty much guarantee your machine won't have this option it's more common on newer and highest spec laptops just quickly before we go any further do make sure that your particular laptop is upgradable the vast majority are but it's worth doing a little bit research online maybe watching a few how-to videos on how to actually open up and change the hard drive in your particular laptop but the actual process of swapping it out is fairly simple I mean if I can do it and you can definitely do it and it shouldn't void your warranty assuming it still has one on although obviously the warranty won't cover the drive the new drive that you're putting in so enough of me rambling let's actually get to the process of swapping out the SSD and the first thing to consider is Windows or your operating system what are you gonna do with your current files that you have on your laptop and you've got two options really the first one is a fresh install of Windows which to be honest I wouldn't really recommend it's a little trickier with laptops because you have to make sure firstly that all your data is backed up that you have the drivers for the touchpad and the screen and the keyboard because it's not quite as straightforward as a desktop PC so one you can do that and they actually will give you a little bit of boost in performance because you've got rid of all your old crap from your laptop I think it's much easier just to clone the data from the current hard drive to the new SSD then then it's just a straight swap now apart from the SSD itself you'll also need a USB to SATA drive cable the one I have here uses two USBs but usually they only have one and you can find them online for about ten pounds an interchangeable screwdriver kit is a good bet as it's important to get the right head otherwise you risk threading the top of the screw and then getting it out becomes seriously difficult also make sure to earth yourself on something grounded to protect the components inside from static or better yet get yourself an anti-static wrist strap I would definitely recommend backing up all your important documents and media just in case though it is a good idea to delete any unnecessary files or programs and then run Windows is disk cleanup and defragmentation tools so you get the best results from the transfer so then as we're working with a Samsung SSD it makes perfect sense to use Samsung's free data migration tool which is really simple to use but there's loads of free or paid for Drive cloning and backup software out there I've used Mac VM reflect a few times before and the free version has everything you need for migrating to your new disk next make sure your new drive is plugged in via USB and it should appear as the target disk again make sure your cloning to a drive with enough storage to fit the data and partitions from your old Drive on it and make sure to close all the open programs you can as these may develop issues if you clone them while still running hit start and remind it pops up to let you know that any data on the target Drive will be lost once it's transferred everything it'll let you know and then prompt you to turn your machine off and swap the drives alright so now we need to remove the screws from the bottom of the laptop and then either remove the bottom plate or in my case the keyboard deck which is a little more tricky actually once we're in it should be obvious where the hard drive is unscrew any retaining screws and then just slide the drive out remove the drives caddy being careful to note the orientation of the drive and then pop in the SSD and replace all the screws check the smaller power and the larger interface connectors line up and then slide it back in carefully don't force it if it's not going in then gently replace the base or the keyboard in my case and don't forget to reattach any of the cables and now it's time for the moment of truth all being well fingers crossed your machine should then boot up as it always has but much faster and that's it you've upgraded your own laptop and added years to the life of it plus you can always use the old hard drive you've just taken out and use it as an external USB Drive you can buy a three and half inch enclosure from Amazon slot it in and you're good to go so the big question then how much have I improved my old laptop well restart time went from 2 minutes and 49 seconds on the hard drive down to 20 seconds on the SSD that's almost seven and a half times faster opening Chrome took 18 seconds with a hard drive but took just 2.5 seconds with the SSD that's over 6 times faster Adobe Lightroom took twice as long to open on the older hard drive 31 seconds versus 15 seconds and the multiplayer shooter overwash took an absolute age to boo top one minute 20 while the SSD managed it in just 25 seconds if you want to get really nerdy then the sequential data weed speeds went up three times and the sequential right speeds go up over five times which is good for faster file transfers and software installation so all that is great but what makes the biggest difference to overall responsiveness is the 4k random read speeds and here we see by far the biggest increase it's over 50 times quicker to access random data on a disk and this is why a laptop with an SSD feels so nippy to use what a difference this little guys made it to my laptop it's gone from painfully slow to something I could actually use now of course remember that your laptop or computer is only as fast as its slowest components so it still may be held back by the amount of RAM or the process or the graphics so for this particular laptop my next upgrade will probably be to double the RAM to eight gigabytes but for now the a 60 Evo has made a huge difference and really anyone can do this it took me about an hour and a half in total so I would definitely recommend it and really the whole point of this is to save money so you don't have to go out and buy a whole showing your laptop and spend hundred and hundred hundreds of thousands of pounds when you can buy something like this for about a hundred pounds or this wall for about 75 80 pounds and actually as I say transform your old laptop I'm all about reusing reham proving we improving looking as we all work upgrading so hopefully you found this video helpful and if you have actually gone through this process yourself before and you think you've got any tips or maybe I've missed something do let me know in the comments below thank you so much for
