hey guys Anton the tech Japan following Sony's big ps5 reveal and Microsoft earlier deep dive into the Xbox series X I can't wait to get my hands on these next-gen consoles which got me thinking is it possible to build a gaming PC now with specs as close as possible to the new consoles and get that next-gen gaming experience how much would it cost what kind of performance would you get and actually would it be better value to just build your own PC rather than waiting for the PS 5 or series X well here's one I made earlier meets the PS 5 / xbox series X / actually a PC mark 1 and this is my attempt at building a gaming PC that's going to give us as close to a next-gen gaming space as possible using off-the-shelf parts so we've got an 8 core AMD Rison processor 16 gigs of ram an AMD radeon 5700 xt although you could also go with a similarly priced RT x 2070 if you want ray-tracing as well as a ridiculously fast aberrant 1 terabyte PCIe for SSD all wrapped up neatly in this NZXT h1 Mini ITX case which I'm sure you'll agree offers more than a passing resemblance to the series X now actually building the PC was the easy part I mean the beauty of the h1 I have here is that the a i/o caller and the PSU are already installed so all I had to do on one side was install the CPU the motherboard and cooling and then on the other at the graphics card connected by a riser cable so having gone to the trouble of actually building this thing can it give us that PS 5 series X next gen gaming experience today well the answer is no not really actually it's a lot more complicated than you might think honestly this video hasn't really turned out as I'd planned but in a good way I've seen it's taught me a whole lot about how the PC and the consoles differ and also why this generation of consoles is actually poor the most exciting ever it's the first time that they're going to go beyond what you can actually get with a high-end gaming PC now usually these consoles are just playing catch-up before they even launch the thing is the consoles are largely based on PC tech but they're so heavily customised and have so many new developments that making any comparison with the PC is incredibly hard but let's dive a little deeper and while the tech in both consoles are pretty similar to each other yes I know there's some slight difference in teraflops and the SSD read and write speeds but largely they're based on similar specs so how is that different to my PC here well the underlying AMD Zen to processor tech is very similar I've also gone has to say with an eCourse 16 thread chip which is what we're getting in your consoles but they're not off-the-shelf parts and they're gonna be custom made and also probably have lower clock speeds to keep it cool as for the graphics while the consoles GPUs are based on AMD's rDNA to graphics tech which isn't even available for PC yet and this brings ray-tracing and around 50% greater efficiency which is massive so custom processors graphics cards that just aren't available yet and then we've got the RAM both new consoles will offer 16 gigabytes of fast GTA 6 RAM which is shared between the CPU and the GPU while on the PC it's separate and the system Ram is just regular ddr4 the motherboards design and i/o speeds are also different as well and then there's the SSD drive that's faster than pretty much any PCIe for storage available right now I mean we're getting some pretty crazy speeds from this PTA for Sabourin m2 but as line has talked about recently you can't just look at the specs and say the read and write times of this drive and say well that's faster than this therefore this will load games quicker because it's all down to the software optimizations and the fact that consoles have a standard spec and yes well cross-platform games will have to still deal with slow hard drives exclusive next-gen games will be able to fully take advantage and utilize that performance and even design games differently so there's no elevators or you know walkways whatever conversation while all the textures load in anyway will come out to actual performance in a second but let's talk about pricing and also value for money because while these next-gen consoles look super exciting and the performances as I say up there if not beyond high-end gaming PC's right now that's all going to come out of cost and chances are a conservative high-end estimate is probably gonna be between five and six hundred pounds maybe $600 for the PS 5 maybe a little less with a digital only Edition and perhaps Sony Microsoft will sell the consoles at a loss so that you know they actually sell more but then you know when you buy more games and you subscribe to the online services again something you don't have to do with PCs but chances are the high-end we're looking at about 600 pounds from a new console so how does that compare to this guy well all in my build here cost roughly fourteen hundred pounds or around sixteen hundred dollars and I had to build it myself to save money that's around two and a half times more expensive and it's also without a 4k blu-ray drive now to be fair I went with a x5 70 motherboard here although I would recommend if I were to build this again and to you guys to go with the B 550 but a time of filming they just weren't available or at least not many of them in the Mini ITX format so B 550 would save you about 50 pounds and also if you want to bothered about going through a console size PC in this one with an ATX motherboard then you could pull even other-- hundred or 150 so that would bring it down a bit but you're still looking at twice the price of a next-gen console but hold up because saying oh well you know this is twice as much as a PS 5 therefore this is rubbish should no one should buy a PC like this is too simplistic because don't forget a games console is just for gaming you could also use the power of this for photo and video editing web browsing you know working on whatever you need it's not just about gaming so you get a lot more flexibility when you build a PC not only that but you can customize the components yourself maybe you want to hold back on a processor go for a quad core because that's maybe all you need for gaming but then put more into the graphics and also potentially much bigger storage options and of course also upgrade ability you could change something out in six months or a year if you get a good deal on something whereas you're stuck with your console forever and then maybe you have to upgrade to the pro version in two or three years anyway so upgrade ability flexibility and the fact that it's not just about gaming or real selling points and advantages of a PC so there's pros and cons for both but what about actual performance how does my build actually play games I mean that's kind of the point of this video to show you the performance that you'd get if you were to build a next-gen kind of level PC but using parts available today and while it differs from the new consoles for all the reasons I've mentioned it might just give us some indication of a base level of performance we can expect from both new machines so ideally I'm looking to hit 60fps in each game at 4k resolution okay starting off with Call of Duty and jumping into a bit of war zone with ultra settings I actually hit 64 fps at 4k which looks great Rainbow six siege is another title due to launch on next-gen and again at 4k with very high settings ahead respectable eighty-six frames per second Red Dead Redemption to did struggle though I managed just 36 FPS at 4k with high settings and finally in fall night another confirmed launch title for the new consoles 4k is possible but I had to drop to medium high settings to get over 60fps now I promise you I'm not a PC master-race or a console fanboy kind of guy I just love good tech and I like beyond to play as many games as possible and this has been such an interesting video to make on paper the 8 core processor they know they PTI for SSD with crazy high reading rights and the graphics are all a really good system although I think actually I will go with the 2070 role in the rally on 5,700 ext because I did have some overheating issues with it this was a little bit better and also you get ray tracing support with this which you don't currently on the rDNA one architecture again here but of course it will with our DNA - and as I say for the first time I think we're gonna get a new generation of consoles that are beyond what you can currently buy in a high-end gaming PC and just don't think we've seen that before which is why I'm so excited to see these next-gen games particularly exclusives jumping between huge world instantly you just wouldn't be able to do that with a traditional hard drive for example so they will be expensive in console terms but hopefully as videos may be giving you some perspective that versus a PC the PS 5 and Xbox Series X look like a bargain and yes I know you still have to subscribe to the online services games can be more expensive so are you know nuances to it but as a whole in terms of the tech that you're getting it's a bargain but the real question PS 5 or series X which one do things can be better I'm sure we can remain civilized and have a very constructive adult conversation in the comments about this and also what do you think of this bill do you think I've done a reasonable job do you like the h1 and would you have changed out any of the components let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys I really hope you enjoyed the video and if you do want to see more from me for not sick of my face and my voice already then hit a little subscribe button down below ding that bell so you'll be the first to know when I publish a new video and I'll catch you next time right here on the tech yeah you
