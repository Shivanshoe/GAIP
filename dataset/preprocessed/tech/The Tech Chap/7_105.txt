[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how is it that after six months since the ps5 launched it's still almost impossible to find one in stock i've got friends and family asking me most days i would say asking when where can i get one can i borrow yours tom which of course the answer is always no absolutely not get your own in fact since last november sony sold just over 8 million ps5s which is roughly twice as many as the series x now i'm lucky enough to have both and while this could be a whole video by itself between the two most of the time i find myself reaching for the dual sense rather than the xbox controller honestly it all comes down to what exclusive games you prefer and also where your friends play online although actually i think the killer xbox feature is actually game pass and game pass ultimate which gets you ea play as well so you get discounts on the likes of the new mass effect but also to be able to download games like fifa 21 or mlb the show games that i probably wouldn't want to drop 60 or 70 pounds on on the playstation instead i can just download them with the game pass ultimate subscription we do have ps now of course and some free games each month but it takes much longer to access the newer games i could go down a whole rabbit hole of xbox vs playstation which maybe i should do let me know in the comments below if you'd like to see that video and also if you do enjoy this one which fingers crossed you do then a cheeky like and subscribe will be lovely okay back to the ps5 though and i've got a few thoughts firstly i've never actually used the uhd blu-ray player although i am glad i have it because every time i buy a game digitally on the playstation store i cry a little bit inside just because of how bloody expensive everything is so having the option to buy physical games and then either sell them or buy them second hand i think it's really important plus of course if you want to you can watch uhd blu-ray movies secondly the dual sense controller is an absolute standout and probably the biggest reason why i've been playing the ps5 more than the xbox series x the haptic motors and the adaptive triggers are just incredible i mean astro's playroom was a great tech demo of this at launch but recently i found return old and resident evil village use it really well you get a real sense of the weight of weapons as you have to really press down the trigger to fire a shotgun compared to a lighter press with freya pistol there's also built-in speakers and a mic which come in handy every now and then but it's that rumble and adaptive resistance to the triggers that really makes this stand out although i do usually turn all this off when i'm playing something like card or warzone as it probably does slow me down a little bit but with this dual sense controller plus the 3d special sound if you're using a compatible headset really adds to that immersive factor and i'd say gives you more of a next-gen experience than any fancy ray tracing or faster load time does so when you are hours into a gaming session and you want to have food normally i can't be bothered making it so i just order a take out or microwave a pizza or something which is not healthy at all so what i would recommend is trying huel who are very kindly sponsoring today's video so for the past month or so i've been eating this stuff heels hot and savory have genuinely been the best thing ever when you just want a healthy nutritious low calorie meal that only takes a couple of minutes to make i say make but really you just choose your flavor i think my favorite right now is the mexican chili give the bag a good old shake take one or two scoops and it is just 200 calories per scoop by the way and then add 200 ml of boiling water and then leave it for five minutes or you can microwave it sometimes i'll add a touch of pepper and maybe a little lemon juice but bob's your uncle heals your dinner and you can get straight back into your game and it's made from all natural ingredients it's packed with vitamins and protein it's gluten free and i just haven't found an easier healthier or tastier way of preparing a quick meal so why not give hewl a try let it feel your gaming sessions and i'll leave a link below if you want to get started all right back to the games and for number three i said this at launch but the biggest reason to buy a ps5 isn't for the handful of next-gen games it's because it's by far the best way to replay all your old games even without updates pretty much every ps4 game benefits from much faster load times and more stable frame rates but more and more games are being patched for next gen or getting full remasters i'm playing the likes of ghost of tsushima god of war last of us part 2 to just name a few now at 60fps and in most cases also in full 4k well except for the last of us which seems to still run at 1440 but it really does make you want to replay all your old favorites so the point is even if you're thinking well i'd like a ps5 but there aren't a ton of must-have next-gen games yet well if you can buy it simply because it makes a massive difference to playing your old games what are you doing sneaking around back there it's like upgrading your pc and then playing the same games again but this time at a high resolution with higher frame rates up to 120 in some cases like fortnite and rainbow six siege and black ops plus faster load times and often better graphics as well okay number four and speaking of games i must admit until a few weeks ago i did feel like we were in a bit of a dry spell there's only so much miles morales demon souls and warzone i can play although revisiting older games with ps5 updates has filled in the gaps but recently we've had ps5 exclusive returnal which i really didn't think i would like but i keep going back for more and more although the first time i got right to the end it actually crashed which was actually the first and only proper crash i've experienced but that one did definitely sting a little bit so definitely check out eternal but i've also just finished him and three resident evil village which looks absolutely incredible on ps5 particularly if you're lucky enough to have an oled tv as well i feel like this game was built for it with all the shadows and tunnels and then maybe when i have a spare million hours or so i'll probably jump into mass effect legendary edition there are a few other games i've been tempted to buy like mlb the show but as i say i can't justify spending 60 quid on a game i might play a couple times which is why i wish we had something like game pass ultimate on here but i'm also looking forward to ratchet and clank and also ff7 integrate in june so together with a bunch of updated and remastered games there's definitely a good amount to play now on ps5 if you see my hair getting flatter and flatter it's because between doing these bits to camera i'm actually throwing this comforter over my head to record the voiceover because i'm in a new house and it's very echo-y echoey so uh this is how i spend most of my time the things we do for videos but on a serious note so far so good but i do have a couple of issues with the ps5 so far and the big one that stands out for me is storage even from like a couple of weeks in i was maxing out the 667 gigs of internal storage and since then i've just had to delete games pretty much every time i've installed a new one to be fair call of duty used about a quarter of the storage by itself but the problem is you still can't expand the storage sony says by the summer they'll unlock it and we'll have some certified drives but for now there's just not much you can do and compared to the series x which not only has about 130 gigs more to play with internally but the expansion card for that while expensive is just the perfect implementation so i think big points to microsoft for that you can transfer games to external storage although you can't play them from there only ps4 games although i guess that's something and also it means you don't have to re-download the games when you want to use them you can just transfer them back so it's kind of useful but it's not full expandable storage they also get points for quick resume now the ps5 has this app switcher but it's actually kind of useless as you still have to fully reload each game so don't make the mistake i made when i was an hour into a return run and then wanted to play some resident evil so i use the app switcher and then when i went back to eternal it just restarted the whole game very frustrating we need xbox's quick resume here funnily enough i know we're talking about games a lot but i think one of the most underrated features of the ps5 is just how quiet it is coming from the category 5 hurricane that appears for pro wars and even the ps4 to some extent this thing is almost silent i mean you can hear the fans if you put your ear right up to it but when i've been gaming i don't think i've ever once heard it which actually is a real quality of life upgrade now this is quite subjective but i love the look of it as well it still feels like one of those concept art renders that will never really become reality as it's too outlandish but it's real it's here it's in my living room and yes it does still look like a wi-fi router but i really like it plus you can switch out to black plates my friend spawn points modded both his console and controllers to matt black which looks awesome plus of course we can now actually buy a couple more color options for the controller i think i need one of each really i'll tell you what i would love to see though a psvr 2. sony have said they're working on it but there's nothing confirmed yet although i will keep you posted one of my friends asked me the other day they said should i buy a new graphics card for my pc or a ps5 depends what you're doing depends if you've got a great gaming rig as well but i don't think in terms of value for money there's really a better option for gaming out there other than a console whether it's ps5 the series x or even a switch honestly my wife plays a switch 10 times more than i play the ps5 but when you consider that if you can buy a graphics card like a 3060 it'll be about the same price as a ps5 if not a lot more expensive actually so while that is again a completely different video as well the pros and cons of console versus pc given that 499 price tag even though at some point you will need to pay for expendable storage and games are very expensive which is why i would go with the physical drive version so you can then have access to the used games market which would be a lot cheaper so now we're six months in the hype has settled down a little bit but i'd still highly recommend buying a ps5 if you can the only couple of issues are the storage the lack of good expandable storage right now also having an xbox with me here i kind of do miss having well explainable storage uh but also the quick resume and of course you can buy much more easily a series x if you want to so that's all well and good but i suspect a lot of you are just like well i don't know tom great good for you but i still can't buy one anywhere and that is the biggest frustration the combination of the global chip demand and just the well unprecedented demand for the ps5 itself is like a perfect storm so it's a tricky time for any gamer out there but if you can i would definitely recommend it and if you are one of the lucky eight million or so to already have one then let me know what you're playing in the comments below and also what game you're most looking forward to and also don't forget to check out huel i've left a link in the description below give it a try i think they're great but see what you think and report back just watching
