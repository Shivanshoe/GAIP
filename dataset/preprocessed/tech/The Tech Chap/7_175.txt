oh no oh this is probably going to be the most stupid video i've ever made this is a rolls royce ghost i have it for about four days and it's a massive privilege to be able to drive it but unfortunately in england um we're actually under lockdown my cameraman pete here who's shooting this on the iphone 12 pro max is wearing a mask we're being socially distant but there's nowhere to go in it obviously i'm not a car reviewer so that begged the question what am i even going to do with the rolls-royce ghost for a long weekend but then it hit me at the same time i had the delivery of uh of this guy ps5 so um could i hook a ps5 up to a rolls-royce ghost because obviously this is supposed to be one of the most luxurious cars you can buy it's like a living room on wheels i can't go anywhere in it so perhaps i can use the uh tv in the rear seat hook it up hdmi it and play some ps5 in the world voice ghost we've not tried this yet i have no idea if it's even gonna work apologies if you are thinking what a stupid idea for a video but i thought it could be a bit of fun so the first thing is obviously power um i've bought this 300 watt bestek power inverter plugs into the 12 watt 12 volt sorry charger in the front of the car so let's just do that first well i'm kind of ignoring this whole beautiful interior here but in here uh nothing particularly special but it does have the 12 volt charger and you can see here this is just the usual uk three pin plug jobby so that should should work controller hdmi cable and i think that's everything back in the ghost this is where you'd uh want to spend most of your time i think being chauffeured that's pretty classy so in here if i press this button everything's got buttons to do everything not crush my leg we've got this rear infotainment screen there's another one uh behind here and so i'm hoping we can play the playstation 5 on here just take a second look at this car we've got this starlight headliner we've got leds uh in the roof you can see little shooting stars sometimes and actually if you look at the front where you can see in the inlay the ghost you've got little leds behind the dash it's an absolutely stunning car so ps5 is here first thing let's uh hook up the hdmi and i bet i'm gonna bet that even in a 370 000 pound car but it doesn't support hdmi 2.1 i also don't think this is gonna be a 4k hdr display either and i'm a little bit worried this inverter should work but i've not hooked up a games console to a car before this way so i have actually stashed an xbox one x if i can get pete's legs out of the way an xbox one x down here this does not come with a car uh i'm not saying that this is uh i'm not saying i'll be happy if it got destroyed but um certainly less of an issue than my review sample of the ps5 so it actually uses the same the same power cable actually so let's plug that in first i can hear some buzzing there's buzzing from somewhere so that makes me think this is a good idea to test it first let's plug in the hdmi what do we think is this is this gonna work that's a good start nothing's on fire look at that xbox one in a rolls-royce ghost that's a good start so ps5 let's put it on my lap for a minute this isn't the best setup but i can still hear some that doesn't sound too good oh if this if i blow up this ps5 in this way no it's not i'm not gonna have any sympathy i'm like you won't be able to leave this one down here we go okay so um this is probably not the healthiest way of holding it but let's just plonk it on my leg this is such a portable travel size console yes look at that i think if guinness world's records are watching this is probably the first time anyone's played a ps5 in a rolls royce ghost so i will uh i'll put my address below if you want to send me the plaque oh oh no oh that light is gone it was all going so well we got it working turning off again is the uh the trick to everything in tech we're still not getting any power through this because this this can give me 300 watts i think the ps5 can take about it takes about 150 180 or so so there's no question with that you saw it come on it did work okay we'll come back i am a little bit concerned something bad has happened so uh to troubleshoot let's um plug the ps5 in well at least eliminate that we haven't destroyed that that's my main concern if nothing turns on i think we're a bit screwed okay okay it's gonna it will never hurt you again okay plan b the um inverter didn't work i tried it in my fiesta and it also didn't work so something's gone wrong there the next best thing is to use a power adapter an extension lead from my dad's house garage and uh try it this way when you think of rolls royce you think of uh elegance and refinement not this probably excellent good start well i said that before so this did not work i'm not saying it wouldn't ever work but that particular model did not and it now seems to not work with anything all right so it works but let's see what video options we have so let's jump into the settings screen and video output info 720p great hdr not supported so maybe not the best setup for um a playstation 5 720p sdr that's a little bit sad of course i knew that would be the case it's just a tv in the back but you know it's almost half a million dollar car you could have a tp screen it works it finally works not the best setup in the world but i guess if you're rich enough to buy a rolls royce ghost maybe you're rich enough to have someone follow you with a generator or something but oh this is fun huge thanks to pete for filming this and he also pointed out that the ps5 matches the interior of the car but the sound quality is phenomenal and because it's all optimized for the space of this car you're getting like a full surround sound experience and also because the screen is quite small and i'm sitting quite close 720p isn't the end of the world it's not ideal but it's actually still quite sharp i like this this is this is a good setup and then imagine you know someone's driving you you and you're going to your business meeting and you want to get a quick game of miles morales in before your big ceo meeting and you can probably afford a better inverter so you don't have to stay tethered to your house ps5 and rolls royce nobody asked for it but there you go [Music] what do you think this is insane [Music] just listen to it [Music] [Music] i think pete could get used to this the only way maybe we could improve this setup is with a better screen uh maybe a 1080p hdr one would be nice or even just buying a second ps5 because don't forget while we've got one screen here there's another one behind the other passenger seat so you can actually have some co-op gaming in the back of a rolls royce just maybe don't use an inverter and maybe bring a house with you or a generator but a huge thank you to rolls royce for sending the ghost over for me to quite literally have a play with this has been such a fun video we got there in the end even if we had to resort to plan b so what do you think ps5 in a rolls-royce would you get one if you want to buy one uh click the link below i'm joking that'd be ridiculous can you imagine the affiliate commission on a rolls royce thank you so much for watching guys don't forget to hit that subscribe button if you enjoyed this video and all that's left to do i think is actually play some more spider-man oh wait how am i gonna do this you regretting this video no everything's fine
