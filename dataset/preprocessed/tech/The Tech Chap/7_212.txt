hey guys i'm tom of techchap and i finally get to share with you my full review of the galaxy note 20 ultra but i want to do something a little bit different rather than me just scripting this whole thing and waffling on for 10 minutes i actually want to answer your questions the ones that you posted on my previous videos on my instagram posts i'm at the tech chat if you don't already follow me to give you hopefully some real world helpful advice and answers about note 20 ultra and at the end we'll sum up about whether you should actually buy this thing so let's jump right in and imad says on popular opinion the protruding camera bump actually looks nice well actually nearly 360 people liked that question or like comment so maybe it's not an unpopular opinion that people like this camera bump personally i actually love the look of this thing but of course once you put a case on it it doesn't really matter anyway and i think we can almost all agree it looks a lot better and more premium than the s20 ultra particularly in these new colors john camacho clearly disagrees with me saying mystic black is a little bit boring well for me i think mystic bronze looks best and then the white and then the black but to be honest all three colors of the note 20 ultra look way better than the british summer gray we get on the s20 ultra js says you kept the screen protector on samsung encourages you to take it off for the instagram fingerprint reader i don't know if that's true i've not actually heard that um maybe it is slightly more reliable without the screen protector but i prefer to keep it on although the funny thing is i only have a big scratch in the screen protector on the note 20 ultra which i can't unsee now which is really frustrating because actually this is the first phone that comes with gorilla glass 7 or glitter glass victors and they say it's actually two times more scratch resistant than the previous gen and since i've already got a scratch on the protector let's just peel it right off and then hopefully when i come back to this in my long term review we'll see how gorilla glass victor's fares as for the fingerprint reader i've not really had any issues with using it with the screen protector i'll have to see if that makes a difference now what i would suggest though is actually registering the same finger twice it makes it a little bit faster and more reliable although most of the time i tend to rely on face unlocking unless i'm out about wearing a mask in which case i go back to the fingerprint drive club asks is it a little bit wider than note 10 plus well here they are side by side and i'll throw in the s20 ultra for good measure and the note 20 ultra is actually the exact same width as the note 10 plus but about two millimeters taller and 0.2 millimeters thicker you can also see they've slightly shrunk the whole punch and ever so slightly trimmed the bezels particularly the bottom one i never got the too big for one-handed use the note is designed for two hands hence the pen says whether fox well yeah i think you're absolutely right i mean the note is the original phablet but i would say the more squared off corners does make it feel bigger to hold than the s20 ultra or the oneplus 8 pro and it's not quite as comfortable in my opinion but yes with the s pen especially it's absolutely a two-handed phone although there is a one-handed mode if you prefer a comparison with the xperia 1 mark ii could be intriguing well nigel just for you here is one i made earlier so here's a side by side with the mark ii versus the note 20 ultra i must admit i really do like the taller design of the xperia although you can see the bezels are a little bit chunkier it is more comfortable to hold in the notes but of course you are getting a smaller screen which design do you guys prefer does it support e sims yes it does we do get e sim support with this and with the ultra model we're getting a hybrid dual sim so you can actually put two sim cards in here it supports dual sim and also you've got micro sd card support with the ultra model so you can actually top this up with an additional one terabyte of micro sd storage for a maximum potential of 1.5 terabytes if you just want to go crazy with storage looks like a nice phone but i don't use the s pen i've already got the s20 plus and really enjoy it says robert well i think that's one of the big questions actually if you're not fussed on the s pen is the note still worth buying well in my opinion yes i think it is i never think i'm going to use the s pen that much but when i have it i find myself taking little notes recording video and taking screenshots using the pen as a remote shut up signing documents actually comes up a lot and from a hardware perspective it's more responsive than before and they've also added new air actions which well i can't really be bothered with it still feels pretty gimmicky but aside from the smaller battery which we'll come back to in a second the note is still definitely worth considering whether you care about the s pen or not i saw another review where the regular note 20 screen seemed better than the ultra says dark man's well first of all how dare you watch other reviews you should only be watching my videos but in all seriousness samsung's only sent out the ultra for review i haven't had more than a couple of hours with the standard notes but on paper at least the ultra should be a lot better it's brighter 1500 nits versus 1000 we get quad hd and 120 hertz options whereas the regular note is stuck at full hd plus 60 hertz and while they do use slightly different screens they're both amoled but really the ultra should be a lot better do they have 120 hertz in quad hd now well i'm sure most of you guys know the answers to that already but sadly no like the s20 series it's still quad hd plus at 60 hertz or full hd plus at 120. the big difference this time though is we get adaptive refresh you can't really tell but it slows down based on what you're doing to save battery life okay this is the big question snapdragon versus xnos comparison as you guys know because i don't stop talking about it in some regions in the uk and europe we get samsung's own exynos 990 whereas in north america and elsewhere they get the fancy shiny new snapdragon 865 plus there was already a disparity between the two chips even on the s20 range but now the snapdragon model gets the even faster 865 plus the disparity between the two phones is on paper at least even greater so is it actually a big deal well i asked my good friends michael josh from gadget match and edibong from bought at work for the results from their snapdragon models and starting with geekbench five cpu test the a65 plus is six percent faster than a single core and a whopping 25 percent faster in multi-core and then in the 3dmark slingshot graphics benchmark again we're looking at a hefty 20 boost for the snapdragon so i'm still going to try and get an actual qualcomm model here in the uk so i can do a proper side-by-side test and run some frame rate tests and games but to see 15 20 30 improvements on the north american model versus this uk one with the exynos chip it is very frustrating it does feel like we're being shortchanged maybe that's why samsung are actually putting 256 gigs of storage in the base model here in the uk uh whereas in the us it's 128 maybe they feel sorry for us so why is this the case well no one really knows for sure it could be you know profit margins it could be patent issues you could argue that it actually is good to see some proper competition to qualcomm and if it was just a couple of percent difference between them then i wouldn't have a problem or you know if they even discounted the european model but to see such a difference in performance and no real price or marketing change yeah that feels like we're getting a bad deal here gabrielle asks is there any major difference in performance versus last year's note 10 plus well i just so happen to have one right here so let's put it to the test and in geekbench 5 the newer exynos is 13 faster in single core and nine percent faster in multi-core and then in the opencl graphics test it's just a four and a half percent boost so in terms of the exynos models the note 20 ultra is on average eight percent faster than the note 10 plus but you'd struggle to really tell a difference in real life again it's that 120 hertz refresh that makes a big difference now this is a good question does anyone actually play mobile games seriously that require the fastest processor on the market well i think the answer is most people don't but if you're paying over a grand for a phone you want it to be future proof and handle new games and apps coming out over the next two or three years comfortably also high 90 and 120 hertz refresh games are becoming more common so to get those high frame rates with the max graphics settings does usually require the best chips but if you're not bothered about gaming the other advantage is you usually get the best isps or image signal processors so generally camera performance is also better i can't find a single feature or benefit that makes this a compelling purchase says zachary well fair enough although we haven't got to the cameras yet but how about playing say forza horizon 4 on the note 20 ultra with xbox game pass and then using dex to wirelessly cast it to your tv i'd say that's pretty noteworthy so this is still in beta right now and it's not exclusive to the note but you can connect say a wireless xbox controller to your phone sign up to game pass and then use the note as a makeshift games console it's definitely playable on the phone with my 17 megabit connection although it's still not as responsive as playing on a console or pc natively in my opinion and while then casting it to my lg tv with dex does work and it's pretty cool it's not really playable it's too laggy and there's tons of compression unfortunately it could improve with updates it's still in beta of course and if you have a hundred plus meg connection it might be more reliable gaming aside though dex is actually a pretty nifty feature and for the first time it is completely wireless so you can cast your phone to your tv and then use it like a desktop pc which is pretty handy if you're a big multitasker or power user alright so let's move on to the camera and the first question comes from the mr airplane who says is the camera improved compared to the s20 ultra and does it also have autofocus problems well let's start with the focusing issue and if we do a little side by side test you can see the note 20 ultra with its new hybrid laser autofocus is faster and smoother than the s20 ultra now this is my neighbor's cat felix who moves every time i try to take his photo yet in almost every one despite his best efforts the photos are clear and in focus with a note it's impressive stuff actually and i think this should be the new standard camera benchmark the fast moving felix test so the camera on the note 20 ultra is essentially a tweaked version of the s20 ultra setup with an ultra wide main and telephoto lens and other than the new laser autofocus the main difference is we're getting a five times optical zoom versus four times on the s20 and the space zoom maxes out at 50 times instead of slightly ridiculous a hundred times so if we put the note side by side with the s20 starting with the ultra wide and straight away you can see the note handles the dynamic range a bit better there's slightly more detail on the clouds and the hedge in the foreground is brighter with more detail on the note switching to the main lens both of which are 108 megapixels which then use pixel binning so you end up with 12 megapixel photos and it's a similar story with the less contrasty more evenly exposed look on the note then we have the four times optical on the s20 ultra and the five times optical on the note and then moving up to a 10 times zoom you can see the note is looking sharper but then the next zoom up is 30 times on the s20 and 20 times on the note as you can see here but if we crop in on the note to match them up you can see the note is much sharper more detailed it really is a big improvement and then moving up to 50 times zoom which is where the note maxes out and while the difference is less noticeable the note is still more detailed if you look closely particularly around the stone cutouts in the window and then finally the 100 times zoom on the s20 which as i say we don't have the option for on the note but i've cropped to match while neither look great there's definitely more definition in the notes photo so even though it's only a bump from four to five times optical zoom all the way up to 50 times and then cropping beyond that it has made a noticeable difference to quality so here's a few more shots side by side to give you an idea of how it compares to the s20 ultra and while there's not a night and day difference between them in tricky lighting you can really see how the note offers better dynamic range looking at the back wall you can easily make out more detail on the wallpaper and it's more evenly exposed around the candles low light shots seem better as well this is just a regular photo without night mode and already the note is a good deal brighter but then switching to night mode and while the s20 catches up the note is still lighter the note can look a little washed out sometimes in night mode but it is brighter and still sharper than the s20 switching round to the selfie camera again in low light and they both look pretty rough but night mode selfies do make a big difference both are much sharper but the note still looks more natural now in good light they both take a great selfie and then of course you also have live focus aka portrait selfies there is definitely a pattern though of the note giving us brighter slightly less contrasty shots on the s20 subjectively i much prefer it but overall especially when it comes to focus speed zooming in and dynamic range the note is clearly better than the s20 ultra i will also be posting a full iphone 11 pro versus note 20 ultra camera comparison the next couple of days so make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss that next question and why would i use pro video well samsung's added a whole host of new pro video options so if you know what you're doing and maybe if you also pop it on a gimbal as well you can shoot much more professional video so putting it to the test and here's a few shots i took with it the other day this is in full 8k and also the most cinematic 21x9 aspect ratio this footage is straight out of the phone no edits or anything while we're talking about the camera they've also expanded the single take mode so you can now adjust uh between five and 15 second shots also in the camera app for some reason samsung hides most of the modes under the more tab but you can drag and drop them onto the main carousel so it's quicker to access also you can switch to shoot in full 108 megapixel mode if you're on the highest resolution and finally i really like when you're taking selfies you can actually switch to the wider field of view or if it detects more than one person it changes to the wider mode automatically so you get more in the frame so far so good then but how good is the battery life well by the end of a normal day and i say normal in the loosest sense of the term because it's still a crazy world i'm not exactly going to trade shows and really pushing this but i tend to end up with about 25 of my battery left but as a test on the 12th of august i didn't top it up overnight and it survived up until almost 1pm the next day and between the two days i got 4 hours and 36 minutes of screen on time and then it takes about an hour and 10 to fully charge which is pretty quick considering it's a 25 watt charger but how does it compare to the snapdragon version well again i don't have it physically here but michael from gadget's match again saved the day by sending his snapdragon battery usage over which shows 5 hours 22 and 5 hours 36 of screen on time now of course there's lots of variables and how we use the phone will be different but on average his last 22 percent longer than mine which is pretty significant alex asks how's the battery compared to the s20 ultra because obviously this has a 5 000 milliamp hour cell this is 4500 well in my experience it's actually pretty neck and neck after one hour of youtube and then one hour of call of duty both phones were down to 78 so the adaptive refresh screen really does seem to offset the 500 million power smaller battery so even though we're looking at similar battery life on this to this it's still not fantastic particularly this exhaust model and to see you know 20 longer battery life on the snapdragon version is actually a similar difference as well what we're seeing in terms of performance between the two chips so again it feels like we're being shortchanged with this uk european model i mean it'll still get you to the end of the day and you know halfway through the next day if you ration it a little bit so it's not terrible but not great not great or terrible the big question from henry hall is the note 20 ultra worth the switch well it all comes down to what your current phone is if you've still got a note 10 plus then no i don't think it's worth upgrading at all 120 hertz screen is nice and you know it's maybe like eight or nine percent faster but it's not significant so stick with note 10 plus not worth the upgrade versus the s20 ultra well if you already own one of these it's definitely not worth upgrading but if you are thinking about buying one or the other i would definitely go with a note firstly i think it looks a lot better although it's not quite as comfortable to hold i do still prefer the rounded corners of this but we are getting an improved camera much faster focusing and better zoom and of course we also have the s pen and even if you're not going to use it that much you may as well so i think across the board uh i would definitely go to the note 20 ultra and also for some reason on samsung's website this is actually 20 pounds cheaper than the s20 ultra so i'm not sure why anyone would actually want to go for the s20 ultra now that this is out this is the clear uh winner but overall as much as they have ranted about the exynos problem well firstly that's not an issue for anyone living in north america so you know lucky you but generally it's not the end of the world and this is still i think probably the best all-round android phone you can buy you know 5g dual sim stereo speakers a super bright screen that looks beautiful the s pen incredible and also very versatile camera setup it really is a fantastic phone it is expensive of course and there are other great options out there like the you know s20 plus maybe or the oneplus 8 pro but despite its flaws i still think this probably is the best android phone you can buy right now it is just a shame about the xnos what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy the note 20 ultra or maybe even the standard note 20 let me know in the comments below and also if you haven't already hit that subscribe button for my camera comparison coming soon and also help me get to that one million subscriber
