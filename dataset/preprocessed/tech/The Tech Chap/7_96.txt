all right let's do this hey guys i'm tummy techchap and this is the new sony xperia one mark three now i love reviewing these sony phones i think they're some of the most uh innovative and actually interesting phones to talk about but every year i get told off because apparently i'm just not using it properly these past xperia reviews have been some of my most disliked videos which is a real shame because my job is to you know share my experience of a product and then hopefully help you make a buying decision but xperia after experia when i criticize it when i say the camera's not quite up to snuff i just sort of get told off that i'm not using it properly i need to be using pro mode and tinker with all the settings all the time to get the most out of it and i'm just being a bit well i think there's only one word to describe it and it's at the top right there if it'll focus i'm just being a bit basic and it's an enthusiast phone a professional's phone and in some ways i would describe this as maybe like the thinking man's galaxy s21 ultra but just because this is considered a more advanced user's phone doesn't automatically make it the best or more importantly good value because the first thing you should know about the mark iii is that it costs 1200 pounds that's the same as the galaxy s21 ultra sony is still pitching this as a proper but clenchingly expensive flagship phone and to be fair there's pretty good reason for that price we have all the latest and greatest specs including 12 gigs of ram and a snapdragon triple eight but the highlights really are this stunning 4k 21x9 oled screen that's now 120 hertz no one else has anything like this there's also this triple well actually quad camera setup with a brand spanking new variable telephoto lens so the glass physically moves inside to give you both a 70 and a 105 mil focal length which is seriously impressive engineering and again no one else is doing this and i could absolutely see this becoming a new kind of standard for phone cameras instead of just packing in more and more lenses we also get the latest guerilla glass victus to protect the screen as well as this gorgeous frosted glass soft touch finish on the back the power button continues to double as a very reliable fingerprint reader although bizarrely there's still no face unlock option here but there's a plethora of other extras that are all too rare on flagship phones these days like micro sd card support a headphone jack a physical camera shutter button an led notification light custom buttons great sounding stereo speakers that are actually 50 louder than before along with best-in-class haptics and there's not a notch or hole punch in sight so there's genuinely a lot to love about the mark iii and it kind of goes to show that when other brands say oh well we can't find room for a micro sd or headphone jack well sony's done it why can't you but for me the cherry on top is the lovely software which feels like stock android 11 with a thin sunny ui on top that adds about a billion features which you can either leave alone or really dive into and tinker with and this taller screen is great for apps that use feeds or if you're reading online because you can basically have more on the screen at once and if you double tap the edge here you bring up sidesense for some quick app shortcuts you've also got multi window for split screening which is actually somewhat usable on a screen like this especially in landscape mode so minimal blow wear lots of handy extras it's just great to use and actually i haven't experienced that slow auto rotate that marquez talked about in his review it seems pretty normal on my phone you will however struggle to find the regular android camera app because it's actually been subsumed entirely by sony's photo pro app as you can see here which by default takes you into basic mode but you can switch to more advanced modes if you want more fine control so for some people this will be the absolute dream phone i mean 4k ultra wide fantastic speakers so it's great for watching movies on more camera options than you could shake a stick at and it's all in this beautiful thin and light extra long slab of glass and for me i actually love this form factor i think a little bit narrower but taller design while obviously you have to do some finger gymnastics to reach the top although there is a one-handed mode i think this is quite a bit more comfortable than a massive s21 ultra so it's a genuinely lovely phone but i wouldn't buy one and that's for a couple of reasons firstly the battery life is very average the 4500 milliamp cell is a decent size given the form factor of the phone but it's the cost of having a 4k 120 hertz screen and so i'm only getting about five and a half hours of screen on time with this and i'm down to about 10 by 11 pm at night although we do now have faster 30 watt charging plus wireless and reverse wireless charging but what really bothers me about this is how in every other regard it's kind of like you know the advanced user's phone they assume you know what you're doing that's why there's so much uh fine control over the camera and the display so why is it that we can't change the resolution it is stuck at 4k which means it's always lovely and crisp and sharp but it has such an impact on your battery life and for me when i'm you know out and about and maybe i don't have access to a charger i would love the ability to drop this down to 1080p which is still pretty reasonable on a six and a half inch phone but you don't have that and also with the refresh rate obviously you can choose between 60 and 120 but it's not dynamic there's no auto mode there's no 90 hertz option it's just kind of strange how in every other aspect you can really you know have that fine control but not when it comes to that 4k resolution which honestly i just don't think you need on a phone obviously it is quite satisfying to jump into the youtube app and then select 4k and know that you're watching a 4k video back natively but unless you're really bringing up close to your eyes you're not going to notice that much difference and the cynical side of me just thinks that it's partly marketing because of course the sony bravia tv side of things they just want everything 4k and so as gorgeously sharp as this screen is i just don't think that 4k res is really worth the impact on battery life at least in my opinion also the screen just doesn't get bright enough next to something like the s21 ultra or the oppo f5 x3 pro the sub 700 nit peak hdr brightness just doesn't pop and it's a little bit harder to use in daylight and then there's the camera and this is where maybe i should tread a little bit more lightly because sony's pedigree is best in class i use the fantastic a7s iii as my video camera i know how good the alpha range and sony's optics are i also know how innovative this variable telephoto lens is and i also very much appreciate that sony's processing is geared toward offering the most natural and most realistic photos and we're getting top-notch autofocus and 20 fps burst mode options plus i love the fact that a half press of the shutter button focuses with the full press taking the shot it's really satisfying and most of the time the camera shines well at least in good light [Music] but of course photography is a beautifully subjective art form and while i don't personally love samsung's overly vivid and sharpened photos i do appreciate the wider dynamic range we get so the detail in the darker and brighter areas of the shot [Music] sony zoom also maxes out at a respectable 4.4 times but it can't compete with the three times and 10 times optical lenses on the s21 ultra to its credit the shutter speed on this is insanely quick so we can keep up with fast moving subjects and in terms of selfies well even the most hardcore xperia photography enthusiast i'm sure occasionally takes a selfie or two but side by side points to gryffindor i mean samsung but it's in low light where the xperia really does start to struggle sony says they don't need a dedicated night mode because it looks too fake on most phones but it just can't keep up now i appreciate that a big selling point of this is that you do have that fine control over the camera settings and you do but that doesn't necessarily always mean you're going to get a better shot and actually one of the things that i thought was really interesting mentioned by mr mobile and david cogan in his review is that obviously we have a fixed aperture with these phone cameras only the uh galaxy s9 had that variable aperture which was pretty cool but then went away so really there's only so much you can do with the iso and shutter speed video quality is solid although it's a bit of a shame there's no 8k option and also selfie video tops out at 1080p but that's not really a big deal overall it looks good but it's nothing really to write home about so there's an awful lot of flexibility with the camera and i'm very impressed with the engineering of that telephoto lens but where it counts the end result i just don't think it's good enough although again that is just my opinion [Music] i was listening to mkbhd's podcast a couple days ago and my good friend david immel was on it talking about the sony mach3 and he described it in so many words as the quintessential android subreddit user's phone which i thought was pretty funny because i know i'm going to get some comments for this but there does seem to be an air of superiority perhaps in the xperia fanbase and maybe that's fair enough because this is more of an enthusiast advanced user's phone but as i said at the beginning of the video that doesn't automatically make it the best phone and if i was going to go out and spend like 1100 pounds over a grand on a phone personally i would probably go with the s21 ultra but then again maybe i'm just a bit basic but anyway i hope this video was useful and i do welcome your feedback and your criticism uh you know let me know what you make of this in the comments below do you agree with me do you think i couldn't be more wrong and if you haven't raged quit out of this video then why not give me a cheeky sub and a thumbs up and i will see you next time right here on the tech chat thanks for watching
