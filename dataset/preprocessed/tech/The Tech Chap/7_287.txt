[Music] hey guys Anton a tech job and I'm with Philips hue at CES 2020 stunning far too close to this TV but I'm here to show off this little guy it's the philips hue play hdmi sync box you may remember that I made a video about this a few months ago when they first unveiled it in berliner the ephah tech show but I'm back here in Las Vegas because it made a few updates tinkling voice support from Alexa the Google assistant and Siri as well as support for infrared remote so you can actually control the lighting with your remote control for your TV but as well as that I got loads of questions at the end of my last video so of asking about HDMI pass-through how does HDR work can I use this with a sound bar and also like what's the best setup for this system so that's what I'm here to show you so as you can see from the lights on my face they're actually reacting to what's on screen relative to their location in the room which I set up through an entertainment area in the app and it all works because of this little guy that Philips you play HDMI sync box so in this setup we've got the Xbox 1s we've got an Apple TV all plugged in to the box at the back via HDMI and then we've got one output to the TV and that output then decodes the lighting from what's on the TV and then does some fancy technical wizardry so that the lights that you've placed a random room then know what's happening around the screen so if you've got green areas at the top left then the lights on the left or the top will be green now if you already have for the two lights then you're probably familiar with the hue app we can adjust the lighting the brightness create entertainment areas all that good stuff done things aren't off this is so much fun just to play around with different modes but for the sink box the first thing you do is make an entertainment area I've already got one set up here and you can see I've got the lights around the room and I've adjusted this so that there relative to the sofa and the TV I've got a couple of sine lights I've got these LED strips I've got this little lamp at the back here and actually with the latest update to the app you can adjust where the light is in the room so you can do TV height ceiling height ground height so you get a much more so of three-dimensional lighting space around you so once you created your entertainment area you then jump to the new hue sync app and from here you can adjust all the sync box settings so whether you're playing a game listening to music watching video and whether you want something like a bit of wave in your house go for extreme intensity or you're just having a quiet movie night and you want to slightly more subtle change to the lighting and then we've also got the brightness so you can really customize it to how you want and down here you can see we've got the Apple TV synching at the moment and if I just tap that we can then switch it to the Xbox or any of the four HDMI inputs so since my last video a software update has added voice and also the infrared support on the remote somebody can do things like okay google turn on sync box sure turning the sync box on you can also change between what the input is it will do automatically when you change the input on the TV but you could do things like hey Google changed sync box to Xbox it's pretty cool and you can actually customize the name of the input you're using so that could be the Apple TV it could be your sky TV box or the Xbox or Playstation so the other big update is the fact that I can now use the TV remote to actually control the light syncing with the TV so I've programmed this the red button here so if I press that it should start the sync as you can see there so then as I go around Apple TV the lighting reflects what's on the screen I can impress that again if I want to turn it off and you can actually program the remote to change the import change the lighting settings or just turn it on and off all right so now let me answer a few questions you guys had after my last video number one you can use sound bars and audio receivers with this there's three options really but I think the best one is to plug everything including the sound bar into the sync box and then output to the TV or you can plug your devices into the sync box plug that into the sound bar and then output to the TV or finally plug everything except the sound bar into the sync box then separately connect your sambhar to the TV via its arc HDMI port number two and the HDMI spec is listed as 2.0 B so it can output 4k but it's limited to 60 Hertz and only supports HD of 10 so if you're watching a movie with Dolby vision or HDR 10 plus the lights won't sync correctly although we may see an update in the future to fix this number three and this was probably the most asked question but unfortunately no the lights won't sync with the content that's played through the apps on your Smart TV it has to come from an external source like a Roku fire TV and video shield games console or set-top box number four and the sync box uses same power adapter as the flips you play bar lights so you could actually plug in to play bars into the sync boxes power adapter so that you're only using one outlet at the wall okay number five and you can use any number of Ferb's you color lights in your entertainment area I'd recommend at least two though but ideally four or five to get the most immersive experience of course you don't have to buy it all at once though you can keep adding new ones over time and finally remember they do keep updating the software as you've seen with the voice and ir support so this will get better and have more features at it over time so is it all worth it well for me I think it is I probably wouldn't use it when just watching TV but if I'm settling down to watch a movie or firing up the Xbox or Playstation for a gaming session it really does add an extra level of immersion although I tend to keep it on subtle or moderate intensity so it's not too distracting so that's just a quick look at the new Philips you played HDMI sync box it's gonna be available for 239 euros it's out now in some regions of Europe and the UK and also the US will be coming to more places very soon I'll update the description below when it's available and where you can buy it and if you have
