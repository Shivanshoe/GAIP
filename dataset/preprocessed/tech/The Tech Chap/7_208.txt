hey guys i'm tom of techchap and nvidia have just shaken up the pc gaming world you've probably heard it but they've just announced the new rtx 3000 series of graphics cards i don't have them with me right now full tests and reviews and buying guides are coming soon but for this video let's look at what's new and if they are actually worth getting excited about so based on nvidia's super fancy new ampere architecture we're getting three new graphics cards to start at the top we have the ludicrously over the top rtx 3090 which is just an absolute beast in terms of size performance and of course price starting at 1500 they were even calling it the bf gpu which probably doesn't stand for a big graphics processing unit but who knows but the 1390 gets a whopping 24 gigs of gddr6 memory a three slot design and nvidia says it's up to 50 faster than the current titan rtx this really is the money no object i want to play 8k and show off kind of card but i think for most of us it's gonna be the new rtx 3080 that's the more realistic flagship firstly it's not as bloody huge as the 3090 so you'll probably be able to fit this in a mini rtx pc as well but it's still incredibly fast according to nvidia the 3080 will offer up to two times the performance of the current rtx 2080. obviously i have to test this myself but if these claims were even close to being true this is a proper generational shift in graphics performance and not only that but it's going to cost the same as the current 2080 at around 700 so if you have just bought a 2080 then maybe have a look for that receipt but this card is aimed at high refresh 1440p or even 4k 60 and finally we have the rtx 3070 this is probably going to be the most popular card as it costs 500 and the nvidia save will give you about the same performance as the current 2080 ti which is a 1200 card and is aimed at high refresh 1080p or even maybe 1440p 120 monitors so first impressions this is pretty crazy actually i mean nvidia are talking about up to double the performance and almost double the power efficiency over previous touring cars and i know a lot of you guys have been holding out to see what these new cars would be like i even made a video a couple of months ago saying don't buy a new graphics card and i think well at least first impressions looking at the specs and what i'm video claiming it was definitely worth the wait and also i think a lot of people are still holding out with pascal cards you know like 1070s 1080s 80 tis because well quite rightly actually the 20 series just didn't seem like a proper upgrade but with the 3000 series this could be the perfect time to upgrade but what exactly makes these new cards so much better well before we even talk about the specs the design of these new founders cards which is pretty much what we expected from the leaks is a huge upgrade the new fan design pulls in cold air from the bottom passes through the pcb and then pushes the hot air out the top so we get 55 better airflow and nvidia say the 3080 is actually three times quieter and also 20 degrees cooler than the turing design on the 2080 although that's not to say that these new cars will be 20 degrees cooler in real life really i think it's just going to give nvidia more headroom to get extra performance out of them because really they're just talking about relative thermal design between the different architectures the different designs so i wouldn't expect the 3080 to be necessarily 20 degrees cooler than my 2080 but uh that's something obviously people have to test in real life and also then see how they overclock that's gonna be pretty interesting as well so it's the combination of the better cooling the extra power draw and of course the new ampere architecture that's giving us this huge leap in performance now i don't want to bore you to death with all the ampere details in this video although do let me know if you guys would like to see a deep dive about it but these new cards are based on a new eight nanometer process which is down from 14 on touring so they can cram in more transistors and it's much more efficient plus the new cars use pcie 4 although you'll need a motherboard that supports it to get the full benefit and all new faster gddr6 x memory on the 390 and 3080 and slightly slower but still improved gdg6 memory on the 30-70 so nvidia are throwing out some pretty wild performance claims but they do also say that the biggest boost to performance will be in games that are optimized for ray tracing in dlss so a big question will be what kind of performance increase are we going to see with you know traditional rasterized games again that's something i'll test myself in my full review having said that i think we'll see ray tracing and the ai upscaling with dlss become much more widespread with the likes of cyberpunk fortnite dying like 2 and the new call of duty cold war fully supporting rtx and also given how genuinely incredible dlss 2 can be i made a video recently that showed how it can often double your performance i'm really excited for what these cars will be able to do with this tech speaking of performance my friends over at digital foundry got a bit of a cheeky exclusive i'm definitely not jealous at all so i'd recommend checking out their video after this for more details another big upgrade which nvidia didn't really spend that much time on is that these new cards will come with an hdmi 2.1 port this is actually a really big deal as it supports 48 gigabytes per second bandwidth that's up from 18 on hdmi 2 and even 32.4 we get with displayport 1.4 so a new generation of monitors are just starting to come out and also higher end 2019 and 2020 tvs already support 2.1 which means you can get 4k at 120 or even 8k at 60. so it's pretty impressive stuff but i do still have a few questions like what are they gonna be like to overclock how well will they support sli and also how much cheaper will these new cards make the current 2000 series of cards and of course we'll have to see what amd can come up with will their new big navi cards compete with the 3080 and or selena will be better value for money so that's something we'll have to wait and see but the big question the biggest question is not can it play crisis but can it play microsoft flight sim 2020 that's the new benchmark and it's something i will be testing myself when i get the cards in for review so the rtx 3080 comes out september 17th and a week later for the 3090 and then sometime in october for the 30-70 but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy one of the new cards or maybe even get a cheaper 20 series let me know in the comments below and also stay tuned for my full review buying guide 8k video test all that good stuff so
