this video is very kindly sponsored by surf shark VPN hey guys I'm Tama tech chap and I'm actually pretty excited about laptops this year in 2020 there's so many new technologies and innovations coming that I think if you are considering buying a laptop right now it may be worth holding off for a month or so let me show you why so first of all at number one we've got new screens coming this is the MSI creator 17 it's the first laptop in the world with a mini LED display I had a bit of a play with it at CES and it's incredibly bright up to a thousand nits it's also 4k supports display HDR 1000 and we get great contrast and accurate colors basically we've gone from hundreds of LEDs in an LCD screen to thousands of LEDs now I've only had a quick hands-on and I can't wait to test it properly against an OLED screen although right now nothing can match no LEDs contrast and deep blacks so for me and you these new mini LED screens will be great for photo and video editing especially if you're working with HDR content for using outdoors or in bright conditions as well as playing games again especially if these support HDR as for how such a bright screen will affect battery life well I'm just gonna have to wait until I can test it myself in a full review now to confuse things slightly there's also micro LED technology which is different from mini LED in so much that basically every single pixel has its own LED so it goes a step further but right now we're only really seeing this with super high-end or concept 8k TVs from lights of Samsung although there are rumors that apples working with micro LEDs for their next-gen MacBook Pros coming back to mini LED though and LG actually unveiled a new mini LED a.k TV at this year's CES with up to 4000 nits of brightness clearly there's a lot of potential with these new screens okay moving on a new year means new processors and in 2020 laptop CPUs are likely to get a serious boost thanks to Intel's 10th gen h-series chips and aim these 4000 series chips both offering up to 8 cores and 16 threads it is worth remembering though the new processors don't usually make a huge difference to gaming performance that mostly comes down to the graphics card but for multitasking for video editing for rendering 3d work that's of stuff this could actually be a serious upgrade and we'll see the first laptops with these chips coming out from March including the new ROG zephyrus g14 which according to Asus will be the world's most powerful 14 inch laptop with a custom AMD 4800 HS and an RT X 2060 graphics card if it's all bit confusing don't worry just make sure you have hit subscribe as I'll be testing and reviewing all these properly in an upcoming video just quickly guys if you have a second after this video

getting a lot better this year is with upgraded graphics tech the latest rumors suggest we're gonna see Nvidia's new r-tx super series of cards coming to laptops this isn't confirmed just yet but from what I've been hearing and reading is chances are coming pretty soon for example a leaked slide found by notebook check suggests the new cards will come in standard and max-q flavors so we're expecting super variants of the 1650 maybe the 1660 as well as the 2060 2017 and 2018 cards and each model will have a parallel max-q version which is slightly under clocked and less powerful for use in thin and light laptops a listing for the 2080 supermax cue with eight gigs of DDR 6 Ram showed up on gig benches OpenCL database with results that put it around the same performance as a desktop our TX 2070 or a GTX 280 Ti which is pretty impressive given this is a max cue card for laptops as for the ranger of rule I'm expecting the same can i boost we got on the desktop super card so anywhere between 5 and 15 percent nothing earth-shattering but it all adds up I suspect we'll also see Nvidia's URT x3000 series of cards like the 30 70 and the 30 80 coming this year probably around the summer time although that will be for desktop PCs only for this year and then chances are that will come to laptops in 2021 as I say this isn't a hundred percent confirmed right now but from the leaks we've seen and also from talking with various brands like MSI at CES who were kind of worried about what graphics cars were coming in their new GS 66 stealth and GE 66 Raider suggests we'll probably seeing laptops with these new cards sort of in late q1 this year just in the past week or so I've seen reports of new Nvidia MX 330 and M X 350 graphics chips now the only information so far is coming from drivers but interestingly it looks like these will be based on Nvidia Zolder Pascal architecture which we last saw in the GTX 10 series and existing MX series models and leaks suggest the MX 350 will have around 65% more cuda cores compared to the previous MX 250 so pretty much from all angles from the integrated chips and processors to these new low power MX graphics chips to the new RC X super cards this is gonna be a big upgrade in the graphics department for laptops this year ok next up and we've got Intel's project Athena Innovation Program which is kind of like ultrabook 2.0 and you standard the meet certain specs for thin and light high-performance laptops so we saw a few laptops that made the grade in 2019 like the Dell XPS 13 to 1 and Lenovo yoga C 940 but 20/20 looks like the a will finally get a lot more choice Intel a promising around 50 new models for this year including the likes of the standard XPS 13 the Asus wear 3 and even the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook why is that exciting though well the guarantees that you'll get either an i5 i7 o a9 processor at least 8 gigs of ram and at least 256 gigs of fast nvme SSD storage as well as a thin and light design at least at ATP touchscreen fast Wi-Fi 6 Thunderbolt 3 fast charging plus at least nine hours of battery life in real world use other perks include a backlit keyboard precision touchpad and fingerprint or face recognition for logging in athena certified laptops will come with intel's engineered for mobile performance ticker although unfortunately this doesn't apply to AMD based models so you have to do a bit more to see how those models compare in any case the idea is to help make buying a new laptop a little bit more straightforward although for now it seems to be quite high-end on the premium soft side of things hopefully that'll trickle down to better specs mid-range or budget laptops but it is a good start now Intel's woes aren't limited to just a resurgent AMD Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 7 C and 8 C chips our laptop class processors for Windows 10 on arm and they could shake up the mobile laptop space thanks to massive battery life Solar performance and 5g LTE connectivity so the chips are based on the ARM architecture which is similar to the process as you get in your smartphone the main issue though is that the on compatible with a lot of software that's made for regular Windows so last year's Microsoft Surface pro X was an ARM based convertible tablet which was thin and light and had a great battery life thanks mainly to the processor there's also already been a couple of education based laptops with the 7c coming in around $300 and I reckon we could see a Microsoft Surface go to with one of these new chips at some point this could give budget Chromebooks a good run for their money of course expect to pay more for a 5g or LTE connected version of the laptop but if you're looking for a really thin light sort of travel laptop then this can be really worth considering one laptop trend that I loved at CES this year are the new design concepts we saw a couple of dual screen designs last year like the asou symbol Pro duo which I loved but this year looks even more exciting some of them are single fold L devices like the Lenovo 13-inch x1 fold and concept designs like Intel's Horseshoe Bend and Dells concept or II these work like tablets when unfolded and mini laptops when flexed and can also fall flat like a conventional clamshell machine these seem like they might be great all the Wan devices especially for people who work on the go although like Samsung's Galaxy fold I'm slightly concerned about the durability of the folding mechanism and the screen then the second screen device is like Dells concept jewett and Microsoft Surface near Microsoft have also built Windows 10 eggs just for these new dual screen devices so hopefully it's implementation doesn't feel like an afterthought some clam shell laptops are also getting second smaller screens which is good for multitasking say having your Premiere Pro files there or watching a YouTube video or twitch stream in any case it feels like we're only just starting out with these new formats and I can't wait to see what else 20/20 has in store now last but not least if you're a Mac user and maybe you've been eyeing up the new MacBook Pro 16 which I have here but perhaps you think it's a little bit too big or just way too expensive because it does cost a lot of money then while it's not confirmed I would bet that we're gonna see a new 14 inch MacBook Pro this year an updated version of the 13 inch modern with the better keyboard new processor new graphics the crazy good speakers and I think for a lot of people an updated 14 inch macbook pro would be sort of the sweet spot when it comes to Apple laptops so fingers crossed we see that maybe in the summer of this year so lots of exciting new laptops are coming which is why I think it's best to hold off right now I'm buying a new one because either you'll get more for your money very soon or you'll be able get last year's models at a discount maybe you can find a good deal on them so either way as I say new graphics new processors new screens new form factors maybe a new MacBook this year's can be pretty exciting for laptops but what about you are you considering upgrading your laptop
