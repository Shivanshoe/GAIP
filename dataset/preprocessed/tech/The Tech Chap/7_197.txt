my name it's chap the tech chap okay let me explain basically this is gonna be james bond's phone well maybe not his actual phone although it would be fun to see daniel craig talk about what his daily driver is but this is the nokia 8.35 g and it's the phone that presumably nokia is spending a ton of money on to feature as the new bond phone in the upcoming movie no time to die okay that's better it's going far too hard not tuxedo but anyway marketing aside this is nokia's new flagship phone the 8.3 5g and it'll set you back 500 pounds or 700 so it's firmly in the not quite flagship but trying to be better than the usual mid-range type of phone category it's also nokia's first 5g phone although it only supports sub 6 gigahertz 5g not mm wave but that's not the end of the world and nokia says this supports more 5g bands than any other 5g phone right now so what exactly makes this stand out other than the fact that maybe daniel craig may have it in his pocket well for me recent nokias have always been about having that fast and pure android software good cameras or at least interesting cameras like last year's nokia 9 pureview and also not costing an arm and a leg and so with android one a quad camera setup and a 500 pound price tag this should be good now the first time you pick this up your first impression is going to be this is a big phone i mean it's 8.9 millimeters thick it weighs 220 grams and we get a 6.81 inch screen it really is a bit of a chunky monkey and while the bezels are pretty thin around three of the edges we do have a bit of a chin at the bottom here but if you do want that big phone big screen experience then it's fine and i think it's a pretty good looking phone overall we get gorilla glass on the back although there's no word on the front so i'm guessing not but the takeaway is while it looks fairly smart it does feel a little bit plasticky it's also very slippery to hold i do like this polar night color though and hopefully you do as well because well there aren't actually any other choices we get this circular camera module on the back the power button here on the right doubles as a fingerprint reader which i actually quite like and it does feel more comfortable given its size than saying in screen reader but then on the other side slightly bizarrely we have a dedicated google assistant button and as much as i'm trying to get used to it i keep pressing the wrong one to unlock it it kind of reminds me of samsung's bixby button in that we just don't really need it and it's more hassle than it's worth we also don't get any wireless charging and come to think of it i don't think there's any ip water resistance rating either there is a headphone jack though if you're still into that sort of thing but we do only get a single fairly average speaker which is a little bit disappointing so headphones are definitely the way to go so let's talk specs and we get a snapdragon 765g chip which isn't quite a flagship 865 but it's more than powerful enough for any game or app right now alongside six or eight gigs of ram and 64 or 128 gigs of storage plus micro sd support we also get a good sized 4 500 milliamp hour battery and i find that i still have about 30 of my battery left at the end of the day so no complaints there you should be able to get a good day and a half out of this with a bit of rationing but for me one of the biggest selling points is the software it runs android 10 but because it's an android one phone i know that's slightly confusing but it means that you're essentially getting the google pixel experience so there's no skins or horrible ugly ui on top or tons of bloatware just pure vanilla android which also means it'll be one of the first phones to get updates like android 11. so far so good then but what lets this down a little bit i think is the screen it's lcd rather than amoled and it's also only 60 hertz neither of which are really deal breakers but so many phones now offer smoother 90 or 120 hertz screens even the 200 pound poco x3 for example and it does make a difference to how fast everything feels will the average person going into a phone store really care or mind that much about 60 versus 90 hertz probably not is the answer and i think that's why you know apple probably don't have that much to worry about with the iphone 12 if they do go with 60 hertz but given the fact that you can get lots of other phones in this price range with high refresh rates it's a little bit disappointing having said that the screen still looks pretty good and by default this pure display is turned on which boosts everything up so it's sharper and punchier it certainly makes videos and games pop a little bit more but it can feel a little bit artificial and over sharpen sometimes one of my biggest criticisms right now though is when it comes to auto brightness i think there's a bug or at least it's not working quite right i know a few other reviewers have had this issue but even in bright sunlight sometimes it will just lower the brightness right down without you doing anything so you can't even see the phone so it seems a bit hit or miss the auto brightness detector but hopefully that's something they can fix in a software update now let's talk about this camera we get four lenses with the main one being 64 megapixels i mean considering they've partnered with zeiss optics and we're getting that pureview camera branding you would expect this to be pretty good we also get a 12 megapixel degree ultra wide lens but unfortunately no telephoto so while you can zoom in it's digital only so there's the main lens the ultra wide and then we have a two megapixel macro and a two megapixel depth sensor so it completes that marketing friendly quad camera setup which every phone manufacturer and the dog seems to want to put into their handsets these days the depth lens should help with portrait shots to some extent but i still find the bokeh blur a bit artificial looking and the macro is pretty much useless the quality just isn't good enough so we get the usual array of modes including a night mode and the longer exposure adds more light and detail but it does start to struggle if it gets too dark nokia is also putting a lot of emphasis on video you can shoot in 4k which is pretty standard these days and also 21x9 ultrawide if you want to give it a bit more of a cinematic feel but there's nothing really that special to write home about here and then around the front we have a 24 megapixel selfie camera although for some reason selfie portraits seem to go really dark and contrasty so the question is should you actually buy the nokia 8.3 5g well it is a good phone i love the software we got solid performance good battery life and i think it looks quite nice although it's not maybe the most sophisticated or most premium phone out there but i think as a package it does a pretty good job especially given the price as i say about 500 pounds so that is worth bearing in mind that of course you're not going to get you know galaxy note 20 ultra cans of level of premiumness and finish and features this is a 500 pound or 700 phone but that argument goes both ways because while versus flagships this may look like a pretty good deal there are so many other budget mid-range phones now that actually make this look a little bit outdated and i think there are just a few too many compromises here 60 hertz lcd single speaker no water resistance no wireless charging it's pretty bulky and the macro and depth lenses aren't that useful i think six months ago even most of this could be forgiven but competition as i say in the mid-range has got so strong recently and the likes of the oneplus nord and the moto g5g plus for example are better in almost every way plus if you do just want that stock android experience then the pixel 4a or the upcoming pixel 5 may be a better option so perhaps if nokia or hmd global who actually own nokia maybe spend a bit less money on the james bond marketing budget and a bit more on the handset itself then we'd be in a better place but while there's nothing wrong with this phone and i think if you do buy it you'll be pretty happy with it given the price and the features i just think there are better options out there but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy this do you think i'm being a bit too harsh and did i just completely ruin the video with that stupid james bond skit at the beginning let me know in the comments below and if you do want to see more from me
