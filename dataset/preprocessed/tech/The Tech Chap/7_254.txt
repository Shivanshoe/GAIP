hey guys Anton tech chap and this gorgeous looking greeny blue slab of glass is the new one plus eight grow and they've also got its little brother here with me the standard one plus eight which I'll come back to a little later in the video so I've been using the a pro for the past couple of weeks I've fully transferred to it I am using it as my main everyday phone on my daily driver if you will and you know what I love this thing but before we get into the specs and whether you should actually consider buying this I think the headline that everyone's talking about is the price I think most of us were a little bit disappointed to find out one plus has increased the price by a hundred pounds so where last year's 70 pro would set you back seven hundred pounds the a pro will cost you eight hundred plus we're getting half the storage on the base model in fact if you want this one with 12 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of storage you're actually gonna have to pay 900 pounds or $1000 that's 200 more than this and actually even 100 more than the 17 McClaren Edition so at the top-end we're looking at a thousand dollars for a one plus phone and that doesn't say easily with a lot of people I think however bear in mind that the standard one plus eight which I have here with me as well starts from just 600 pounds or $700 so there is a more affordable option if you want it and as I say we'll compare these at the end of the video now for me the big two selling points for oneplus have always been performance it's always come with the latest processor a ton of RAM and most importantly this super slick oxygen OS software and then also being really good value for money we could forgive that it missed out on maybe a few bells and whistles and the camera was good was great perhaps because in some cases it was two-thirds or even half the price of competing flagship phones so have we lost that value for money well maybe a little bit but consider that I'd see the 70 Pro only offered 4G there was no 5g support with this whereas all 1+8 models are 5g enabled and on the pro model they've also added an official ip68 racing for water and dust resistance they finally added wireless charging up to 30 watts if you use their charging pad plus we get the new snapdragon 865 a smoother 120 hertz screen up from 90 faster ram and improved quad camera setup including a slightly bizarre color filter lens but we'll come back to that we also get a much bigger battery which actually came second only to the iPhone 11 Pro mags in my battery test along with nice have like what my sakes inclusive 5.1 so to paraphrase the Dark Knight you either die a flagship killer or you live long enough to see yourself become the flagship and I think in every respect now the a pro is a proper flagship phone so yes it's more expensive but there's a lot new here and to be honest with you I still think we're getting good value for money and I think I'd recommend the base eight pro eight gigs of RAM and 128 storage is absolutely fine and that does make it a better value option than the s20 plus it's about two hundred pounds cheaper or about a hundred less in the US but enough about money what's it actually like to use well here's a line up of a few of its comparative so you can get an idea four sides with a six point seven inch screen it is a big phone and I think a lot of people will prefer the standard one plus eight which is a more comfortable manageable size but for me I think the pro is just right and the 20 by 9 aspect ratio means it's not too wide I do recommend putting a case on it though as it is very slippery and the camera module protrudes more than before so I'm a little worried it will get scratched from the back there's not really much new here aside from when we designed oneplus logo the color and a couple of new camera features on the pro we get three color options onyx black glacial green and ultramarine blue although unfortunately the blue model won't actually be coming to the UK but it's not the end of the world because I think this glacial green model is my favorite color I never thought I'd want a green phone although to be fair it's kind of like a bluey green but it really is a unique looking phone and with this sort of glass matte finish there's no fingerprints no smudges it looks awesome we still get one plus is alert slider which I'm a huge fan of and I kind of wish more phones were just copy but the biggest change here is that new hole-punch display in place of the pop-out camera on a 70 pro or the teardrop notch on the 70 now personally until we get them under the screen selfie cameras I think the corner hole-punch cutout is the best design and while the pop-up camera of the 70 probe was pretty nifty I'm always a little bit dubious about the durability of mechanical Slayers in phones and also this has helped us get that IP rating the first time a oneplus phone has ever had an official IP water-resistance rating for unlocking the phone we have the same optical fingerprint reader as before which works reasonably well although I tend to rely on face unlocking most of the time I wouldn't have minded a slightly bigger cut out if they could have squeezed in and I asked but that's just me I do quite like the fact that pixels around the selfie camera light up those so you and your friends know where to look for selfies but for me one of the absolute standouts with one plus a pro is the screen display may gave it an A+ and it's one of the few phones to offer a quad HD plus resolution and 120 Hertz refresh at the same time plus it has auto switch modes for both based on battery so you don't have to worry about it at all the screen does have a slight curve to it and once or twice how about a couple of accidental presses but the vast majority of the time it's been fine I think one underrated feature though is just how bright the screen gets in blazing sunshine I measured a peak of around 920 nets on the a pro versus about 850 on the galaxy s 20 ultra and just 703 on the previous 70 Pro so it's one of the brightest phones I've ever used and will actually peak at 1300 nits when playing HDR content movies games just browsing through socials it all looks incredible on the oneplus and paired with the top-end specs and oxygen OS which in my opinion is the best Android experience you can get I'd even say I prefer to stock Android but that's just me altogether this feels like the fastest and slickest phone I've ever used speaking of software let me show you a couple of new features that we've added the first one is motion graphics smoothing it's kind of like the motion processor you get on TVs which to be honest I always turn off but it increases the frame rate of the video you're watching I've mostly noticed it in YouTube videos where little pop-up will tell me there's working and it makes a a 30 FPS video look like you're shot in 60 it says it supports Netflix and Amazon but to tell you the truth I haven't even able to notice it but as I say in YouTube especially it does work quite well and to my surprise I haven't turned it off yet the other addition is vibrant color effect Pro which just stops the saturation and contrast to give you a little more pop I tried it but it became quite jarring when watching YouTube videos going from portrait to full screen landscape and then suddenly seeing all the color switch it's a personal taste thing but I turn it off one area where the one plus a pro really surprised me though is with battery life I mean in my experience oneplus phones have always had good battery but not necessarily exceptional but in my recent battery life rundown test it actually came out as the best performing Android phone a slight caveat that the s20 ultra was the Exynos version and if it Snapdragon it would probably been a close contest with the oneplus but still the a pro gave an impressive showing the combo of the bigger 45 10 million power battery and presumably a bunch of optimizations considering this only one HDI 120 Hertz at the same time battery life is seriously impressive charging comes in the form of their walk charge 30 T charger it's the same as before and in my charging test 20 minutes tops it up to 45% and it took 1 hour and 6 minutes to fully charge by 11 p.m. I've stole use illegal about 30% of my battery left which brings me to another new feature optimized charging now you can turn this off but by default when you leave it to charge overnight it'll actually pause at 80% and then resume about half now or so before your alarm goes off or when it expects you to wake up so you're still fully charged in the morning but it's not degrading the battery overnight as it maintains that 100% charge so you can always turn it off and if you do have a fairly predictable routine which I think most of us do right now then it is a good feature to have and now the first one plus is the addition of wireless charging something most of the phones have had for a while now but they finally caught up we also now get reverse wireless charging for the first time so you can top-up other Qi enabled devices like maybe give earphones or someone else's phone but again it is very slow still it's a few nice to have features that had been missing ok let's talk about the camera because we don't want plus phones in my experience I think for a lot of people it's always been the one area that's kind of let it down it's never quite matched the other flagships from Samsung while Wade Google or Apple so while things better this time around well the answer is yes but not much we get a quad lens setup with a 48 megapixel F 1.78 main lens using a new Sony imx6 89 sensor it also uses pixel billings so we end up with 12 megapixel photos but in the camera app you can choose a shoot in full 48 megapixels if you really want to then we have a 48 megapixel F 2.2 ultra wide as far as I'm aware that's actually the highest resolution on any ultra wide camera phone next we have a telephoto lens which gives us three times hybrid zoom and I'm - a thirty times digital zoom which I think is all most of us really need but it does fall short of the s20 range there's also a fourth camera lens but I guess a that's the last but so far my experience of the 1+8 camera has been positive but not breathtaking versus last year's oneplus 70 Pro in some shots there's not a whole lot of difference the most notable change is what oneplus are calling their new three HDR tech which has led to some much improved dynamic range here's a quick side-by-side shooting 4k video as well and you can see the sky is noticeably less blown out on the a pro now if you'll excuse my sloppy messy house you can see just how overexposed the 70 Pro is looking on the back window and it's the same thing with the lights behind my desk it's not just in video either in my camera comparison again you can see how well expose the pathway is the brush is in the sky compared to the others and especially in this photo with a tree overall the dynamic range is significantly better on the a pro we also get some fancy new all pixel autofocus and to his credit I found versus the s20 ultra on the iPhone it was consistently the fastest to focus one thing I've noticed though is the white balance can be a little inconsistent sometimes it gets it spot-on and beats the other phones and other times it's way off the streetlamp here is orange for example and some selfies and portrait photos colors can look a little washed out the nice gape mode works reasonably well but in super dark conditions it doesn't hold a candle to something like the iPhone 11 Pro we do get a dedicated macro mode though which works well although quite honestly I've never actually used it beyond just testing it for this speaking of extra lenses I've kept you waiting long enough ladies and gentlemen welcome to one of the weirdest new features I've seen on a phone in a long time the fourth lens is a 5 megapixel photo chromatic lens in the camera app you'll see a new filter icon with the usual rare filters but only when shooting with a rear camera you'll see one extra filter photo Chrome and this is where things get kind of weird most of the time it's a kind of grayscale image with some bright copper highlights depending on the objects it can even see through some materials like my TV remote or the VR headset showing some electronic components inside it's surreal but kind of cool to play with for five minutes or to maybe show your mates but beyond that I'm not sure who would actually want to use this and the 5 megapixel quality is pretty poor video still tops out at 4k 6 C there's no a.k option here but that's not really a big deal tea is good especially with the improved HDR as is the OIS and E is stabilization [Music] in low light white balance what's still a bit hit and miss though but on the whole video looks good as for selfies the 16 megapixel F 2.4 front camera is sharp and generally takes a good photo however depending on the light I have found the colors particularly skin tones can look quite understands it for example my eyes and this photo look kind of gray and in my comparison video 2 I often ended up looking kind of ill it's a similar story for selfie video again colors are kind of muted and washed out plus it's still limited to 1080p whereas most phones can shoot 4k with a front camera so overall the camera is better but mostly just in regards to the improved HDR the 4th lens seems gimmicky there's still no 4k foreign video and the colors in portraits low-light and selfies can sometimes look unnatural to be fair we have seen oneplus makes some significant improvements to cameras in the past via OTA updates so maybe this will get better over time a few tweaks to the white balance could make things a lot better alright so this has been a pretty long review but I appreciate you guys sticking with me the last thing I want to talk about is this guy should you go for the a pro or the standard 1 + 8 well the key differences are that it's smaller with a 6.5 5 inch full HD + 95 screen no wireless charging no IP water rating no telephoto lens and the main lens is using the older sensor that we get in the 70 pro along with an ultra wide and a macro lens plus a smaller 4300 mAh battery which I found lasted about half an hour less than the pro but we do get the same core specs of the snapdragon 86 5 8 or 12 gigs of RAM and 128 or 256 storage but crucially it is 200 pounds cheaper starting at just six hundred pounds or $700 so I think on paper it does look like you're missing out on quite a lot but in reality you're kind of just getting a 70 pro but with a newer processor and the hole punch design rather than the pop-out camera so in my opinion I think most people would be better off with just the 1 + 8 it's all you need I mean 120 Hertz quad-hd plus wireless charging IP ratings are all nice-to-haves but not essential features and if you are in a bit of a tighter budget I think this is all you need but if you want an all-singing all-dancing proper flagship phone then yeah the eight pro is the one to go for yes it's a little bit more expensive than before and maybe it's lost a little bit of its competitive edge where the a pro is still a fantastic phone oxygen OS is still my favorite version of Android and I am gonna keep using this everyday as my main phone so I hope you guys found that useful it did take quite a while to make this video so a thumbs up or maybe even a cheeky little subscribe would be amazing also let me know which one you go for the a or the a pro or if you think they're both just too expensive now thank you so much for watching guys I'll see you next time right here on the texture [Music]
