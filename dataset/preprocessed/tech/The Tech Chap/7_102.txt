[Music] hey guys anthony techchap and there must be a good billion or so laptops like this to choose from yeah premium thin and light ultra portable laptop uh that cost between like a thousand and fifteen hundred quid or so you've got your dell xps's your macbook airs and pros even the lg gram series this is the 16 which i'll come back to later so the samsung galaxy book pro has its work cut out to really stand out and convince you to drop about 1200 pounds to buy it the good news though is that this does have a couple of tricks up its sleeve and actually while it's not perfect i do have a couple of issues with it actually this is one of my favorite laptops of the year so far but does that mean you should actually buy it well let's find out and if you do enjoy this video and want to see more from me a cheeky little like and subscribe would be lovely cheers so i had a brief hands-on with the pro a few weeks back along with its siblings the much more affordable standard galaxy book and the flipping pro 360. but i think it's this guy the pro that i've been most excited to get in for a proper review i'll tell you what though i'd forgotten just how ridiculously thin and light this thing is it's a 15.6 inch laptop it weighs just over one kilogram so about 2.3 pounds which is insane and of course there's also the smaller 13 inch version which weighs even less and it gets even more interesting because the lg gram 16 while still holding the title for the world's lightest 16 inch laptop very specifically 16 inch the 15.6 inch galaxy book pro weighs 100 grams less i'm really really impressed by this i think the design is an absolute standout samsung have nailed it and my only wish in terms of the design well the screen really would be for a 16 by 10 aspect ratio i think 16x9 is looking a little bit old-fashioned these days if they just be able to reduce this chin make the screen 16 by 10 it would have been almost perfect i think so that's one sort of subjective criticism although some people may prefer that so this design paired with this gorgeous amoled screen which is also impressively color accurate this is a genuinely lovely laptop and travel companion but while i think the design and the screen are the sort of standout headline features we're actually getting a pretty good all-round spec with us as well we're getting the latest 11th gen intel processors either an i5 or an i7 along with 16 gigs of ram and 512 storage so pretty nicely spec'd and also as you can see from this little sticker down here it takes the intel evo certification branding you can see it's just click the youtube video there uh intel's evo so it's basically past all their tests uh and guarantees you a sort of certain level of performance and samsung is pitching these there's all about portability with connectivity so we're getting the latest wi-fi 6e although you'll need a compatible router with that thunderbolt 4 quick share if you want to share files with your galaxy phone and also a second screen option if you've got a galaxy tab s7 or s7 plus so if you are in the galaxy ecosystem then you are getting some extra benefits and also the 13-inch version of this gets 4g lte support although not 5g weirdly but not the 15-inch which is a bit disappointing so i've been using this for a little over a week now and performance is snappy and responsive it just breezes through pretty much everything you'd want to do on it and while of course we're not getting a dedicated graphics card we do get intel's onboard iris xe graphics which are about twice as fast as the previous 10th gen processors and you can get away with playing some fairly demanding games if you don't mind dropping the resolution or the graphics settings a little bit take rainbow six siege i just about scraped 60fps with low settings at 1080p and with high settings at 720p in fortnite at 1080p with medium settings i just about got 60 fps but really i had to drop to low to avoid the huge frame drops i think 720p with medium settings was the most consistently smooth way to play so you can get away with a bit of light to moderate gaming on this although i think realistically most of you guys probably wouldn't be looking to play games on this if you were going to buy it this is going to be great for students or as like a home slash work laptop or just a travel companion given how thin and light this thing is or even as a bit of a creator's tool i was actually able to comfortably edit some light 4k video on this not your fancy 10-bit 422 stuff that i can shoot on this they wouldn't really deal with that although you please use proxies but if you're just taking 4k video shot on your phone then premiere pro or um davinci will easily be able to handle it although i think 1080p video is really where this is at or indeed a bit of lightroom photoshop general everyday stuff there's nothing really about this in terms of the specs that makes it stand out compared to the other ultrabook competition they're still the same 11th gen low 15 watt power chips with the integrated graphics but still more than capable for 95 of what most of us would use it for i was actually surprised just how good the sound quality was it's clear it gets pretty loud and has more punch than you'd expect given the fact it has downward-facing speakers what i will say though is that as someone coming from regularly using the macbook pro and macbook air with the m1 chip you do notice the fans were up on this uh opening a few chrome tabs or doing some light sort of light room editing you do hear them we're up it's not particularly loud but it's noticeable and also it can get quite warm even when i was just downloading some games to test on here i could feel it get quite warm underneath not uncomfortably so on the keyboard so none of these are a deal breaker just to make you aware you can hit the fan and it can get a bit warm under load although if you are worried about the fan noise what you can actually do is dive into the settings and change the fan speed to match the ambient sounds around you so if you're in a coffee shop and you're doing something whatever it is on your laptop then you can adjust it and keep it to a lower level although of course that will then restrict performance i tell you what though battery life on this thing is excellent i got about 11 hours from this as i was writing my review and using chrome for my notes and that was with 75 screen brightness and using the better battery setting so this will comfortably get you through a full work day and maybe even a little bit more depending on how you use it and the other good thing is it charges reasonably quickly because we've got the bundled 65 watt chargers do you hear that just out of the blue i wasn't even doing anything it stopped now periodically you'll just hear but not the end of the world going back to the design for a second and personally i think this thing looks great especially with the slim bezels and this large precision track pad samsung calls this mystic silver although i'm gonna rename it mostly white because really it's just the top of the lid that's actually silver although the blue version is a consistent color around the sides we get two usbcs one with the latest thunderbolt 4 which is great to see plus a full size hdmi and on the other side we get usb 3.2 type a's a three and a half mil jack and a micro sd card reader actually just quickly you know how i mentioned the big track pad earlier it's lovely to use don't get me wrong it's got a really smooth glossy surface lovely very very big it fills up this entire palm rest and it's nice and responsive it's microsoft precision drivers but it has one of the loudest clicks your friends might want to kill you if you bring this out and use that like that in front of them in other news the power button doubles as a fingerprint reader and you can see on this 15 inch model we have this full numpad as well which is nice and a very comfortable white backlit chiclet keyboard no complaints there and this is being shot on the webcam both the audio and the video it's not terrible it's 720p but it is a little bit noisy uh i'm quite smooth as well which i guess is not a bad thing and also you'll see there's a bit of screen wobble there actually so don't make you feel dizzy uh so 720p one megapixel it's in a good location at least so uh yeah that's the webcam so far so good then but i think i've left the best till last i think maybe it's the amoled screen of course there are not many amoled or oled screens on the market you've got a few options from razer and dell and being self-emissive i.e having no led backlight means the blacks are actually black there's no backlight bleed or blooming like certain ipad pros for example and colors look much punchier than on a regular lcd screen and particularly hdr movies and photos look fantastic on this and it supports the visa display hdr 500 standard for high dynamic range which means this can peak at up to 500 nits of brightness which is pretty good for an oled but just as importantly as color accuracy especially if you're editing or color correcting and samsung claims 120 coverage of the very demanding dci p3 color gamut although with the tools i've got here i could only measure 98 dci p3 although that's still very very impressive and even better actually you can switch from the p3 to the srgb to the adobe rgb color gamuts in the display settings for the best results based on what you're working with and if you want to cater to one particular standard which is not something you see very often it's a really nice feature it is full hd though so 1080p which is fine and the standard really for a 15 inch laptop like this i suppose maybe a 4k option would have been nice like we do on the dell xps you can go 1080p or 4k depending on how you want to use it and also what your battery life is because of course uh going for the high res destroys your performance and your battery so should you buy one well yeah i think so i think for 1200 pounds for the entry level spec pay a little bit more for the i5 and more ram and more storage you know you know the drill i think this is a terrific laptop you get that thin and light portability of an lg gram you get an amoled screen which is not very common at all which really does make it stand out top notch performance and doesn't cost an absolute fortune i want really good battery life as well yes it's got a loud clicky track pad the webcam is average and it can get a bit warm and the fan can heat up a little bit as well and maybe a 16 by 10 screen would have been nice aspect ratio but other than that there's not a whole lot to criticize here so if you are after a ultra portable thin light premium laptop which i think a lot of people are to be fair then i would definitely give the samsung galaxy book pro a serious look i think this is a terrific
