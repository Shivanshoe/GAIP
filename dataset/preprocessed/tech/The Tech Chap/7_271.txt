hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is the new 2020 huawei matebook d15 so i've got the cheapest model here the entry level version will set you back 600 pounds which is actually relatively affordable for a fairly premium ultrabook now this does also have a smaller brother the matebook d14 which surprisingly actually costs you 50 pounds more for the entry level spec although you do get double the storage and we'll come back to that in a second so the matebook d is actually huawei's cheapest laptop one up from this we have the standard matebook the 13 inch which they haven't actually updated yet for 2020 and then we have the top end makebook makebook matebook x pro they've just launched the new 2020 model with a green version and a faster 10th gen i7 processor but that will cost you upwards of 1500 pounds as i say this starts at 600. so if you want to budget if you're a student if you're looking for just a nice compact thin and light travel laptop that you can watch netflix on and do some work on and maybe a little bit of photo editing and light maybe 1080p video editing then this is pretty much all you need so the first question what makes this stand out compared to the million or so other mid-range laptops on the market well i think firstly the design it looks pretty smart actually and premium considering the price there's definite cues from a certain fruit-based rival they even call this aluminium chassis space gray as well but that's no bad thing and i think it definitely looks more expensive than it is which is always a good thing we've got pretty thin bezels although they are plastic and they protrude a little bit they're not flush with the screen so that takes away a little bit from the premium aesthetic and the keys feel a little bit plasticky and cheap and they're not backlit either so you can see some areas where they're cost saving but for a 15.6 inch laptop and weighing just 1.62 kilograms it's remarkably portable as well so i think design is definitely one of the selling points of this then we have this little guy the maple d comes with huawei's famous recessed webcam if security is important to you if you're someone who puts a bit of tape over their webcam normally the fact that you can just press i almost dropped it there you can just press a little key here between f6 and f7 to physically hide or recess the webcam i think it's definitely a selling point then we have the power button which also doubles as a fingerprint reader so with just one press you can start it up and log in we also get usbc charging which is not something you find on lower end mid-range laptops you usually get those horrible proprietary little dc in cables so actually what that means is you can also charge your phone assuming you're not using an iphone and actually it's pretty fast as well the charger is 65 watts so you can go from zero to 55 battery in half an hour which is actually very impressive and again fast charging is not something you tend to see on more mid-range laptops and finally we have huawei share now you may have seen this before on previous maybooks and the idea is that you can pair it with a huawei phone and then easily transfer photos and videos with one touch through nfc and if you're using a huawei phone with emui 10 or later there's a new feature called multi-screen collaboration so what you can do with your p30 pro or mate 30 pro is with one touch you can connect it to the laptop and then you can actually use your phone on the laptop screen whether you're swiping between home screens messaging someone you can even use the mouse and keyboard to type messages and the coolest thing is you can then drag and drop files or photos over to the desktop from the phone and it's all done through its own local wi-fi network so it doesn't use up any data and i love it when tech works together that seamlessly it doesn't happen very often although of course you do need to buy into the huawei ecosystem to make this work this only works with huawei devices just to reassure you though unlike the phone department of huawei the laptops don't seem to have any issues with this so-called sort of trade war ban we still have microsoft windows and we gain the latest updates and on the higher end models of this and other matebooks we get intel processors so their laptop division doesn't seem to be affected at all which is good news there are a couple of downsides to this though which we'll get to in just a second but first let me run you through the specs and as i say this is the entry level model uh where we get the amd ryzen 3 500 u along with 8 gigs of ram and 256 gigs of ssd storage which is absolutely fine it's not going to break any records uh that processor is roughly equivalent to the previous gen i5 the 8250u so it's okay it's a quad core chip with eight threads and also eight gigs of ram is pretty much the minimum but acceptable minimum these days for laptops although this can be expect up to 16 gigs so actually using every day it's pretty nippy and that's also largely thanks to the fast nvme ssd we get inside here although 256 gigs isn't a lot if you install a couple of games and put a few videos on there that will fill up quickly as for graphics we get amd's vega 8 chip which is uh built into the processor it's an integrated chip it doesn't quite come up to say the nvidia mx150 or even intel's brand new ios plus graphics and that's because actually this processor is getting on a little bit we're expecting to see amd's new 4 000 ryzen series in a month or so so that is worth bearing in mind but you know what for everyday stuff a little bit of lightroom light 1080p video editing this is absolutely fine and you can also get away with just a little bit of light gaming as well and actually even when i was gaming or rendering videos it stayed cool and quiet throughout and i think that's thanks to huawei's new shark fin 2 design which is another new feature it never got particularly loud and nowhere on the laptop did they get anywhere close to uncomfortably warm it was actually very impressive so far so good then but as i say i do have a couple of problems with the maple d15 the first one being the screen it's okay but it is not color accurate it doesn't get particularly bright looking at a peak of 220 nits as i say if you're trying to color correct uh photos or video on this the 65 srgb 49 adobe rgb and 48 p3 gamuts color accuracy is pretty poor actually and also with an 800 to one contrast ratio it just looks a little bit washed out and also as you can see the viewing angles aren't fantastic this i think is the biggest area the biggest sort of compromise versus the higher end matebooks like the x pro which have absolutely stunning screens it's not the end of the world and again you do have to factor in the price of this 600 pounds my other issue is battery life it's not great inside we get a 42 watt hour cell which is a good deal smaller than the 56 what hour cell we get on the 14 inch version of this so that's kind of another reason you might want to go for the smaller model and while huawei say you may get up to sort of 10 hours of use that's their test with local video playback at 150 nits but with normal use you're looking at more like five and a half hours the upside though is that we do have that fast 65 watt charging so you can top it up pretty quickly while we're talking about areas for improvement it would have been nice to see a backlit keyboard as well on this and also while the range of ports is decent we actually get three usb uh type a's one type c although it's not thunderbolt headphone jack and a full-size hdmi that's okay it would have been nice to see maybe an sd card reader but actually two of the usb a ports are only usb 2. we only get one fast usb 3 which for a 2020 laptop is a little bit old-fashioned now here's another version of me to test the speakers and if i whack the volume right out so we don't get the play store what that means it does get nice and loud actually it's definitely tinnies lacking in bass i wouldn't say they're fantastic speakers so then the big question should you actually buy the 2020 matebook d15 well i think for 600 pounds it's a pretty good value laptop although i have to say i do think it's smaller brother the 14 inch model may be a better bet you get a better battery life it's obviously thinner and lighter because you get a smaller screen and while it does cost 50 pounds more you do get double the storage 512 which is kind of what you want in 2020 so for a bunch of reasons i think that may be the better option but if you want the bigger screen and also the extra usb a port and then yeah this is still worth considering the screen and the battery let it down a little bit but then i think the design the fact that we get the fast charging the webcam and also the huawei share assuming you are invested in the huawei ecosystem do make up for it in some areas and i think for as i say 600 quid you're getting quite a lot for your money here but what do you think of the matebook d would you consider buying this or if not what laptop are you looking to upgrade to next let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you enjoyed the video then make sure you hit that like and subscribe button
