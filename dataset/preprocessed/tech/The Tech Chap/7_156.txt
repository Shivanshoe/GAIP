about the new samsung galaxy s21 series what's up guys saf here on supersaf tv it's supersaf this is actually a really good video by the way if you want to get the latest of specs and rumor updates for the s21 check out sas video leave a link below but i want to talk about something a little bit different the problem is i just don't know if there's anything that exciting that's going to make you want to chuck your current phone in the bin and rush out and buy a new s21 i mean there's the usual range of upgrades you know new processor slightly updated cameras slightly design which i must admit i do quite like uh with this curved edge to the camera module and also the two-tone design i think this purple one looks amazing in fact let's just get the specs out of the way first and here we've got the s21 versus the plus versus the ultra and the big changes include the new chips uh having an adaptive refresh on the ultra model bigger batteries which actually think will be one most notable upgrades although i do think the new snapdragon and exynos processors look really interesting some early results from the new exynos chip suggest it may actually give the snapdragon a proper run for its money this year however in the camera department that doesn't seem to be a whole lot new aside from an upgraded ultra wide lens faster laser autofocus and an extra zoom on the ultra but that's about it and also uh the news that the s21 ultra is likely to support the stylus the s pen which is one less reason to go for a note i suppose it kind of merges the two brands together a little bit on a side note i don't think we are seeing the end of the note series if anything because samsung's brought the uh launch and the unveiling of the s21 series so much farther forward it's usually the end of february march but now it's middle of jan that actually gives a bigger separation to when we usually see the notes launched around august september time so i still think we'll see a note 21 but it is kind of interesting that we may have s pen support on the s21 ultra so of course there are some decent upgrades but one of the questions and the comments i see a lot pop up on my channel is people saying well you know i've got my note 10 plus or my s9 and i still don't see a reason to upgrade you know come back to me when there's something different fundamentally i still don't know if we're getting that and that's only half the story because we've got these fairly you know modest upgrades but there also seems to be a couple of downgrades with the new phones uh for example if we take the display if the leaks are to be believed the s21 and the plus will actually just have a full hd rather than quad hd screen uh which isn't the end of the world but it is technically a downgrade from the s20 series it also looks like we're losing micro sd card support uh we're not gonna get a charger in the box which again environmentally friendly yes great but that means you probably have to pay extra yourself if you want the sort of latest best fast charger and it also looks like both the s21 and the plus will have the slightly cheaper feeling glastic polycarbonate body rather than the sort of proper glass that you get on the higher end models so it all comes down to pricing but i don't know if there's anything that leaps off the page that's going to make me want to run out and buy an s21 i'm not sure if you saw it but dave from dave 2d made a really good video a couple of days ago on the s21 uh talking well ranting a little bit about the 1080p resolution and also suggesting that perhaps samsung is to some extent maybe even sidelining the s series so that then there's a bigger differential and more reason to upgrade to a fancy flipping or folding phone with so much competition in the you know rectangular glass smartphone category that what's going to make them stand out are these different form factors and i think the other thing that stands out is while the s21 will no doubt be a fantastic phone and as i say a great benchmark to compare all the other phones coming out this year looking at the quality of the phones the affordable budget phones that we saw at the end of 2020 what you could get for two three four hundred pounds or dollars is insane i think 2020 for me was really the year of the resurgence of the good budget affordable phone why would someone go out and spend a grand or 800 pounds on a phone that's marginally better and the truth is a lot of the best features that might actually tempt you to upgrade are exclusive to the super expensive s21 ultra the glass body the adaptive refresh screen which saves battery the quad hd resolution and also the option for quad hd and 120 hertz finally at the same time but again only on the ultra that periscope zoom the micro sd s pen support it's frustrating that you'll have to pay around 1200 pounds or so to get all those extras so what was the point of this video well i don't know really i just like talking to you guys about phones but i guess it's kind of managing expectations for the s21 there's nothing that really jumps out at me as being a must-have new feature most of the good stuff is exclusive to the ultra and i think for a lot of people something like the current s20 fe may end up being a better value choice especially if we see it on sale however the good news is that we don't have to wait long until we find out everything samsung will unveil it at their galaxy unpacked event and i'll have a hands-on first impressions video either that day or very soon afterwards so make sure you have subscribed and stay tuned but in the meantime what about you what do you think of the s21 also the fact that you're getting maybe an s pen uh at least compatibility with the ultra is that something that would be interesting to you let me know in the comments below i read every single one of your comments and i'd love to hear uh what your expectations are what you're thinking about the s21 thank you so much for watching guys i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
