hey guys I'm Tama tech Jeff and this is the new Huawei mate X s a slightly updated version of their mate X folding phone which they first have built last year and although there was a lot of excitement around that unfortunately it only ended up launching in China so here we are with the mate X s and it comes with huawei's latest keren 995 g chip and more durable screen and refined hinge mechanism and a few software tweaks but aside from that not much has really changed although we're still getting the same gorgeous triple screen phone tablet folding thing that we've seen before and I have to say I really really like it I want one so right now as I'm filming this I actually don't have official availability or pricing for the mate XS although I've been told that it's going to come to China and some overseas territories and as for pricing the original mate X was due to cost about 2300 euros in Europe although of course it never came out and hopefully I've been told the new mate success will be a good deal cheaper because Huawei's basically reduced the cost on their production process so if it comes in cheaper than the 2 grand Galaxy fold and this would definitely make it more tempting so for this video I want to focus more on the hardware side of things and also give you my first impressions on what it was like to actually use the mate XS but of course we can't ignore the fact that like the mate 30 Pro and probably the upcoming P 40 Pro the mate XS doesn't support Google mobile services or GM s and so we didn't get the Play Store what that means is out of the box you won't see YouTube Google Maps Gmail or more importantly the Play Store which is obviously where you download all your normal Android apps instead we have the Huawei app gallery which is growing and I think with the amount Huawei we're investing in it maybe in a year or so it'll become a genuine competitor to Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store but for now it's definitely lacking now between the app gallery cloning the apps from your old phone onto this site loading them with apks or using say the Amazon App Store you can probably get most of the apps you need but it is a big hassle and getting the latest updates will be tricky the mate success is running on android 10 though so we get things like night mode and better gestures but it's based on the open source Android platform so again it'll get updates and security patches later than if they were working with Google directly alright so with all that out of the way let me show you around the mate access on the front we have a good sized 6.6 inch screen so you can actually use this like a regular albeit slightly chunky phone then you can open it up and go into full tablet mode with that huge 8-inch screen which just looks stunning especially with the thin bezels and no ugly camera cutout like we get on the Galaxy fold then finally if you want to take a selfie fold it closed again and switch round to the six point three eight inch screen on the back which again can work as a normal phone screen if you like but mostly you'll use it as a viewfinder for the savvy camera and the best part is you're using the same great where cameras for your selfies there's no secondary not as good front-facing camera here so really it's just one big screen but since it's on the outside it virtually splits into three depending on how you're using it fully open in tablet mode while the resolution can adjust dynamically based on your battery life at full wears we're getting 414 pixels per inch versus 264 on the iPad pro and 3 to 6 on the Galaxy fold so it's incredibly sharp on the back we get this little grip which makes it easier to hold when using it like a tablet and it houses all the camera gubbins so obviously there are benefits to having the screen on the outside it means that whether you're using it from the front or the back or opening up into tablet mode it's just using one big screen and then you don't have to worry about a second tiny screen like we get on the Galaxy fold but the downside is unlike the fold which opens up like a book and therefore keeps the screen safe when you're not using it but with the screen on the mate XS always being on the outside I'm a little bit worried about whether it's gonna get scratched or dinged or banged up when I'm just using it or it's sad my pocket while we did ship a protective leather pouch with the original mate X so I'm sure they will again here but when it's not inside that and the same just a little bit worried however while we says the mate excess has a new quad layer flexible OLED screen so it is more durable than before but it is still plastic rather than glass having said that even though samsung's new Galaxy flip uses ultra thin glass it does still have a thin layer of plastic on top so it can still scratch quite easily they've also improved their falconwing hinge it definitely feels sturdier than before and when you press the unlock button to open it up there's a springiness to it it feels good and you can barely see or feel the crease it's much less noticeable than the Galaxy fold or even the flip and like those hallways also added little caps at the edge of the hinge to help prevent dirt and bad stuff getting in I do have one issue though and that's the sound it makes you can just about hear what sounds like the creaking or cracking of plastic when you're folding it it was a pretty loud room so it was hard to pick up on the mic but in person you can definitely hear it and while I was told it's just the sound of the hinge and it's meant to be like that every time it made me wince a little bit thinking that plastic was cracking I'm sure I'd get used to it but it was a little off-putting so the mate success is just five point four millimeters at its thinnest point or 11 millimeters when folded considering the new S 20 Ultra is 8.8 millimeters thick it's pretty impressive actually on the side the power button doubles as a fingerprint reader and on the bottom we get the speaker and a USB C charging port the cameras are all housed in that side bar / grippy thing on the back which I don't think is the technical name for it and it's pretty much the same setup as the original maytag's with a 40 megapixel main lens 16 megapixel ultra wide 12 megapixel telephoto with three times optical five times hybrid and 10 times digital zoom as well as a time-of-flight depth sensor which gives us more realistic bokeh in portrait charts quality why is it should be closer to the p30 pro than the newer made 30 pro but it's still a great camera setup and actually because the rear cameras also act as the front cameras it means the mate excess is pretty much the best selfie camera phone you can buy specs wise we get the new Karen 995 G chip eight gigs of ram and 512 gigs of faster UF s3 storage and powering everything we have a 4500 mAh battery with 55 watts super charging although no wireless charging unfortunately now to make use of that huge 8-inch screen you can swipe in to bring up an edge panel of quick app shortcuts it's very similar to what we get on the Galaxy fold and other Samsung phones but it means we can then easily have two apps side-by-side and split view and even a third floating app on top which you can move around and because there's so much screen space it's actually genuinely comfortable to multitask like this and you can also then save and keep them as individual little desktops like you get on a Mac which you can then switch between in the recently used apps menu it's pretty cool actually so overall I am actually really impressed by the mate XS and well is definitely a refinement rather than revolution of the mate X it's still a really cool bit of kit and I can't wait to test and review properly my thing because our cross that will actually see it outside of China this year and hopefully also it'll be a lower price than the original mate X was as well I do still have a couple of concerns about whether that screens gonna get scratched although while we say is more durable than before also the slight crunching sound it makes when actually folding it which as I say I've been told is how the hinge is supposed to work and supposed to sound but it's a little bit off-putting and of course like if Google is still a big deal I'm hoping that over time as I say the app gallery store does get better maybe there'll be more workarounds but for now it is still definitely worth keeping in mind if you're thinking about buying them 8xs as I say I'll add final pricing and availability in the description below but what do you think would you be tempted to buy one and how big of a deal is the lack of Google for you thank you so much for
