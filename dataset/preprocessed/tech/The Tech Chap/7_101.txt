this is something a little bit special it's the new realme gt 5g and i know it's a cliche and it's really annoying when people say this but this is genuinely as close to a proper flagship killer phone that we've seen in years it really is and with this we're getting a snapdragon triple eight processor and a 120 hertz amoled screen all for just 369 euros when it launches on june 21st that's the same top-of-the-line snapdragon chip used in say the galaxy s21 ultra which costs almost four times as much or more realistically something like the oneplus 9 which also uses it but still costs almost twice as much as this real me gt so i don't think you can get a more powerful phone for less money it's as simple as that that's not to say this is perfect or it's not without compromise to get to this super low price but you can't argue with the value for money but it gets better because i've actually teamed up with realme for a giveaway of the gt not just one or two or three or four or five i actually get to give away 10 of these phones to you guys which i think makes this my biggest giveaway ever for a phone which is amazing so a big thank you to realme for supporting the channel and also you guys with that and i'll give you all the details for how to win at the end of the video so stay tuned and also subscribed obviously so i've been playing with the new real me gt 5g for a couple of weeks now and this is their new flagship all-singing old dancing phone for 2021 which is no surprise given these specs inside the box we have the usual gubbins nothing too crazy until you see that bright yellow design we also get a fast 65 watt dart charger and the usual usbc cable plus a nice little rubber case to keep your phone safe and there it is the famous real me bright yellow which is usually only reserved for the box but this time it's actually on the back of the phone racing yellow it's called along with its two-tone design and well since this phone is all about performance this is clearly a go faster stripe as well but it does kind of remind me of one of these ford mustangs but i genuinely think this looks pretty cool and it feels good to hold as well so it looks and feels like a faux leather and it nicely contrasts with the glossy stripe and it also serves to make it really grippy and comfortable plus it doesn't pick up any smudges or fingerprints i do just have to read this though from their reviewers guide for this and real me say the camera matrix extends infinitely downward paying tribute to the bionic design of the tear-stained headlights the speedy yellow represents the dawn of the bright future at morning a tribute to the young people who are moving at full speed who writes this marketing spiel aside we have this triple lens camera at the top power button on the right hand side volume and the dual sim tray although no micro sd sadly on the left and then on the bottom we get the speaker we do get stereo speakers by the way usb c port and look at that a headphone jack not something you see very often on a top spec phone like this and then finally up front we have this little corner hole punch selfie cut out we also get an in-screen fingerprint reader and the whole thing weighs just 186 grams the only downside really is that there's no wireless charging and also we're not getting any official ip rating so don't take this in the shower with you okay let's not mess around let's see what this thing can do and the entry level model i have here comes with a healthy eight gigs of ram and 128 storage although i did wonder if maybe realme had cut some corners on the speed of the ram and storage but rest assured it's the good stuff ddr5 and ufs 3.1 so i ran the 3dmark wildlife extreme 20 minute stress test to see how the gt would fare and these are the results but then if i bring in the brand new oneplus nord ce which just launched and costs about the same as this but with a snapdragon 750 g and also the oneplus 9 which was one of the cheapest triple a phones you could buy you can see there's really no compromise with the gt despite its lower price so no surprises really anything you throw at this it just breezes through and of course since we have this 120 hertz screen it'll fully max out games that support the high refresh all it's missing is a couple of shoulder buttons and a clip-on fan and this would be a proper gaming phone and naturally the performance carries over to everyday use as well so we're getting android 11 out of the box but you can actually install the android 12 beta straight away if you want to and we also have realme's ui 2.0 skin on top yes there's the usual pre-installed apps and bloatware that helps them keep the cost down a little bit but i just remove or hide them away in a folder so it's not a big deal and generally i find the ui really nice to use it's fast i like having the google news feed left at the home screen there's a ton of customization options and actually i quite like some of the options you get in the labs menu as well i keep smooth scrolling and dc dimming turned on and also really promises at least two years of android updates so the headline really is the fact that we're getting the snapdragon 8 at this price point but the other big selling point for me is the fact that we're getting this 120 hertz amoled screen because i've reviewed the latest realme 8 and 85g and that's always kind of like a balance between do you want high refresh with an lcd screen or amoled at 60 hertz it's often like this sort of balancing act just because they're trying to keep the cost down and there's always a bit of a compromise but not with this this is the best of both worlds plus we're getting a 360 hertz touch sampling rate which is particularly useful for gaming and in the display settings you can switch between p3 srgb and brilliant picture modes although i tend to keep it in vivid and i also turned on the edge lighting i think the neon purple looks quite snazzy as for the battery it's okay it gets me through a full day i usually have about 25 left by 11 pm uh we're getting a decent sized 4 500 milliamp hour battery in here which is pretty good given the size of the phone overall but obviously we do have that 120 hertz with that pretty powerful processor so that does have an impact particularly of course if you are playing games all day although i did find one hour of gaming used up about 22 of the battery so the battery life is fine it's good nothing really to write home about but of course we do also have that fast 65 watt dark charging so you can top it up nice and quickly and then there's the camera which i think as we all pretty much expected is kind of the only area that makes this not quite the full flagship killer that it could have been but it's still pretty good it's a triple lens setup with a 64 megapixel main 16 megapixel ultra wide and a macro lens so no telephoto here and also the main lens does use sony's older imx 682 sensor which is the same one you get in say last year's realme 7 pro but it still does a good job yes it's not going to quite compete with your s21 ultra iphone 12 pro max but again given that 325 pound-ish early bird price it's pretty damn good for the money colors are accurate and not too over-saturated skin tones are realistic and dynamic range is actually very good with bright clouds and dark shadows equally well exposed although the quality does dip in lower light as you'd expect there's more noise and fine detail gets a little softer but the night mode does help things out a little bit we do also get this ultra macro mode which is fine but honestly the quality is a bit iffy and it's not something i'd use very often we do get stabilized 4k30 video though which is great to see it tops out at 4k60 but there's no 8k and also the front video caps at 1080p which is fine but again not quite flagship so should you buy this well downsides there's no micro sd no ip water resistance so so battery and the camera is good but not amazing but on the plus side we get this fantastic design top-notch performance with impressive cooling this lovely screen fast charging and just a completely unbeatable price so hats off to real me they've produced a stunning incredibly good value phone and i highly recommend it and i will leave links below if you want to check it out although i should say the entry level model with eight gigs of ram and 128 storage will only be on aliexpress which you can still buy in the uk but the higher spec one with 12 gigs of ram and 256 storage will be coming to amazon and i'll leave links to both in the description as well as everything else you need to know but i know why you guys have been watching to the end not just to listen to me waffle on it's because you won't know how you can win one of these well it's very simple actually i will leave a gleam link in the description below and also in the pinned comments so just follow that and there's a bunch of ways you can enter i have 10 phones to give away it is uk and europe only i'm afraid that's just a logistical restriction i was given and also this will only be running for two days i will pick the winners on the 17th confirm with them uh and then let you guys know via pin comment as well and if you are one of the lucky ten uh to win it would be amazing if you could then share your thoughts maybe a quick review of what you think of it when you receive your device both myself and realme would love to know what you guys think of this as well thank you so much for watching guys i'll see you next time right here in this very hot and muggy studio i've gotta figure out the airflow for this place in the studio next time on the tech chat thanks for watching
