hey guys ant Omnitech and this is the new twenty20 match book Pro 13 I've been looking forward to apples refresh of the 13 for ages and while I think a lot of us myself included thought that maybe we'd get a MacBook Pro 14 with slightly thinner bezels and a slightly bigger screen like we did on the MacBook Pro 16 here's one I made earlier in fact no it's the same screen the same design same battery and in some cases which I'll explain in a second the same specs so the big upgrades here are the keyboard we now get the fantastic magic keyboard which Apple introduced on a 16 and then most recently the air and on some models more powerful hardware although that's where things get a little more complicated so I've actually bought this one myself it's the cheapest model it is the 1,300 pound or $1300 MacBook Pro 13 which is technically known as the MacBook Pro 13 20 22 Thunderbolt 3 model as opposed to the highest spec for Thunderbolt 3 model which starts from 1800 pounds or $1,800 although despite the name there's more to it than just the 2 extra ports so while this is the tooth and of offering model I should be getting the 4 Thunderball 3 model early next week so stay tuned for the full comparison but as I say the main upgrade is on the inside with all the fuss over the fancy Intel 10th gem processors faster iris + graphics and faster ddr4 X Ram however if you look closely at the specs you'll see that you have to pay at least 1,800 pounds for the one with all the shiny new parts in fact this base model comes with an 8th gen i5 eight gigs of pretty slow ddr3 RAM and 256 gigs of storage which to be fair is doubled from the previous base model so we are getting more for our money but aside from that the two Thunderbolt 3 model here has exactly the same specs as the last gen 20-19 laptop essentially we're just getting a better keyboard and double the storage so on the one hand yes it is a better laptop for keyboards nice thick so storage is nice but on the other for a mid 2020 mic Book Pro 13 refresh still getting 8th gen specs still getting 21 33 megahertz RAM and little Kostya 1300 creds seems just a little bit cheeky almost to give you some context this is the latest Dell XPS 13 the 9300 model and it starts at 14 100 pounds or $1,400 which is a hundred more than the MacBook Pro 13 but you get I'd argue a much sleeker looking laptop that's also lighter but importantly it comes with a 10th gender much faster ddr4 Ram and double the storage 512 gigs if you guys would like to see a full comparison video between the Dell XPS 13 and the macbook pro 13 do let me know in the comments below and hopefully that's something I can do for you guys soon but the point is if you want a macbook pro 13 a new one with 20/20 specs you're gonna have to pay 1,800 pounds which is an awful lot of money for a laptop that despite pro being in the name still doesn't offer any kind of dedicated graphics card option that still reserved for the maple pro 16 where we get the AMD radeon 5300 M or 5500 M and starts at 2400 so a good deal more than this but some good news for those of you with deep pockets but maybe not deep enough for the pro 16 you can now spec the 4 Thunderbolt 3 pro 13 up to 32 gigs of ram and they're walking 4 terabytes of storage which is double the 16 gig and 2 terabyte options we had on the 2019 model so it's good to have these extra options another advantage of the highest spec 4 Thunderbolt 3 model is along with the new processors we get faster integrated graphics Intel's naming scheme is a bit confusing but on the cheaper model we get the iris plus 645 chip which is the same as last year and has 48 execution units versus 60-80 use with what simply called iris + I'll compare these two properly in my next video but we can see a potential 40% boost in graphics with the fourth and a bath remodel not only that but the more powerful iris plus supports a technology called display stream compression which means it will fully support apples XDR display in regards to sticking with all the chips in the cheaper models my understanding is that Apple just want to offer the MacBook Pro form factor to as many people as possible with a premium option for those who can afford it but alongside a more affordable model and to their credit prices haven't gone up and we're getting more for our money with double of storage and they listen to our feedback for the keyboard the other thing I want to mention is we're getting the same pretty average 720p FaceTime webcam it's the same one that we get on the pro 16 the same one as last year and also we're still getting Wi-Fi five there's no Wi-Fi six we've been nice to see those upgrades on this guy but I know a lot of you guys including myself have been eagerly waiting for this the pro 16 is out of too big or just too expensive for most of us and the MacBook Air again here is one I made earlier is perhaps not powerful enough for what you want as a pro user so this is what we've been all waiting for and I think unless you're willing to pay you know the 500-pound premium to get the four Thunderball three model with the faster processor faster graphics faster RAM and the two extra ports well it seems just a bit of a lackluster upgrade although I want to reiterate just how awesome the keyboard is on this thing it uses the updated scissor mechanism and then say it's my favorite keyboard on any laptop plus we get the same sharp and accurate screen incredible build quality and the love it or hate it touch bar battery life should be about the same - but I need to test that properly so it's still a terrific laptop but value for money is important to pretty much all of us I just don't know if we're getting that with this guy however looking at the lineup as a whole from the 1000 pound MacBook Air the 1,300 pounds MacBook Pro 13 and then the 2,400 pound MacBook Pro 16 obviously there is something for pretty much every budget and I will try and do a full comparison video a Mac buying guide if you will as soon as I can although just quickly here's how the cheapest MacBook Air with an i3 processor compares to the new cheapest macbook pro which has an i-5 in terms of processor performance so as you can see even though we're getting 8th gen chips the fact that it is a quad core i5 while in the dual core i3 we're getting double the Maltese core performance but almost exactly the same single core so for my full review all those comparisons with a different MATLAB tops and also the XPS 13 and probably also the upcoming XPS 15 and 17 there's so many laptops at the moment do make sure you hit that subscribe button down below so you don't miss our and also I am trying to hit that 1 million subscriber mark so if you haven't already it would be amazing if you could give me a cheeky little subscribe but what do you make of the new pro 13 do you think that better keyboard and the doubling of the base storage is enough to tempt you to upgrade if you've been holding out and also would you pay that extra 500 quid or so to get the 2020 spec essentially of this let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys I'll see you next time right here on the tech channel
