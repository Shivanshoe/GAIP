okay so the tv i've been dying to get my hands on for over a year now has finally been announced and actually it's not the gigantic 97-inch lg oled g2 although one of those will be very nice and hopefully i'll get to review it soon but it's actually this the 42-inch lg c2 oled that's right of all the crazy new tvs unveiled at ces the one i want is the smallest one because we were promised this by lg display at ces last year it never came out and we were just sort of left hoping for it in fact the one i've got behind me is a 55 inch c1 you could get a smaller 48 inch but the 42 never came out which is the one i really wanted because for me that size would make the perfect gaming monitor bedroom tv or just an older tv that i could recommend to my friends who actually don't want a big tv they do still exist but maybe the best bit is it's not just lg getting in on the action because sony's just unveiled its brand new oled lineup which includes a 42 inch master series a90k which i can't wait to test and unlike previous sonys it actually supports vrr out of the box so it should be great for gaming by the way if you do enjoy this video then a cheeky little like and subscribe would be lovely so all the big tv manufacturers have announced their 2022 lineups and lg have been showing off their new oled tvs including the slightly cut down more affordable a2 and b2 series then there's the more mainstream and popular c2 the higher end g2 series which is the gallery edition and right at the top we have the crazy expensive z2 series and these should start being available from around may and one of the big headlines this year is that most of the new models get lg display's new oled x panel technology which promises to boost peak brightness meaning better hdr and also weirdly smaller bezels and that's alongside new processors new software we're getting web os 22 now and a few of the tweaks but for me the two big tv announcements from lg in particular are the 42 inch c2 and also that gigantic 97 inch g2 i've actually been using the g1 and previously the gx the g10 as my main sort of living room tv in my house uh for the past couple of years i love those things although i would be curious if i could get away with a 97 inch tv in my living room but more realistically and a lot more affordably affordably is that word the lg 42 inch c2 is weirdly the only model that actually comes in this new smaller 42 inch variant you can't get the cheaper a or b series in 42 inch on the plus side the c series is lg's top seller for a reason it packs in most of the latest and greatest features into a reasonably mainstream tv that significantly undercuts its slimmer g series sibling i reckon this could be the ideal size for a big immersive gaming display at your desk but without being too overwhelming and also still being big enough to double maybe as a regular tv when you're sat further away from it making it a good fit for smaller spaces and it's oled which of course means deep blacks rich colors great hdr and responsiveness including dobby vision support which of course we don't get on samsung's tv still and this is just something you don't find on regular desk monitors unless you're willing to pay thousands and thousands of pounds and it gives you all the gaming features you'd want whether you're going to hook this up to your gaming pc or your ps5 or series x it's 4k 120 hertz we get g-sync and freesync premium pro adaptive syncs auto low latency mode low response times and also some new upgrades for this year that i'll come back to in just a second i think it was just over a year ago now i actually tried the lg c148 as a desktop monitor i thought obviously with all those gaming features and being oled and also not ridiculously expensive at 48 inches it was like a thousand pounds or something i thought that'd be a great desktop monitor which it would be except the desk which i'm actually still using over there and you can see i've got my ultra wide on currently just wasn't deep enough so i did actually find myself getting eye strain headaches it just wasn't comfortable obviously with a deeper desk or if i set a bit further away it would still work and i think lg does have one eye at least on this desk use as well because the new stand positions the display higher so it's actually more in line with your eye as well as also leaving more room for keyboards mice and other peripherals you may have underneath just a quick word though on the 42-inch sony a90k because this seems like it could be a really good alternative as the specs look very similar and it gets a dual layout stand which also allows for peripherals like sound bars underneath now i'm not saying i will replace that with the new 42 inch tv because i love my ultra wide it's the uh what just so happens to also be an lg the 38wn 95c which is still my favorite monitor of all time so i don't know if i can go back to a standard 16x9 even if it is a lot bigger uh going from 21 by 10 i think that's right because it's a bit taller but i am very curious how it would compare so hopefully in the next few weeks or well a couple of months i will do a side by side and see if again now i can actually transition to a tv as a desktop work and gaming display speaking of gaming if you are lucky enough to have a ps5 then you know how quickly that 667 gigs fills up i cannot recommend enough expanding your storage with one of these this is the one terabyte crucial p5 plus this pcie gen 4 m2 drive is fully compatible with the ps5 and we're looking at some ridiculous read speeds of around 6 600 megabytes per second now certainly do also recommend using a heatsink to keep it cooler over longer periods and there are loads of options to choose from and most are simply a case of peeling off the adhesive strip and well sticking it on top all right so after about five minutes it's installed and all i have to do now is tell it to format the new drive and i'm good to go now with over one and a half terabytes of space and it just means i'm not going to need to uninstall anything for a long time so i'll leave a link below for the crucial p5 plus if you want to check it out and also the heatsink i'm using and a big thank you to crucial for partly sponsoring this video okay enough obsessing over the size let's talk about some of the key upgrades across the whole new oled lineup and the biggest upgrade has to be that brightness boosting oled evo tech which uses lg's deuterium based oled x panel cleverness to increase peak brightness by up to 30 percent if you believe the press release and crucially without reducing panel lifespan or increasing the risk of burning although despite sharing the same name it's not actually the same technology as we saw in the g1 and z1 series last year it is a bit different and this new oled evo tech also allows for smaller bezels down from an already small six mil down to four mil on the 65 inch and above models but this is where things get a little bit complicated and where we see the differences between the range of oleds for example lg claims the c2 can hit up to 900 nits of peak brightness which isn't gonna bother the mini led competition but it still goes a long way toward addressing what is really the oled's biggest shortcoming however the more affordable a2 and b2 series don't get this new evo uh oladivo technology so they won't get quite as bright as that i can't say for sure but we're probably looking at a similar sort of six seven hundred nits as we saw over the last couple of years and crushingly the biggest disappointment of all is this new c2 42 inch the one that i really want and actually anything below 55 inches in the c range also don't get that higher brightness technology it's not the end of the world i mean we've been living with these fantastic oleds for a while now and we've not all just thrown in the bin because they're too dark but it is a bit of a shame that even the bigger sizes in the same range the same c2 range do get it above 55 but the 48 and 42 don't aside from that all new lg tvs get a new processor we're looking at the alpha 9 gen 5 on the c2 and the g2 and the z2 and also the less powerful alpha 7 gen 5 on the a2 and b2 all of which bring improved tone mapping and ai which can upscale sources directly to 4k rather than using intermediate steps as before which should improve image quality all of the oleds are 4k and every model except the cheapest a series supports 120 hertz and actually now with a higher bandwidth 48 gigabits per second hdmi 2.1 ports try saying that three times very quickly uh that's up from 40 gigabits per second on last year although that won't really make a difference for like 99.9 percent of us that all sounds great but actually in the real world the one upgrade i really want to see and hopefully this gen 5 processor will deliver is a slightly more responsive home screen it's probably my biggest criticism of the one series the 2021 lineup because we have this new full screen home page which is great for seeing more content at once but it just feels a bit laggy and a bit slow so hopefully i haven't tried it in person yet this will be a bit quicker there is one more upgrade though and it's not the picture quality or the features it's actually the weight i think this is probably the most underappreciated upgrade of the new tvs for example the new 65-inch c2 believe it or not weighs just over half what last year's c1 did thanks to new composite materials maybe you won't notice it in day to day viewing but you definitely will if you've ever had to move it or wall mount it just a quick word on the a2 and the b2 series though because the a2 which is the most affordable does top out at 60 hertz it doesn't support 120 so maybe isn't ideal for gamers the b2 does get you 120 hertz but then it has that slightly slower uh alpha 7 gen 5 processor role in the alpha 9. so it's not going to be quite as good for that image processing and up scaling but if pricing is aggressive enough then maybe the b2 could actually become a more popular option now going back to the g2 gallery series not only are we getting the oled x oled evo upgrades but we're also getting bigger sizes both 83 and that whopping 97-inch version now as previously it topped out at 77 inches which is what i'm currently using apparently lg can build them this big now after reducing material weight and these get all the same upgrades the c2 does and a bit more including a new brightness booster mode which should be the c2 and the older g1 in sustained brightness of up to a thousand nits thanks to more aggressive brightness algorithms and also a new thermal dissipation heatsink which draws heat from the panel theoretically allowing it to display higher brightness for longer without increasing the danger of burn-in now there are no firm figures how long they can sustain that peak brightness and really i can't give you a full judgment until i get it in the studio and test and review it myself the other benefit is we should also be getting slimmer bezels and being the gallery series the g2 gets that gorgeous though slightly tweaked slimline design now with a nice silver strip around the edges the thing is though all these oled tvs are pretty expensive particularly the g series and the zed series so on the more affordable end lg have also announced their second gen q ned tvs which use mini led backlights and these are actually a lot brighter than oleds although they can't quite compete with that infinite contrast of pixels being able to turn themselves off and on on a oled tv but they are more affordable particularly if you want bigger sizes or indeed 8k models i still think i would prefer a 4k oled over a 8k mini led but the gap between mini led and oled is smaller than ever so it's worth considering so arguably there isn't a night and day difference with these new 2022 tvs so i'm not going to chuck that in the bin straight away but there are some nice upgrades and i can't wait to test and review them myself and of course see what samsung and sony are doing as well sony particularly uh have announced their new qd oled their quantum dot oleds which i can't wait to test out and actually may finally beat lg at their own game but we'll have to see all i know is i'm going to be making a lot more tv videos this year so if you did enjoy this and want to see more from me then don't forget to hit that subscribe button let me know if you're thinking about upgrading your tv this year and to what model and i'll see you guys next time right here on the tech chat
