[Music] there's always been three reasons to buy a pixel it's stock vanilla android which means it's fast and also the first to get updates the cameras are among the best on the market and usually they're pretty good value for money and so here we are with the pixel 6 pro the first flagship phone from google since the 4xl two years ago and despite a very frustrating review embargo that maybe gave the impression google wants to hide something the good news is you don't have anything to worry about this is an exceptional phone and still hits those three main reasons to buy a pixel and aside from a couple of little bugs here and there i've not had any problems with this and considering the price this is 849 in the uk and 899 in the us which puts it in the same ballpark as the s21 plus and the oneplus 9 pro and about halfway between the iphone 13 and 13 pro so well clear of the ultras and pro maxes of this world that cost over a grand but i would argue this is still a genuine competitor and actually it's little brother the pixel 6 which costs just 5.99 is the same price as the pixel 5 was at launch which was a much smaller and more budget-oriented phone in fact while this is my review for the 6 pro while we're here i would say that the pixel 6 is probably the best phone you can get for 600 quid right now so it's a good start but what's that new tensor core been like to use uh do these cameras live up to the hype and is this actually worth buying well the very first thing you'll notice is this is a big phone with a 6.7 inch 120 hertz quad hd plus screen it is gorilla glass vectors front and back and also ip68 so it checks all the durability boxes but you'll absolutely want to put a case on this as it is very slippery and every time i pull out of my pocket i feel like i'm snagging the camera bump on something the standard pixel 6 is a much more manageable size i know not everyone's a fan but i do really like the look of this thing and as i mentioned in my unboxing the first time you pick it up because of these curved edges to the screen which i know is also quite divisive it's got a kind of huawei esque vibe about it with that premium feel i have the six pro in cloudy white and it kind of looks like a dual tone panda style of the pixel 2 xl but with jordy leforge's visor stuck on it or maybe that's just me i would avoid the black though it's a bit dull and it picks up fingerprints really easily however very frustratingly the different colors have different storage options so only the black gets the 256 gig version here in the uk and a 512 option in the us so if you want cloudy white in 256 then you're out of luck and also the fact that in the uk this tops out at 256 which is a bit annoying because there's no micro sd card support and well for a flagship phone i just want an option for more storage also why is this antenna band at the top here a different shade of white to this it kind of looks like someone's just tip x the top of it one of my bigger issues is the fact that we don't get any kind of face unlock with the pixel 6 or 6 pro we have an optical fingerprint reader which is fine but where's the face unlocking most android phones offer both and of course on the iphone we have that fantastic true depth face id although no fingerprint but come on where did all that fancy project solely radar motion tracking stuff go did they just throw in the bin because it's not the end of the world but it just feels a bit basic so now i've got that off my chest let's talk about some good stuff and as i was showing my lovely wife sarah the new six pro because she's very excited to upgrade to this and telling her about oh look it's adaptive 120 hertz now and look how fast it is with android 12 and also how the color of the ui changes with the tone of your wallpaper which i must admit is quite cool and of course also trying to explain the tensor core chip but then i think she's zoned out however when we went to my local cathedral the other day which had a giant moon exhibit as you do we took a whole bunch of photos but there were people in the background which is where the new magic eraser tool comes in and right there and then it convinced her she needed this phone snap a photo open it in the photo editor tap magic eraser and it'll scan the photo for people you want to back to the future style fade out of existence including yourself if you want to if you zoom right in then you'll be able to tell but this was a particularly tricky shot with those straight lines on the pillar behind them and while you could also do this in photoshop this is instant doesn't require any skills which is great for me and it's on your phone although only photos taken on the pixel 6 and 6 pro actually work with this i sent one over from my pixel 4 xl to test it and you just don't get that magic eraser option oh and just a quick mention of the lovely people over at surfsharkvpn who are very kindly sponsoring this

camera and it's a familiar gcam ui and as you can see we have a 0.7 times ultra wide lens the main lens then a two times digital slash hybrid zoom and a four times optical zoom thanks to that telephoto lens and you can also punch right in up to a 20 times super resume which is a kind of hybridy ai smart zoom thingymajig however they do it it works incredibly well and it's probably the best zoom outside of the s21 and well maybe the huawei p50 pro or something but you know we do also have these new motion camera modes with action pan which focuses on a moving subject and then blowing out the background and long exposure which well it's a long exposure good for light trails and things action pan is kind of fun at least i had some fun getting my friend damn to run around as i tested it but the edge detection is a bit dodgy and with multiple subjects it just doesn't seem to work very well considering it's proud of place next to the main photo tab for me at least it feels a bit gimmicky although i do still appreciate the shadows brightness and now temperature controls that we get when you tap on the screen in photo mode but aside from occasionally upping the shadows a bit i don't really find myself using this too much really i just want to rely on the pixel zone processing because while we are getting a smart hdr plus live preview on the camera we still have that familiar take a photo wait a couple of seconds for it to fully process then go oh that turned out pretty good but i guess like the motion stuff it's there if you want it so i actually counted them up and i've taken over a thousand photos with the six pro over the last week or so and i'm going to show you every single one right now [Music] okay not really but i have come away very impressed with the pixel 6 pro there's a couple of hiccups like the white balance can sometimes be a bit off in low light shots this moon should be white not blue for example but most of the time i'm pretty blown away by the detail the dynamic range and the realistic color and skin tones i really just want to make this video an hour long to show you every photo and while of course photography is incredibly subjective it does lack that brighter vibrancy of an iphone that a lot of people prefer i think this nicely balances a more contrasty realistic look with an exceptional level of detail and we do still get that awesome astrophotography mode it does need to be perfectly still on a tripod and it takes a few minutes but if you have a clear night sky then there's no other phone that can take a night sky photo like this the selfies are top notch with good light but pretty hit and miss and darker conditions even using the selfie night sight and the screen illumination flash now if we switch over to video i don't think this quite lives up to the same standard as the photography side of things it's still good but it can't match the ridiculously smooth stabilization you get on an iphone and while detail and dynamic range is impressive with good light in darker conditions we still have that auto white balance issues again this moon in the cathedral appears to be blue right up until i get close and then it switches to its natural white color and in some shots i'm getting a crazy amount of noise which doesn't feel like a flagship phone at all but then in other low-light video clips the noise isn't as bad but we do also see lots of lens flares so pixels have never had the best video and while i think this is a good step up from before there is still room for improvement here but the flexibility of having the ultra wide the telephoto and surprisingly impressive long range super red zoom with that overall quality and the final control you get in the app for me at least puts a nice big tick next to that second tenet of what makes a good pixel the camera but what about this new tensor core chip powering everything because like apple it's google's own chip powering their own phone so uh you'd hope there'd be some efficiency savings there and i am keen to see what developers can do with its machine learning ai chops it's kind of hard to say what the chip actually unlocks or you know enables right now perhaps that magic eraser tool wouldn't be possible without it and of course the isp on the chip handles all the camera processing but still it's great to see google trying something different and it actually holds its own against the snapdragon triple eight it falls down a little bit in multi-core performance but then actually beats the snapdragon in the 3dmark graphics test the iphone still comes out on top but it's an impressive showing from the new kid and if we jump into a bit of call of duty mobile it's actually a dead tie between them in terms of load times so google's tensor core does a surprisingly good job and together with stock android 12 that 120 hertz screen and a very healthy 12 gigs of ram on the 6 pro this thing is incredibly fast and responsive as i say i did experience a couple of bugs where the screen wouldn't respond or there was a slight pause but that seems to be getting better and better with each update so google's promising five years of security updates with the six series and also of course with this you'll be the very first to get the brand new versions of android when they come out rather than waiting six nine twelve months like most android phones and i do also really like the style of android 12 with this fully redesigned drop down shortcuts bar lots more customization including the ui matching the wallpaper colors this new extra dim mode is handy if you embed scrolling through reddit as you do and want an even darker screen so you're not disturbing your partner plus we get some nice extras like live translate so you can actually download languages and use it offline with the camera app and it works so i reckon for me this is the best way to experience android i used to say that was the oneplus 9 series with the oxygen os but more recently it's turning into a more color os from oppo which is fine but if you want that pure vanilla android the good stuff then this is the best way of experiencing it it's lovely to use what [Music] a couple of other things to note the haptic feedback feels very good we also get stereo speakers which are decent and there's a good amount of bass but the bottom firing speaker is definitely louder and richer than the top so it can sound a little bit uneven sometimes another minor complaint is the screen doesn't get as bright as some of its competitors we're looking at about 675 nits in normal use and it peaks at just over a thousand for hdr content which is still good but not the 1100 and almost 1300 respectively on the iphone 13 pro but on the whole the screen is top notch well top hole punch and because it's an ltpo panel it can dynamically adjust between 10 and 120 hertz which should save battery so what about battery well i've left this till last because well i just want to talk about other stuff first there's absolutely nothing wrong with it unlike a lot of the older pixels which really did suffer with battery life uh perhaps until you use it for a few months and the ai started recognizing your patterns and it got a bit better out of the box battery life with this is very good thanks to a very healthy 5 000 million power battery by about 11 pm at night i still have 25 of my battery left on the 6 pro which is almost as good as my s21 ultra which tends to have about 30 uh but unfortunately nowhere near the 40 or so i still have left on my 13 pro max but for an android phone and a pixel at that the battery life is very good plus it does support fast 30 watt charging although you will have to pay 25 quid extra for the privilege of being able to do that because you don't get a charger in the box it also supports up to 23 watt wireless charging if you have the new pixel stand otherwise it's 12 watts on normal qi charges and also we do have reverse wireless charging if you want to top up other devices albeit slowly so let's wrap up and my biggest issues with the pixel 6 pro include the lack of face unlocking uh also that storage is a bit stingy particularly outside the us and especially if you want it in the good colors also in some ways the tensor core doesn't quite keep up with the competition and we are expecting a brand new snapdragon in a couple of months so this might fall behind even further but if none of those are deal breakers for you and they're certainly not for me then absolutely get yourself a 6 pro it's a massive update over previous pixels the camera is very impressive if not flawless battery solid and they undercut the big dogs in price and so for me as google kind of always intended this is the go-to android phone and it kind of makes you wonder why you should then splurge on something like the s21 ultra or you know an iphone for over a grand when this does pretty much everything you need and it certainly makes you consider why anyone would want to buy a oneplus 9 anymore as much as i love these phones i would just go for the pixel 6 pro or even the pixel 6 uh for 599 which possibly is the better buy i mean you get the same cameras minus that telephoto lens and also a slightly lower resolution selfie 90 hertz full hd screen instead but it's also a bit smaller so that uh difference in ppi isn't a big deal the battery actually my testing is pretty much neck and neck between the two and it's also a lot more comfortable to hold plus 250 pounds cheaper so actually um i think the six is gonna be the best bet for most people but if you do want the bigger size the nicer design arguably and that telephoto lens and well the better screen then yeah the six pro is an easy recommendation but what do you reckon will you be getting one of these or not and if not why not let me know in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you did enjoy the video which
