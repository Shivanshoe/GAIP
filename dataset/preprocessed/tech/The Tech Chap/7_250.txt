hey guys Anton a tech job but Intel have finally finally revealed their new tenth generation desktop processors including what they're calling the world's fastest gaming processor the eye 9/10 900k which is a ten core chip twenty threads and turbo boosts up to a massive 5.3 gigahertz no bad all if things aren't quite that simple as for the rest of the range well there's a ton of them including all the usual suspects like the eighth course sixteen thread i7 ten 700k and the six core twelfth red eye five ten six hundred K which are probably the pic of the mid high-end chips for gaming but the big question what exactly is new here well we're getting slightly faster clock speeds enhancements to overclocking which should make it a little bit easier they also support faster RAM on the i7 on the a9 and crucially this is really important actually every single processor even the cheapest base I three supports hyper threading so a whole new line up some pretty decent upgrades but of course the next question is pricing and it looks like they're pretty much gonna match like like the current pricing of the nine series processors that we get at the moment which is fine at least it's not going up but it would have been nice to see maybe some more competitive pricing to really take the fight to AMD unfortunately though we are looking at a whole new socket LGA 1200 coming with the new series of Z 490 motherboards so if you do want the new processor you also gonna have to buy a new motherboard as well so it's gonna get pricey and funnily enough as I was actually filming this video I had to pause because it was knock on the door and I had a delivery of this guy it's the sub rent 2 terabyte PCA for nvme SSD and I'm actually gonna be using this in my thread Ripper three build which I'm working on the moment and will be replacing my main video editing rig that's a whole different topic a whole different video but crucially PCIe for which AMD Rison and thread Ripper the latest motherboards do support but unfortunately these new 10th gen processors from Intel don't officially support PCI 4 which isn't a big deal right now but you know if you're gonna be paying a bunch of money for a new processor and a motherboard it would have been nice if they're a bit more future proof so fortunately we can have to wait until the eleventh series of Intel chips rocket League rocket League no rocket Lake what can't legally been a good name but for official PCI for support some motherboards may actually in themselves but we very costly probably not the most efficient so yeah that's a little bit disappointing I'd say but the good news is we do get Wi-Fi six support anyway let's get back to the king of the hill the I nine ten nine hundred K and for the same price as the current ninety nine hundred K you get two extra cores and threads and of course the claimed boost clocks up to five point three gigahertz out of the box the problem though is that they're 5.3 gigahertz boost only applies to one core everything else maxes out at four point nine gigahertz but crucially Intel doesn't say how long you can sustain these boost clock speeds as well because really all comes down to your system and what your cooling solution is however the good news is that it's not just a case of same old same old intel is doing things a little bit differently this time if you've ever researched buying a new processor before then you've probably come across the term silicon lottery where supposedly identical chips actually perform differently sometimes by a decent margin now tenth gen CPUs automatically test each core and then prioritize the two best performers to boost first and highest which is where we get that 5.3 gigahertz figure on the ten 900k and without raising the voltage but to be clear I don't have the physical chip yet but I have been in an Intel briefing so I know all about the new chips which is what I'm giving you this news video but I will of course test them all properly and see what categories we're getting in the real life in the in the real life in the real world when I get it soon so while Intel has struggled to match AMD on core count in the past again they're fighting back with core frequency and Intel claimed that 60% of games are still optimized for single cores where higher clock speeds will make a bigger difference especially when it comes to reducing latency and to help them do this they've reduced the actual dye thickness while increasing the thermal interface solder which is much better at dissipating Heat intel's also concentrated on improving the overclocking experience so this time around instead of turning hyper-threading either on or off we can now enable or disable it for individual cause so for example telling a few virtual cores off may help in reducing heat and allows you to optimize your system for the programs that you use and how you make use of those threads you also now get the option of controlling voltages using a frequency curve which should allow for extra fine tuning so Intel are claiming double-digit performance games even versus the current 1900 K and even up to 18% better performance in Adobe Premiere Pro which makes sense given the boost in frequency and the two extra chords I will of course testa or myself but that does sound like a decent upgrade Intel's figures for improvements compared to a three year old i7 7700 K are much higher of course anywhere from 35 to 81 percent although a pinch of salt is always advised with a company's own numbers okay sounds pretty good overall then but why am I still a little bit worried well like the rest of the range it's still based on Intel's virtually prehistoric 14 nanometer process admittedly a very refined process but it struggles to compete versus AMD's current rise in 3000 series which are built on the far more efficient and cooler 7 nanometer process now normally chip makers improve performance by making the processor itself more efficient but Intel can only get so far with that 14 nanometers so instead they've increased power consumption or TDP from 95 watts to 125 watts on the i5 i7 and i9 and as usual this figure only applies to base clocks and from Somali reports I've seen on performance it looks like the top-end chip could break 300 watts under heavy load that's a lot although no great surprise I guess as we saw the 125 watt 9900 KS hitting 250 watts in some cases if this is the case then you're going to want some pretty beefy and probably quite expensive cooling to take full advantage of in your PC which could limit their value proposition vs. AMD now speaking of AMD matching chips like for like to the risin 3001 up is a bit tricky Intel retains their clock speed advantage so for purely gaming they're likely to still be the best choice they may not be the best value though the 10900 K is due to retail for 10 dollars less than the 3900 X but that chip offers two extra cores and should be better for highly threaded workloads I think the i7 10 700 K though could be a good gaming option as its priced between the rise and thigh 700 X and 3,800 X and we'll run a few hundred megahertz quicker so altogether I'd say I'm cautiously excited I mean they are pushing the benchmarks we are going to see better performance with the higher clock speeds with the extra cores and threads and it is great to see hyper threading across the lineup but it is all of the cost of a higher TDP so unless you have pretty beefy cooling I'm not sure if we're gonna get the best out of it and crucially even if Intel can claim the world's fastest gaming processor that doesn't necessarily mean you should buy it is it the best value well again all these things I'll be covering in my full review and some comparison videos coming soon and don't forget aim DS got their 4000 series desktop processors coming out in September so Intel's really got a fight on their hands this year but of course all this competition is great for me new for the consumer either will get a better value or will see more innovation but what do you reckon have you been holding off your PC upgrade for 10th gen are you excited for it or you already sold on Rison let me know what you think in the comments below I can't wait to test them so make sure you do hit a subscribe button below so you don't miss all my videos thank you so much for watching guys I'll see you next time right here on the tech chair you
