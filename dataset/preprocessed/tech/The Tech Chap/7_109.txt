[Music] all right let's do this hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is the new 24-inch apple imac i'm all in on my purple theme today to match the imac but the question is should you buy it is it big upgrade you'll also notice that the quality of this video is a little bit different because i'm actually shooting all these talking head a-roll shots with the new built-in 1080p facetime camera and also using the triple microway away array that we get built in i've got this guy my usual level a mic as a backup but also if i switch between them that might give you an idea of how the inbuilt mics compare but yeah let me know what you think of the video and audio quality in the comments and let's dive into this review should you buy the new imac okay i'm not gonna lie there is something a little bit special about unboxing and setting up the new imac from the packaging to the genuine surprise of just how thin and light this thing is when you pull it out to the quite literal plug-and-play setup you just connect the magnetic power adapter turn on your bluetooth keyboard touch pad and or mouse and press the power button that's it oh and you can also now log in with the touch id button on your fancy new color matched keyboard which also lets you instantly switch users if your partner or your kids also have a login so apple actually sent me the whole shebang for this review i've got all the peripherals i've got one of the higher spec imacs it's this one with the 8 core cpu and 8 core gpu also upgraded 16 gigs of ram and 512 storage plus i've got the touch id keyboard and both the magic mouse and magic trackpad all in we're looking at about 2 grand although it does start from a slightly less eye-watering 1250 pounds which is about the same as a new macbook pro 13. so there's a lot new here there's a lot to talk about and actually if i just shimmy across a little bit and leave room for the full spec list let's get the specs out of the way first to give you an idea what we are getting with the new imac and also if you guys do enjoy this video and my commitment to the purple theme of actually buying a mug from anthropology and also a purple shirt then a like and a subscribe will be lovely so there's a couple of things that strike me straight away and firstly let's talk about this design and the big question is why does it matter how thin it is i mean unless your visa mounting it normally you do have it so it's kind of like when you have a ultra thin tv i've actually got a wall mounted tv currently but normally he's on a tv stand and even though you can get those super thin oleds you've still got a big flat stand at the bottom to stop it from falling over and that's kind of the same situation with the imac yes the actual computer itself is only 11.5 millimeters thick it looks amazing but why is that important i mean you still got the stand which sticks out further front and back so you're not really saving any space and this drive for ultra thinness means we're still stuck with this big colorful chin underneath as that's where all the fans and the components are if they just made this a couple of centimeters thicker it could have been all hidden behind the screen and we'd end up with something that looked more like the surface studio instead of an imac design from 15 years ago that's gone on a bit of a diet plus maybe they could have squeezed in a bigger 27 inch screen into this form factor instead if you do want a bigger screen which personally i do then you're currently stuck with the last gen intel only imax however one thing i thought i really wouldn't like is this big white bezel around the edge but actually in person now it's here next to the colorful chin i quite like it there's something about the white with that splash of color and just how insanely thin and light this whole thing is that makes it feel kind of fun and almost uplifting it's definitely got some gen z vibes about it but even as i get older and more cynical i do quite like it having said that there's still no rotation or height adjustment the latter of which i really would like to have seen so depending on your setup you may have to stick something underneath it to prop it up around the back we're getting a much darker color so as you can see i've gone for the purple one here and it's quite different to the front purple and in terms of the connectivity we're getting two of the latest thunderbolt 4 ports along with two usb 3s on this higher end model although as you can see they're all type c so you'll probably want to plug in an adapter or card reader like you would on a macbook and we do get a gigabit ethernet port but it's actually hidden back here on the power brick which i think is a pretty nifty way of keeping the cable out of sight however the base imac does miss out on the two usb 3s and the ethernet is an optional extra also just a quick mention of the speakers in this thing because they're ridiculously good normally i use a pair of headphones some kids out with apple's tech at the moment uh but the sixth speaker system combined with the uh what they call it the force cancelling woofers which apparently are not uh anti-jedi dogs from star wars but it just gives a whole other level to the base and the richness of the sound just have a listen to this flavor little girl talk don't you this i've been seeing john is named no his name's john wings night like at a sports bar like monday nights wings night down a pj flat squeegee please stop so far so good then but we haven't even got to the best bit the m1 chip uh the apple silicon which currently powers the latest macbook pro macbook air and also the mac mini and this is the first time we're getting it in the imac now to tell you the truth both my wife and i use macbook pro 13s as our sort of everyday laptops i use the m1 powered version she has the intel version and i tell you what every single day she complains about how the battery's almost dead uh why when she has a billion chrome tabs open it starts to get hot and the fans were up who'd have thought but it's a totally different story with the m1 version which is uh up to twice as fast the battery lasts almost twice as long and it's a lot cooler and quieter because even though the pro has a fan unlike the macbook air i've never actually heard it even when i'm exporting videos or gaming on this to some extent so um it's genuinely revolutionary stuff so you can understand why we tech nerds are a bit more excited about apple's silicone on the inside rather than the fancy colorful design on the outside and we're getting essentially the exact same chip and performance as the macbook pro 13. although i was curious since this 4.5 k retina imac which is technically the highest resolution m1 power device you can get which therefore has more pixels to push would it be able to keep up well the answer is yes actually it's absolutely the same performance as the macbook pro 13. helpfully i have identically specced machines these have both got the 8 core cpu 8 core gpu and also 16 gig of unified ram and i ran a whole bunch of tests on both and they're pretty much neck and neck in terms of performance in geekbench and 3dmark the difference is really within the margin of error and they also both exported my 10 minute 4k premiere pro project in exactly 17 minutes and 14 seconds so whether you go for the macbook pro or the imac or even the mac mini you're really getting the same performance and while of course we're not going to get the same battery life and to some extent heat and cooling advantages that the m1 brings on the macbooks the speed and the efficiency of the chip makes this new imac worth buying just by itself final cut pro just breezes through multiple 4k streams in a project it'll even handle 8k i do find i still have to use proxies to get a smooth timeline in premiere pro with my 10 bit 4k footage but then again i have to do the same thing on my top of the line gaming pc as well so obviously you'll get the best experience with apple's own suite of apps and also those that have been uh fully optimized for the m1 aka universal apps like chrome photoshop affinity designer and a whole bunch of apple arcade games you can always check whether your program's running intel or apple silicon with the m1 but more and more programs are becoming universal apps as time goes on and those that aren't still use apple's rosetta 2 emulation software which translates between intel and the apple silicon which at first is what we were all worried would be terrible but actually most emulated apps on m1 still outperform their native intel versions so i've been using this for about a week now i've been using these macbook pros with the m1 since they launched late last year and i'm genuinely yet to come across a proper roadblock where i can't use a program or app that i want to because of the silicon although what i would suggest is paying a little bit extra upfront and getting the 16 gig of ram model because you can't change it afterwards it's unified onto the chip and a couple of times when i was testing the macbook air with eight gigabytes i did hit a uh memory limit warning so considering you're probably gonna use this new imac for the best part of five years or more definitely pay the extra 200 pounds now and get 16 gigs of ram i'll make it a lot more future proof and sadly this lack of upgradability is a downside of the m1 design that's not often talked about also gaming still kind of sucks to be blunt serious gaming that is i mean the apple arcade is fun and games run flawlessly but we still have a limited library of traditional games on mac and performance is a bit iffy at full hd with medium settings in shadow of the tomb raider i averaged just 25 frames per second metro exodus same settings 39 fps not great not terrible not great or terrible although i would definitely recommend connecting a playstation or xbox controller if you are going to play some games so for me it's that m1 chip on the inside that makes this worth the upgrade but it's not just that it's the m1 paired with the latest big sur software which makes this a lot more interesting because you can actually run some iphone and ipad apps although the selection is pretty limited and i haven't really found this to be particularly useful so far but as apple's desktop and mobile worlds continue to merge particularly with the new ipad pros also packing an m1 chip this imac will be a lot more future proof than an intel one plus of course we have all the usual apple ecosystem benefits from your facetimes to your airdrops handoff icloud synced messages none of those are unique to this new imac but if you are an iphone or ipad user already then there are good reasons to use one of these as your desktop computer it's funny because when i first started this review i thought this would be pretty straightforward we've got a new design a bunch of fancy colors and the m1 chip but when you start to unpack that and then you also add in touch id keyboard a much better webcam great speakers and upgraded ports in reality this is actually a very significant upgrade but i do have a couple of issues for example all the peripherals still charge via lightning not usb-c although they do bundle a usb-c to lining connector cable in the box so i'll let them off but it just seems a bit old-fashioned also magic mouse 2 even though they've gone to the trouble of matching the color still has this ridiculous charging design also i think as impressively thin as it is i just don't really care make it a bit thicker stick the fans and components behind it just get rid of this and also unlike a lot of all-in-ones we're still not getting a touchscreen so in some ways an m1 ipad pro might be a better option for some artists and designers although that is still limited to ipad os apps and speaking of weird transitions the 27-inch imac feels a little bit left out it's not been refreshed yet and it's still powered by last gen intel chips although it is a lot more configurable and for professionals that need you know 128 gigs of ram and have much deeper pockets this is still going to be a better option for now but i would expect an updated 27 inch or imac pro with a faster m1z or m2 chip coming soon but for the vast majority of people even though this new imac kind of feels like an old design with a fresh liquor paint it is that new m1 chip with that big sur software and a few of the nice extras that does make this i think genuinely worth upgrading to but what do you reckon are you tempted to buy this or maybe wait for the 27 inch or the macbook pro 16 let me know in the comments below and also let me know how the audio and the microphone quality has been throughout this video thank you so much for watching guys if you want to see more of me then hit that like and
