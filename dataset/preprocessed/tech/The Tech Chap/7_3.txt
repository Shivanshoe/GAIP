[Music] goodness new hey guys i'm so tech chap and that definitely happened just like that no editing or funny business now do you remember these every videographer and editor had or even actually still has one of these hard drives tough as nails but also of course very slow compared to a modern ssd the number of shoots i've been on where i've had to wait an extra half an hour at the end of the day where they sort of transfer the files and check the rushes and all that pain in the backside which is why i have about three of these around the office this is the samsung t7 i've also got a couple of the old t5s laying about somewhere but i'm not always convinced that they're their most durable things in the entire world if it falls off your desk if you're out on a shoot and it starts drizzling or gets a bit muddy which is where these things come in aptly named the samsung t7 shield and for all intents and purposes it is one of these but now a lot tougher and so a big thank you to samsung for sending these over for me to have a play with and test out and also offering to sponsor this video but as always all opinions and tests are my own so the t7 shield comes in three colors and they're all usb 3.2 gen 2 and they also use the nvme protocol so you can transfer your photos your videos your files whatever it is you like to keep on your hard drive with read reading write speeds of a thousand and fifty and a thousand megabytes per second respectively which you'll note is the same as the standard t7 model but it's still nearly twice as fast as regular sata ssds and also up to 10 times faster than all external hard drives the funny thing is when it comes to shaving off a few seconds in the edit or the export or you know whatever it is you're doing in your workflow people will pay i pay thousands of pounds to get a slightly faster laptop or a slightly beefier gpu in the pc or something or even faster internet so i can upload it quicker but then we often forget about the time it takes to transfer the footage not just from the sd card maybe to your laptop but then back onto your main editing pc or giving it to an editor or someone else working with you so while the speeds haven't changed coming from the already incredibly fast t7 considering the price of these things it really makes sense to invest in them to speed up your workflow now the t7 shield comes in either one or two terabyte capacities perhaps a four terabyte option would have also been nice to see and also i do love this red color of the t7 so maybe samsung if you're listening down the road you can make a four terabyte one of these in red anyway as i say both sizes top out at a thousand and fifty megabits per second read and a thousand right although the two terabyte guarantees up to a thousand megabytes per second write speeds versus 900 on the one terabyte when you're transferring a really big file that takes a long time now firing up a bit of crystal disk mark i'm getting speeds that are pretty much bang on what i expected given the specs although in practice i was often getting high 600s it can vary based on the file type but i've used a variety of laptops to test this with with the bundle cable and it is using the correct nvme interface i'm not entirely sure why but your experience may vary and crystal disk mark did show that full speed it is really good to see though that the speeds were consistent throughout it didn't start to slow down during longer transfers which is pretty common with a lot of portable ssds when they hit bandwidth limitations or even they start to overheat so despite that rubber exterior everything keeps cool throughout so it's fast but the t7 shield is all about that extra durability it's got a similar aluminium body like the t7 on the inside that helps to dissipate heat and then we have this rubber exterior for added toughness and it's also a lot more grippy the grippiness factor not sure if that's actually a word but it does make a difference when you're on a desk and maybe you nudge it because well i can show you right here so the idea is it's less likely to fall out of your backpack or slide off a desk that sort of thing although if it does you should still be protected the t7 shield offers three meter drop protection which realistically was always the main cause of concern for me but we also get ip65 water and dust resistance so it's protected against low pressure water jets and droplets it can also withstand more extreme temperatures it'll work from a freezing zero degrees celsius up to 60 although to be fair i don't think even i could withstand 60. now little old me here in the studio shoots in 4k 60 which is well child's play compared to the professionals who shoot an 8 and even 12k but actually samsung say that these have been certified for use with black magic designs 12k cameras which is great for professionals but perhaps a little bit beyond what i would use it for i should also say that while i mainly work off a macbook pro 16 right now this is fully compatible with both mac and windows plus most android phones and tablets although i imagine it's been best optimized for samsung's own products although i can tell you it does also work with the current ipad pros and it is even compatible with your playstation or xbox if you fancy backing up some last gen games to free up your internal storage or you want to use it to store your video captures now you don't need to install the samsung magician software to use the drive it really is just plug and play but it's worth doing if you can as you get a whole bunch of extra information about the drive you can name it you can check on the health the capacity plus you've also got security settings and it's also where you can update the firmware so in my backpack i always carry my camera a microphone sd cards extra batteries chargers uh the laptop of course and now one of these i was carrying actually probably still well just for the extra capacity uh the t7 but now i've switched to the t7 shield this is my new adventure buddy and the extra durability of the shield just gives you that i know it's a cliche but extra peace of mind the one terabyte t7 shield will set you back 159 and the 2 terabyte is 289 which is i think surprisingly good value these are genuinely one of the gadgets that i do use every single day and i'm not always chasing up mountains or uh hiking or adventuring i'm usually just sat right there in my cozy office with the cat that's also sat right there so i'm not necessarily always putting this extra durability to the test to use but it is good to know you have that extra protection and if you do travel a lot and go on fancy adventures then well i would highly highly recommend one of these before we finish i would love to hear if you've got any horror stories about losing files or things being corrupted or your hard drives failing stories that perhaps weren't funny at the time but now we can look back on them well maybe they're still not funny but share those in the comments below and if you've got any questions about these also let me know thank you so much for watching guys if you want to see more from me then a cheeky little like and subscribe would be very much appreciated and i'll catch you next time right here on the tech chat [Music] you
