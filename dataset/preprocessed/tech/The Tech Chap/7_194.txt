all right let's do this hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and i'm pretty excited for this video because not only do i get to unbox and show you two different phones uh but i've been looking forward to getting my hands on these new real me seven series phones for a while now and i think when i tell you the specs and crucially the price of these guys i think you'll be pretty excited as well this video is very kindly sponsored by realme they also sent the phones over but as always all my opinions are completely my own but they go in touch and offer me this early access look at the two phones and i thought that would be pretty handy for you guys to have a little look at them as well now as you can see i'm also bringing back the vertical camera the bird's eye view so you can see exactly what i'm looking at as we unbox these guys and the first thing you'll notice is the pro model is actually a little bit smaller than the standard one these are quite different phones actually and what makes it really interesting is the pro isn't necessarily the better option it's kind of like what you want in your phone and also of course what your budget is let me start with the price because i think that's what's going to catch your attention most because the 7 here starts at just 179 pounds versus 279 on the pro and if we flip these guys over you can see some of the main specs here and we're looking at 30 watt dart charging with a whopping 5 million power battery on the real me seven uh versus 65 watt super dart charging and a 4500 milliamp hour battery on the pro so faster charging but smaller battery versus slightly slower charging but much bigger battery so actually there are quite a few differences but let's get into the actual unboxing let's start with a standard one it's always a nice touch from the included case because it just means you don't have to go out and buy one yourself you've got this little silicon rubber case there so you can keep it safe and then we've got the phone itself you can tell i've not even opened this yet this is a proper unboxing let's just tip these out so this is the 30 watt dart charger for the 7 and a usb a2 usbc cable so that's the 7 but then if we just open up the pro see if there's anything different which i don't think there will be got the same case and actually a bigger charger not doing that very uh smoothly this is the super dart charging 65 watt as well as the same cable so the only difference really is obviously the phone and also the size and speed of the charger all right so now we've got them unboxed and set up in my left hand here with the blue background we've got the standard real me seven and then in my right here with the red background is the seven pro because as you can see there isn't a whole lot of difference between them although around the back you can see while they are both quad camera setups the uh style of the module is a little bit different but they both come with what realme called this ag split design so with this sort of matte glass back you can see when it hits the light you've got this sort of line on one side which kind of makes it look a little bit more interesting it stands out from the crowd so i've got the real me seven here in mist blue but you can also get it in mist white and the seven pro is in mirror silver but there's also a mirror blue on the right hand side we've got the power button although on the standard seven it actually doubles as a side fingerprint reader whereas we get an in-screen optical reader on the pro both phones give us stereo speakers and also a headphone jack which is always good to see and then on the left we've got the volume rocker and the sim card tray now actually both phones have a bit of a party trick i've not seen this on a phone at least not one that i've used but if we use a sim card ejector tool both phones actually have this quite unique looking triple slot design so what that means is you can have two sim cards it is 4g both phones are 4g which is fair enough i think given the price and also it's not exactly an essential feature right now i don't think 5g but you can expand the storage as well as having dual sim so i think that's actually really useful and something that does set these phones apart there isn't any formal ip rating but we only do say that this does have some splash resistant features so i suspect this will survivor uh you know using it in the rain but i probably wouldn't take it in the shower with me also both the real me 7 and the 7 pro are the first ever smartphones to pass the tuv rhineland smartphone reliability verification which is pretty reassuring actually so build quality is very good now this is where things get a little bit more interesting because as i say the pro isn't necessarily the better phone firstly in terms of the screen you can see the pro here actually has better view angles and that's because we get a super amoled panel versus an lcd here so uh you are getting better contrast and slightly richer colors on the pro but this is actually a 60 hertz screen whereas we're getting 90 hertz refresh rate on the 7. so you kind of have to weigh up do you want a 60hz amoled or a 90hz lcd not only that but if we jump into the settings menu on both and then go to about phone uh you can see i've got the top spec models of both here with eight gigs of ram and 128 storage but you can also see the pro has a snapdragon 720 g that's a qualcomm processor versus the mediatek well it just says octa-core processor here so of course my first question is which is faster the snapdragon or the mediatek well i fired up a bit of geekbench 5 and actually in terms of processor performance they're pretty neck and neck you can see the snapdragon is ever slightly faster in single core but then just look at these open cl scores which is kind of testing the graphics performance and you can see the mediatek chip is almost twice as fast as the snapdragon so the standard seven i think really is more aimed at gamers uh because firstly we have that 90 hertz refresh rate we've got a bigger 5 000 million power battery versus 4 500 on here and then we've got that much better graphics performance both phones do feel pretty fast though and every app and game i tried ran smoothly on both but of course you do want that extra graphics performance from this if you are going to take advantage of the 90 hertz because you're going to want to get 90 fps in games that support it so that extra graphical grunt will come in handy to sort of max out this higher refresh rate we also get a carbon fiber cooling system on a 7. now i don't have a ton of details about this although i'm guessing the material is a good conductor of the heat away from the chip which then helps to keep it cool so you're still getting the highest frame rate possible even in longer gaming sessions software wise we get android 10 with the real me ui skin on top there's very little bloatware and it's fast and easy to use now let's talk about these cameras because i think that's where the pro which i have here is going to come into its own both phones do have quad setups with a main lens as well as an ultra wide a macro and also a black and white sensor which they say helps to capture more light and therefore gives you more detail and better contrast in your photos now to be honest i don't really find having a macro lens that helpful although it seems every phone manufacturer and their dog seems to be just chucking one in anyway i guess it's an extra option but the quality isn't that good but i do like the fact we've got ultra wide lens on both so there's the usual range of options from night mode video photo portrait full resolution of the lens and under more you've got the macro sensor you can go to expert mode if you want to tweak all the settings video with the rear camera tops out at 4k 30 although on the front if we switch the selfie it's 1080p 30 not 4k now last but not least let's talk about battery life and charging because while the 7 does have a bigger battery we're looking at 5 000 milliamps versus 4500 on the 7 pro so a slightly smaller battery we do get much faster charging with this so this super dart 65 watt charger will get you from zero to 50 or about 50 in just 12 minutes whereas the standard 30 watt so still pretty fast uh dart charger for the seven and will get you zero to 100 in about an hour and five although unfortunately neither of these guys support wireless charging all right so i appreciate that was a pretty long unboxing video i think you can hear my voice start to get a bit horsey but it is really interesting to see the differences between these two phones on the one hand the standard seven which is cheaper starting at 179 pounds we obviously have the 90 hertz screen the faster graphics performance and also the bigger battery so i think if gaming is a priority or you just want the best battery life possible then the 7 is the one to go for whereas the 7 pro is a kind of like a better all-round phone with a super amoled screen the higher quality camera and of course also the much faster 65 watt super dot charging so it kind of comes down to what you want it's a bit of a shame that you kind of have to pick and choose like we don't get a 90 hertz super amoled for example but overall i mean with the premium design the solid performance good battery life and surprisingly capable camera setup i think given the price these are both definitely phones to look out for and as i say i will be doing a more in-depth look at both of these uh very soon so make sure you have subscribed and stay tuned for that but first impressions which one would you go for the seven or the seven pro let me know in the comments below also the realme 7 series comes with a 3 year warranty and 2 months free replacement policy which is a year and a month longer respectively than most phone brands offer which is a nice bonus thank you so much for watching guys if you do want to see more from me then don't forget to hit that little subscribe button below and i'll catch you next time right here on the tech
