hey guys i'm tom with techchap and this is the new asus pro art studio book 16 oled bit of a mouthful but there is an awful lot going on with this because it is essentially another one of those creator laptops high-end powerful laptops with uh color accurate screens and still reasonably portable form factors aimed at you know content creators and youtubers and renderers and all those fancy workstation-y people including me to be fair and actually this is exactly the kind of laptop that i would want to use as a desktop replacement or even when i'm editing on the go but the problem is there are so many of these nvidia studio certified creator laptops these days and you know what will convince you to drop two or three grand on this one and not the other one for example i recently reviewed the msi creator z16 which was a great laptop and it had 120 hertz screen which is not something you see very often on non-gaming laptops so for me that was a real standout but as soon as i'm doing something a little bit different with this we've still got the high-end specs and the beautiful oled screen which we'll come back to in a second but it's all about this guy this asus dial i must admit before i actually got hands-on with this i didn't know if i loved the idea of having this wheel between the track pad and the keyboard i thought it might get in the way and feel about uncomfortable under my wrist but as you can see as i type and then use the trackpad it actually never gets in the way it's always under your palms so to answer what might be your first question no it's not in the way which is great but then your second question is probably why what is this for well in programs that support it like premiere pro photoshop lightroom classic after effects it's essentially another way of helping you interact with the program and it actually works really well whether you're sort of scrubbing through your timeline zooming in and out or you're just using it on windows to adjust the volume or brightness lightroom classic is pretty fun where you can sort of adjust the exposure and shadows and contrast with this in a very sort of analog way which i must say does feel quite intuitive there's definitely gonna be some muscle memory relearning to be had here to sort of you know remember to use it and fully take advantage of it and also while you can customize the functionality in the different apps within this creator hub program which i'll talk about in a second you don't have sort of unlimited options for it there are only really a handful per program and again the list of programs that this supports is very limited there's no davinci resolve or you know 3ds max or solidworks or actual lightroom outside of lightroom classic so hopefully we do see this continue to be supported by asus although it is really good to see that you actually get similar functionality with this to using the microsoft dial so actually in the creator hub you can switch between asu style and microsoft to then get different uses out of it it definitely makes the laptop stand out and alongside the three function keys that we get on the bottom here below the trackpad and also a couple of customizable buttons actually on the keyboard you can really set this up to how you use it to hopefully again speed up your workflow so this little built-in dial is definitely a highlight of a laptop but it is by no means the full story because for me one of the absolute standouts of this is the screen it's a 16 inch 16 by 10 which is great to see 4k plus resolution oled screen we're looking at 100 srgb and 97 adobe rgb and dci p3 although asus claim 100 p3 but well that's what i got from my tests i must admit i do love this trend towards 16 by 10 aspect ratios we're seeing a lot more of it these days and combining that with the 4k res and also that oled panel this is absolutely glorious to use it really really is and if you're worried about oled burning well firstly asus give you a 7 000 hour warranty for this screen at 200 nits but realistically i've never had a problem with oled screens there's built-in pixel refreshers in terms of the actual samsung panel that they're using and also it comes pre-shipped with dark mode and there's a few other things you can do like automatically hide the taskbar really you don't have to worry and you are getting that one million to one contrast ratio and also 500 minutes of brightness which is pretty decent the downside though is that it is a 60 hertz panel i think that would have been the one extra feature that would have really put this over the top for me like the msi z16 would be to have that 120 hertz screen because even if you're not gaming that smoother refresh just makes everything you do on desktop or you know in premiere pro and timeline feels smoother although this does have a trick up its sleeve because the touchpad doubles as a digitizer so you can use your stylus of choice with this and the 1024 i think it is levels of pressure and then do your fancy drawing and doodling on screens so that is definitely a nice extra to have along with asus dial as well to really make this stand out as a creator laptop amazingly we're this far into the video and we haven't even talked about specs yet so let's get those out of the way and this new pro art studio book comes with either an rtx 3060 or 3070 which i've got in here which is a 110 watt tgp variant along with either a ryzen 7 5800h or ryzen 9 up to 64 gigs of ram and 2 terabytes of storage both of which are upgradable which is great to see and also interestingly the two m2 slots for the storage are pre-configured in raid 0. so i'm actually getting up to about 6 000 megabytes per second read and write and finally powering everything we have a 90 watt hour battery which is a pretty good size and asus say will get you about eight and a half hours of light to use although in my tests that's closer to sort of six and a half seven hours if you're gaming on this or intensive uh workloads that's going to drop right down so realistically you're going to want to plug it in with this power brick so this is essentially what you're carrying with you now it is actually quite a portable laptop for a 16 inch screen with these car specs it's not too bad at all uh we're looking at 2.4 kilograms and just under 20 mil thick so reasonably thin and light although you'll definitely feel this in your backpack or your briefcase if you're lugging it around with you but not too bad and actually we do have a really good range of ports as well including an rj45 ethernet uh the three and a half mil combo jack two usb 3.2 gen two type a's and also two type c's a full size and very fast sd card reader and also a full fat hdmi 2.1 port now you'll also notice this power button doubles as a fingerprint reader plus we have this webcam up here uh with an ir camera as well so it supports windows hello face unlocking and it also has this very nifty little webcam privacy shutter so if you don't fancy anyone hacking into your laptop and then spying on you then you can physically hide it which is quite nice to see in terms of design there's no mistaking this is a more professional kind of workstation laptop it's a subtle smart and quite professional design it's an all-aluminium alloy chassis which also has an anti-fingerprint smudge coating built in apparently which seems to be doing a fairly good job although there's still a couple of greasy stains from my uh grubby paws speakers are top notch they're harman kardon tuned and there's actually a really good amount of bass to it which is not something you usually find on laptops so very impressive speakers now as you can hear it does get quite loud although this is with the full fan toggle enabled and also in rendering mode normally in normal mode it's actually pretty much silent even when you you know just browsing google chrome doing light stuff you won't really hear the fan but i do love the idea that in the creator hub here you can just put it into rendering mode turn on full fan and then you're going to get the best performance which obviously is what you're going to want if you're rendering a video or actually playing games on this so this is the pro art creator hub and it's a pre-installed app you get with the laptop and you've got this dashboard which gives you all your sort of import information you can go to the color calibration tab and if you plug in a colorometer you can actually calibrate the color that way and then you've got the control settings for adjusting the asus dial and all the customizable buttons and basically you can just tinker with a laptop and set it up how you like but overall i mean top notch specs a really beautiful color accurate oled screen this asus dial which of course makes it a bit unique great range of ports really comfortable and responsive keyboard and touch pad yeah what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy something like this and also what do you think of the dial great idea or just a bit of a gimmick let me know what you think in the comments below thank you so much for watching guys if you do want to see more from me a cheeky little like and subscribe would be very much appreciated and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat [Music]
