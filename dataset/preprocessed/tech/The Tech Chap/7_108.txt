all right let's do this hey guys i'm from the tech chat and this well this is just a brown cardboard box but what's on the inside is a very interesting new laptop that i can't wait to show you and if i uh get this opened up it's kind of like that pulp fiction scene if by but inside here we have the brand new honor magic book 14. so i'm actually quite a big fan of these honour magic books i've tested them for a couple of years now because i know it's a bit of a cliche but they're just good all-round laptops they don't completely break the bank they're quite affordable so this is the new 2021 magic book 14 a big thank you to honor for sending this over and also sponsoring this video although as always all opinions are my own now the tagline for this is powerfully compact which obviously is a marketing spiel but i think it's pretty on point because it's quite thin and light it weighs just 1.38 kilograms it's a hair under 16 millimeters thick and also we're getting the brand new or the very latest intel 11th gem processors either the i5 or the i7 paired with up to 16 gigs of ram and up to 512 gigs of storage so a very nicely specced laptop that is reasonably portable as well and crucially not too expensive so this starts for the i5 with 8 gigs of ram and 512 storage for just 799 pounds and i think the biggest upgrade is the fact that these 11th gen processors come with intel's iris xc graphics which is up to twice as fast as their previous integrated graphics so let's just jump straight in and play a bit of rainbow six siege this is at 1080p with high settings and i'm averaging a very playable 55 fps not too shabby at all and actually it stayed nice and cool throughout as we're getting new dual heat pipes and a bigger cooling fan so this particular model is the highest spec one with an i7 16 gigs of ram 512 storage and that will cost more although i don't have the final pricing for it but for that 849 price tag you're getting the i5 eight gigs of ram and also still five 12 gigs of fast nvme storage which isn't bad at all actually and crucially you can upgrade it yourself so maybe in 6 or 12 months if you've got a few more pounds to spend you can maybe double the ram and expand the storage so i've just dived straight in talking about performance but let's take a step back and have a look at this laptop as a whole and i think this is a pretty good looking laptop we're getting an aluminium chassis in space grey and it's got a kind of sleek understated aesthetic to it the top and the side bezels are nice and thin although there is a bit of a chin at the bottom but it's still a solid 84 screen to body ratio plus we're getting a 180 degree hinge so you can fold the screen right back and then uh well use it like that if you want to apparently people do sometimes and they share their work or what they're looking at with their flat screen i'm not sure how useful that would be for me but what is helpful is that you have more options for the viewing angle so if you are maybe putting this on a laptop stand or however you are using it you basically can adjust the screen however you like so that is useful you may also notice there's no webcam up here and that's because it's hidden away under this key between f6 and f7 now we've seen these privacy webcams on honor and huawei laptops for a few years now and while the quality isn't fantastic and does look up your nose you do have the benefit of being able to physically hide it if you are a bit concerned about privacy other nifty extras include a fingerprint reader built into the power button also as it literally says on the tin this supports honors magic link so just by tapping your on a phone you can share files and with the cross collaboration feature actually use your phone screen on the laptop there's a pretty decent selection of ports including two full-size usba's one 3.2 gen1 one usb 2 for some reason which is a bit old and slow as well as a full-size hdmi usb c for charging which i'll come to in a second and a headphone jack plus we're getting wi-fi six and bluetooth 5.1 but you will notice that unlike a lot of more affordable laptops there's no ugly annoying dc power brick that you have to log around logo wrong look around with you instead when you unbox this laptop i could have given you the whole unboxing experience but it's just a cardboard box with some styrofoam inside but crucially we get this inside it's a fast 65 watt usbc charges so this is going to be great for your smartphone as well and it means you can plug it in with the usbc port and in just half an hour you'll get 44 of your batteries so fast charging with this is a really nice extra and speaking of battery thanks to the more efficient chips and also the 56 watt hour battery we get inside honest says we'll get up to 10 and a half hours of local full hd video playback so far in my more real world testing i'm getting closer to six and a half or seven hours which is still good and of course you do have a fast charger as well but it does all depend on how you use it but it should get you through a full working day now question for you guys do you prefer a glossy or matte screen on your laptop there are kind of pros and cons for each glossy's generally are a bit more contrasty and can make colors pop a bit but personally i quite like a map panel like we get on the magic book here because it means you don't really have to worry about reflections as much and it just makes it easy to use outdoors and considering that this is supposed to be a bit of a portable travel companion as well it's all about that powerfully compact uh tagline having a map screen i think is quite a good choice but i would genuinely be curious what you guys prefer uh between matt and glossy so let me know in the comments below so with the magic book we're getting a 14 inch 1080p ips lcd screen 300 nits 1001 contrast and actually covers an impressive 100 of the srgb color gamut but if i could have one upgrade or i would love to have a 16 by 10 aspect ratio that fills in maybe a little bit of that chin maybe for next time if honor are watching now i have to say one of the more surprising standouts for me about this is actually the keyboard i was making some notes and writing the review for this the other day and my wife was sat next to me and she said how nice it was that this wasn't a really loud annoying clacky keyboard you can hear it's nice and muffled yet it's still responsive there's a good key travel it's actually a lovely keyboard it's well spaced out uh it's backlit as well so um unlike a lot of keyboards that just drive my wife crazy because i'm like banging away and it's clacking this is kind of like softer and a little bit rubbery it's nice and also this smooth precision trackpad is a good size you couldn't really squeeze much for a big one in here so that's your walkthrough of the magicbook 14. but going back to performance just for a second and over the past week or so as i've been using this it's comfortably handled 1080p video editing in premiere pro plus you could always use proxies if you're doing more intensive 4k editing and also i could smoothly edit my videos in lightroom so to wrap up if you're after a thin and light laptop with the latest specs good performance and a smart design that also doesn't cost an absolute fortune then i would definitely give the honor magic book 14 a look or even its bigger brother than magicbook15 and i'll leave links in the description below if you want to check it out my only feedback would be that while i do appreciate the privacy of the hidden webcam the position isn't great and actually for me i wouldn't mind it being up here and perhaps physically disabling some other way also having a usb 2 port while it's fine if you're plugging in a peripheral for like a mouse or a keyboard it's not ideal maybe faster usb 3 or even if thunderbolt would have been lovely with this and also i suppose it would have been nice to see perhaps a bit of a refresh of the design it still looks good but perhaps next time a 16 by 10 and a slightly thinner chin down here would be good to see but that's it really so what do you make of the new honor magic 14 would you be tempted to buy one and if not well why not let me know in the comments below uh if you did enjoy the video and want to see more from me then hit that subscribe button ding that bell all those annoying youtuber things and i will see you guys next time right here on the tech chat thanks for watching you
