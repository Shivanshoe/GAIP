get away from me hey guys i'm summertech chap and this is the new red magic 7 from nubia and right now this is the most powerful gaming phone in the world so i've actually teamed up with red magic for this video because i want to show you just what this can do although of course as always all my opinions are my own [Music] now to give you an idea of how fast this is let's bring in this guy last year's red magic phone which is still incredibly powerful you can hear the fan has already started wearing up snapdragon triple eight 16 gigs of ram not too shabby but then we have the new one the seven this has the latest snapdragon 8 gen 1 up to 18 gigs of ram and side by side in the 20 minute 3dmark wildlife extreme stress benchmark which tests the graphics performance the new phone is 65 faster and in this test at least that's the difference of getting between 7 and 13 fps or 12 and 20 fps in the antutu benchmark the jump is only around 10 percent which is obviously not quite as impressive but for gamers it all adds up and so as you would expect this just breezed through everything i threw at it i fired up a bit of gentian impact naturally fully maxed out the settings and then i pulled out red magic's game menu which gives you access to a bunch of shortcuts and options one of which is the performance monitor so you can see we've now got the live fps counter now genshin is capped at 60fps sadly although you can see it never drops below it goes between 60 and even 61. this is as smooth as a baby's bum but then if we bring in last year's red magic phone again still very powerful but with the same settings you can see it actually fluctuates between 50 and 60. benchmarks are one thing but we're seeing a real world difference here and for the gamer who buys gaming phones this is a big deal okay so we've established this as a pretty quick phone and actually a solid upgrade even over last year's flagship gaming phones but there's something else i want to show you this now it's not a new feature having an inbuilt turbo fan although this one actually is more efficient and more effective it goes up to 20 000 rpm plus of course we have the go faster rgb now actually one thing i do want to show you first listen to the difference i'm going to turn the fan on here put it up to the mic you can just about hear it when you're gaming if you've got the volume on you can't really but yes you can hit the fan now let's bring in the red magic six can hear that difference it's a lot whinier a lot noisier apparently they've added a new metal plate inside to reduce the volume of the fan and the pitch is just way less annoying although i should say this fan is only on the supernova model of the red magic seven there's also pulsar and obsidian versions with slightly different designs although red magic do sell external fans that you can clip on if you do fancy one of those versions and also this fan is just part of their new ice 8.0 cooling system which gives us better airflow more conductive materials more efficient heat sinks anyway why am i talking about this well let's see how this compares to a regular flagship phone a non-gaming phone if you will but still with a snapdragon 8 gen 1. and just look at this again in that 20 minute stress test from 3dmark we're looking at a 98.9 stability versus 63 on a non-gaming competitor without a dedicated fan or this fancy cooling system and you can see from the graph the regular phone has to keep throttling down to keep cool whereas the red magic 7 it doesn't break a sweat which is exactly what you want to see on a gaming phone where you might be playing for hours and hours on end and if you're thinking whoa hold on tom you said this was the fastest gaming phone in the world what about the iphone i mean that's pretty powerful with this a15 chip well yes of course it is but i ran the same test again on the iphone 13 pro max and while we did actually see a higher peak score on the iphone even that throttles and actually for 19 of the 20 loops it's actually slower than the red magic what else well as i think any good gaming phone should have we have these shoulder triggers which you can assign to controls in your game you just turn it on and then drag the l and r triggers over the virtual buttons you want them to control and that's it and it makes such a big difference to making mobile games feel more like proper console games then we have the 165 hertz refresh rate which is still a bit overkill i mean there's only a handful of games that even hit 144 but you have the option it's feature-proof and even on menus and just generally using the phone and browsing the web it makes everything feel ridiculously quick especially with the 720 hertz touch response rate so the instant you press that screen it reacts the red magic 7 also supports what they call 4d vibration so in games that support it like pubg you can get a more immersive haptic feedback then of course we have the new chip we have more and faster ram an improved cooling system and then there's some of red magic's own secret sauce some of their own uh hardware and technologies that boost and stabilize your frame rate even further beyond just what that already very capable snapdragon chip can do you'll also notice we have this little guy on the side welcome to the game space and in here you can tinker with your settings for each game like maxing out that 720 hertz sampling rate which is particularly helpful in twitchy multiplayer games you can adjust the performance and actually even add plugins this is actually a new feature to mod your games and there's a whole plug-in library you can browse it's definitely worth exploring and then there's some nice extras like we get a headphone jack dual speakers three mics so if you're streaming from this or recording a gameplay your voice still sounds good and also we get wi-fi 6e support although of course you do still need a compatible router there does seem to be one downgrade though coming from this guy which had a 5050 milliamp hour battery in the 7 we only have a 4500 million power battery which isn't the biggest considering we have a 6.8 inch screen and of course it is a gaming phone and playing genshin which of course is a very demanding game and with 50 brightness at 120fps and the medium sort of balanced performance mode i only got about two and a half hours of gameplay from this your mileage may vary and of course it all comes down to what game you're playing and how demanding it is but i had hoped we'd see a longer battery life i just don't think 4 500 milliamps is quite big enough and i also did notice despite the fan going it did get quite toasty near the top of the phone there is a sort of anti-sweat anti-fingerprint coating on the back so you're not going to get all gross but it did make my palms quite warm so that's my main criticism but i tell you what i do like the software and it's actually quite refreshing not to see a ton of bloatware or pre-installed apps the only thing i had to change was the default browser we're getting android 12 with red magix os 5.0 on top and this latest version has refreshed some of the design including the gaming menus and i can tell you with that 165hz refresh the whole thing just feels incredibly responsive now as for the camera well you kind of know how it goes on these gaming phones it is a bit of an afterthought it's still a solid setup we get a triple lens system main an wide and a telephoto and in good light you know it does the job but realistically if you're gonna be buying this it's for the gaming merits and not necessarily the camera performance but as i say it still does a decent job i do like the look of this thing though it is undoubtedly a gaming phone and we even have some of the key specs written on the back which is quite a nice touch it is all glass and we have an aluminium frame but really the impressive design elements are on the inside with that ice cooling system this is the first proper gaming phone of 2022 and it's the one to be and although the battery and the cameras aren't its strongest suit the performance is top notch and it is definitely worth considering but what do you reckon would you be tempted to buy this do you buy gaming phones let me know in the comments below and also let me know what you're playing at the moment i'm always open to some new suggestions thank you so much for watching guys and i'll see you next time right here on the tech chat
