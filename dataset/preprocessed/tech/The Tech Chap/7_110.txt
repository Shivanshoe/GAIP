hey guys i'm from the tech chap and this is the new infinix note 10 pro now i'll be totally honest with you this is actually the first infinix phone i've ever used so i'm quite excited about that and also a big thank you to infinix for sponsoring this video although as always all opinions are my own but this guy costs just 259 dollars and i think considering what we are getting for that money this could actually be really good value uh so as i say first infinix phone ever uh so uh let's get this unboxed you can see we got this big 6.95 inch screen it's really really massive actually but we'll come back to that in just a second sim ejector we've then got this this is quite fun this one join x club coupon i'll definitely cash that in later as well as a clear plastic case to keep the phone nice and safe we also get a pair of headphones which is not something you see very often these days usb c cable and also infinix's 33 watt x charger for fast charging this really is a big phone although actually it's surprisingly thin and light given that almost seven inch screen size so you can see the key specs here 6.95 inch 90 hertz we've got the helio g95 mediatek processor which actually is a really good gaming chip 64 megapixel quad camera keen to have a little look at those in a second fast charging and this top spec one has eight gigs of ram plus 256 storage beautiful look at that so as you can see we've got this dual tone design on the back we've got this textured finish on the bottom and this reflective glossy top and i really like the way as the light hits it it sort of bounces off a little differently we get this nice curve between the two textures it definitely stands out it looks quite smart and definitely more premium than the price tag might suggest so let's get this fired up we've got this power button on the right hand side which doubles as a fingerprint reader although you can also uh face unlock it with the hole punch selfie camera up front it's a 16 megapixel camera we also get stereo speakers not something you see very often on more affordable phones so speaker grille down here and then one in the earpiece at the top on the bottom as you can see we've got a three and a half mil headphone jack which is always a plus and then on the back we've got this big quad lens camera setup and actually if i just use the sim ejector to pull the tray out you can see we've got room for two 4g sim cards and also great to see a micro sd card so you can expand the storage i really love just how big this screen is we've got nice thin bezels around the edges we've got the whole punch selfie at the top as i say 6.95 inches if you're watching movies or playing games this is going to give you a really immersive experience now this is using an lcd panel which obviously isn't quite as nice as amoled but actually because it's an ips lcd we're getting pretty good 1500 watt contrast and the viewing angles aren't too bad at all actually and of course the reason for this is well cost saving but on the plus side we do get a 90 hertz refresh rate and actually i would take a high refresh all day long even over the slightly more inky blacks of an amoled screen so i'm perfectly happy with that 90 hertz full hd plus ips lcd now the first thing i want to do is jump into a game and actually this is genshin impact which is one of the most graphically demanding games on mobile right now and as you can see we have the occasional frame drop but on the whole it's actually really nice and smooth and so obviously this is being powered by the mediatek helio g95 which is actually over twice as fast as the previous gen g80 and just the fact that it runs genshin this well means you're not gonna have any problem uh with any app or game you throw at it and you might also be able to hear those speakers so as i say stereo speakers uh they're actually dts tuned so we get better surround sound and if i shut up for a second and just turn the volume up you might get an idea of how good they [Music] are [Music] but it's not just about the hardware because while we have the g95 and also in this top spec model eight gigs of ram uh we've also got infinix's dar link game engine optimizer which i keep thinking sounds like darling and i want to call my phone darling but no darling and it works by intelligently adjusting the speed of the cpu and the gpu and all the resource allocation behind the scenes to give you the smoothest and best gaming experience possible the other benefit of having a big phone is that they can cram a really big battery in it as well so you've got a 5 000 million power cell in here and depending on how you use it of course you'll easily get a day day and a half of use out of this and of course we do also have that fast 33 watt x charger which actually charges up 50 minutes faster than the previous generation of this phone so a nice upgrade there now as i say this is my first infinix phone also the first time i've used their software so we're getting android 11 with their x os software on top and so far i'm actually really liking it it's nice and quick obviously that's helped by the nutty hertz screen as well we have this dashboard to the left hand side with some news feeds also the weather and a step counter and also how much ram you're using and you can reset that as well so you've got a bit of an optimizer there and we've got tons of extra functions and features if you want to have a play and really customize this and make it your own i also quite like how they're calling the battery menu power marathon uh which suggests that we are gonna get a nice long battery with this but you can also tweak all the uh power saving and ultra power saving modes uh as well so you can get some extra juice out of this my only feedback would be that there are quite a few pre-installed apps on the phone which you may not want although you can remove and hide them in folders if you want to but i do appreciate that often helps these companies keep the price down but now let's talk about this camera and actually it's a pretty good setup considering the price we're getting a quad lens module here with a 64 megapixel main eight megapixel ultra wide and a couple of two megapixels uh a depth and a black and white and actually one thing i quite like as you can see here is that there's no standard photo mode they've actually called it ai cam because uh we've got the scene and object detection and actually the ai will automatically enhance the photo based on what you're looking at so i've got the phone box here if i bring in my fake plant let's see if it detects what it is there you can see flower at the top there so it's analyzing the photo so the ai will then optimize the photo based on what you're looking at you can also shoot in the full 64 megapixels if you want the highest resolution image as well and we also get 4k 30 fps video with both the front and the rear camera which is nice especially at this price point and we've also got this portrait mode where you can actually adjust the aperture manually so how much of a sort of bokeh background you'd like and also this super night low light mode and then switching around to the 16 megapixel selfie camera and also the same 4k30 video so that is the new infinix note 10 pro and while a lot of people still haven't actually heard of infinix they are growing really really fast i think they've grown like 160 in the last couple of years so they are definitely one to watch and i think the note 10 pro given its 259 price tag definitely worth considering if you want a good all-round big screen pretty decent gaming phone and if you do fancy checking this out for yourself i will leave links below so go and have a look at that and if you've got any questions at all let me know in the comments thank you so much for watching guys hit that subscribe button if you enjoyed the video and i'll see you next time right here on
