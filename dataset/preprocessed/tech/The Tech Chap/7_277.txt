hey guys Anton the tech Japan I've got the brand new Samsung Galaxy Z flip here although obviously being English and in the UK I call it the Zed flip but we'll stick with Z flip for now so I actually bought this myself this is not a review sample I actually went on Samsung's website and paid 1,300 pounds for the privilege of getting it today so I could do a full unboxing for you guys and also put it side-by-side with the Samsung Galaxy fold this isn't a replacement I'm still expecting we'll see a fall to later in the year but if you do want to buy a folding device right now you're pretty much limited to the guy to fold the guy to flip the pretty terrible Motorola RAZR and probably whatever Huawei is working on in terms of their version 2 of the mate X but we'll come back to that in another video it's a fairly unassuming box actually we have the galaxy Z flip name on the side and we have this little cutout this is the cutout on the front which actually matches the colour of the phone you've bought so I've gone with a mirror purple and then slide that out and we have a nice big flip logo on the front and then inside we have the phone itself you can see this is a brand new model so I've got the mirror purple one here but it also comes in mirror black and mirror gold but that's only in some markets I think this is the best color though so take a good look at that now because it's never gonna be this clean again I promise you it's gonna be a fingerprint magnet in about 30 seconds so let's go for the inaugural fold beautiful so as you can see once it's folded it basically fits in your palm and is actually quite chunky if I do just bring in my galaxy folds for a second you'll see that it's a tiny bit thicker when closed than the fold although it's not that much different but you can see in terms of sort of the height it's about half the size I don't really know what the benefit is of having a shorter phone that's a little bit thicker perhaps it would fit more easily in a jacket pocket or in women's jeans which tend to be a little bit shorter this may work out quite well but it certainly is one of the most compact phones you can buy because obviously it well folds in half but then once it's unfolded you get a 21.9 so nearly 22 by 9 scream which is actually the tallest phone screen on the market right now in the box just like the Galaxy fold we get this premier service leaflet so where you actually have 24-hour customer support and also most importantly a one-year Samsung screen protection guarantee it's not free will cost you $2.99 pounds here in the UK but if you do accidentally break the screen on the flip which may happen we'll have to see how durable it is in the long term then it will only cost you in the UK at least a hundred pounds to replace for the first one after that you'll actually have to replace the whole thing yourself then we've got some fancy texts from Samsung telling you how awesome it is and making you feel better for paying 1300 pounds and then under that we have the charger this is obviously the UK adapter it is a fairly slow 15 watt charger which is actually the same speed as the Galaxy fold this is also 15 watt charging which is fine and actually because the flipz battery isn't that big something we'll talk about in a second it shouldn't take too long to charge we also get a USB a 2 USBC adapter a pair of AKG tuned earphones the USB C charging cable we also get sim ejector some paperwork and most importantly a case which is actually split into one for the top half and one for the bottom it's just a simple clear plastic case but given the price of this thing it's better safe than sorry just quickly guys a big THANK YOU to audible for sponsoring this video taking the train to London or flying to events around

tech chap to five hundred five hundred and give audible a try so I've got all the boring setup stuff out of the way the first thing I'll show you is actually the folding screen that uses an ultra-thin glass screen compared to plastic which you usually get like we have on the Galaxy fold it's actually pretty incredible just how subtle that is if you run your finger down it you can feel it but then compared to the Galaxy fold you can feel it much more easily so we get a six point seven inch 22 by nine screen which makes it an incredibly tall screen and while you can use it handed because it's not particularly wide you will need to do some finger gymnastics if you want to reach to the top of the firm now around the edge we have a slightly raised plastic bezel just like the Galaxy fold although unlike the fold we don't have that huge camera cut out in the corner instead we just get small hole punch selfie camera and we also get these new little screen cap protectors something Samsung introduced enough old when they revised it after it initially broke and we get that here on the flip but as well as that we also get this new fiber shield on the hinge which you can't actually see I can't show you but it's supposed to help improve durability and prevent dirt getting in so I'm actually quite confident this will be fairly durable Samsung say they've tested the flipping motion for two hundred thousand uses so that should keep me going for a while but it does feel really nice to use but it does feel really nice to use and actually unlike the fold which can only be used fully open or closed the hinge on the flip and she allows you to use it at different angles well like a laptop which means we can then use it in Flex mode which is something I'll show you in just a second so by now you're already pretty familiar with the flip there's loads of videos out there but just to give you a quick rundown this is using a snapdragon 855 plus processor which is last year's chip rather than you 865 along with eight gigs of ram and 256 gigs of storage we also get Android 10 and Samsung's 1u white 2.1 compared to the fold which is still on android 9 which is kind of irritating and powering everything we have a 3300 mAh battery which is pretty small actually I'm kind of concerned about that but I'll let you guys know how I get on with it in my full review so while it is a small battery cell partially because they've actually had to split it between both sides of the flip on the plus side when it comes to battery life at least we only get a full HD plus resolution that's only a 60 Hertz from refresh rate so it's not quad HD plus it's not 120 Hertz like we see on the new Galaxy S 20 phones so in many ways this is kind of like a 2019 phone when it comes to specs looking around the phone we get a USB C port on the bottom along with a speaker grille on the right side we had the power button which doubles as a fingerprint reader which is actually the same reader as the Galaxy fold although this is much easier to press because you have sort of thumb just rests there anyway we also have face and locking for the selfie camera we do get stereo speakers though we get the but I'm famili speaker as well as the earpiece speaker and it's AKG tuned so it sounds pretty good and then on the back we have this dual lens camera setup with a main lens and an ultra-wide that both 12 megapixels and use the same sensor as the new galaxy s 20 phones but unfortunately there is no telephoto lens and then we have this little guy which if I fold it closed you'll see pops up with time the date battery percentage and actually something that a lot of people don't realize but it is a touch screen so you can swipe between different notifications and also if you double tap the power button it pops up as a viewfinder so you can actually take sort of selfies of yourself using the good rear cameras or indeed the person you're taking app a trio of clothes to see themselves if they squint very hard because it is a tiny 1.1 inch AMOLED screen I really wish it was bigger it's such a cool idea but it's so small so for anything other than checking the time notification or maybe a close-up selfie it's not that useful I'd love something bigger here so that's the cover screen and then of course we have the main six point seven inch screen inside now compared to the Galaxy fold where we obviously have to much bigger screens there's a 7.3 inch sort of squarish 3x2 aspect ratio on the inside which is much more of a tablet experience but then we also have this 4.6 inch cover screen which is obviously much bigger than the tiny local cover screen we get on the flip so in that regard you can use this both as a regular phone or be a little bit small and obviously when you need to you could open up and use the full tablet experience so I guess in terms of flexibility and productivity due to the sheer amount of screen space we get in the fault I think it's much more of a pro device whereas the flip seems more like a stylish accessory what about you though which one would you go for the Galaxy flip or the Galaxy fold let me know in the pulp at the top right and also let me know why in the comments below but it is actually worth mentioning that the fold is significantly more expensive it'll see you back about 1900 pounds or $2,000 so this is about 600 more but it is also a slightly higher spec for example the fold actually has 12 gigs of ram and 512 gigs of storage verses 8 and 256 on the flip and also this does support 5g so let me jump into a few apps to show you what it's actually like to use this day-to-day so obviously when you're watching videos you're going to want to use this landscape so I shoot my video in the slowly wider aspect ratio of two by one which is something a lot of youtubers do these days but you still do get a little bit of pillarboxing either side of the screen although of course you can always pinch in to fill the screen but then that just crop a little bit at the top and bottom but when you are fullscreen like this it really is a very cool and cinematic experience however a traditional sixteen by nine video does leave quite chunky black bars either side but I guess that benefit is nothing's been cut out by the whole punch unless you fully zoom in so if I put them both side-by-side you can see the fault does still give you a much better YouTube experience there's a lot more screen being taken up with the video however if we then jump into Netflix we've got a bit of narcos here the aspect ratio of the show does take up more screen space on the flip so between the two given how much smaller and more comfortable to hold the flip is I do really like it let's jump into a bit of Instagram which is why I spend about half my life Oliver when it seems well between this and YouTube and you can see the real benefit of this extra tall screen and unlike the Galaxy fold which actually has issues with Instagram stories because it cuts off the top and bottom there's no problem on here although this can sometimes have the opposite problem because if I was going to post this as a story because it's so tall a whole bunch of this will be cut off on most other people's phones so make sure you do then reduce your story size a little bit like that but if you do want to see more behind the scenes tech and more about my life then make sure you do follow me on Instagram at the tech chap all right so we're ten minutes then let's change things up a little bit and I find up a Call of Duty mobile on the guide easy flip and as you can see it's filled up the entire screen there's no issues with letterboxing pillarboxing it's not stretched or anything even with this slight peculiar aspect ratio folding it doesn't really do anything except make it incredibly difficult to play and actually very strange to look at the only thing that's really missing is maybe a high refresh rate screen and of course we don't have the latest Snapdragon 86 5 processor but as you can see even in this really graphically intense game performance is top-notch but then switching back to the Galaxy fold and even though we have this little bit cut out at the top left I think I might actually prefer playing on this just because of the bigger tablet screen then we have what Samsung are calling flex mode because of course you can use the phone fully open like this and you also have the time or cover screen on the front which well you can't lead ooh much with at all but because of the hinge we can then actually use it like this flex mode it kind of acts as its own little stand tripod thing so if I open up say the camera app you can see that actually fills the top half of the screen with a viewfinder and then you have the controls on the bottom but if I pick it up and unfold it then again we go back to full screen and you can see just how seamless that transition is why is that useful well for one thing it means I could have a video call with someone like this and not actually have to hold the phone or anything which is quite nice I could also maybe do a video hyperlapse or something the camera is probably the best example of it right now although some other apps like YouTube are optimized for it but right now the vast majority of apps don't really do anything at all when you flip and go into Flex mode let me show you a little bit more about the camera and as I say we have the 12 megapixel main lens and the 12 megapixel ultra wide but no telephoto we do have a couple of new features including single take here's one I made earlier and you can see it's taken a video like a white shot different sort of filters this one's got a nice boquete background and essentially it means you don't have to take one of everything individually yourself you just do one single take and then you get everything you need unlike the galaxy s 20 range though we don't get any 8k video support on the Z flip which isn't surprising really given this is using last year's processor but we do get some interesting options in terms of aspect ratios including 9 by 16 which would be really useful for Instagram stories or even the full 22 by 9 aspect ratio of the Z flip but like previous Samsung phones we do also get 4k front-facing video from the selfie camera also if you prefer you can actually turn off this table table layout so I can then go back to the camera and then folding the screen doesn't do anything that's turned off that flex mode okay last but not least if you have just bought yourself is the flip let me give you a couple of my favorite tips to sort of improve the user experience so firstly jump into the settings and then go to display and then turn on dark mode this should help improve battery life a little bit because it's using an AMOLED screen and it is now fully integrated into it because of the latest software then scroll down to advanced features and turn on with juice animations this will make things feel just a little bit faster then I'd recommend heading to the navigation bar and changing the navigate buttons to full screen gestures but then you can actually get that little bit of screen real-estate back at the bottom and because it's Android 10 we can actually now swipe in from the edge to go back which is so much easier than having to swipe up from the bottom all the time particularly on this taller phone so that was a lot to take in but I really hope you guys enjoy this unboxing and bit of a walkthrough of the new Samsung Galaxy Z flip
