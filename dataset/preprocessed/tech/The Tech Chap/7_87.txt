[Music] hmm hey guys i'm tom the tech chap and this is a bit of a strange one actually it's the new qualcomm snapdragon insider phone it's a qualcomm's hero product if you will their flagship with all their tech crammed in and you can buy this it's not like a special edition really uh you can go online and order this in the us and china it's coming to the rest of the world later in 2021 and it will cost you fairly eye-watering fifteen hundred dollars so as you would hope for that kind of money and the fact that this is qualcomm's hero product and they've just announced the new snapdragon triple eight plus processor well bizarrely enough it's not in here we just get the regular triple eight for some reason which is a bit disappointing but still lots to talk about with this lots to show you in the box and also let's try and figure out who would actually buy this because right now i'm a bit confused by it so this is the very snazzy and also quite chunky box that it comes in we've got the snapdragon branding all around sliding it open and it reveals this welcome note uh saying that apparently i deserve extra which is very kind of them to say and also telling me all about qualcomm's products including of course their snapdragon triple h 5g chip and also how you can become a snapdragon insider if you want and well i'll leave a link to that website below if you fancy checking it out so in the box we have this phone of course and also a couple of wireless earbuds if i can actually get them out that's one come on i've ruined this unboxing video already there we go got it okay let's try this again so we also get a pair of true wireless earbuds inside these are from master and dynamic uh i think the case is actually inside the box or at least i hope it is but for now they work pretty well as a pair of dyes okay let's check out this phone and even under the plastic cover i can see how much it resembles the rog phone five of course this is built by asus uh it feels very similar but with a slightly toned down design it's a big phone 6.78 inch screen we've also got this triple camera module on the back a rear fingerprint reader and also this uh light up little fire logo for the snapdragon chip so it's certainly a unique design elsewhere in the box we have this uh little rubber uh bumper case for the phone kind of reminds me of that bumper case you got with the iphone 4 about a million years ago and does a good job of protecting it without covering up the back although it feels a little bit plasticky but it is rubber and it's also quite chunky as you can see we also get the earbuds case so as i say these are made by master and dynamic they've got qualcomm sound tech built in and some of their branding on the actual box as well and finally the quick charger 5 brick it's a 65 watt charger and a couple of cables for charging the phone and the earbuds case and that is pretty much it so let's put that to one side and have a look at the insider phone okay so first impressions well it is a lot like the rog phone five uh and obviously we've also got some very impressive specs the snapdragon triple eight not the plus uh but also 16 gigs of ddr5 ram 512 gigs of ufs 3.1 storage and this massive 6.78 inch 144hz amoled screen so some proper flagship specs there which go some way to explain that very high price but if you're thinking about using this as a gaming phone unlike the rog phone 5 which actually is cheaper and also has a significantly bigger battery that also has the shoulder trigger buttons and rog's range of accessories for like the fan for cooling it for longer gaming sessions and also the controller the kunai gamepad now to be fair they're not marketing this as a fully fledged proper gaming phone this is all about showing off qualcomm's tech everything from their ai auto zoom with the camera and actually just the camera itself because we have the image signal processor built into that snapdragon chip the qualcomm sounds tech also the 3d sonic 2 gen 2 fingerprint reader and just the performance generally it's an all-rounder phone as opposed to just a gaming phone so design wise this is a pretty chunky boy it's uh 210 grams and uh nine and a half mil thick we've got this matte midnight blue color which actually i do quite like it's a very subtle design except for that light up snapdragon logo although you can turn that off we get gorilla glass vectors on the screen also stereo speakers the sound on this is actually really really good it supports dual 5g sim cards although sadly no micro sd card support no headphone jack though and also as i say strangely we have this rear fingerprint reader but normally with these qualcomm phones it's all about the in-screen fingerprint readers so perhaps this is qualcomm's subtle way of encouraging phone brands to go back to physical fingerprint readers like this as for the cameras we get a 64 megapixel main lens that's using an imax 686 sensor we also have a 12 megapixel ultra wide using sony's imx 363 and finally an 8 megapixel telephoto lens which gives us three times optical zoom and actually the quality is very good dxomark has given it a 132 which puts it in first place in the us and sixth globally and also bear in mind that these shots were taken with pre-release software so it's likely they'll improve further but one of the cool features of this phone is we have this auto tracking video mode so let's try this with sylvie the cat because while she's not moving uh she's obviously uh having a nice time snoozing i can move around so we're tracking her if i move in a little bit the camera zooms out and we get a nice ultra wide view but if i move back and she gets further away you can see it switches to the telephoto lens bit of a white balance shift there and that quality really has dropped actually all this actually is limited to 1080p as well there's no 4k if i come right back in you can see it pull out so it's definitely doing a good job of tracking here i'm not sure about the consistency of the quality between the lenses but uh it certainly works so it goes without saying that with this 144hz screen and the specs we get in here this is blisteringly fast it will play any game you throw at it flawlessly including likes of gentian impacts maxed out at 60 fps this doesn't really battle an eyelid although of course over sustained gaming loads having something like an external fan that we get as an accessory on the rog phone 5 would make a difference however i think my biggest issue with this is the battery because when we have that pretty fast 65 watt quick charge 5 charger which will top you up to 70 in half an hour that's okay but we only have a 4 000 milliamp hour cell in here which isn't that big for a phone this size and also significantly smaller than the 6 000 million power cell we get in the almost identical rog phone five and considering asus built this as well it's a bit odd that we haven't also got that massive battery in here which would have been good to see so you'll still get a reasonable battery life out of this but considering the specs and that you know you might want to play a bunch of games on here it's not going to last anywhere near as long as something like the rog phone 5. so a bit of a strange decision there but i love the fact that this comes with what is essentially stock android 11. that's what usually comes with asus phones and well of course we do have some snapdragon branding in terms of wallpapers it is near enough stock android so it's nice and fast there's no horrible bloatware or ugly skin you have to sort of hide or navigate around it's just a good clean stock android 11 experience we also have these guys now i've been uh testing these for a couple of hours this morning and they actually sound really good i normally use the sony uh well the wf-1000xm4s which are incredible wireless headphones as soon as they're paired to the phone you can see that we have qualcomm's aptx adaptive uh audio enabled and we can also switch between different sound optimizations depending on what you're looking for so we're getting 24-bit audio support 96 kilohertz music streaming ultra low latency and also some improved microphone quality the funny thing is though i thought the earbuds sounded terrific at least to my ear but then i was told by qualcomm that these are also pre-production models and don't yet fully support snapdragon sounds so i am actually really curious to hear what kind of difference that will actually make but right now i can't really comment on it so who should buy this well i don't know the idea is that this is going to give feedback to qualcomm you get to sort of be a snapdragon insider tell them how they can improve things i'm guessing they're tracking a lot of the information a lot of the data on here as well and it's kind of just like their demo device but as i say i'm not quite sure who would actually buy it especially for that kind of money you could get an iphone 12 pro max top spec or an s21 ultra for that kind of money but it's certainly not a bad thing that qualcomm are making these kind of demo devices because anything that they can do to you know get more feedback and have a better idea of what users want so they can then develop that going forward which will then trickle down to pretty much every other phone that we use can't be a bad thing but if you do fancy checking this out for yourself i'll leave a link in the description below and also um let me know what you make of this in the comments would you potentially buy one have you got an idea who might want to buy one thank you so much for watching guys if you enjoyed this video a cheeky little like and subscribe would be very much appreciated
