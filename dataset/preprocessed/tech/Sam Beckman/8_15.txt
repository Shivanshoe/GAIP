[Music] i've provided a lot of coverage on my channel related to all things android root and in fact i've got an entire playlist dedicated to just that topic alone which i'll link up in the cards and down below however the number one question i get asked on pretty much every single one of these android videos is how do you update your phone once it's rooted and that's because once your phone is rooted you can't just simply do a wireless over-the-air system update whenever a new one rolls around because phones contain what's called a pre-ota block check which among other things checks if your phone is rooted and if it is it'll block the update from happening it is one of the bigger downsides to having a rooted phone but the good news is that you can still update your phone manually with a little bit of know-how and so consider this video your one-stop solution for how to update a rooted phone and for the most part if you've rooted your device using magisk then this process should work for almost any device that said obviously take your precautions with this possibly even do a system backup prior just in case but with that being said let's dive in now the first thing to point out is that there are actually a few methods for updating a rooted phone but i'm going to be explaining the one that i personally use as i find it to be not only the most universal but also the most reliable as well as that if you've already got a rooted device then i'm going to assume you also already have adb set up and ready to go on your computer as well as usb debugging on your phone however if you don't have either setup then you can literally watch any of my how to root x device videos and they'll all explain these parts of the process i'll also leave an article linked down below if you'd prefer to just read how to do it but if you want to follow along with this video exactly just make sure that your platform dash tools folder is sitting on your desktop all right for this method you'll need to have access to the latest factory and ota images for your device of choice for google pixel devices this is made incredibly easy because google uploads all of these files to a developer's page every time there's a new update out but if you're not using a pixel phone then you'll need to locate these files elsewhere generally speaking unless your phone is really niche you should just be able to perform a quick google search with your device name followed by the terms ota image files or factory image files and then you should be able to find the files that you're looking for often there will be a friendly user uploading these files for download over on xda or sometimes you'll be able to find them on a site like needrom.com but whichever website you're using just be careful to ensure that the files you're downloading match your specific device and region as using the wrong files may result in some features becoming broken so for the pixel 6 which will be the device that i'm using for this demonstration like i said on my computer i can just navigate first to the factory images page and find the latest factory image file under the pixel 6 section and click on link to download it and then i can navigate to the full ota images page and again find and download the latest ota files and click to download these will both be pretty massive files around a couple of gigabytes each but once they've completed downloading we want to then first locate the factory zip file which will be the one with the ota in the name double click that to extract it and then double click this other zip file called image dash blah blah blah now if you're running android 12 on your router device then prior to one of the recent magisk updates you would have needed to disable what's called dm verity check via adb using this vb met up dot image file not only when you first rooted your device but also each time you wanted to update your phone as well but if you're running version 24 or later of magisk then you don't need to do this process anymore but with that being said with this image zip file now opened we now need to plug our phone into our computer and then transfer this file called boot.image somewhere we'll remember on our phone i'm just going to put mine in the documents folder via android file transfer with that done we now want to find that ota zip file we downloaded which is the one with ota in the file name and then to make life easier for everyone we're going to rename it to simply ota dot zip and then we'll move that file to that platform tools folder sitting on our desktop all right with our device still plugged in we now need to open up a command prompt application which for me on a mac is going to be the terminal application but use whichever one you have access to and then with it open we're going to type the following cd space desktop and then enter and then cd space platform dash tools and then enter now just to save me from having to repeat myself a thousand times because i'm using a mac for this demonstration anytime i type an adb command i'll need to add a dot and a slash before the word adb so i'll keep saying it like that because that's what i'm doing but if you're using a windows pc then you can just type adb without the dot or slash does that make sense okay so from here we're going to type dot slash adb space reboot space recovery and then hit enter this will switch our phone off and for some devices it'll go straight into recovery mode but for others you may see this icon of a robot android lying down and if you do you'll need to hold the power button and press volume up and then you should enter recovery mode then we want to use the volume keys on our phone to navigate to the apply update from adb option and then hit the power button to select it then on our computer we'll type the following command dot slash adb space side load space ota dot zip and with that typed out we can hit enter this will now go through the process of updating our phone which it will do in two steps and this can take quite some time somewhere between five to ten minutes sometimes even longer depending on the update and keep in mind on the rare occasion i've actually had the update fail before completing and the first time this happened i actually didn't realize it and so assuming it was complete i rebooted my device only for it to go into a bootloop luckily i just needed to reboot into recovery mode again and apply the update once more and then it did successfully update so keep that in mind for some reason that seems to be something that can happen from time to time with the update not completing so just keep trying until it does successfully complete but once the ota completes we will be back in recovery mode and we can now select the reboot to system now option our phone will now reboot and just give your phone a little bit of time to fully update before moving on to the next step all right with that done and our phone fully updated we will actually no longer be rooted meaning we need to once more root our device to do this open the magisk application and then tap on the install button then choose the select and patch a file option and then navigate to that boot.image file you transferred to your device earlier i moved mine to the documents folder so i'll select that and then i can tap on let's go magisk manager will now go ahead and create a patched version of this boot image file and store it in the downloads folder on our phone and so back on our computer we then want to reopen android file transfer or just the file explorer on a windows device and find that newly created patched boot image file once we've found it we then want to transfer that file which should be called magisk underscore patch and then some randomnumbers.img to the platform tools folder on our desktop and then with out of our still plugged in we now want to use our command prompt application once more but this time launch our phone into fastboot mode which we can do so by typing dot slash adb space reboot space bootloader and then hit enter once our phone is booted into fastboot mode there are one of two options here we can either directly flash the magic patched boot image file if we're really confident in what we're doing but the safer approach is to just temporarily boot our device via that patch boot image file which will allow us to verify that everything is working as expected but if it's not it's just temporary and it will undo itself the next time we reboot to do this we're going to type the following dot fastboot or just fastboot on a windows machine then space boot space and then we want to drag and drop the magisk underscore patched image file directly from our platform tools folder to where our cursor is and once that's completed we can then hit enter once your device boots back up you will in fact be rooted once more however only temporarily so to complete the job and make sure it stays rooted we'll need to reopen the magic manager application then tap on install then direct install and then let's go we can then wait for the process to complete and once it has we can then tap on reboot if all has gone according to plan your phone will now be both updated to the latest software version and it'll still be rooted how good is that [Music] now this is obviously a downside to having a rooted phone however if you've rooted your phone using magisk in the past then this process is honestly very much the same and now you can just bookmark this video so that anytime you need to update your phone you just open this one up follow along and you're done each month it only takes me about 20 minutes or so to complete the process and part of that time is spent actually downloading the files and waiting for the ota update to complete but aside from that it's actually relatively simple and fast and so that's it if you found this video helpful then a sub to the channel would be greatly appreciated but aside from that thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] hey
