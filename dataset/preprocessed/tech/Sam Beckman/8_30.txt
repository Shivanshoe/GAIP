[Music] okay at the back end of 2021 i released my in-depth reviews of the pixel 6 and 6 pro and i was absolutely blown away at the response to both of those videos so i thought a few months down the line it's probably worth revisiting these two phones in a head-to-head comparison to really give you a solid idea of which one is more suitable if you're thinking about getting either one and i want to get this out of the way up front both of these phones are fantastic and in my opinion neither will disappoint but there are a few key differences that might make either device more or less suitable so without further ado let's compare the pixel 6 and 6 pro [Music] all right when you break it down there are basically five key differences between these two devices which we will cover in a moment but before we do let's just quickly cover how these phones are the same the main similarity is software and performance see both phones have essentially the same hardware inside with that super fast in-house tensor chipset as well as the exact same cpu and gpu and these three components the main contributors to how a phone performs so likewise both phones perform almost identically the only real difference in terms of specs is that the regular pixel 6 only comes with 8 gigabytes of ram and up to 256 gigabytes of internal storage whereas the pixel 6 pro has 12 gigabytes of ram and up to 512 gigabytes of internal storage in my experience the difference in ram is pretty negligible when it comes to day-to-day use but if you're someone who needs a lot of internal storage then perhaps having the option of buying a phone that has half a terabyte of internal storage is enough to sway you towards the six pro but as i said the main specs are all identical and because of android 12 and the way that google has refined the software experience both phones feel super responsive very snappy and very fast and in all honesty they're both a true joy to use but then that leads me to my first key difference which is the display so on the regular pixel 6 we get a 90 hertz oled panel whereas the 6 pro has a beautiful 120hz oled panel and whilst the regular 6's display still feels really smooth if you're looking for maximum fluidity then the 6 pro is the way to go for me personally though i got used to the slightly slower 90 hertz display within about a day of using the regular 6 after switching directly from the 6 pro but from then onwards it was not at all something that i noticed both displays have the same maximum brightness levels and i even noticed better off-axis performance with the regular six but again if having a 120hz display is of the utmost importance then your only option is the six pro however there is a downside to having a faster refresh rate display and that is battery life in my experience even after a full month of using the pixel 6 pro which is more than enough time for the adaptive battery to start doing its best work i was only just making it through each day without having to top it up whereas for the regular pixel 6 i still finish most days with the phone sitting on anywhere between 50 to 70 of battery left it seems baffling that there'd be that much improvement in battery performance thanks to just the difference in the refresh rate of the two displays but for me despite having a smaller battery capacity the regular pixel six is actually a much better performer in regards to battery life and so then we come to the design and this is largely going to be somewhat subjective and perhaps even redundant if you just put your phone straight into a case but in my opinion there are two key factors that make the raw naked design of the regular pixel 6 better than the 6 pro and they are the matte rails and the flat display on the 6 pro you get shiny rails and a curved display both of which make the phone look pretty cool when you first unbox it and in the promotional materials but when it comes to feel in the hand these two factors make it feel quite a bit more uncomfortable to hold yes you get larger bezels on the regular six but like hole punches and notches the bezels essentially become invisible within a few hours of using the phone and for me what i place higher priority on is the feel in the hand and for that alone the regular six is better but again if you use your phone in a case then this category is probably not of too much importance but the final differentiating factor that might sway you towards the 6 pro instead of the regular 6 is the camera configuration now both phones actually have the exact same 50 megapixel main sensors as well as the slightly underwhelming 12 megapixel ultrawide lenses so if all you care about is a really solid main lens as well as having an ultrawide lens well the two phones are identical but the two key differences between the regular six and six pro in regards to the camera configuration are firstly that the regular six does not have a telephoto lens and secondly that it also has a pretty inferior selfie camera i've certainly found myself missing that telephoto lens in particular i loved using the 4x lens on the 6 pro to capture videos of my kids playing at the park and whilst i'm not that much of a selfie taker there is the odd occasion i like to take a group selfie photo and so having the wider and sharper lens on the six pro certainly makes the results a lot nicer videos captured with the regular six and selfie camera are also capped to a max resolution of 1080p which you can shoot at 4k with the 6 pro selfie camera and so if you're after a much more complete camera configuration and you can see yourself really missing a telephoto lens in particular well then the regular pixel 6 is probably not the phone for you now aside from that what about any other little incidentals well both the fingerprint sensor and the haptics are actually surprisingly better on the regular six though the difference is somewhat marginal and speaker performance is always going to be subjective but again i personally prefer the fuller sound of the regular sixes speakers in comparison to the perhaps slightly louder yet somewhat slightly thinner sounding speakers on the six pro i actually did a speaker comparison between the two devices in my review of the regular six so i'll leave that linked up in the cards and down in the description below if you want to compare the speakers yourself but then the final key difference between the two phones is of course the price now at launch the six pro cost 899 us dollars for the base model whereas the regular six cost 599 us dollars and so when you break it down you're essentially paying 300 extra dollars for getting a display with a slight bump up in refresh rate as well as the superior selfie camera and of course that four times telephoto lens and if those three components are worth it then that means you should absolutely go for the pixel 6 pro in my humble opinion a phone is a piece of technology i use more than any other piece of tech that i own and so i want it to be the best one suited to my needs and within reason if that means spending a few extra hundred dollars then i am all for it but as much as i missed the telephoto lens on the 6 pro the device i've chosen to continue using out of the two is actually the regular pixel six and that basically comes down to the design i've literally got the six pro sitting here in my office as well but yet i still choose to rock this one as my everyday device so use that information as you will but regardless i'm hoping this video has helped to provide some clarity in regards to which phone might be better suited to you aside from that we're now not too far away from the next top apps video which launches on the first of every month and that means if you want to be involved in the promo code giveaway for any participating apps in that video then you want to get signed up as a channel member in addition to the monthly promo codes there's also a stack of other perks that you'll get access to when you join as a channel member as well including a members only discord a monthly live stream plus all of my own assets as well and you'll also get access to my entire filmmaking course for a staggering 90 off the original price which means it'll only cost five dollars instead of 50. so if you like the sound of that and you're keen to support the channel then there's a link in the description to where you can check that out and get involved aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] oh
