so i've made quite a few root focus videos on the channel two of which even walk through 10 reasons why i think rooting your phone is something still worth doing but i wanted to balance out the score a little i wanted to create an entire video focused on the topic of why you should not root your phone that way if you're someone who has watched any of those pro root videos on my channel and you're wondering whether it's safe to even root your phone in the first place well this video will be the answer to your question once you've watched this entire video you'll be able to assess all of the downsides that come along with ruining your phone and decide whether it's worth the cost so with that said let's dive in all right now first and foremost rooting your phone will actually void your manufacturer warranty so let's say you have a rooted phone and something unexpected causes it to stop working properly you take it to the store for repairs they fix it up and after doing so they say that the phone is rooted well if that happens bad luck you'll have to pay to cover the cost yourself now that said you can actually unroot your phone and make it look as though it was never actually rooted in the first place which will essentially restore your warranty but that's banking on the fact that your phone is working well enough to allow you to do that in the past i've even returned a pixel device that was originally rooted in exchange for a replacement one simply by factory resetting the device and re-locking the boot loader and they were nonetheless so you'll only be stuck if something happens to the phone whilst it's rooted meaning you can't effectively unroot it but otherwise you should be okay now reason number two why you should potentially avoid rooting your phone is that you're actually putting the phone at risk of becoming bricked now there are two types of phone breaking that can occur hard breaking and soft bricking so a hard brick is when something is wrong with the hardware itself like the display isn't working or the battery has died and this usually isn't an issue that can come about as a result of rooting your phone but a soft brick is something software related like a system file missing or the wrong boot image file being loaded in accidentally and when it comes to actually going through the process of rooting your phone these can actually be quite a common occurrence trust me it's happened to me more times than i care to admit and for those who have experienced the whole boot loop situation you know how nerve-wracking and frustrating that experience can be now there are usually ways to get yourself out of a soft ring but it will require a computer and a lot of tinkering and installing various bits of software to sort the situation out and more than anything you're most likely going to lose your data and so if you haven't backed things up that can be a rough situation now from there perhaps the biggest downside to rooting your phones these days is that it will most certainly cause some apps to stop working so in a lot of countries some banking apps will detect that a phone is rooted and just simply block you from using the app together but in every country one of the biggest apps that breaks when you root your phone is google pay so you can still use the app and navigate through its user interface but as soon as you go to load in a payment method it will detect that something is not right with your phone and it won't finish the setup process now this particular reason is actually a huge deal for me because i've recently started being able to carry around just my phone thanks to google pay and so not having it work is pretty annoying now there are some workarounds like using magisk hide and installing some specific magisk modules that can temporarily allow to use google pay but i've found that they only ever work for a day or so even if they do work in the first place and so you don't want to be stuck in a situation where you're out and about you've got to pay and whoops google pay ain't working no more now on top of that the fourth reason that is a little less detrimental than the previous reasons but still something worth considering is that you lose native system updates now that's not to say that your phone can never be updated it just becomes a lot harder to do so if you do want to update you'll have to manually download and sideload the update file via adb which is not an outrageously difficult thing to do but it's still way more annoying than just downloading and installing it directly via your phone system update tool with that said you can sometimes get lucky using a workaround magisk method to essentially temporarily uninstall magisk and then have the update come through but i could only ever get this working like two times out of the dozen times i tried and once your phone has missed the update because my disk is still installed there's no way to get it back natively so as i said annoying but not detrimental now one of the big questions that i see asked whenever i post a video related to rooting your phone is will my phone be more susceptible to malware or hacking if it's rooted and the short answer is yes now for a more detailed response let me say this when your phone is rooted it gives you and therefore any apps installed on your phone access to the system root level files hence why we call it root access so that means if you inadvertently install an app that does have hidden malware or other sinister things like that baked in well on a rooted phone your system files are no longer protected so you do have to install the malicious app for anything bad to actually happen and for what it's worth it's never happened to me but it's still a risk not otherwise present if your phone is not rooted and so finally the last reason that might cause you to think twice about rooting your phone is that ultimately it can actually cause performance issues and software bugs so because we're rooting our phones to modify some of the system files this can often cause unexpected glitches or even heavier drain than usual on your phone's performance think of it like this software manufacturers have teams of full-time paid staff creating software for just a handful of devices that they sell and sometimes even they get it wrong oneplus but with root modifications that you install more often than not it's just one developer working in their free time to create some sort of tweak now whilst they're a very talented bunch of people they just simply don't have the time or resources to test their mods on every single device and so whilst it might work really well on one phone on another it might cause performance issues i've definitely noticed that the phones i've rooted in the past have felt a little more sluggish compared to the phones that i use that haven't been rooted and often it is worth the trade-off to gain the features you're enabling via root access but it's still something to keep in mind and so there you have it those are a handful of reasons why rooting a phone is something you should be hesitant about now if you've decided that these risks are worth the cost then i've got plenty of content covering what makes rooting your phone worthwhile so i'll leave a link to a playlist up in the cards and down in the description below as for me what's my approach to rooting well as i mentioned in a recent q a video i've actually just recently stopped rooting my main everyday devices and the big reason which i made reference to in this video is that i lose access to google pay and also the service new south wales app which holds a digital copy of my driver's license do i miss rooting my phones actually yes i do i wish that there was some way for root access to not cause this one particular issue of apps not working and if it's ever properly fixed in the future then i'll probably start doing it again i do also have secondary devices that remain rooted for testing purposes so you'll still see root focus videos on the channel in the future but as for my main devices that i carry around everywhere i go well as for now they stay unrooted but that's it if you enjoyed the video then a sub would be greatly appreciated don't forget to follow me over on twitter and instagram for access to promo codes to paid apps that i release each month aside from that thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
