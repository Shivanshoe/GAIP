oh boy oh it's not good it's not good so it's no secret that i feature a lot of apps on my channel every month i create a new top apps video then we've also got my best nova launcher setup series which features a ridiculous amount of customization related apps and i quickly lose count of the amount of applications that i'm featuring each and every month now over the past couple of years i've always had the idea floating around in the back of my mind that i should totally create my own application i mean i love the idea of owning my very own app there'd be free publicity here on the channel and i reckon it'd just be a heck of a lot of fun to have an application that is totally my own issue is i'm not an app developer at all and i really don't have the time to learn how to become one so that's where today's video sponsor fiverr comes in they actually challenged me to go to their website and see if i could find some developers to create my dream application for me so that's exactly what i plan to do [Music] now when you go to the fiverr website and search for app developer you'll probably be shocked at just how many people are offering this service and probably even more shocked at just how low some of their prices seemingly are however if you do a bit of digging around you'll start to see that each developer actually offers different packages each with different pricing tiers and these really cheap ones are often just for a simple two-page application or perhaps even just a prototype of an app and i was looking for something quite a bit beefier so on each developers page there is also this get a quote option and for the type of app i'm interested in building it will definitely require getting a customized quote now for context it's probably worth first explaining the type of app that i'm after so i'm looking to create an app that will hopefully eventually replace the email submission process for my best nova launcher setup series instead of having to email me which can often result in submissions that are missing loads of relevant information i instead want an all-in-one app that enables users to submit their setups and have them showcased within the app as well then instead of sifting through the email submissions each month i will instead choose setups from the app to be featured in my best nova launcher setup series does that make sense there are a couple of apps that offer a similar functionality some of which i've even featured on my channel in the past but the difference is that this app will be mine and it will connect directly to my best nova launcher setup series so i put together a fairly detailed brief that covered pretty much the exact type of app i was after with all of the included features said that i needed some sort of working prototype within 14 days and then i sent that off to a bunch of developers and after a bunch of going back and forth with some negotiation here are the five i've decided to go with all right first up we have amelia her page says she'll develop a native android application she only has one five-star review but it's still five stars and after some negotiation she said she would develop my app for 150 bucks now even though she's the cheapest contender on this list the compromise to reach this price was that some of the features i was initially after would need to be scrapped but i really wanted to see what sort of design she could come up with so we locked it in now these next four developers all agreed to the same set of features i proposed in the initial brief so for only 10 more dollars than amelia we have syed he says that he will design and develop an android application which is definitely what i'm after he has eight five star reviews which is pretty great going when you consider that it's app development he's doing and he agreed to all of the features that i was after which i thought was very impressive for the price boom 160 next up is host sam and his page says that he will build a mobile app using flutter or android native he's only got one five star review so far but again he agreed to all of the features i wanted and to deliver the app within seven days which is faster than anyone else so he's locked in for two hundred dollars second and last is totman02 who says he will design and develop a professional android app using flutter he's got nine ratings and a 4.8 star average so he gets the gig for 215 and finally we have a little alden seven is that right probably not anyway he's a level two seller with 58 star reviews which for app development is bonkers and he came deservedly so it seems right at the top of the pack for a total price of 290 bucks so they're all locked in and working away none of them know that it's for this video that i'm really excited to see what they come up with all right it is officially the day to review the completed apps now disclosure three out of the five developers have fully finished their apps there is no more work to be done on them but two of the developers have broken up their work into two phases with the end of phase one being a working prototype and then the next phase being the completion of the app for those developers we're looking at the apps at the end of phase one so that's something to keep in mind now what we're going to do is open up each application that i've been sent take a sneak peek around experiment with each of their functionalities and then i'm going to rank each application based on a few key factors design usability and feature set we'll give each app a score of between one to five one being the lowest five being the highest and i'll update the rankings as we look at each app but then once all is said and done we'll assess all of the scores and unless something crazy has happened that will determine which app i'm gonna pursue going forward [Music] let's begin [Music] okay first up is syed and we're flipping things up a little bit because even though saeed's initial cost was 160 he was one of the developers who split his project into two phases each costing 80 bucks so today we're looking at the app that he created for only 80 all right let's open it up and take a look is that it oh boy oh it's not good it's not good um okay so first things first the design immediately to me is very basic uh there's nothing really too impressive about the layout the fonts don't look very nice either i mean if we go to the different categories huh i mean does anything actually even work if i tap the hamburger okay we've got another menu uh nothing works and even the layout isn't it's not that nice oh saeed what scores can i give you ah og it's a grim start let's move on all right next up we have it's amelia she cost 150 but just a reminder she only agreed to that price by removing some of the features that i had originally requested you can see here on my home screen that every other developer actually has two applications within a folder and that is because they've all created admin apps where i can go in and approve submitted setups and in some cases even edit them and so that's something that syed obviously hasn't created yet either he will need to do that in the next phase but with that said let's open up amelia's main application and already off the bat you can see the design is a thousand times better than what we saw in the first application if we tap on one of the setups excellent we get all the details underneath and hopefully as we tap on these icons here yep they launch into the applications on the play store and we can go ahead and download them directly from the play store which is a really important feature now one thing to keep in mind is that these phone renders that you're seeing on the home screen here they were actually created by me so there is an app that i always use that i really like called snap mod and this is where you can actually put any screenshot into a phone render which makes it look a lot nicer so that is something that you know users would have to do when submitting their own home screen you can see we have the categories here if i tap on one here bang that loads in any setups that you know were categorized under that particular heading but now let's go ahead and try and submit a setup and what i really like about amelia's is that she has some sort of pre-loaded apps you know that are set up for the submission process so i can tap this bottom icon and you can see that there are a few here we'll hit submit but now let's go and open up the admin app and you can see that now it said no setups initially but now we've got sam's home screen so we can tap on that and view all of the details unfortunately i can't actually edit any of the details i can just either delete it or approve it which means if there's one slight error i'll just have to delete it and that means the user will have to resubmit and so forth but i can approve it let's hit the tick button okay i think that approved it if we go up to the approved page you can see all of the approved there's sam's home screen so that's great let's go back to the main app now i wonder if that just loads yeah so that loaded i don't even have to quit the app and reopen it that's there if i tap on that there it is it's live within the app and i can tap on these uh icons and they will load the different applications that it mentions all right but that's it for amelia's a really great application i would highly recommend her as a developer she was really easy to work with but let's move on to the next application all right after that is hosam's app this guy was 200 in total and this included every feature that i was after let's open up the main app and ooh yes yes sir this is very nice now one thing to keep in mind is that with josem's app there is no necessary step after you take the screenshot to make you know the screenshots look nice and in fact this is what the screenshots will look like if they're uploaded directly within the app so that is fantastic got the icons up there which you know very clear as we change that text changes at the top we've got favorites oh nice folder icon there let's try the search functionality bang there we go tap on the setup beautiful so the search feature is working well and that is actually a feature that i just remembered amelia didn't incorporate into her application either so this looks like it's going to be like the dark light theme icon so if we tap that bam there it goes into an amoled dark mode beautiful let's try and submit a setup now so we'll go same setup as before sam's home screen ah and what's really cool here is that we can add a second widget app if need be so tap that ooh and third and for all indefinite widget apps which is fantastic i think that's everything hit submit pretty seamless submission process now let's go to the admin app and there you can see we have sam's home screen and what's really cool is i can tap on details and everything here is editable and we'll come back here and accept the setup so let's go into the app see if that updates automatically no so i might have to quit it let's try quit it scroll down bam there it is and look at that you saw it that was just a plain screenshot and now it looks beautiful it's got that yellow outline the you know blurred blue background to match the wallpaper that looks awesome gee this is super impressive for 200 this is a fully functioning application that i would be happy to upload and submit to the play store today yes oh sam good man all right second and last we're actually subbing in a lil alden seven who i actually later came to realise has the first name ali so i'll call him ali from now on now his total fee for the project was 290 but like syed he split his project into two phases and this first one cost two hundred dollars the second one is costing ninety dollars okay no let's do that again that was a really cool yes that's a really nice loading animation okay and i will let you know that these screenshots do not have to be pre-loaded via the snap mod app or anything like that they come loaded in phone renders automatically so that's you know thumbs up for that this is a really nice and clean design it's actually quite different from hosam's let's just quickly tap on a setup here oh yes yes this is really nice so that's it sort of for the home screen let's try and submit a setup so we'll go to upload setup oh man that's i mean this is by far the nicest looking setup page by far let's go for it hit submit set up all good all right we'll go home we'll open up the admin app jump over to pending submissions there it is tap on that as you can see i can edit all the details here if need be hit post setup nice icons there so now let's go into the main app again just double check does that setup get loaded in automatically yes it does again no needing to quit and reopen the app tap on that there it is that's fantastic now dark and light theme there is no toggle for it but ali did let me know that it does just behave the system settings so let's tap on dark theme there and bam it automatically transitions over so that's really nice oh man so wow okay all right that's it for ali's app i'll start with the main application all right nice so fairly simple layout i would say straight off the bat that in terms of design this home screen doesn't look quite as nice as anyone's butt said but it's not bad uh if we tap on a setup here and tap on more details it just doesn't look as nice as really any of the applications except for said just quickly before we submit a setup we'll come over to the hamburger menu we've got the light and dark mode toggle there oh yeah quite like that let's now submit a setup so let's put this in so sam's home screen now one thing to keep in mind is that you can even see there's a little hint here that says kindly edit the screenshot for professional look you do actually have to you know use an app like snap mod to make the screenshot look nice before you submit it but i think that's everything so let's hit submit set up submitted successfully waiting for approval to go live so let's go to the admin app now so you can see there it is i've got all the details there which i can manually edit and what's cool is i can change the thumbnail let's hit approve and if i come in okay it's not there so i'll have to manually reload the app that is one thing i've noticed is that load times aren't amazing with this app in particular but there it is sam's home screen tap on that there it is let's add that to favorites more details aside from that it's pretty functional it's got most of the features that i was after in the initial brief they're not as smooth as as the other applications so that's gonna dock a few points but yeah it is definitely a pretty solid working application [Music] okay so for those playing at home here is how each developer and application ranked and as you can see even though it was a pretty tight race in between her sam and ali the eventual winner was of course ali his overall design and usability was the best and although it didn't have quite as many features as some of the other apps keep in mind the app we saw was just his first version so as much as i really really like her sam's version of the app and its amelia's and topman zero twos were pretty solid as well ally's is the one that i'm going to stick with going forward honestly i'm hoping that it's live and available to download on the google play store in the next couple of months and i'll of course keep you all updated once that has happened so keep an eye out a big thank you to fiverr for sponsoring this video make sure you check out the
