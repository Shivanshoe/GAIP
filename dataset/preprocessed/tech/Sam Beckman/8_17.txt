this is an app called volume scheduler pro and you can use it to essentially hack your phone's system volume so let's say you work at a quiet office 9 to 5 p.m monday to friday there's a good chance you probably don't want your phone ringing super loudly during a super important meet right well with this app you simply set up schedules as you need them and within each schedule you can customize virtually every aspect of your system volume the ringtones the volume levels and whether the phone vibrates or not with your profiles activated you can then sit back knowing your phone's system volume will change automatically whenever you need it to and if you thought that was cool then you're gonna love the second app on today's list adaptive controls with this app you can actually automate a few key system settings on an app by app basis you just select the apps you want to customize and then for each app you can set custom settings for your phone system brightness volume and rotation and you can even set it up so that your phones do not disturb mode will turn on automatically and then that's it now whenever you open any of your customized apps those custom settings will become activated and what's really cool is that whenever you then close the app the settings will immediately revert back just keep in mind the app is pretty early in its development phase at the moment so it is a bit buggy and doesn't always work but the functionality is super promising all right from there we have float browser which is a pretty cool app that does pretty much exactly what it says on the tin you just open the app browse to any website you like and then the app will launch that site as a floating browser you can then use your phone as you normally would but now you've got this floating browser on top of whatever you're doing which has the potential to really level up your productivity you can then move the window around resize it if you like and for the most part it actually works really well and even more than that it's completely free and contains no ads whatsoever here's a pretty unique one contacts widget and this is an application that allows you to create all sorts of different widgets all related to the contacts on your phone there's actually a stack of different widget styles to choose from but i think my two favorite options are widget stacks and folder widgets with widget stacks it'll show you a scrollable list of chosen contacts and with the folder option it'll let you set up a widget that you can tap to expand again a list of chosen contacts then whenever you tap a contact you'll get this neat animation with options to quickly sms call or edit their contact information and if you have the pro version you can even add buttons to quickly launch into each of your contacts social accounts next up is verone kwgt a fantastic android 12 inspired widget pack with dynamic color thing at the time of making this video the pack comes with 91 different widgets and all of them have this beautiful yet unique design language about them which i think looks top shelf on top of that there's a heap of different widget styles as well from clean and minimal weather widgets to highly complex widgets with stacks of shortcuts but then the killer feature of this widget pack is that a lot of the widgets dynamically change their colors based on whatever wallpaper you have set it just means you never really have to worry about a widget not matching your setup which i think is so great and along with a bunch of other apps featured in today's video if you sign up as a channel member you will actually get this widget pack completely for free now before we press on just wanted to take a quick moment to thank today's video sponsor you hodler if you're someone who's

down in the description below right next up we have sectograph which is an app that will give you a super unique interface for viewing your daily tasks and plans instead of a standard list style format sector graph places everything on this circular clock graph and aside from making everything viewable at a quick glance i actually just think it looks really cool there are also lots of customizations you can make within the app settings including adding up to five different shortcut buttons on the widget itself so it has the potential to be really functional as well now apk extractor is a very handy tool that's been around for a little while now but that i've found to be super useful in recent times as the name so hopefully implies this app will let you extract apk files from any app installed on your phone you just tap any app on the list which by the way also includes system applications and then the app will place the exported apk in a specific folder on your phone and so if an app isn't readily available for download from the google play store now i can just extract the apk and share it to whatever device i'm using for filming and install it that way in all of my testing it has worked perfectly with not a single app failing to install so it's a really really handy tool and another really handy tool you might find helpful is calendar exporter the app is super simple you use it to export events from either google calendar or outlook and when you do it'll create a local backup that you can transfer to other devices and that's kind of it though if you do upgrade you can also upload your backups to the cloud for such a simple application it also has a really nice design and ui so hats off to the developer for nailing this one out of the park switching things up a bit and next up we have snippet and if you're someone who loves the idea of reading books but you just can't quite make the time to do so then this app is definitely worth checking out so the app is filled with short 15-minute summaries of books articles and podcasts and that means you can save a whole heap of time by reading just the key takeaways the summaries are actually supposedly formatted using insights from neuroscientific research to help you retain more information in less time which is really cool and then on top of that the app also just has a really nice design though i'm sure a lot of us would appreciate a dark mode hopefully in the future and so finally today we have reprice a really handy tool for keeping a track of the ever fluctuating prices on amazon it's super simple the app contains an integrated amazon browser that you can use to search and explore as you would normally then when you find a product you'd like to track you just tap this plus button and then tap track product that will then retrieve the information related to that product and you can then set it up so that the app will notify you if and when that product decreases under a specific price super handy app that could definitely save you a lot of cash but that my friends is it if you enjoyed the video then a sub to the channel would be amazing and a huge
