dear oneplus back in 2014 you revolutionized the smartphone industry with the self-dubbed flagship killer release the oneplus one what we had was an affordable device with most of the same high-end specifications being used in other flagship devices on the market and away we went for the next few years you were leading the charge offering devices with fantastic specs for really affordable prices yet as the years rolled on it became evident that the budget realm was not really where your heart truly laid for every new device that you released the prices also gradually increased as well now sure you were adding features and improving things so it made sense for the devices to move in an upward trajectory but then in 2019 you just went the full hog with the oneplus 7 pro which was pretty much a fully fledged flagship and whilst you of course still release mid-range and budget devices many would say that you've kind of lost your way over the past few years and that's not just because of pricing either so i'm here to present you with five suggestions that i think you should implement and if you do i think this will drastically help to bring the oneplus brand that was once loved and adored by almost everyone back to its former glory you ready oneplus let's do it so to start we've got to talk about your software now a number of years ago there was really very little question to it oxygen os was by far the best android skin available but then over the years for some reason you decided to steer away from that stock android look and feel to something that resembles samsung's one ui and for me that definitely ain't heading in the right direction it's not like the current iteration of oxygen os is a bad software skin in fact it's still one of the best available but it's that departure from the stock android look that concerns me and then the news comes in that oneplus just recently merged with oppo and as a result the code base of oxygen os is being merged with oppo's color os to supposedly offer a better software experience now whilst they tell us that on the user side of things oxygen os will largely remain the same i'm not so sure about that see we've seen one plus break promises in the past regarding their software like when they said android nougat would be coming to the oneplus 2 or other devices also having their software update support stop short of what was originally promised and so the same could definitely happen here with oxygen os so oneplus please listen to me here if there are any internal murmurs in the water about making oxygen os look even more like one ui or color os please put a pin in that and let that not be the case and whilst you're at it try and get things looking a little more like stock android again going forward now speaking of broken promises regarding software support this next point is all about exactly that over the years oneplus has become somewhat infamous for essentially leaving its users in the sand by promising a certain amount of software updates but then bailing out of that for one reason or another but even more than that lately there have been a lot of software issues with your phones that haven't really been fixed things like touch input lag or color tints when viewing your displays at low brightness or perhaps the worst one yet delayed app notifications seriously i rarely ever get notifications from gmail when using a oneplus phone and that's an issue that was present years back when i used the oneplus 3t so granted you have recently come out and promised three years of major os updates for your flagship devices and four years of security patches which is definitely promising but one that means very little when your updates don't actually fix some of the larger issues and two you've been known to break promises in the past so don't let that be the case again i'm not going to ask for anything ridiculous here like five years of major os updates but i am asking you to one hold true to your word and two actually fix the issues present on so many of your devices now one other issue i've noticed of late that can't be helping the situation is that you've started releasing a vast array of devices most of which are only available in certain regions so aside from your main lineup which currently contains the 9 pro the regular 9 and the nord 2 you've then also got a plethora of other phones like the nord n200 or the nordce the 9r and the m10 now aside from those pretty awful names that is a convoluted portfolio of phones and it doesn't make much sense to me it just looks like you're trying to become the next samsung and don't worry i'm coming for them next but oneplus a wider portfolio of phones is only going to make life harder for yourself particularly when it comes to software support and it's not surprising that you're only offering one major os update for your really budget phones which is kind of unacceptable so oneplus you've got to refine your lineup of phones and from my perspective i think you should bring your portfolio down to just three the pro lineup the flagship lineup with the likes of the regular 9 or 8t and then just your main nordliner with that main oneplus nord being the only budget option and that leads me to my next point pricing and availability now credit where credit is due i actually think the pricing of the oneplus nord and the regular oneplus 9 is pretty spot-on but the issue is that pro liner the oneplus 9 pro was the first time your pricing went above and beyond the 1 000 mark for the globally available baseline version and for me that just seems wrong from a company once heralding themselves as the flagship killer company now i know the oneplus 9 pro was a true flagship so it seems fitting to add a flagship price tag to go with but i don't know it just still feels wrong so look if there's a way that you can find the courage to bring the pricing down below that magic 1 000 mark for your next pro device then i will seriously applaud you but then the next thing you need to solve is the availability of your phones so for context there actually was supposed to be a oneplus 9 pro device that came with 8 gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage that was meant to cost just a sliver under that 1 000 price tag but it wasn't available globally then you've got the regular oneplus 9 which supposedly offers wireless charging but not for the indian versions of the phone and even the oneplus nord wasn't available in the us as well so oneplus what we'd really appreciate is worldwide availability for your entire lineup of phones that would inspire confidence and so then we come to the big area that perhaps you were hoping i wasn't going to mention in this video but it's got to happen and of course we're talking about the cameras and whilst you've made big strides in this department over the past couple of years let's be honest you're still quite a ways behind the rest of the pack when it comes to the images your phones capture and i think largely this comes down to software processing see take a look at these two portrait images believe it or not both of them were actually taken with the same phone the regular oneplus 9 and yet they look drastically different from the other that's because this one was taken with what's called a gcam mod which essentially ports the pixel camera app over to other devices and whilst you're likely to see only minimal changes when just taking landscape images with the gk mod when it comes to portrait images and low light photography the gcam mod absolutely trounces the stock oneplus camera app but this isn't used to oneplus they've been hearing and supposedly listening to user feedback about how their camera app really struggles with processing over a number of years and they even brought on hasselblad this year in an attempt to improve their image processing but the results are still lackluster oneplus whatever you're doing it's not really working if it means scratching the entire oneplus camera app in its current state and starting from scratch do it i mean heck take the gcam port break down the apk and coding and see what it's doing right and uh copy and paste it over to the oneplus camera app and i've got to say you're kind of lucky the gk mod even exists because without it i wouldn't have been nearly quite as positive in my reviews of your phones over the years so oneplus please fix your cameras or more specifically how they process images and so that's it oneplus if you implement these five changes then i say you'll be dominating the headlines once more but this time with glowing reviews of your phones and so now i turn to you guys everyone watching this video what did i miss i reckon there's a pretty solid chance that oneplus are actually watching this video and if that's the case i reckon it's also a pretty solid bet that they're reading the comments as well so be nice but let them know the changes you'd like to see as well beyond all of that if you missed the recent announcements then i am pumped to let you know that my filmmaking course creating cinematic technology videos is back up and live on the newly redesigned graphic platform the course is filled with over five hours of in-depth content that unpacks my entire process for creating high quality technology videos like this one and it's really affordable so i'll leave a link to it down in the description below aside from that hopefully you enjoyed this video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
