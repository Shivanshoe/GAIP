[Music] welcome back to episode 2 of redesigning your setups this is the series where I take the home screen set up submitted by you lot and I redesign them so let's get straight into setup number one all right set up number one has been submitted by Riley this is a three page home screen setup you can see that the main page is in the center and then we've got two pages either site now it's been made using Nova Launcher the very space inspired setup which I really like the look of that wallpaper which is sort of the heart and soul of this entire setup that's been taken from the AMOLED pix wallpaper application we've got the line X icon pack being used throughout a couple of widgets taken from the foxy 4k WGT widget pack and the avocado 4k wgt widget pack right initial impressions are that I really like this setup there's not a whole heap that I'm going to do to change it I particularly like your use of the line X icon pack and I think it complements that wallpaper beautifully my main priority will be to see if we can simplify how many pages are being used because we currently have three pages I always like to see if I can get my home screen setups down to one page but we might not be able to do that but I just think three pages might be a little excessive and if we can cut that down to at least two pages then we'll be doing wonders with this setup so one thing I'll quickly point out is that on this first home screen if we swipe up on a few of these apps you can see that they actually launched hidden folders if you will and then tapping on them opens up the various applications and we have a similar thing on this page where all of these icons are just folder icons and so what I really like about that is that there's lots of functionality baked in but we still have this clean and minimal look that said as I showed you we do have four folder icons that are hidden here on this first home screen and so I'm wondering if we can take the apps that are in the folders on this page and move them over to the folders on this main home screen so I'm not sure if I'm really happy with the changes that I've made here I think it is sacrificing a little bit on functionality for the sake of cleaning up the home screen but what I've done is I've basically merged all the folders from this age and moved them into the folders on this page I've intentionally left this icon here as a standard folder icon so that I can walk you through how to change this into a normal app icon so we basically long press on it edit and then there's two options here we can either checkmark this thing here that says swipe to open fold up and that'll change it to the app icon of the first item in that folder and if we click done there you can see that that now switches over to the Facebook icon and then if I swipe up on it it opens that folder so I can switch that over to Instagram so that it looks how it did in your original set up or we can long press that again come to edit uncheck that and then we can tap on the icon here come down to the line X icon pack and then select whatever icon we want let's say this one here so I can now tap on that and it will launch it as a regular folder we don't have to swipe up to open the folder but if we long press it and go into the edit menu you can see we still have a swipe action here that says first item in folder so if I swipe up on that icon it'll launch into the first application that was in that folder so I'll so I definitely think the functionality of your original setup was easier to understand straight out of the gate because you had different categories for each of your folders you know games communication sport and so forth and I get that but I don't think it's too big of an issue to minimize these two pages into one because at the end of the day we know as the user of this setup that each of these six icons if we swipe up on them will launch into a folder so I think now that we've removed all of those app icons I'm hoping you're not going to be too offended by the fact that I'm now going to remove this entire page altogether I'm gonna unfortunately remove this widget and I'm gonna remove that entire page so now we're left with just two pages I think you'll probably agree with me that it makes sense to switch this page over to the right side and just make sure we set that page to be the main home screen the cool thing is we still have to home screen pages which means if you want to use these app icons as folders instead of you know just being standard app icons as they are now and move back some of these applications that I've transferred over before then that would be a totally acceptable thing to do okay now onto the widgets so we've got a day and time and date one here we've got a weather one here and I think I like the principles of these widgets but I'm gonna tweak the look of them a little bit so I'm gonna open this up I'm gonna go to load preset and I'm gonna stay with the what was that one from that was from the foxy four kwg to widget packs I'm gonna stay with that widget pack and I'm gonna try and pick a different one here so I spent a little time digging through the foxy 4k WGT widget pack and I landed on this one here which is widget number 16 but what I thought I might do is actually tweak these yellow accent colors so that it matches the wallpaper a little better so I think that works pretty well and if we wanted to increase the functionality even further we're gonna jump into kW GT and never get over to the shortcut section and we can see that the developer of this widget has already set up some shortcuts but again we have to set these up so that they go into apps that are installed on our phones so I'll tap on this on here that says calendar make sure we open up the calendar application on our phone then tap on that one that says clock and same thing save that so now if we go back home we tap on the day there that goes into our calendar application and then on the clock and again into the clock application so I think there's some nice functionality within that widget so lastly I want to change the look of this weather widget on the second home screen page so I'm gonna launch into kW GT tap that and then let's go to load preset and let's have a look at what we can do here so what I'm thinking of is actually taking this widget here which is widget 101 from the on it 4k WGT widget pack and I want to actually just delete everything but those five icons in the middle there so I'm gonna come into this stack root and then I'm just going to try and find the items that I need to delete and delete them okay so they've all been deleted now let's make the entire widget just a little bit bigger there save that come back home and in my opinion I think that looks really cool just having those little elements of color in the weather icons they're just add back in a little bit of interest compared to the fairly plain looking widget that you had there prior so those are the changes that I would make without touching the wallpaper and even though I really like this wallpaper the one thing that annoys me about it is all of those stars that are scattered across the image it almost looks as though my phone screen is dirty and I'm tempted to wipe it every time I see it so I want to try and find a wallpaper that is very similar still using the AMOLED picks wallpaper application but one that hopefully doesn't make me feel like I need to want my phone screen every time I look at it okay so I found this one here called colors it was in the colorful abstract folder within the AMOLED pix wallpaper application and I know it still has a few stars there but definitely not as many as the previous wallpaper and if we take a look at that with our home screen I think that looks awesome so those the changes that I would make with this home screen setup loved your initial ideas and I've just built upon it I did end up tweaking the wallpaper but I think it still retains that same visual identity that you had in your original setup I've tweaked the widgets but the icons have stayed very much the same in terms of how they look I've just slightly minimized how many icons and how many pages we have in this setup now we don't have polls anymore on YouTube so you'll have to let me know down in the comments below do you think I improve this set up did I make it worse let me know your thoughts down in the comments below moving on to setup number two this one has been sent in by tyrant or Terran apologies that I'm mispronouncing your name there but this is a two page setup made using Nova Launcher you can see it's got a very clean and minimal vibe about it thin icons and thin widgets and it all works together fairly nicely but I think there's a few small tweaks that we can make to improve it even further now the icon pack being used here is the Alliance icon pack which looks pretty nice and you can see the dock here if we swipe up on these icons they launch hidden folders which is cool and over on the second page these two icons also launch hidden folders or the other icons there are just standard application icons now as for the widgets I don't actually know where they came from ty mentioned that he got them from the Lyons widget application but I tried searching on the Play Store and I couldn't find it so perhaps you recognize them and you can let us know down in the comments below or maybe it's an outdated application now I really like the minimal vibe that you've established with this set up and all I'm going to do is try and accentuate that vibe even further by just making a few small tweaks so the first thing I'm going to do is tweak this wallpaper in fact I'm actually just gonna find a new one altogether I don't mind the one that you've already got here but I think we can find one that's even a little cleaner so I'm gonna open up my trusty Wolpe wallpaper application when in doubt this is the app I always use to find wallpapers particularly when they're real images like this one so I'm gonna start by searching for let's say trees and see what comes up and the thing about your initial wallpaper that you've chosen is that whilst I like the tree vibe there's no real consistency to it and so that makes it feel a little more cluttered so what I want to do is try and find a wallpaper that has a lot of consistency so if you want a wallpaper that has a very very similar vibe to your initial wallpaper and this one here does a pretty decent job it's by Philippe name I can't pronounce on wall P or on unsplash if you're on that website instead but I'm gonna take it a stage further and find one that has a little more negative space which will help our widgets and application icons to stand out even further alright so here's the wallpaper that I'm thinking of using it's by Lou lavet on unsplash or in the wall fee application and if we come back to our home screen you can see it is a little bit of a drastic change from your original wallpaper but it just cleans up the home screen really nicely ok so the next thing I'm going to do is change these two widgets because whilst I don't mind their functionality in that they're presenting good information to us and I like the thin vibe of them I guess I think we can find widgets that are gonna be a little more appropriate for a clean and minimal setup like this okay so what I've done is I've come into the outline for Kaito bg2 widget pack and I've taken this one here called outline widget 22 and you can see there's a few icons there in that widget and I've basically gotten rid of every icon except for the battery icon and text and I've also changed the color to black and this is the end result and I think it looks really clean I like the look of this the simple text and icon there at the top and it still gives you the same information that you had previously but it just looks a heck of a lot more minimal now of course the other thing we can do with that is tap on the widget come over to where it says touch hit the plus icon change this from custom action to launch shortcut change the shortcut to settings shortcut and then battery save that and come home now when we tap on that widget it launches into our phone's battery settings menu which is a handy little added functionality I said that's the battery widget changed and if you want to maintain that white color pallette it does still work in white even though it's a light background I just changed it to black to further increase the contrast there but now we need to think about tweaking this date and weather widget on the main home screen page alright so this is the widget that I landed on is taken from the Sun and c4k WGT widget pack widget 118 if you're looking for it but I have edited it a fair bit to end up with what you're seeing here I think it retains the same information that you had in your original widget but it just cleans it up a little bit brings it slightly into the center gives it a little bit more negative space on either side which i think helps with this sort of a minimal setup now the last thing I want to do as I said I want to accentuate that clean vibe that you've established so to do that I'm gonna take down the size of the icons on the desktop even a little bit further so come into the settings and go to our home screen then icon layout and bring down our icon size to maybe around 90 let's save that come back home and I think that looks really nice to bring down the size of those icons there alright so those are the changes that I would make to this setup as you can see I've changed both of those widgets at the top there I've brought down the size of the icons on the desktop and I've also tweaked the wallpaper just to give it a little bit more negative space rather than having that cluttered background that you had previously but let me know down in the comments below do you think I improve this set up or did I make it worse all right this is our third and final setup for today's episode this has been sent in by red jet or Rashad again apology so if I'm getting your name wrong there but this is a two-page set up again created using Nova Launcher and we've got a couple of different things on show here so I'll just quickly cover what he's used and then we'll go about redesigning it now that wallpaper has been taken from unsplash and I think it's going to be one of the first things I changed just because it makes reading the text a little bit tricky and it makes everything feel a little bit cluttered but we'll come to that in a moment now on this home screen that widget up the top there is from the spiffy 4k WGT widget pack it's wood seventy-six underneath that is a custom self-made widget we sort of like a series of portfolio images there you could obviously replace those images with whatever suits you and then down the very bottom we have a custom self-made clock widget and if we swipe left on that you can see we've got a row of applications there and then we can swipe right as well to bring up another row of applications on a second page we have a standard Google Calendar widget on the left there and then to the right of that is a widget from the todoist application now as I said the first thing we need to change here is that wallpaper because it is just a little bit too cluttered and it makes it really hard to read that text in the middle there so we're gonna jump into wall P as always and I'm just going to search for Lego and see what comes up so I'm trying to find images here that still have that sort of Lego vibe about them but that are not gonna take away from all the other stuff that's on your home screen alright so I've landed on this one here by Jose Lara Zolo because it's got that leg over but it's very clean and minimal but if we come to a home screen you can see it's still pretty hard to read that text so what I'm gonna do is actually open this wallpaper in an image editing application and tweak it just a little bit so I attempted to brighten up the image a little bit just so that it would hopefully help that text to stand out even further but I think what's happening is the little details of the Lego is making it still a little bit tricky to read that text so I think we need to go back to the drawing board and find a different wallpaper altogether so in order to keep that widget the same on the home screen I realized that we're gonna have to use a really light wallpaper so I've landed on this one here from Joel Felipe you can get it in the wall P app or on unsplash.com as well and if we come back to our home screen you can see and nicely that works with that home screen widget now I'm not going to change anything about this particular home screen page I think that we did at the bottom that is decent we don't need to really change much about that and I actually don't mind the white clock there in the dock as well but what I am gonna do is I'm actually going to change the icon pack so let's jump into our settings come to look and feel' icon style and I downloaded one here that is called the Swart icon pack let's that you can probably see that I also added back in a bunch of icons there just to fill up that doc completely because I think it looked a bit odd having those random gaps in your doc there so I've done that for both sides of the doc and you can see how buggy Nova Launcher is with the gestures here on the 1 plus 8 Pro unfortunately but it is what it is you can see that swiping on that doc I think that looks a lot cleaner compared to what we had previously the only other thing I'm going to do with this setup here is I'm going to come to this second page I'm gonna remove this to-do list application widget there which I hope you don't mind and I'm also going to remove the google calendar widget there as well and I'm gonna replace it with a different widget I said there we go I replace those two widgets but instead just one calendar widget from the month calendar widget application we can still tap on it to see all of our events and whatnot but I think that ties in nicely with the rest of the set now I said I didn't mind the white color of the clock widget down the bottom there but it was annoying me that it wasn't matching the other elements in the setup so I did change it to black as well but those are the changes that I would make did this setup really at the end of the day a lot of the changes came down to just the wallpaper and everything else stayed fairly similar except for this second page which I changed to the month calendar widget application there but we did change the icon pack as well down the bottom which I think lends itself nicely to this black and white theme that we've now set up but aside from that the changes are fairly minimal let me know down in the comments below do you think I improved this setup or did I make it worse alrighty but that is it for the redesigns let me know down in the comments below which redesign was your favorite or if you want to get creative let everyone know what you would do differently if you were redesigning the setups yourself but that's it team thank you so much for watching hopefully you enjoyed today's episode and I will catch you later [Music]
