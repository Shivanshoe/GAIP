welcome to 20 hit in Mac OS features that will seriously up the way that you use your Mac device let's go did you know that you can easily merge the contents of two identically named folders in a single location so normally when you try to drag and drop a folder with the same name into the same location there's another folder with the same name you'll be greeted with a prompt that allows you to either stop the transfer or a place the folder altogether so the trick is to hold the option key as you do it when you do so you'll get an additional prompt that allows you to instead merge the folders together for a lot of us battery naming files can be a very handy thing for file organization purposes and these days it's actually a really easy thing to do straight from the right-click context your menu with in Mac OS you just select your group of files then right-click and select rename from here you'll get the option of either replacing text adding text or even applying a format such as a predetermined name followed by an automatically incrementing counter if you're someone like me who loves to use templates so that you don't have to start from scratch every time you create a new document you can actually use a method called stationary pad which will do all the heavy lifting for you so just find the file you want to use as a template then right-click it and select get info from here enable the stationery pad checkbox now when if you double click to open this file Mac OS will make a duplicate for you allowing you to make changes without messing with the original template document it's a pretty universal shortcut to use command or control X to cut something and then command or ctrl V to paste it effectively moving that file instead of duplicating it except this doesn't actually work on a Mac when transferring files instead if you copy a file as per usual by using command C but then use option command V to paste the file it will actually move the file rather than copying it now whilst I love the concept of the Mac OS dynamic wallpapers there are just so few to actually choose from but with a little bit of time and effort you can actually create your own now the first step is to find a set of images 24 to be exact that will represent each hour of the day then after you name each according to the hour of day you'd like it to represent so from 1 all the way to 24 you can then upload them to a website called dynamic wallpaper clock once you do and it's gone through and processed your images you'll then be able to download a particular file that stores all of that information which you can then set as your dynamic wallpaper as per the usual method as someone who loves customization I'm a big fan of how surprisingly easy it is to change the Mac OS icons to whatever I want all you do is open the image file you like the look of in the preview app then tap command C to copy it now right-click the icon you want to change then select get info click on the icon and hit the shortcut command V to paste in your new icon and that's it if you want to organize your dock a little by grouping various icons together then open up the terminal application and copy in the command on screen right now I'll also leave it down in the description below once you've pasted it in click enter your dock will disappear for a moment then it'll reappear with a space a tile on the right you can then use this same prompt to add in as many spaces as you like and then use them to group together your icons the menu bar is that Universal space at the top of your Mac that allows you to quickly access a variety of shortcuts and also check on various status updates about your computer if you want to reorganize it though simply hold command and drag the icons around that way you can have them in an order that makes more sense for your particular needs but if you're someone like me who has a stack of icons up there that you rarely use but you still want them open and accessible for the occasional times that you do use them well you can actually hide them using an app called vanilla simply download and install the app and you'll then be able to move as many icons as you so desire behind this collapsible menu and if you upgrade to the pro version you can actually hide them completely until you quit the app so with all the recent announcements coming in at WWDC it's clear that Mac OS is getting more and more refined as an operating system but that said our Mac's can still build up deficiencies over time and the fact of the matter is our Mac computers still need ongoing maintenance and that's where today's video sponsor CleanMyMac X comes in this software helps you to stay on top of all of the apps and services installed on your Mac as well as all of your permissions which means you can figure out which programs have access to your microphone or your camera and it just gives you more control over your apps and their files therefore helping you to free up space and speed up your computer and probably their most popular feature is called smart skin and this helps you to find logs and cache files that are no longer needed on your device and it gets rid of them which keeps your Mac clean so I'll leave a link below to where you can get a free trial for your Mac and if you like the product then the upgrade is just $35 annually scroll bars are hidden by default on Mac OS and only become visible whenever a user starts to scroll any given page if you're someone who finds this somewhat confusing it's actually really easy to change this default setting head to system preferences then general and change the show scroll bar setting to always now more often than not I actually prefer to use my computer to read your lovely YouTube comments but when it comes to replying I'll admit that I do love to use a sneaky emoji which just perfectly captures what I want to say but in one character well did you know that on a Mac it's actually super easy to insert all of your favorite emojis wherever you're typing simply by hitting the shortcut ctrl command space this will open up a dedicated emoji window ready for all of your emoji typing needs now most of us probably know that the shortcut command Q will quit any active app that is currently open but if you're wanting to quit a huge collection of active apps then this can be somewhat tiresome well instead try holding command + tab and then as you cycle through each of the open apps by tapping tab you can then quit the apps here instead by tapping Q if you want to hide them then tap H simple if you're not already using keyboard shortcuts then you absolutely should start doing so open up the system preferences then navigate to the keyboards section and then the text section from here you can set up any number of shortcuts that when typed will be replaced with your text of choice the really handy one is to set up two at symbols to be replaced with your primary email of choice if you've ever found yourself locked out of your computer for whatever reason don't fret there is a solution to get the solution to work we need to enter recovery mode to enter this turn off your Mac and then once it's off press and hold command R and then press the power button keep holding command R until you see a progress bar appear and then your Mac will boot into recovery mode from here in the menu bar click utilities and then terminal in this terminal window type reset password and then hit enter now close the terminal window and you'll find the reset password tool where you'll see a list of user accounts on your Mac keep in mind if you reset the password for your account you also have to set a new one for every other user as well if you got speakers or headphones plugged into your Mac or a microphone or all of the above you can actually really quickly switch audio source inputs and outputs from the menu bar simply hold option when clicking the volume icon in the menu bar and this will then bring up a list of audio inputs and outputs this will save you from having a dig into the system preferences every time you want to change your audio source did you know there's actually a few hidden window resizing tricks that you can use on Mac OS we all know that you can just click and drag any corner of a select window to move that corner in right well if you hold shift as you drag a corner in it will maintain its current aspect ratio or if you hold option then the corner you selected and the opposite corner of both proportionally resize at the same time and finally if you hold shift and option at the same time you can combine both features now I admit I am a little bit of a new school that if you will when it comes to searching for files on my Mac and that I use spotlight rather than to find out but there are actually a couple of handy tricks that you can use to improve the spotlight method even further so after you've typed your filename and selected a file if you hold the command key the file location will conveniently pop up at the bottom of the file preview or if you type command and then are the file location will actually open in a new Finder window if you browse on the web and you want to save just a small amount of time when you're wanting to navigate to a new URL try typing command L this will immediately highlight the URL bar for you saving you a swipe and a click we all know and no doubt use command H all the time to hide our currently active window but what if you want to do the opposite and hide every other window and clean up your workspace and keep just the active window open well instead type command option H and there you go and finally I like this one quite a while ago but I was blown away with how simple and effective it is if you've got an application that has multiple windows open you can quickly cycle between the windows by using the shortcut command grave I genuinely use this all the time and that's it now I know I normally focus on Android related content on this channel but if you'd like to see more Mac related content then definitely let me know down in the comments below aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and I'll catch you later [Music] you
