if you are a regular listener of spotify or title but you can't quite justify the price to upgrade to a premium account on either platform then there's a pretty good chance that you're well and truly fed up with all of the ads in your face well add silence is a super simple application that will solve that exact issue you just turn the app on and that's it now anytime an ad starts automatically playing add silence will mute your device's audio so you don't have to hear them pretty dang cool okay second up today is brush and whilst this isn't necessarily an application strictly speaking it is a brand new wallpaper pack designed by yours truly and it is perhaps my favorite set of wallpapers i've made so far the pack comes with 15 unique wallpapers each of which have this artsy brushstroke look to them and i was going for pastel vibes when it came to choosing the colorways of each of these backdrops but i've also thrown in some dark options for those who prefer a more moodier look every wallpaper is a crispy 5k resolution plus for anyone using an ios device i've also created a version of each wallpaper that you can use to make your dock invisible and there are some that'll work with the light theme activated and others that will work with the dark theme activated i'm super proud of this wallpaper pack so hopefully you love them as much as i do and along with a bunch of other apps featured in today's video if you sign up as a channel member you will actually get this wallpaper pack completely for free after that is listy and this is a beautifully minimal application that as the name suggests is designed to help you keep the track of anything using lists first and foremost what's great about the app is that there are no logins required to get going so everything is private and secure but then from there you just tap the plus button select a category give your list a name and then start building up your list i'm actually using the app to list the movies i'm wanting to see in 2022 as well as what books i've read throughout the year and the app will even populate additional information where available like movie posters or book covers which means the lists end up looking really cool i just love the simplicity of the app and yet it also works so well speaking of lists fresh things is a super effective application for helping you to keep a track of food and beverage expiration dates now i featured a similar app called nosh at the start of the year and fresh things has very much the same sort of functionality but perhaps an even more visually appealing design so you essentially use the app to input any foods or beverages that have expiration or used by dates and this means if you're ever at the shops and you can't remember whether you need milk or not for example you can just open up fresh things see how long until what you currently have expires and then go from there there's also a checklist for quickly building up a shopping list although it is relatively simple and although the overall functionality of the app isn't quite as powerful as nosh the design is super beautiful next up is at swap draw and this is one of those apps that can really help to level up how functional your home screen is as the name indicates it's essentially an additional standalone app drawer however you can also customize it really heavily which makes it so much more than just an app drawer for example you could hide everything but only your most used applications then set up a widget with a custom icon that launches into the app and then all of a sudden you've got access to your favorite applications within essentially a customized folder which is fantastic if you're using a home screen launcher that doesn't allow for custom folder icon theme there's also a stack of other features and customizations including sorting your apps by icon color which looks really cool and even though the app hasn't been updated since 2017 it still works beautifully now before we press on if you've noticed and liked the look of the motion graphics used for each of the apps intros in this video or even in other videos on my channel over the past few months then you should definitely check out today's video sponsor motion array motion array is an all-in-one video and filmmaking platform filled with a huge collection of beautiful assets including video

down in the description and start exploring all of motion ray's incredible assets today all right black screen is an application that at first glance might seem completely unnecessary but in actuality it could come in very handy so for those not using youtube premium one of the absolute best features of the paid upgrade is that even when your phone screen is locked you can continue listening to any content in the background and so black screen is actually a really clever solution to emulate this with the app activated and set up you'll get this floating little toggle on your phone which when tapped will place a completely black overlay on top of whatever is on your phone which essentially means your phone's display is actually off drawing near to no power but the kicker is your phone doesn't actually think the display is off and so that means you can then open up and play whatever video you want tap the little lock icon and boom all of a sudden you're listening to a youtube video with your phone's display being off at the same time super cool and then we have tellurium which is a really helpful application that solves that annoying whatsapp problem that limits you to only sending messages to contacts saved on your phone and i don't know about you but i've never understood why whatsapp forces you to do this and so with tellurium you just enter your contact's phone number as well as their country code and then hit send that'll automatically open up a whatsapp chat with that particular phone number and that's it okay breathwork is a health-based application with a really cool design and it aims to help improve your mental well-being simply by controlling your breath they have a bunch of different breathing exercises available all neatly laid out in different categories but each of these exercises target some really specific goals including calming yourself down or to prepare yourself for exercise or my personal favorite to help your sleeping patterns but then as i said i think my favorite part of this app is the design beautiful colors and fantastic ui elements throughout seriously visually pleasing now there are countless amounts of audio recording applications available on the play store but voice recorder manages to stand out because of its unique design as you can see instead of your run-of-the-mill interface voice recorder emulates a very vintage looking and feeling tape deck complete with animated cassettes and very authentic sound effects whenever you tap a button the app has 16 different tape deck designs which it will cycle through randomly unless you upgrade to the premium version they all look just as impressive as the last the only thing i wish the developers would implement is to force the app into full screen mode which i think would enhance the look even more so but aside from that it's such a cool approach to an otherwise tried and true application concept so huge props to the developers behind it so finally today we have echo kwgt a beautifully designed widget pack for anyone who loves a monochromatic home screen setup at the time of making this video the pack comes with 91 different widgets each of which have a black and white colorway and along with the right wallpaper these widgets look downright gorgeous there's a heap of really minimal widgets for those minimalists out there along with a stack of really functional widgets so in my opinion everyone is catered for and i'm confident that pretty much every single widget available could fit seamlessly into just about any home screen setup and that is it now as always a huge thank you to the developers on screen right now as they've all been kind enough to give my channel members a promo code to the premium versions of their apps no questions asked so
