right it's been three months since my last q a video which you guys seem to really dig so once again i reached out to you over on twitter instagram and here on youtube to see what questions you had for me so without further ado let's get answering all right this first question comes from chronic poseidon over on twitter and they ask where and how do you find unique underrated but real useful and good-looking apps now i get this question quite a lot because obviously a lot of the content that i post to my channel is at related and honestly it can be quite a lengthy process to try and find 10 apps each and every month that i think are worth showcasing one of the main ways is through my emails so every single month i get sent a stack of emails from usually app developers asking me to try out the apps that they've made and seeing whether or not i'd be interested in featuring them on my channel for every email that i get i usually flick them a quick response letting them know that i've got their email but then i'll categorize their email under an app suggestions folder and then in the week or two leading up to creating the top android apps video i'll sift through that folder and try out all of the apps that i've been sent any app that i like in this folder will usually get a feature in my top android apps videos and some of my favorite applications that i've ever featured have come from the developer emailing me and asking for me to showcase their app and finally i'll of course spend a bit of time researching across the web whether it be on xda or android authority or any other up-to-date articles that might showcase fairly undiscovered applications but then i'll of course look at other videos to see what apps are doing the rounds that might be worth featuring in my own videos this next question is also from twitter and that username is borderline impossible to pronounce wahida juzaman not bad they ask nowadays midrange offers similar features like flagships are flagships really worth buying or are we just buying brand value yeah honestly these days i do think most mid-range phones are where it's at these days they offer the best bang for buck and that is generally speaking what i would point someone in the direction of if they're considering upgrading uh to a long-term device i really do think that the top-end flagships don't offer great bang for buck anymore i mean they never really have but these days the mid-ranges just get so close in terms of offering the amount of features most people would want and so those top-end flagships are best suited for those who would call themselves tech enthusiasts ben from lover of tech says love those cinematic intros when you make the phone spin and stuff how long does it usually take and what's your favorite type of shot when making a video yeah so all of my phone intros are probably what take the longest amount of time to produce for each of my phone reviews and sometimes a disproportionate amount of time as well i will say i love making them and they really do help me to flex that creative muscle that otherwise wouldn't be possible but when i reflect over some of the more in-depth intros that i've made over the past few years and i recognize that some have taken at least four hours to make and sometimes even a full day when you include the shooting of the intro as well that's when i think it's gone a little bit too far but hey i love doing it so in the end it's probably worth it as for my favorite type of shot to get this is a tough one i've got a few different categories that my b-roll falls under for most of my phone reviews you've got top-downs you've got studio b-roll and you've got outdoor b-roll as well and depending on the video any one of them could be my favorite to capture that said i really do enjoy having a nice large bank of outdoor b-roll to utilize throughout my phone reviews and so that's why i try and incorporate outdoor shots as much as possible it might not be the funnest to shoot particularly when it's cold it's winter my hands are getting ice cold but when it comes to actually incorporating them into the edit usually those are the types of shots that i enjoy using the most joe asks when is your official app palette getting launched in the play store now i know i mentioned in my last q a video that uh the app was maybe a month or two away but the developer that i've been working with he got busy with some other jobs uh and so we're now working on the app once again and we're working on it pretty quickly so i don't want to put a definitive date on paper because i'll probably get in trouble like i did the last time but just to whet your appetite a little bit how about i give you a little teaser of the new readers on you ready [Music] was that too quick i'll do one more you ready there you go hopefully that'll wet your appetite until the app officially gets released all right this next question comes from instagram and the question is would you switch over to ios as your main os if it got the same customization options as android now this is a huge what if because i don't really ever foresee ios getting the same level of customization that android currently has what with being able to place widgets wherever we want them and you know having apps like kwgt to design widgets essentially from scratch but if it did then i probably still wouldn't make the switch i've been using android so long now that i've become so accustomed to the way the ui is laid out so the quick settings the settings menu itself the app drawer and more than anything the notification system itself those are all key elements that keep me on android and prevent me from wanting to switch to ios this next question says what do you cover in your course so for those who missed it i just recently announced that my filmmaking course creating cinematic technology videos is back up and live on the newly redesigned graphi platform i'll leave a link to it down below if you're interested in checking it out you can also watch the trailer there to see if it's something that interests you but for a bit of context the platform that i uploaded my course to all those months ago was originally designed with mobile viewing in mind so the courses were designed with that vertical aspect ratio but then over the past six months or so they've been tweaking and redesigning their platform and now it's a little bit of a different system so when the new platform launched i could have just uploaded my old course in the vertical aspect ratio that would have been fine but i actually filmed the entire course in a wide aspect ratio and so i thought i might as well take the time to edit it and tweak it and make sure it fits this new wider aspect ratio because that is actually my preferred aspect ratio so i spent about a week and a half re-editing it and exporting it and then uploading it and now all of it is live and ready for you to view on the new graphic platform you can see all of the details regarding the course on the website on that landing page but just for a little bit of coverage it literally covers every step of the process when it comes to how i create my youtube videos so pre-production as well as production which is actually a three plus hour long chapter including filming a-roll the camera equipment i recommend filming outdoor b-roll filming top-downs filming studio b-roll all that stuff is covered plus then the entire editing process doing vfx work and then finalizing the videos so that they're ready for upload to youtube and i even discussed the youtube algorithm and discuss best practices when it comes to thinking about how to get your videos seen by people on the platform literally the course is over five hours long i spent so long making sure that it was a comprehensive guide to creating a high quality and cinematic technology videos so as i said i'll leave a link to it down in the description below and i'd really appreciate it if you consider purchasing the course all right this next question asks what are the best free productivity apps for everyone other than some of the google apps now productivity is a pretty broad genre of application but i have picked three of my personal favorite productivity apps and these are ones that i now use every single day and so the first app is task aid now task a did sponsor a video on the channel a number of months ago now but we haven't worked together since then and they are not sponsoring me to say this i just genuinely really enjoy using this app and in fact i use it all the time there are essentially two main ways that i use this application the first is to keep a track of my to-do list related to my youtube workflow so at the start of every single week i'll actually make a fairly detailed list in task aid of everything i'm wanting to achieve on any given day in the upcoming week so whether it's to complete scripts or to film a role or to film a particular type of b-roll for a video or to finalize an edit or to create a thumbnail all of that stuff is loaded in to my task list and then i genuinely reference that task multiple times a day and as i complete tasks i check it off and move on to the next one so i do most of that process using the desktop version but i can obviously see it all on my phone as well but the way that i utilize the app version most is if i'm ever going out to do some shooting on location so for example for my top android apps intros i'll often create a shot list in task aid in a different document this is often set up as a checklist and then when i'm out and about obviously i don't want to take my computer with me and so i just open up the app work my way through the checklist to ensure i'm getting every single shot that i've planned for honestly i really do use this application pretty much all the time and as a result i can highly recommend it all right the second productivity application that i can highly recommend is one that actually got a feature in my most recent episode of the top android apps and it's called notes nook so notes nook as the name suggests is a note-taking application but it's got a really clean and fresh design and it's also got online syncing support which is a must-have feature if i'm going to consider switching to a particular note-taking application full-time so prior to using notes nook i was using an application called simplenote pretty much for the last five years really it's also got online syncing and it's still a fantastic application but i really do just enjoy the design of knows nook and so i think i'm going to switch to using it full time and then finally i'm going to sound like a bit of a broken record here but i cannot talk about productivity app recommendations without mentioning memory remember rigi gets a mention on my channel every few months it seems in fact it got a feature in my last q a video as well but this is a to-do lists and reminders application the design is just top shelf i've seriously never really come across another app like it and i've tried other reminder applications and none of them can stack up to not only the design that memorize offers but also the feature set as well funnily enough though it's really only one key feature that keeps me using memory g time and time again and that is snoozable reminders i know that android has its own native snoozing and so perhaps other developers have thought that that's enough but with the memories snoozing functionality you can really dial in exactly how long you want that notification to be snoozed for i'm always on the lookout for more productivity applications though so let me know the ones that you most recommend down in the comments below alright this next question comes from youtube and i've had a few other people submit a similar question as well but the question is what app do i use to create my instagram stories and the answer is unfold i actually recommended this app in one of my top android apps videos in the last couple of years can't remember which one but i've been using it ever since will you ever take on team members to help you shoot and edit i think the inevitable answer is yes but the big question is when right now i'm pretty content with the level of content that i can produce just being a one-man band but there have been points in the creation process over the past six months or so where i thought gee it'd be really handy to have someone helping me out but i think i'm a while away from getting someone on board full time and so the big question is what do i get the person to do is it editing is it replying to emails is it creating thumbnails is it vfx work cinematography who knows probably all of the above but having someone who's on board part time to do a bunch of that stuff could be pretty tricky so it's a bit of a wait and see but i am excited for the moment when i can finally employ someone and have them helping out and hopefully making my videos even better the last question your favorite phone of 2021 till now oh that is a tough one i've reviewed a lot of phones this year more than i ever have in my youtube career but uh if i had to nail it down to just one right now actually let me go get it [Music] so i think it'd be a toss up between the regular xiaomi mi 11 and the oneplus 9 it's these sorts of phones that companies often try and jam as much value into without making the price astronomical so they tend to cut out the features that are unnecessary and so i really enjoyed the xiaomi mi 11 i also love the oneplus 9 but the one issue that i'm not loving about this phone is that i never get my gmail notifications whereas there were no issues with notifications on the xiaomi mi 11 so it's a toss up between these two phones they're pretty similar but i like both of them that said there's still quite a number of phones to review before the year is out so i'm guessing by the end of the year that decision may well have changed okay so those are the more in-depth answers out of the way but you know that i always love to do a quick fire round so hold on to your butts here we go dc or marvel marvel do you like assassin's creed never played it do you think oneplus is slowly digging its own grave by merging with color os maybe video coming on that very soon purchasing the oneplus 9 currently is it worth it yeah ios apps and setup episodes probably not did you ever think of stopping youtube to be honest never thought of it are you a full-time youtuber now or do you have a main job and do youtube as a hobby i'm full time now iphone 10r or iphone 11 iphone 11. does nova launcher create any lag in the os do you recommend using nova over one ui it does create a little bit of lag but it has gotten less so over the past little while have you ever been outside australia yes many times and i am missing not being able to travel at the moment when will you upgrade your camera hopefully when the sony a74 gets released in the next couple of months fingers crossed and last question how long do you work daily on average every single week i work monday to friday nine to five and that's it man my throat is hurting after that anyway that's it a huge thank you to everyone that sent in questions there were so many more that i simply didn't have time to fit into today's video so if your question didn't get answered then please feel free to post it down in the comments and i'll do my best to respond to them over the next few days don't forget to check out my filmmaking course using that link down in the description below but aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
