so this is a video that I've been meaning to create for quite a while but for anyone who knows me well you'll know that I like things kept neat and tidy and the same holds true for my file management so if you're a video editor or a content creator today I'm gonna show you what I think is the best way that you can manage your media ready let's go okay so this is super simple we've got a folder open on my SSD here with all of my current projects now you'll notice at the top here I have a folder called template and if I click on that you'll see that the folder structure I use lives here but they're all empty but I genuinely swear by this folder structure so let me show you how it works we've got five overarching folders here audio exports footage graphics and projects and they're all fairly self-explanatory but let's take a deeper dive into each folder so you can see how I take things a stage further so in our audio folder we've got an additional four folders music SFX vo and zoom so music is pretty obvious any music that I'm using for the current project I'm working on generally get stored in this folder but that said I do have another folder located elsewhere on my drive that has a whole heap of downloaded music content that I generally pull from so actually this folder is generally where I store stems of music or perhaps edited versions of music that are longer or shorter than the original recordings then SFX is where all of my sound effects get stored as you can see I already have a bunch of audio files that I fairly regularly use across each project that I'm working on but again anything else I'd download for a specific project gets stored in this folder now for most video projects I do generally have on camera audio so what you're listening to right now where I'm talking to camera this actually gets recorded separately from my camera through a shotgun microphone into a zoom h4n recorder and then naturally these files get stored in this folder here called zoom but then there are some projects where I only have voiceover recordings and so these files get stored in the folder labeled video and therefore some projects I'll actually have a combination of both and so having these folders separate and clearly labeled is really helpful for my workflow okay let's head out of that audio folder and move into the exports folder and as you can see here I have three additional subfolders AUD is for audio exports PR is for ongoing files that are export out of Premiere Pro and then the finals folder is where I place well finals then into the footage folder and here I have two folders a roll and b-roll and these are obviously fairly self-explanatory sometimes under the b-roll folder I might create additional folders that help organize my footage even more so but for the most part it generally just stays as a role and b-roll so then we have the graphics folder and in this folder we have four additional subfolders AE renders which is where I place all of the exported items that come from Adobe After Effects then effects which includes some preset video assets that I fairly regularly use across each of my videos that I have a folder that I begrudging Li called other which contains exactly that some other graphical assets that are used from time to time some for thumbnails some for videos and some for both this folder is generally where I'll also store any media that's been downloaded from a phone let's say for a camera review segment and so anything like that will get stored into this folder as well and then lastly we have a folder here called tiens which stands for thumbnails so any photos that I've taken throughout the filming process that I think might be used for a thumbnail later on they'll get stored into this folder as well as the Photoshop files that I've created to actually make the end thumbnails the completed thumbnail files are actually saved out as JPEGs and stored in that files folder that I have in the exports folder all right finally we have the projects folder and as you can see here actually have two Premiere Pro template projects that I've set up and saved myself one from Mac and one for PC because sometimes I'm switching between the two but if I open one of these you'll see that it contains a very similar folder structure as to what we have on my SSD and again this just helps in keeping everything neat organized and easy to follow but any other video or audio project files that I create throughout the course of a project including After Effects projects and audition project files they all get stored in here as well this also helps to keep all of those extra folders that the Adobe suite of applications like to create automatically you know for render files and so forth contains so that they're not messing everything up and then at the end of a project once I know everything is done and dusted I delete everything except for the final exports and isolated audio export the thumbnail files and the project files this way I don't have to manage tons and tons of storage but I still have a contingency plan if I ever need to go back and use old content for a future video that's it that is my ultimate file management system and as I said at the start of the video your video editor or a content creator then I can highly recommend using this system as a way to keep all of your files clean and organized which will greatly enhance your workflow aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and I will catch you later [Music] you all
