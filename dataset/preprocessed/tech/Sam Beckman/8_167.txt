welcome to ten of the best smartphone gadgets you may never have thought of to buy let's get straight in those of you with long commutes will appreciate the walkie car phone charger it's got both USB C and USB eight outputs and it supports Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 fast charging which is an absolute must-have feature if you're someone who relies on juicing up your phone as you drive the design is fairly minimal but the functionality is amazing this is the key organizer from orbit it takes an otherwise messy stack of keys and cleanse them all up into a neat leather organizer now know you might be thinking that ain't smartphone related and whilst the key organizer might not be the Bluetooth tracker certainly is this accessory is an additional add-on that fits neatly into the key organizer and might be a game changer for those of you who often lose your keys using the chat polar app on your phone you can keep a track of wherever your keys are at any given time you can even send an alert notification to your keys if they're out of sight there's even a button on the tracker that allows you to snap a photo on your phone wirelessly there's something satisfying about propping your phone up rather than just lying it down on the table and with this affordable phone stand from 5m you can do it in style and on a budget there's nothing too fancy about it it doesn't charge your phone or anything like that but its sturdy it has a clean design and it's adjustable as well it also has anti slip protection and allows you to fit pretty much any sized device with a small phone or a large tablet so it's a great option for anyone looking to add a little flair to their desk setup these days many cell phone manufacturers are all about their 10 x and 30 x and even now a hundred times zoom features on their smart phones and yet more often than not they're fairly gimmicky if your goal is to take a quality photo now this generic 12 x universal optical lens is probably also a product that leans towards gimmicky rather than functional but the results are often a lot sharper than what you can get out of the aforementioned zoom features it can be quite finicky to line it up just right with your smartphone's lens and even when you do you will experience some serious vignetting and fringing around the edges of your images but for less than 15 bucks it's a pretty decent solution now pop sockets have never really been my thing but the gyro ring holder from museums has been the FIR one that I've tried that I've actually thought about keeping on my phone it's got a really strong metal design so it feels quite premium and it's a lot more subtle than most of the pop sockets I've seen or try it out additionally because the way it's been designed you can also use it as a desktop stand for your phone making it really versatile speaking of desktop stands another option is this two-in-one sound amplifier that also holds your phone up now all honesty the build quality of this thing is very cheap nothing but plastic all the way around but it's got this speaker grille design on the front which means when you place a phone with bottom firing speakers into it it will actually redirect that sound to come out of the front of this amplifier it's a subtle change that you might find it a really nice addition that phone that you have that only has bottom firing speakers so I'm definitely not much of a gamer but if I was the IP got Bluetooth gaming controller would be something I'd want to pick up as the name suggests this controller connects to your phone of choice via bluetooth and then it telescopes open to later insert your phone essentially transforming it into an incredible portable gaming device it's got a range of buttons and controls meaning it's adaptable to pretty much any game you can think of now generally when we think of smart home security solutions we think of big and expensive equipment that is always just a little bit out of our price range well the did use smart home security sensor is the opposite in every way possible firstly this thing is tiny which means it's unobtrusive and easy to mount with the 3m strips provided you place one side on your window or door and then the other on the frame right next to it and then once you have the app downloaded and the sensor connected to your Wi-Fi every time that door or window opens you will receive an alert the other thing is it's ridiculously inexpensive making it a great option for those looking to pick up a few to place around the home to up their security gain one of my favourite products on this list is this 15 inch portable touchscreen monitor and this is a device that can literally transform your smartphone into a computer now admittedly this works best with phones that have the proper support such as Samsung or huawei devices and in these cases if you have a portable touchscreen monitor like this one from white Chansey it genuinely feels like you all of a sudden have a laptop or tablet device it also works as an external touchscreen display for laptops PCs and gaming devices and so if you're interested in upping your productivity game this device is a must-have smartphone manufacturers are getting better and better at the optical and even electronic image stabilization implementations that they're putting into their smartphones but if you're looking for a way to get proper smooth and cinematic footage using a smartphone then there's no better solution than a gibble and the smooth fall from jae-hoon is one of the best this gimbal is packed the brim full of useful features some of which include focus pulling and zooming face and object tracking motion time lapses plus a heat more and with the companion joining app which is available for both iOS and Android devices as well as a little bit of practice the results you can end up with are seriously impressive but that's it if you enjoyed the video then a sub would be amazing and let me
