[Music] so with the end of the year quickly approaching i thought it'd be really fun to do my first ever roundup of the best smartphones released this year and 2021 was a huge year for me personally in terms of phone reviews where i actually ended up reviewing 15 different devices plus i did a bunch of revisited reviews as well and in comparison to previous years this he was a huge step up in terms of the amount of devices i reviewed so i've reflected long and hard and i've ended up picking a bunch of winners along with some honorable mentions across a range of pricing categories and i've also picked a winner for what i'm calling the overall best smartphone of the year now first things first this video is going to be hugely subjective i'm going to own that right up front because a lot of the choices i make today are based on things i prioritize most when deciding whether i like a phone or not and this might differ from what you prioritize when picking a phone so keep that in mind whilst you watch this video but the other thing i will say is that the number one rule for deciding which phones were even considered for each category was that i actually had to have inserted my sim card into the phone and reviewed it here on my chat there were a heap of phones released this year that i wasn't able to get my hands on for one reason or another which is probably the reason they're not on this list so if your favorite does not make today's video check to see whether i reviewed it this year i'll have a playlist linked up in the cards and down below and if i didn't review it that's probably the reason it's not featured in today's video but with that being said let's get on to the first category [Music] now i was gonna award a winner for the best budget phone of the year but when i looked through all of the phones i reviewed this year that fell into this pricing category there were actually only three the oneplus nord 2 the zte axon 30 and the samsung galaxy a525g my least favorite of the three was the galaxy a52 and whilst the axon 30 was a pretty solid option it's actually kind of debatable whether it should be considered budget or not now i would have had no problem awarding the ultimate winner to the nord 2 but there have actually been a number of reports of some nor2 devices exploding around the world so it made me a little less confident it was a great phone but it feels a little off to recommend a device that's exploded even just a handful of times so i don't really want to recommend any of these phones for this category so accordingly we're going to skip it and move straight onto the next one which is the best mid-range phone of the year okay so this is perhaps my favorite pricing tier for phones release this year and really for me this was a pretty fluid category in terms of price i basically just included any phones that cost less than a thousand australian dollars but above about six to seven hundred dollars and in this pricing tier there were a lot of fantastic phones so honorable mentions have to go to the galaxy s 21 the oneplus 9 and the xiaomi mi 11 all of which were phones i would have been happy to continue using as my main everyday devices and what made them all such appealing options were that they were quite a bit cheaper than their more premium counterparts but they sacrificed little in the way of features the galaxy s 21 you lost out on that 10 times periscope lens and it also had a cheaper build but aside from that it had pretty much every other feature the much more expensive s21 ultra had similar story for both the oneplus 9 and xiaomi mi 11 both of which dropped the telephoto lenses and maybe one or two other small features but everything else was pretty much included so i still have no problems in recommending any of those three devices but the ultimate winner of best mid-range phone of the year goes undoubtedly to the pixel 6. i only just reviewed this phone on the channel and like the runners-up in this category it offers most of the key features the more premium pixel 6 pro offers but everything else either matches or in some cases supersedes it so yes no telephoto lens and only a 90 hertz display but we've got the same super fast tensor chip inside we've got the exact same software which is a true joy to use thanks to all of those amazing animations and for me it actually has a better design and feel in the hand i also personally felt like the speakers were better as well as the fingerprint sensor and somehow the haptics also felt better than the 6 pro as well but more than anything it is the price of this phone at launch that makes it the best value offering of all of the options in this category the other three phones all launched north of 700 us dollars whereas the pixel 6 launched for a much more affordable 5.99 like i said all of the phones in this category were seriously impressive without question the pixel 6 is my favorite of the lot now before we press on just wanted to give a shout out to today's video sponsor mpl if you haven't heard of npl or mobile premier league it's basically like an all-in-one hub for really cool online multiplayer format games you can download it for ios via the app store itself or for android users simply use a browser on your phone to go to mpl.us and download the apk directly ignore any warning banners that pop up android phones will always show these anytime you sideload an art and mpl is absolutely safe and secure but once installed you'll see that the app contains over 10 different games to pick from including bingo bubble shooter and 10 pin bowling throughout every single game there are actually opportunities to win real money now for some of these games you do need to pay to enter so trend carefully and play responsibly but there are a number of free games as well you can also choose to play in a variety of formats including head-to-head battles or multiplayer tournaments and you don't have to worry about being matched up against super hard components because the app actually matches you up against other players with a similar skill level to yourself you do need to be over 18 to play the games so keep that in mind but if this sounds like an app you want to try then check out the first link down in the description below okay from there we have the best flagship phone of 2021 and for me to be on the list in this category you essentially need to be not only above that 1 000 price tag australian dollars that is but you also need to be the top tier phone in your phone line this was the fullest category of the year for me with phones like the galaxy s 21 ultra the oneplus 9 pro and even the pixel 6 pro all of which were pretty great options that i quite enjoyed using but i want to give the first runner-up title to the xiaomi mi 11 ultra this was a seriously fun phone to use with really impressive cameras and a super fluid software experience definitely flagship material but then the ultimate winner of this category is none other than the iphone 13 pro never did i think i'd have as much fun using an iphone as i did with the 13 pro but i think the main reason it claims this particular category is that it was just so damn reliable whatever i threw at it it just handled with absolute ease seriously the fastest phone on the market hands down by then the cameras were incredible with just enough features to make them really great to use full time that 120hz display was also really fluid and also super bright as well which was amazing and that battery life unparalleled this was the first time i was actually a little sad to stop using an iphone when i moved on to reviewing the next device but don't worry i got it out of my system and i'm back to loving android once more now i didn't review the 13 pro max this year hence why it wasn't awarded this title however i probably still would have been hesitant to give it the top prize anyway simply because of how big and chunky it is i certainly appreciate a smaller form factor and the 13 pro offers that without compromising on really any features so a pretty solid range of options for this category and i know an android channel giving a price to an iphone might be a little controversial but hey it was a really great phone that seriously impressed me [Music] and so finally we have the outright best phone of the year now for me this category boils down to three main factors firstly just how good a phone was overall in terms of each and every category i place high value in secondly whether the phone offers good enough value in terms of its price and then thirdly the really important deciding factor for me comes down to which phone i decide to leave my sim in once i've finished reviewing every phone of the year see i've got a bit of a break now until i start reviewing devices again probably until february next year and so i'm now at a point where i get to settle in and use just one of these phones for a longer period of time and the phone that i've picked is the winner of this category now before i get to the winner i do want to give honorable mentions to the galaxy s21 the iphone 13 pro and the pixel 6 pro all of which were really incredible phones that i thoroughly enjoyed using throughout this year i was never going to keep using the iphone 13 pro long term but the galaxy s s21 was a really fun phone to use though the haptics were a little disappointing but at the end of reviewing the pixel 6 pro i thought for sure that would be the phone that won this category but little did i know that in actual fact its cheaper brother would be the one to claim the title and so the ultimate winner for best smartphone of the year is the regular pixel six and for me the reason it won against its more premium flagship brother comes down to three main components the build the haptics and of course the price so the fact that the regular six has both a flat display and matte rails seriously leveled up how it felt in the hand the six pro never stopped feeling chunky to me and i honestly don't mind a big phone but the shiny rails and curved display alongside the glossy finish on the back made it pretty uncomfortable to hold and i was so surprised at how much i preferred the feel of the regular six the haptics are also the best haptics i've experienced on a phone this year except for perhaps the iphone 13 lineup but then like i said the price to value ratio for this phone is on another level 5.99 for what feels like a top-end flagship in day-to-day use is seriously amazing and whilst it's certainly not a perfect device no phone really ever is it's the one i will probably be recommending most people buy for the next six months or so and so there you have it those were my winners for the best smartphones across the year of 2021 and i'm guessing there's going to be a lot of discussion down in the comments below so be nice but absolutely have at it and let me know which phones you thought should have won each of the categories and why aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
