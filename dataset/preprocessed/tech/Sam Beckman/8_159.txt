[Music] so this is the 1+8 Pro and you don't want to see instead of us it has me torn on one hand in a lot of ways this is one of the best Android devices that you can pick up right now but on the other hand the hefty price tag that comes with buying this phone kind of makes it lose that magical and/or inspiring feeling that used to come from using a flagship level 1 plus device that didn't leave as big a hole in your pocket and so for this review we're gonna take a look at what oneplus has done differently that in some ways justifies the price hike and figure out whether or not it was all actually worth it so let's dive right in it's now like all oneplus devices the oneplus 8 pro is a seriously fast phone the fastest really that Android has to offer and that's both in performance but also in fluidity whilst the specs of course play a huge part in achieving this speed what really hits the nail on the head is the display not only is it sharp vivid and amazingly bright for outdoor use the real talking point here is that silky smooth 120 Hertz refresh rate only thing is the difference between 120 Hertz and 90 Hertz really isn't that noticeable compared to the difference between 90 Hertz and 60 Hertz and so the display on its own really isn't a reason to upgrade from the significantly cheaper 7 and 17 devices at least in my opinion now as a side note there were actually quite a number of reports that some units were suffering from a green tint and crushed blacks issue when viewing these panels at minimum brightness but put simply I haven't really experienced it I think in the first day or two of using the device it may have been present but I didn't really pick up on it and then a software patch came through that said it was addressing this issue and since then I definitely haven't noticed it the real issue with this display though are those curved edges I'm not gonna hop on too long about this but in short it has a pretty noticeable impact on daily use particularly one-handed use and so please oneplus stop doing this now as well as that whilst the battery life on the 8 Pro is very decent to say the least easily a full day performer I think with the increase up to 120 Hertz it ends up being just about the same as what was offered on the oneplus and 17 we do however now get the inclusion of wireless charging the first one plus device to include this feature in any capacity so I guess if you've been put off from buying a one plus device in the past because of a lack of wireless charging well maybe the price hike is worth it for you there's for the rest of the device honestly oneplus really doesn't cut many corners it's still got that same possibly fastest on the market in display fingerprint sensor that is slightly made me open up to the idea of in display fingerprint sensors it's got incredible haptics the really handy alerts light up great speaker performance a ridiculously fast albeit less secure face unlock that in terms of software implementation feels as seamless as what we have on the pixel for lineup and in terms of software it's still got that clean oxygen OS that a lot of us have come to know and love now don't get me wrong there are a number of quirks about oxygen OS that leave a lot to be desired like the lack of an always-on display or the lack of a quick settings shortcut to toggle on and off the dark theme quickly or even just the general home screen experience which whilst more flexible than what the pixel launcher offers still feels a little off in regards to execution but again it's the same experience possibly just a little bit smoother and a little bit faster than what you can get on older oneplus devices now there are three other areas that perhaps might justify the price increase of the oneplus 8 pro and in order from least important to most important they are 5g not very important in ip68 rating nice to have but not essential and an improved camera setup which is by far the best upgrade on this phone now I've already done a full deep dive on the camera set up on the oneplus 8 Pro pitting it against the galaxy s 20 plus you know head-to-head comparison so I'll leave a link up here and down there but in short the images you can take using this phone a flagship quality keep in mind they're still not quite up to the level of the iPhones in pixels of the world but they're very very decent and that's probably the biggest difference between the 8 Pro in the 70 on the 70 you had fairly decent usable cameras but on a pro you have flagship other cameras neither have the best cameras but keep in mind the 70 also didn't have the worst cameras so to wrap this all up there's no question that the oneplus 8 Pro is a phenomenal device it does everything you'd expect and want a $900 smartphone to do but when you compare it to the nearly half the price one plus 70 it honestly becomes a significantly tougher choice if you buy this phone you know what you're getting yourself into it is an excellent phone with pretty much compromises evident at all except for the fact that it doesn't ship with it always on display but for me these really premium and expensive phones are getting me all the more excited for the more budget oriented Android phones coming soon like the pixel for a and even supposed 1 plus Z because I think those phones are going to be much easier to recommend to someone without feeling the weight of their wallet on my shoulders but that's it for my review on the oneplus 8 pro hopefully you enjoyed it or at least found it entertaining and let me know your thoughts on one passes move into proper flagship territory down in the comments below but that's it thank you all very much for watching and I'll catch you later [Music] you [Music]
