not too long ago i posted a video that covered the process of how to root both the pixel 6 and 6 pro devices and at the end of making that video i wasn't entirely sure whether i would leave my regular pixel 6 rooted because i didn't want to lose access to some really important apps i use every day so back when i used to regularly route my main everyday devices which was sometime back in 2020 both google pay and service new south wales which is an app that holds a digital copy of my driver's license they both stopped working and no fix i found could resolve the issue and these are apps i rely on every single day so for quite some time i actually just stopped rooting my everyday phones but then i found out that lawn 12 had been released and that it worked with quick switch on routed devices running android 12 and being someone who absolutely loads the pixel launcher and how limiting it is in regards to customization i was like gee i might have to go back to the drawing board here and see if i can figure it out and i did now if you watched my review of the pixel 6 you'll know that i've actually been using that phone as my main everyday device with root access enabled and both service new south wales and google pay working as good as gold ever since i first rooted it and that actually remains true even to this day i even manually sideloaded the december software patch and everything is still working beautifully so i thought i better make a video detailing exactly how i did it so without further ado let's dive in so first things first if you've already got your phone rooted while simultaneously being on android 12 then i'm assuming you've already got the latest canary version of magisk installed but if not make sure you updated it because in order for this process to work we'd need the version of magisk that includes the zgisk functionality which is kind of like the new version of magisk hide which has now been discontinued assuming you have that version installed from there on our phones we want to download a magisk module called magisk hide props config and i've left a link to where you can download this down in the description as well as everything else mentioned in this video but once it's downloaded we then want to launch the magic manager application navigate over to the modules section and then tap the button at the top to install a module from our phone storage go ahead and find that magiscard props config file in your downloads folder and select it and then it should be automatically installed once complete you can go ahead and tap the reboot button to restart your device from there if you don't have one installed already you'll need to now download and install a terminal emulator application my go to option is called termix so again i'll leave that linked below but with the terminal application opened we'll go ahead and type su space dash c space props and then hit enter we'll then get a prompt to grant the app super user access so go ahead and grant it and then it should launch the magisk card props config automatically now we'll type the number two which is to force basic key attestation and then hit enter this will take us to the force basic key attestation page and by default the value is set to nexus 5 but i found success with the nexus 6p value so to change it i'll type in d then hit enter then i'll type seven hit enter and then finally i'll type five and once again hit enter it will now ask you to confirm the new value so type y for yes and then enter we'll now need to reboot the device so to do this we'll type y and then once again say it with me we'll hit enter all right with that sorted out and our phone rebooted we can now launch it back into the magisk application and then we can tap on the settings icon up here we'll come down to the magic section and we then need to enable the ziges toggle here then the enforce denylist toggle and then we can come into this configure deny list menu and this is basically an updated version of magisk you then need to just toggle any apps in this list that usually don't work with root access enabled so i'll first enable the toggle for the service new south wales application you can do the same for any apps as necessary i'll also do the same for google pay but to get google pay to actually work we also have to hide magisk from google play services which isn't actually in this list by default so to make sure we can see it on the list we'll tap this button here and select the check mark to enable system apps within the list and we can then find the google play services section and make sure every option on this list is toggled on okay now we need to download another magisk module called universal safety net fix which again i'll leave linked below but once it's downloaded we'll come back to the module section within magisk tap on install from storage and then tap the safety net fixed module we just downloaded we can then hit reboot okay with our phone rebooted there's just a couple of small steps from here the first is to clear the data from any of the apps that haven't been working due to root access being enabled so for example i'll find the google pay app in my app drawer long press it select app info then go to the storage and cache section and select clear storage do the same for any app you've been having trouble with now when i tried this process on my pixel 5 i actually didn't need to do anything else the apps in question like google pay and service new south wales they started working again no drums but if you are still running into issues like i did with my pixel 6 then you might actually need to hide the magic app itself to do this open it up and head into the settings menu then select the hide the magic at option and then when i did this process on my pixel six i changed the name here to hashtag one now usually after another reboot things should be working just as expected but funnily enough during the process of filming this video google pay was actually still broken for me following this entire process so to get it to eventually work i found the google play services settings menu and cleared all data from that and once that was complete i opened up google pay registered my card again and finally google pay was up and ready for action and so there you have it a little complicated but not overly so particularly when you consider the benefits and again the fact that i've been able to root my pixel 6 and still use both google pay and the service new south wales application without any issues at all has seriously leveled up my experience of using this phone if you found this video helpful then a sub to the channel would be amazing and if you missed the recent announcement i've just launched my youtube channel membership page which has two different levels both of which give you access to a bunch of extra goodies including monthly promo code giveaways and a members only discord plus a heap of other stuff as well so there's a link in the description to where you can check that out and get involved in that growing community aside from that thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
