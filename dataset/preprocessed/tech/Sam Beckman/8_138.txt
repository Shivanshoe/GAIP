you ever just want one easy and universal method of accessing the google assistant on any device regardless of the launcher that you're using well using tap tap you can just tap the back of your device twice and boom there it is and with that we are back with another episode of the top android apps let's do this true amps is a neat personalization app designed to make the charging up of your phone a visually brilliant experience now it only becomes activated when your phone is charging though you do need to have your phone's display on before you plug it in for it to show up but then you get these really cool animated and oled friendly animations that just look downright slick there's a whole heap of customization available within the app settings as well but a lot of these are only available after you upgrade to the premium version that said the developer of this app has been kind enough to offer me 20 promo codes that i will be releasing over on my instagram page in the next week or two so definitely make sure that you're following me over there to have a chance at claiming one of those codes speaking of instagram while you're over there take a look at my highlights i recently cleaned these up and reorganized them but those fancy highlight icons were made using the foco design app and so i thought i'd showcase it in today's video as well now there are seriously so many icon themes available to choose from within this app in fact over 3 000 according to the play store description but not only that there are also heaps and heaps of photo and video templates that you can also use to help make your posts and stories unique themselves it's a really valuable tool if you're a heavy instagram user and you're looking to make your profile stand out darker sky is an app made in response to the recent shutdown of the dark sky application so if you're not aware dark sky is a super popular weather application that worked on both android and ios but its recent acquisition by apple resulted in its complete shutdown on android a couple of months ago so that's where darker sky comes in it is essentially the exact same app as the original though with none of the paid features available the only catch is that you do need to sideload it via the telegram group which i will leave linked down below but if you're someone who misses that simple and elegant design of the old dark sky weather app and you want it back on your favorite android phone then this is a fantastic solution glenn is a really well designed application designed to help boost your productivity this app is based on the tomato timer technique that allows you to break down your work into intervals separated by breaks so you can set up to 10 tasks to be completed for the day ahead hit the timer to focus yourself and get working and then you can work hard for that allotted amount of time knowing you've got breaks scheduled ahead that will help to break up your workload there are a bunch of other hidden features as well but the fantastic design is what makes this one a winner in my books real quick before we continue i want to thank this video's sponsor skillshare so skillshare is an incredible online community that has tens of thousands of classes across a wide range of categories including graphic design video editing and cinematography just to name a few and what's awesome is that you just pay a monthly price and that gives you access to any class that you like it's kind of like netflix but for learning now over the next few months my family and i are going to be moving and i'm actually going to be renovating and setting up a brand new youtube studio stand by for some videos on that but i've been watching a class by emily henderson that covers a whole range of interior design tips and techniques so that i can set up my space as best as possible now i'm still watching the course but it is really well made and super practical and i can't wait to apply the techniques learned in my own space in a couple of months skillshare premium starts at less than 10 a month but because they're sponsoring today's video they're actually offering the first 1 000 people who use my link down in the description two months of skillshare for free so make sure that you check it out and get learning [Music] a lot of us have no doubt already seen some of the really exciting changes coming with the ios 14 update but one really subtle change that i dig are the indicator lights that light up any time a third-party app is accessing your phone's microphone or camera well access dots is an app that brings that exact feature across to android devices it's real simple but anytime a third-party app accesses your phone's camera or microphone these little green and orange dots will appear right at the top of the display next to your selfie camera you can customize the color of the dots as well as the position and size but it's a really handy app that will help you to stay on top of which apps are accessing these functions without your knowledge lifelapse is a super cool app that makes creating short time-lapse or stop-motion videos an absolute breeze now normally this can be a really long and arduous process and you've got to get specific software and a big whole camera set up but this app has it all built in one and whilst i probably wouldn't be attempting to create feature films using this app for short little animations posted to your socials it's awesome the standout feature is the ghosted image and opacity slider and using this displays a slightly transparent overlay of each previous image that you take which makes it easy to determine what needs to happen for the next frame it took me about three minutes to create this little animated clip that you're watching right now and whilst the exported clips do have a watermark visible when using the free version it's still a heck of a lot of fun and definitely worth giving a try now prism is a new wallpaper application that kind of steers away from the whole unsplash client mentality and instead focuses itself on providing more abstract based wallpapers sourced from wallhaven and pixels the design of the app is really well implemented and makes browsing through the unlimited amount of wallpapers a pretty enjoyable experience and there are all these really easily identifiable categories that make honing your search and finding that exact style of wallpaper that you're after a much more seamless process there are some bugs here and there but keep in mind that the app is pretty early in its development cycle but what's great is that right now every feature is free and unlimited pretty neat no t easy is another one of those notification history applications but the clean design and extra bits of functionality hidden throughout is what got it featured in today's episode so once you've installed the app and enabled some permissions the app will start collecting your notifications locally on your device of course from there anytime you accidentally swipe away a notification or even if you want to go back and check any old notifications you can simply do so by opening the app you can also use the app to blacklist notifications from being displayed on your notification bar you can also auto save or auto delete certain notifications altogether plus there's a bunch of other features available as well now every single feature within the app is available for free which is great but if you want to remove the ads then you do need to upgrade and the developer of this app has also been kind enough to offer me 20 free promo codes that i will be releasing over on instagram again these ones do need to be redeemed in the app itself so keep that in mind but again make sure that you follow me over on instagram to have a chance at claiming one of those codes and finally for today housebook is a really handy application that makes keeping a track of any inventory in a house or business environment a really straightforward process you start by adding in a room name you take an image and from there you start setting up your different containers or locations so this might be a set of drawers or a number of different shelves whatever else it might be but then in each you can start adding in your items you take images as you go put in prices if you want and there are also a range of other descriptive elements that you can enter in as well and that might take some time when you first initiate this process the benefits of doing this for your business or home can be monumental but that is it if you like the video and you enjoy this style of content then a sub would be super appreciated and don't forget to hit that little notification bell and switch the settings to all which is literally the only way that you're guaranteed to be notified whenever i release a new video aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching thank you skillshare for the support and i will catch you later [Music] so you
