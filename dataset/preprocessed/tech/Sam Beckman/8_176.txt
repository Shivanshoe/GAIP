so I'm all about a minimal desk setup I don't like a lot of clutter on my desk I want lots of room to stretch out my creativity both figuratively and literally and so ever since my first proper desk set up back in 2016 I've been on a journey towards achieving the perfect minimalist desk setup that suits my needs as a content creator that two years ago uploaded my second desk setup video which has remained pretty much unchanged to this day save for a few peripherals here and there that said I've moved twice since then I've switched over using PC full-time and just recently MSI offered to send me their prestige desktop and monitor combination to test out and so now my desk looks like this now with the white MSI PC and monitor they tie in perfectly with the rest of the setup we've ended up with this white and wood color combo which looks super clean in my opinion and if you're looking to upgrade either your monitor or your PC then you'll definitely want to stick around to find out more about both so in this video we're gonna be taking a look at the small tweaks that I've made to my desk set up over the past few years and I'm also going to be sharing with you my experience of using both the PC and the monitor that was sent to me by a my site and full disclosure even though they sent me both the PC and the monitor MSI haven't paid me a cent to say anything in particular and in fact I don't even get to keep either the PC or the monitor but I have had both of them in-house for the past few months I feel like I definitely have a good understanding of the pros and cons of both so with that said let's get straight in now I'm not gonna go through each and every item seen on this desk set up in detail as my previous desk set up video unpacks all of that so I'll definitely leave a link to it below but as a really quick summary I've got the egg back in worktop in dark oak from Ikea which is sitting atop to a Dill's legs on one side and an Alex trawl unit on the other both of which are also from Ikea now in my last desk setup video a lot of people commented wondering whether or not I'd experienced any sagging in the middle given that the worktop is so long and to be honest because of the placement of both the legs and the drawers being slightly in from either side I've not experienced any sagging whatsoever and that's after two years of using this same work top but movie we take a look at what's on top of the desk we've still got that trusty Epson XP 610 printed there which is well and truly outdated I could definitely do with the new printer there for sure but then moving in a little bit from that I'm still using a pair of audio engine a2 plus speakers which have been workhorses and mainstays on my desk for the past four years I also got my pixel stand sitting neatly in between the left speaker and the monitor which is really convenient for charging my smart phone wirelessly throughout the day and then aside from some fake foliage sitting on either side of my desk setup we're left with just the PC and the monitor from MSI so let's hop over to the desk and chat about my experience in using both of them okay using both the monitor and the PC as my daily drivers for the past few months starting with the monitor it's full name is the msi prestige ps3 41 w/u which is an absolute mouthful to say but it's a 34 inch 5k 21 by 9 ultrawide monitor that's bigger strength lies in its design aside from being an ultra wide monitor which will make just about any desk setup look pretty damn sexy it's got these really thin bezels all the way around which just adds to the immersive experience of using this display it's also a flat panel which I tend to prefer over the flashy hour yet slightly less practical curved displays that we've seen so many of in recent years there's also that even though we've rarely see the backs of our monitors the back of this press to each monitor is really really pretty it's got this sleek white and gold theme design as well as this neat cable management cover to keep things fairly tidy the monitor also swivels from side to side it tilts back and forth and even lifts up and down making it really versatile depending on your desktop or workflow so one tiny complaint I have about the design of this monitor is that because of this shaft design at the back it actually makes hiding cables which have to come in from either side a really difficult task the back is also made out of plastic which gives a little bit of a cheap feeling but aside from that I'm a big fan of the way that this monitor looks now MSI claims that this monitor has unmatched colour reproduction thanks to its nano IPS screen technology and what I will say is from an on the perspective at least as far as I can tell this monitor has performed very well in terms of its color reproduction I use it all the time to edit my videos and photos and I'd really really like this monitor I love the widescreen panel and the design fits my desk amazingly and so I can see it being a great fit for just about any desk setup so then we have the PC this is the EMA side prestige p100 and again just like the monitor a lot of the appeal that comes with using this PC is the design now I'm not normally one to showcase a PC on top of the desk setup normally like to hide it underneath and off to the side somewhere but this one is really compact and just downright good-looking in my opinion it's got that same of white and gold color palette that we saw on the back of the monitor and it's also got this really nice RGB accent light that gives off an elegant glow when the PC is powered on as well as that the i/o and this thing is pretty stacked we've got heaps of options on the back here plus a range on the side as well which makes integrating it into just about any desk setup really seamless and easy now a PC is obviously far from being just about the designer and in reality that holds a little sway over whether or not I choose to buy it and so what's really impressive about this PC is how it performs inside you get the GeForce r-tx 20 80 TI graphics card the Intel Core I 9 processor 64 gigabytes of ddr4 memory and let's just say this thing can hold its own against some of the best it has handled every project that I've thrown at it over the past few months like an absolute champ and this is why I've been able to use it and test it for so long because I haven't felt the need to rush back to the PC that I actually own that being said the big downside of this PC is the fan noise I'm guessing that it's because of the compact form factor which means maybe it gets hotter than the average PC and that in turn means the fans have to work extra hard to keep the temperature down but whatever the reason this thing can get loud now it's definitely not a deal-breaker whatsoever but if you like me and you shoot content in the same space as your desk setup or as your PC then you'll most likely just want to switch it off whenever you shoot your content otherwise those fans might get too loud and ruin your audio but aside from that I honestly really like this PC just like the monitor this fit into my workflow seamlessly and I'll be sad to see it's sleek and elegant design leave the studio if you want to find out more about the PC or the monitor then you can do so by clicking on the first link down in the description below now before we wrap up this video I also want to make mention of my cable management which is something that I always labor over each and every time that I move and set up my desk and it basically comes down to using these runway tracks to guide all of the necessary cables along the underside of my desk that then runs down the back of the Alex draw unit next to which I place all of the leftover cables and a power strip with in one of these cable management boxes from Ikea this is so far the best method that I've come across for getting the cleanest cable management possible but it does also make adding removing cables somewhat tricky so keep that in mind if you're someone who's constantly swapping in or out various cables and peripherals and this method might not work for you I also still run a USB extension cable from the back of my PC to an SD card reader which is then mounted to the underside of my desk and this makes loading files from my SD cards really really convenient but lastly the chair that I use is still this really affordably gray fabric chair that I picked up from it Kmart it's comfortable it does the job and I honestly have no real complaints about it and that's it for this current desk setup I've got links down below to everything that I talked about throughout the video and as I mentioned earlier I do also have links below to my two previous desk setup videos as well aside from that that's it hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and I will catch you later [Music]
