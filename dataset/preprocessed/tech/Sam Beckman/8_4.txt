[Music] this is the poco x4 pro 5g from xiaomi and at around 250 us dollars this phone is one of the cheapest phones i've ever reviewed on the chat and yet if you take one look at the specs of this thing you'd be forgiven for thinking that it costs at least double that figure perhaps even more but specs are one thing real world use is another so after using this phone for the past couple of weeks i thought i'd provide some insight as to whether this phone is worth picking up let's dive in now in terms of the unboxing experience unlike most top end phones on the market right now you get pretty much everything you'd want in the box with the poco x4 pro you get all your paperwork a really nice clear tpu case which is fantastic there's obviously the phone itself which we'll come back to in a moment but then underneath this next layer we get a 67 watt wall plug for super fast charging and then a usbc cable to go with and then of course there's the phone itself [Music] now starting with the design of this phone and i've got to say for 250 bucks you're getting a lot of bang for your buck we've got a glass back with this cool shimmery look to it super minimal bezels on the front of the phone and yes there is a chin but it's pretty small as well and then we have this micro hole punch at the top of the display for the selfie camera oh and the phone comes pre-applied with a screen protector which is fantastic aside from that whilst the frame of this phone is plastic because it's got a matte finish and because it's flat i actually think it makes the phone really comfortable to hold in terms of the fingerprint sensor it's actually embedded within the power button which is pretty cool and it has been quite quick and reliable throughout my time using this phone the only slight disappointment in terms of build quality are the haptics they're actually not awful haptics and i haven't had to disable them which i often do on phones with really bad haptics so that speaks to the fact that they are actually okay and given the price i'm not that surprised that they're slightly under part either but for those who love super premium tight and clicky haptics just know that this phone doesn't have them now just before we chat about the rest of this phone i do want to take a quick moment to thank the sponsor of this video hecker.com heka.com is a fantastic platform that features a huge range of affordable and well-made gadgets including smartphones laptops and a stack of other electronic based products in fact they were actually kind enough to not only sponsor this video but also provide me with the poco x4 pro so that i could review it here on the channel now as well as xiaomi they also work with a heap of other top brands like oneplus lenovo realme and a bunch more and because they're sponsoring this video they've agreed to give anyone who uses the code sam beckman at checkout a handy ten dollars off any purchase made on their website so again thanks to heka.com for sponsoring this video and for providing me with the poco x4 pro to review okay so then we come to one of the absolute highlights of this phone the display now first things first the display is amoled and it actually gets really bright making it great for outdoor use but those two really impressive points aside the real talking point with this display is that it has an incredible 120hz refresh rate and for a phone of this price to have a 120 hertz amoled panel that gets this bright is seriously amazing it just makes navigating around the os a true joy and it really does allow all of those miui animations to shine and speaking to me why let's quickly chat about the software on this phone now despite the fact that it runs miui 13 which is the latest version of me ui it's actually based on android 11 and not android 12. and whilst most people would hardly notice the difference between the two i have missed some of those super sleek os animations that i've become accustomed to after using so many phones running android 12 this year but one advantage of this version of me ui is that the stock launcher is actually the poco launcher and if you're a fan of customization like i am then this launcher actually lets you apply third-party icon packs and hide apps from the app drawer both of which are features that i think are super underrated now the software does come with a lot of bloatware by default and this annoying full screen app scanning interface that shows ads whenever you install an app from the play store which definitely isn't ideal but you can uninstall the bloatware and disable the app scanning interface so i highly recommend doing that if you're planning on picking one up but aside from that i've largely enjoyed the software experience itself on this phone i'm just hoping we see an update to android 12 soon though all right in terms of performance this is probably the first big area that will remind you that this is a budget phone because although i haven't experienced any glaring bugs or issues in terms of performance the phone just doesn't feel quite as silky smooth as phones that come with a more premium price tag now this isn't all that surprising when you see that the phone is powered by a snapdragon 695 chipset which is one of qualcomm's lower end chips but given that the previous version of this phone the x3 pro had a snapdragon 860 chipset it is a little disappointing it's pretty clear that xiaomi opted to prioritize giving this phone 5g which the snapdragon 860 chipset doesn't support and i kind of get it a lot of people assume they need 5g in their phone these days but the 5g capabilities of the 695 chip are not the same as those of a flagship phone it is enough to allow xiaomi to plaster 5g all over the marketing materials of this phone but not enough to make it something people are really going to be able to utilize in real world use and so whilst i get it i obviously would have loved it had xiaomi prioritized a faster chipset rather than a slower 5g enabled one but where the phone may lack in performance it certainly makes up for in terms of battery life the phone houses a 5 000 milliamp hour cell and because of that underpowered chip it actually results in pretty phenomenal battery life for example most days i'm finishing with between 40 to 50 battery left and that's after a day of medium use with the panel set to 120 hertz and as far as i'm concerned that's pretty great going so if battery life is something that you prioritize then this phone ticks that box in spades all right lastly we have the cameras and for the price they're not bad but they're also definitely nothing to write home about in the absolute best of conditions the main lens can produce fairly pleasing results however as with most budget smartphones as soon as the light drops a bit or you go indoors that's when it can become quite a bit trickier to take a solid shot the phone also has an ultra wide lens and a macro lens however as expected the results from both are even less reliable than that of the main lens one other thing to note is that when capturing videos the video caps out at a max resolution of 1080p which in 2022 seems like a pretty sizable limitation of the hardware whether this is because of the chipset or something else i'm not too sure but suffice it to say you ain't buying this phone if you're looking for a top shelf camera experience and so with all that being said at 250 even with the drawbacks of this phone i'm still really comfortable recommending it to anyone looking for an affordable phone in many ways it actually reminds me a lot of the galaxy a52 5g which is a phone i reviewed last year on the channel with a 120hz display but that phone is quite a bit more expensive than this one and it still suffers from performance issues like the poco x4 pro admittedly that phone has a much more promising software support guarantee from samsung whereas who knows how many software updates this phone is gonna get over the next couple of years but again at 250 bucks part of me is like does it even really matter look at the end of the day this phone is so affordable that it feels petty to complain about really anything given all that it does offer now is it a flagship killer no not at all but is it the new budget king well it is certainly a top contender [Music] me [Music] you
