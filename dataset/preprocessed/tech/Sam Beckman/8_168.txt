I'll set the sin you get home from work you go get out of the car and you drop your keys under your seat it's dark you can't see where they've gone now normally you would turn on your phone's display swipe down and then activate your flashlight unacceptable but slightly inconvenient workflow well using shake light to simple shakes and your flashlight turns on even if your phone's displays off so with that whilst we're all staying inside welcome to my top 10 Android apps for April 2020 let's go almighty volume Keys is an app that lets you remap a huge range of shortcuts to pretty much any action using your volume keys so for example you can set a single tap up or down to activate your Bluetooth or an up then down tap to trigger a sound recording to start and you can even use the commands to launch a Tasker action which means the possibilities for shortcuts are pretty much endless X icon changer is for those who want the ability to customize their home screen icons even when the launcher doesn't support it you simply long press your home screen to add a widget swipe to find the X icon changer option then select the app that you want to customize from there select an icon from a range of provided icons or from an image taken from your camera or even from a third-party icon pack and there you have it they are your default uncustomary home screen launcher looks a little more youth one shade is an app that emulates the look and feel of the notification panel found on Samsung Galaxy devices it's highly customizable with options to change the icon shapes the clock positioning the colors utilized throughout plus I hate more and it's somewhat baffling how well it works once you've enabled a few permissions it just takes over and does its thing hardly any hiccups whatsoever USB locket is an app that can protect just about any drive you plug into your phone for enhanced security once you've plugged your device in the app will automatically launch asking if you want to lock it by entering a pin once you do any files stored on that drive will genuinely be hidden unless you unlock it again using the pin that you previously entered you can't even access the files on another device or PC because of the way that the encryption has been executed now if you're a fan of Google's live City wallpapers but find the amount to choose from somewhat limiting the metropolis is an application that takes this exact concept but it expands upon it tenfold the app lets you choose from 60 built-in locations but then you can also upgrade to the pro version which not only removes any ads but it also lets you search for custom locations within North America what set the wallpapers interact with your swipes and unlocks and it makes for an impressively immersive experience now the developer of this application has been kind enough to give me 20 free promo codes for the pro version of this app which I will be releasing over on my Twitter account in the coming weeks so make sure to go and follow me over there if you want to have a chance at climbing one of those codes just keep in mind that it is a fairly intensive application so expect a slight hit to battery life and performance colors is for those who enjoy a much simpler wallpaper option but with some added functionality this app simply places a block of color onto your background but what makes in an app worth getting is the fact that you can double tap anywhere on the wallpaper to trigger a change in color which makes for changing up the look of your homescreen super quick and convenient energy ring is an app that lets you use your phone's whole punch if it has one to showcase your phone's battery life now it's designed primarily with Samsung's recent s20 lineup in minds but the developer also has a range of other apps the previous Samsung flagships are valuable and you can even use the app to emulate a hole punch on a phone that doesn't have one there are a bunch of customization options to choose from and there's even a neat animation for when your phone is charging background eraser doesn't need a whole lot of explaining this is a photo editing application that's main objective is to give you the tools you need to remove the backgrounds of your images you've got three main modes to choose from auto magic and manual and what's it can be a little bit finicky depending on the photo if you take your time with it then the end result can be impressive now type wise keyboard is an app that aims to transform and modernize the typing experience it does this by introducing a range of intuitive typing gestures you can swipe up to capitalize a letter swipe left to delete or right to restore plus a heat more and on top of that the keys are 70% bigger than the average keyboard making it much harder to make an error as you type keep in mind there is a pretty serious learning curve to mastering the art of typing on this keyboard but if you're willing to give it a red-hot go then I can truly say this revolutionising the way that we type if you enjoyed the video then a sub would be amazing and if you're looking to watch more app content particularly as we all do our best to try and stay inside during this time then I'll link to a playlist as a card up above and also down in the description below aside from that hopefully you enjoy the video thank you all very much for watching and I will catch you later [Music] you [Music]
