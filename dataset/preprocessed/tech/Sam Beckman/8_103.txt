okay okay recently in the mail i received this mystery box now i knew that i was going to be receiving some sort of a box but i had absolutely no clue what was inside so it was sent to me by a company here in australia called gadget club and full disclosure they did reach out and asked if i'd be interested in partnering up and unboxing one of their subscription boxes on my channel and i really like this concept as a whole so i agree but because this video is sponsored i will be doing a giveaway which i'll give more details about at the back end of the video now for context gadget club is a subscription box service i'm sure you've all heard of similar ideas in the past even perhaps other tech related ones as well but the idea is that when you sign up to their subscription service you will receive one mystery tech item each month for every month that you've signed up for more often than not the products that you receive are actually better value than what you'd have to pay if you were just buying them outright but what makes gadget club unique is that the product you get each month is something innovative and fairly new to the market now i've been told that the product i am unboxing today is one of the selected items that will be sent to subscribers in the coming months so with that said let's unbox it so here is the gadget club box in all of its glory we've got the logo nicely printed on top and in fact kind of reminds me of the avengers style logo as i shift it in the lot but we're not here to admire the box so let's get it open out of the box comes something of decent size i still can't see what it is because it's inside this outer layer but it has the brand name to jezo printed on the top to chaiso to gizo not sure if i'm saying that correctly i've never heard of that brand before though so i'm very interested to see what's inside and when we open it up we have what is a very unique looking bag of some sort it's got a really nice sort of hard shell feeling to it and quite a distinct geometric design which i kind of like now the initial thought is hmm a bag is that tech related but then i quickly noticed a little usba port over on the side here so the gears start ticking away my first guess is that this is a pass-through port for charging a device on the go but let's head back to the studio and look at the bag in even more detail okay so after spending a little bit more time with this bag by tejaso i'm going to say for its compact form factor this is a pretty impressive little bag it's one of those sling backpacks and it has a clip on the front for easy dismount but then taking a look inside and you can see that yes as i thought there is indeed a usb a cable built in so essentially you provide your own portable battery bank plug that into the usb cord hide it away in the bag and then you grab your usb charging cable plug that into the port on the side then into your device and there is your charging on the go there's also four separate compartments inside the bag including one that can be zipped up for extra protection and i did a little bit of research on this bag and saw that on the amazon au side it costs just a little more than 60 dollars which is actually more than what you'd pay even for a one-off subscription box from gadget club so i'd say this is a really nice get for this month's box now as i said because this video is sponsored by gadget club we are doing a giveaway and the giveaway is three free months to the gadget club subscription service which is pretty dang cool if you ask me and all you need to do to enter is comment down below the most unique piece of tech that you've ever used and you will go into the running to be the lucky person who wins unfortunately the giveaway is only open to australian residents as gadget club is currently only operating within the australian borders but if you like free stuff and you do not live in australia then feel free to head over to my twitter and instagram pages as i give away heaps and heaps of promo codes to paid apps every single month aside from that that's it a big big thank you to gadget club for partnering up and supporting the channel hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
