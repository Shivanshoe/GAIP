[Music] so this is the samsung galaxy s20 fe and we're gonna keep this video relatively short because there's really only just a few things that you need to know about this phone let's start with the good so firstly the design is actually pretty solid it is a matte plastic back so take that for what it is but we've got fairly minimal bezels all the way around the front of the phone and we've got that center hole punch which is actually the smallest so far on any samsung device now for some reason though samsung felt the need to place this little chrome metallic ring around the hole punch so even though yes it's smaller it actually stands out more compared to most other phones with a hole punch now the cameras are also pretty decent kind of what we've come to expect from a mid to high range samsung device images have that usual amount of samsung punch to them and you can get pretty decent results in most lighting scenarios and the fact that we have three lenses on the back to choose from well it makes for a versatile and fun shooting experience i think it captures some really nice videos as well okay so to test the video quality we're gonna do so whilst i thank today's video sponsor skillshare okay so for those who've been living under a rock and haven't heard of skillshare yet well it is an amazing online learning community that has tens of thousands of classes across a wide range of categories including graphic design video editing and cinematography just to name a few and what's awesome is that you just pay one monthly price and that gives you access to any class that you like now i haven't actually announced this online yet but i have just moved into a brand new studio space and in fact some of my recent videos have actually been made within this space but it's very much so a work in progress and there are so many things that i need to do to start filling up this space to really make it my own so a lot of this i've actually just started watching a class on skillshare called interior design interior decorate like a boss it goes into lots of detail regarding how to design a space really well and it kind of just makes me really excited to get cracking with the layout and design of my studio space okay so skillshare premium starts at less than ten dollars a month but because they're sponsoring today's video they are offering a free trial to the first 1000 people who sign up using my link down in the description below so definitely make sure that you check it out and get learning [Music] okay so let's see what else well battery life is pretty solid the display is nice and sharp and gets pretty decently bright for outdoor use the speakers are actually really decent and we even have wireless charging and ip68 water and dust resistance rating and we have 5g onboard thanks to the snapdragon 865 processor so on paper at least for 699 us dollars which is right in line with the pixel 5 and the oneplus 8t this phone honestly seems like a no-brainer it cuts no corners right well unfortunately that ain't quite the case and in fact to me it actually seems like they've cut the biggest corner of them all and that is in regards to software optimization and performance honestly it feels as though this is where they've saved the most money because the software on this phone feels very much half baked almost like they didn't put it through enough testing maybe they save money by not having the normal amount of developers really putting the software experience through its paces like they did with their note 20 lineup which was a much more refined software experience for example whilst this phone supposedly has a 120 hertz refresh rate panel for the most part it didn't feel like it animations were pretty stuttery a lot of the time and scrolling on web pages or even just back and forth on my home screen it just didn't have that buttery smooth feeling to it i also noticed a number of lags here and there despite it using pretty much the best chipset that you could get for the majority of 2020. the fingerprint sensor is also pretty woeful even after registering my thumb twice and the haptic motor well it's just downright unpleasant and keep in mind this is not pre-release software this is after a number of software patches normally when the software should feel a little more settled in and so to be perfectly frank unfortunately i just can't really recommend this phone mainly because of everything else that is available at either a similar or even a cheaper price point you've got the oneplus 8t the pixel 5 both of which are phones that i would recommend over the galaxy s20 fe and then even phones like the pixel 4a or the pixel 4 a5g or even the oneplus nord these are phones that i would probably steer people towards instead of the galaxy s20 fe and it disappoints me i was really ready for a somewhat affordable device from samsung that offered a flagship experience but this isn't it to me it seems as though samsung really only reserves astounding performance and software optimization for their top of the line phones and as soon as you step into a slightly lower price point like this phone well things just don't really stack up it was actually the same story with the galaxy a51 which seemed to be a great competitor to the pixel 4a and the oneplus nord but like the galaxy s20 fe both of these phones really only perform best on paper and not in real life so that's it that's where i'm leaving the s20 fe for the moment who knows maybe there'll be even more software patches down the road that will help to improve the situation but for the moment if you're looking for a new phone at about this price range well you're best off looking elsewhere
