a couple of weeks maybe a month ago I uploaded a video covering the process of how to route the oneplus 8 pro then many of you commented on that video saying can you please make a video on how to root X device and the thing is unfortunately they're actually isn't one universal method for rooting every device on the market but that said there is kind of a generic way for most devices and I use the word most pretty lightly here but I thought why not showcase this method in a video as well so that's what we're gonna do today now before we walk through this method another comment I saw a lot of on that 1 plus 8 video was can you show me how to route a phone without a PC and believe me when I say routing a phone without a PC is one of two things it's either really hard and not worth the effort or it's a lie there are these apps that claim that they can route your phone without a PC but put simply they don't work so here's what I'll say if you don't have a PC then it's probably not worth going through the process of routing your phone particularly if something goes wrong then you won't be able to restore your phone back to normal and you'll be left with a glorified paperweight so that said let's talk about how to route most phones okay first things first make sure that you completely backup your phone before going through with this process and I always recommend double-checking the various methods of rooting your device of choice over on XDA or something similar this next step is going to sound very familiar if you've already watched my 1+8 pro routing guide video and that's because it is pretty much exactly the same so we need to download some files that are going to enable our device to interact with our computer and I've left a link down below to where you can download these files as I mentioned in the previous video there are specific files for Mac and PC and so forth so make sure you grab the ones that are suited to your computer of choice but once you've downloaded them you'll get a zip file so we're gonna open that downloaded zip file and extract it and within that we should see a folder called platform tools now I'm gonna drag and drop this over to my desktop and I suggest that you do the same so that following this tutorial doesn't become a complete mess now if you haven't already this next step is going to cover unlocking the bootloader of our phones which we need to do in order to actually root our phones this can be a slightly different process on every single device really does one method work on every single phone so what I recommend doing is googling something like how to unlock the insert devices bootloader that will no doubt be several articles or forum posts covering how to do this for your device and keep in mind your phone will be completely wiped at this point in time but for the most part the method will look something like the following you'll need to first enable developer options on your phone and doing this is actually pretty universal across all phones so to do this we need to open our phone's settings navigate down to the about phone menu and then tap where it says build number seven times until your passcode shows up once you've inputted your passcode then we need to head back into the main settings menu and then come into the system page that this menu might be labeled differently depending on the phone that you're using but then we need to navigate to a new section that should now show up called developer options within this page we need to find a setting called OAM unlocking and make sure it is switched to on then we'll come down to the debugging section and enable USB debugging now we need to plug a device into our computer and you'll probably get an authorization pop-up that asks to allow USB debugging which you want to allow okay now back to our computers and we want to launch into our command prompt application so this is the terminal on a Mac or the command prompt on a Windows Device but once we've opened the application we then want to type the following CD space desktop and then enter and then CD platform - tools and then enter and this will direct our terminal to that platform tools folder that we moved to our desktop earlier from there type in dot slash adb space devices on a Mac or you can just type in adb devices if you're on a Windows Device and then hit enter and you should see a random number here that indicates that your device is correctly set up or it could also show as blank if you haven't yet enabled USB debugging or you haven't authorized it on your phone yet or it could be the e cable isn't properly plugged in or it's a faulty cable so check all of those things if this number doesn't show up for you but once this number shows up and we verified that our device is plugged in we're now going to type in dot slash ADB or just a to B again if you're on a Windows machine then space then reboot space bootloader and then hit enter to launch our phone in fastboot mode then we need to type in a command that will actually unlock the bootloader of our phone and this is going to be relative to the device that you're using so for example on a pixel for device we type in fastboot flashing unlock or on a oneplus device we type in fastboot OEM unlock so again just verify the correct command for your device by doing a quick google search anyway once you enter this command you should see a confirmation message on your device and you can then use the volume keys to select the unlock the bootloader option then hit the power key to confirm but your bootloader will then unlock and then you can reboot your phone and it's at this point that your phone will be completely wiped and restored to its factory state except for the fact that the bootloader is now unlocked ok so you can now take the time to re set up your phone because your phone won't be wiped again from this point forward but whilst you're doing so make sure you head back into the settings menu and re-enable the developer options and USB debugging as well because those settings will have been reset in the wiping process but whilst your phone is being restored we can now head back to our pcs to locate the factory image file for our device of choice and this is probably one of the main reasons why rooting a Google pixel device is so easy because Google uploads these files themselves on their own website every single time an update is released so you find this file whether it be directly from the manufacturer or from a friendly user over on the XDA forums or perhaps from a website such as need rom-com but once you've found it download it and this will be a pretty large file but once it's downloaded we then need to unzip it now within that unzipped folder you should see a bunch of files and we're looking for another zip file here if the pixel for you can see it's called image - coral - blah blah blah zip so we're gonna unzip that and then in this folder you'll see some more files but the one we're looking for is called boot.img so we want to take this boot image file and transfer it over to our device of choice I'm just going to place it in the Downloads folder using Android file transfer now that we've done that we want to head back to our phones and download and install the magic manager application which of course I'll leave a link to below then launch the app and you should see a button here that says install we're going to tap on that then tap install again to select and patch a file option from here we want to find that boot image file we just transferred to the downloads folder and select it magic manager will then patch that boot image file and store it into the Downloads folder on your phone as well so then we want to jump back to our computers and locate that file so if you're on a Mac you do it via the Android file transfer application or you can just use the File Explorer on a Windows Device but you're gonna find that file it's going to be called magic underscore patched IMG we're gonna drag and drop that file from our phone to the platform tools folder on our desktop okay nearly there so with a device still plugged in we want to jump back to our command prompt application and launch our phone back into fastboot mode by typing dot slash adb on a Mac or just ADB if you're on a Windows Device then space and reboot space bootloader then hit enter once your phone is back into fastboot mode we can then type in the following fastboot space flash space boot space and then magic underscore patched dot IMG or instead of typing out magic underscore patched you can also just drag and drop the image file directly from your platform tools folder but once you fully typed that command you can then hit enter the image file will then be patched over and once it's done you can then reboot your phone and your phone will now be rooted double check that all is well in the magic manager application you should have all greens now indicating that root has been installed and that is it now depending on the device you own you may be able to still install OTA updates directly on your phone whilst maintaining root without having to use a PC thanks to the magic manager application I'll leave an article down below that explains how to do this but even though my pixel four should technically be able to do this I think I've only ever had it work like twice every other time I've had to manually flash the OTA update and then repeat the aforementioned patch to boot image method to re-enable root access and even though it might seem fairly arduous to have to do this every month to be honest you get pretty quick at it and the only thing that really takes time is downloading the factory image files themselves if you're not sure what to do with your newly rooted device from here I've made a video that walks through ten root only features that is probably a pretty good place to start I'll leave a link up here and down there but aside from that if you found this video helpful then a subscribe would be amazing but that's it thank you all very much for watching and I will catch you later [Music] you all
