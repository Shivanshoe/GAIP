so in my recent unboxing and first impressions video on the oneplus 8 Pro I spoke at length about how similar it seems compared to Samsung's newest s20 lineup and I think one of the areas where this is best reflected is the camera setup the camera is on the oneplus 8 Pro have seen a fairly significant upgrade this year and in a lot of reviews they've been compared quite favorably to the cameras on the s20 lineup of phones and a lot of reviewers have mentioned that the image processing has resulted in images and videos that feel quite similar to the images and videos taken on the s20 lineup well it's one thing to say they look similar but it's another altogether to actually put these cameras up against each other and directly compare them side-by-side and so that's exactly what we're gonna do so let's hop over to the computer and put these cameras head-to-head okay so here we go I've spent a good portion of today taking lots of side by side photos and videos with both the galaxy s 20 plus and the oneplus 8 Pro and one thing I wanted to clear up straight out of the gate is that I've switched off any sort of scene optimizer or Beauty modes on both of these phones as that was something that a lot of you mentioned in my recent camera comparison video can often have a negative impact on image quality so those sorts of features have been switched off on both phones and also both phones have been updated to their latest software patches available now if you've seen any of my other camera comparison videos then you'll know that I love to start these comparisons off by comparing portrait photos of a person and this is particularly interesting in today's video because I feel as though this is one of the weakest areas of both of these phones so let's take a look so the first thing that you'll probably notice E is that the image taken with the portrait mode on the oneplus 8 Pro is a little bit more cropped in compared to what we have with the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus my personal preference is for these images to crop in a little bit because that resembles portrait photos that we take with real DSLR and mirrorless cameras so I prefer that look it's not for everyone but then in terms of edge detection you'll notice that both phones are doing a pretty decent job both of these phones do tend to have quite a harsh fall off into the background areas of the image the sub it really does pop it's not supernatural looking I will say though in this scenario the galaxy s 20 plus has slightly missed the edge when it comes to just above my right ear you can see something funny is happening there whereas it's pretty much a flawless cutout when we're looking at the image taken on the 1 plus 8 prop now because the image is slightly cropped in on the 1 plus 8 Pro we can't really use these images to compare dynamic range but if I'm comparing the colors and the overall processing of both of these portrait photos my personal favorite is the image taken on the 1 + 8 program so here's another set of portrait photos and you can see for this scenario both phones have struggled with edge detection on the top of my head there in particular it is less obvious with the image taken on the 1 + 8 Pro and slightly smaller in terms of how big that error is but that said in terms of color and dynamic range both phones have done a pretty decent job although I will say that the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro is slightly punchy are compared to the one taken on the galaxy s 20 plus now normally I do prefer that punchy look similar to what we see out of the images taken on the pixel for lineup but that's it I think in this scenario the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus has an overall cleaner look to it despite that slight error in the edge detection being a little bit worse on the galaxy s 20 plus but I think for this particular example my personal preference is the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus okay moving on to a range of images taken in varying daylight conditions and if we take a look at this first side-by-side comparison you probably recognize this from my recent camera comparison video and you can see that both phones are doing a very similar job those darker areas of the image in the foreground so the fence there and the trees on the left and the right they both look pretty similar with both of these images there is a slight difference in the way that each smartphone has handled the processing or the colors of the building in the background there in the middle of the image it's a bit lighter on the s20 + or is a little bit punchier on the 1 + mate Pro and hopefully despite YouTube's compression you can tell that the sky on the galaxy s 20 + is more blown out compared to what we can see with the sky on the 1 + 8 Pro so even though the colors are fairly similar across both photos that are slightly punchier on the 1+8 pros image and also the darker areas in the image taken on the oneplus 8 pro are a lot sharper and cleaner compared to the slightly noisy and soft dark areas of the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus so even though from a distance both of these images look very similar on my pixel peeping and taking a look at each different area of these images my favorite is hands down to one taken on the oneplus 8 pro so then if we zoom out and go to the wide-angle lenses on both of these phones you can see it's a pretty similar story slightly brighter on the galaxy s 20 plus but no detail at all in that sky whereas on the oneplus 8 Pro it's not quite as bright but we're still seeing a little bit of detail in the clouds just above the building there you can see that slight blue tint which is the clouds coming through whereas on the galaxy s 20 plusses image it's just complete white aside from that pretty similar processing for both images similar to what we saw out of the main sensors on these phones the image is slightly wider on the galaxy s 20 plus so that's something to keep in mind but again just comparing these images side-by-side I do prefer the overall look and quality of the image taken on the wide-angle lens on the oneplus 8 Pro and then if we punch into the telephoto lenses on both of these phones you can see that the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro is more saturated compared to the one taken on the galaxy s 20 plus the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus is still suffering from some of that purple fringing that we saw in the last camera comparison and you'll notice that particularly around the little details of the leaves and twigs on the right side of the image both phones are doing very well with dynamic range here again slightly more saturated with the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro which I don't like as much I think I prefer the overall color of the one taken on the galaxy s 20 plus but it's that fringing that we can see on the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus that I really don't like so compared to the 1 + 8 Pro it's not quite as good in my opinion switching to another daylight scenario and again just another reminder that the scene optimizer setting was switched off on both of these phones and you can see that the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro is a little bit more contrast II compared to the one taken on the galaxy s 20 plus both do have very similar image processing and this is a really good example of that the colors the sharpness is pretty much the same between both phones here I will say that the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro is a little more contrasting compared to the one taken on the galaxy s 20 plus that is really evident in the darker areas of that tree in the middle there you can see on the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro we're losing a lot of detail in the darker areas of that tree trunk in the middle there whereas on the galaxy s 20 plus we can see pretty much the entire tree trunk all the way from the top down to the bottom that's it if you look at the clouds in the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus they are slightly more blown and up compared to the clouds on the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro so it looks like that's a little bit of a trade-off there but I think the overall look of the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus is my personal preference in this particular example there's a little bit more punch and vibrancy to the leaves that you can pick up on there and again I prefer seeing a little more detail in those darker areas of my images similar story when we switch over to the wide-angle lenses on both of these phones a little more contrast II with the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro and less detail in the darker areas of the image there but again more detail in the broader areas of the image I will say the image taken with the wide-angle lens on the oneplus 8 Pro looks a little sharper a little more vibrant a bit more pleasing to the eyes straight out of the gate so that's why it's my favorite out of these two and then again to the telephoto lenses on both of these phones personally I prefer the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro because it doesn't suffer from that fringing issue that we can see again here with the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus but it's a bit of a toss-up in terms of image processing and Colour that both look pretty similar nice and punchy nice and vibrant but again because of that lack of fringing issue with the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro it tends to be my favorite in this side-by-side comparison now here's another daylight side-by-side this is an architecture scenario and both phones are doing a really decent job I'd be happy with either of these images that said I think I prefer the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro because of the way that the colors have been rendered it acts has a pixel look to it with this particular image where it's slightly cooler in its color tone whereas the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus is slightly warmer and also the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro is very sharp and it has that nice punchy look to it which I really like when it comes to architecture photography and it's even harder to pick a winner with the images taken on the wide-angle lenses both are doing a pretty decent job in terms of sharpness and dynamic range although I will say the oneplus 8 Pro has done a better job in terms of retaining the detail in those clouds that you can see at the top there so I think for that reason the winner is the 1+8 pro but again I'd be pretty happy with either of these images now here's another scenario where I think we can see very pixel like processing with the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro lots of good punch and clarity particularly when compared it to the slightly flatter image that we're getting out of the galaxy s 20 plus you could probably take the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus and boost the clarity and sharpness imposed to get it to look a little more similar to the one taken on the oneplus 8 Pro so again not everyone's gonna like that really edited look that we can see with the image taken on the oneplus 8 pro but for mine that's my personal favorite out of this side-by-side comparison again a similar story with the images taken on the wide-angle lenses on both of these phones a little flatter not as punchy with the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus whereas we do have that punch and clarity with the image taken on the wide-angle lens on the oneplus 8 Pro again looking at the side by side of the telephoto lenses here we can still see that fringing with the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus and I do prefer the punch here more crisp looking image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro so in that particular scenario it was a little bit more of a blower where I preferred every single image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro regardless of which lens I was using now here's an ultra close-up photo taken with the main senses on the galaxy s 20 + + 1 + 8 Pro both images look pretty decent but again I prefer that punchy er crisper looking image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro and even though it is a punchy a photo which often tends to result in worse dynamic range you can see that we can still see some of those clouds off in the distance there with the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro compared to the image taken on the galaxy 20-plus where those clouds and that sky is completely blown out so a pretty interesting side-by-side comparison there with the images taken in good bright lighting conditions and again I would say overall my favorite were the images taken on the 1 plus 8 Pro I tended to prefer the image processing slightly more with more clarity more punch compared to the slightly flatter less saturated photos that we saw on the galaxy s 20 plus and the 1 plus 8 Pro handled dynamic range a little bit better than what we saw with the images taken on the galaxy s 20 plus but with that out of the way let's now jump into another really interesting comparison low-light photos you'll hopefully be able to pick up on a recurring pattern here where the images taken on the galaxy s 20 plus they are slightly brighter compared to the ones taken on the 1 plus 8 Pro only a little bit but that said the image is taken on the 1 plus 8 Pro are definitely cleaner now YouTube compression will probably not allow you to see this but the darker areas of the images taken on the galaxy s 20 plus are a lot nausea whereas the darker areas of the images taken on the 1+8 Pro and using its nightscape feature a very very clean and sharp at the same time and so whilst you might look at these photos taken on the phones on those smaller screens and think that the images taken in low-light conditions on the galaxy s 20 plus are better because they're brighter I would say that the image is taken using the 1 plus 8 pros nightscape feature are cleaner and better quality overall there are some photos in low-light conditions where the 1 plus 8 Pro will miss but generally speaking they're very clean and very impressive and even though the photos taken using the galaxy s 20 pluses night mode feature are still very impressive they do suffer from Machinist in the darker areas of the images whereas on the 1 plus 8 Pro they're very clean and very sharp again both phones can take some really impressive images in low light conditions but again the winner here is the 1 plus 8 Pro for delivering consistently clean and sharp images taken in pretty poor lighting conditions but with that now out of the way let's now jump into some selfie portrait comparisons now you'll see that when we start using the selfie cameras both cameras a little more with dynamic range though I will say that my skin is a little more blown out with the image taken on the oneplus 8 Pro compared to their really soft and consistent skin tones we're seeing with the image taken on the galaxy s 20 plus both phones have done a really impressive job here with edge detection you can see there's pretty much no errors that I can pick up on at least nothing that you're going to notice on a phone screen so that's really impressive now whilst I do tend to prefer the punchy out looking photo taken on the oneplus 8 Pro I think the fact that the galaxy s 20 plus has retained a consistent look across my skin tones means it is going to slightly edge out the oneplus 8 pro in this side-by-side comparison another quick side by side here and the oneplus 8 Pro has struggled a little more with edge detection you can see at the top left of my hat there it's blended in with the background of the building there but I don't really like the softer looking image that we're seeing out of the s20 plus here so if the oneplus 8 Pro had have nailed the edge detection like it did in the previous photo then it would have hands-down one this side-by-side comparison but it's a little too hard to pick a winner here because I don't really like the way that the image has been processed on the galaxy s 20 plus but the oneplus 8 Pro has struggled with edge detection so a little bit more of a toss-up between the selfie cameras on the oneplus 8 pro s 20 plus similar story in terms of image processing but edge detection is a little bit hit-and-miss depending on which phone you're using and the scenario that you're in is a little bit like a draw sometimes with portrait mode particularly using the selfie counters but now let's jump over to another selfie comparison but this time a video test all right starting off with the selfie camera on the S 20 plus and obviously with these tests we always want to be looking out for image quality how does it compare but I'm also really interested to hear the sound quality what are the microphones like when we're using the selfie camera and also or stabilization like as well so let's jump over now to the 1 + 8 Pro alright switching over to the selfie camera on the 1 + 8 Pro and again I wonder whether or not the image quality is on par or better perhaps then the s 20 + stabilization how does that look and then audio quality how does this sound compared to what we just heard with the s 20 + now this is a scenario where I think both phones are doing a really decent job but in my opinion the winner is hands-down the galaxy s 20 plus the way that it handles dynamic range is so impressive it's a really consistent image and the audio quality is really impressive as well that's not to say that it's bad image quality or bad audio quality out of the 1 plus 8 Pro it's not but it's just that the galaxy s 20 plus does such a good job of it but now let's switch the camera around and do a rear video camera test all right now another video camera test but this time with the main sensor on the rear of the s 20 plus this is where you'd hope to get the best image quality not so much necessarily audio quality depending on the mic placement on the phone but again image quality should surpass what we saw on the selfie camera I'm interested to hear your thoughts on that does it surpass the quality that we saw on the selfie camera so let's now jump over to the 1 plus site Pro and see how it stacks up to the main sensor on the S 20 plus alright now on to the rear camera the main sensor on the back of the oneplus 8 Pro how does this compare that's what we just saw on the s 20 plus does the image quality look and worse or any better as the image stabilization look at its the audio quality sound in comparison let me know your thoughts down in the comments below again another comparison where the Crown clearly goes to the galaxy s 20 plus and very consistent and visually pleasing image and also the audio is super clean as well and it doesn't have those focusing issues like what we're seeing with the video taken on the oneplus 8 Pro I do like the audio that's been captured with this video on the oneplus 8 Pro it's nice and loud and punchy but it's not as clean as the audio captured on the galaxy s 20 plus I would actually compare the video quality from the oneplus 8 Pro to what we've seen in the past on the pixel for lineup and so that's a pretty good thing but again the galaxy s 20 plus takes the cake here but now let's zoom out and compare the wide-angle lenses for video alright now switching over to the wide-angle lens on the back of the S 20 + o is really like doing these tests because I think this is a much more realistic and useful option to film yourself with the wide angle lens compared to using the main sensor because the main sensor you're much more likely to accidentally cut yourself because it's quite a bit Suman dim compared to the wide-angle lens but again it's a really helpful scenario to see how the image quality looks using the wide angle lens compared to the main sensor how does the audio quality sound and also general image stabilization as well and now over to the wide-angle lens on the back of the oneplus 8 Pro we've got the Sun going in and out of clouds at the moment so keep that in mind but with wide-angle lenses on oneplus devices in the past they've been fun to have but they've taken a little bit of a hit to the image quality and so this year we've seen an upgrade to the sensor being used for the wide-angle lens so hopefully image quality doesn't take as big of a hit as we've seen in past one-pass devices how does it compare though to what we just saw on the s20 plus and also what's autofocus like on on these phones because I can't see it myself so I can't tap to focus because I'm not looking at the screen so hopefully that's going okay and also what does audio quality sound like how does it sound compared to what we just heard on the s20 plus now for this comparison it's a lot harder to pick a winner from because both phones have their pros and cons I think I'm going to give the slight edge to the oneplus 8 pro in terms of audio quality simply because it's louder and it's punchy are only just compared to the s20 plus but again that gives it the slight edge but then in terms of image quality both phones are handling the situation very differently yes it's over sharpened almost to a fault with the video taken on the oneplus 8 pro but then in comparison the image on the galaxy s 20 plus almost looks out of focus it's that soft so I think because of that reason I'm gonna give the crown in this comparison to the oneplus 8 program okay so that is the full comparison of these two phones and whilst each phone does have a couple of additional features that I didn't touch on in today's video like the one plusses macro and photo chrome features or the galaxy's ability to shoot at K video these are not really features that are going to impact whether or not I decide to buy a phone they're fun to have but they're fairly gimmicky and so I wasn't really interested in including them in today's video but our suspicions of the 1+8 pro's new camera lineup competing fairly competitively with the 20s lineup of cameras has proven to be pretty bang on in fact I would say for the most part the images taken on the oneplus 8 Pro were consistently better looking if only slightly than the images taken on the galaxy s 20 plus and that was across each of the different lenses video is a different story the S 20 plus was clearly the overall winner in that category but the oneplus 8 Pro is certainly no slouch in regards to video either and so what this shows is that image quality is no longer a reason not to buy a oneplus device or at least the oneplus 8 Pro we now have flagship level cameras on a oneplus device which is pretty fantastic I wouldn't go as far as to say that they're better than or even as good as the cameras on the iPhone and pixel devices and in my opinion they're not and I do find myself missing the consistently excellent images that I've become accustomed to taking on my pixel for phone but again now we can say that the cameras on the oneplus 8 Pro are just about as good and in some cases even better than what we have with the Galaxy lineup of phones but those are just my thoughts let me know if you agree or disagree with me down in the comments below and the full in-depth review of the oneplus 8 pro is on the way so make sure you hit that subscribe button and that little notification bell so that you're notified when that video goes live but aside from that that is it hopefully you
