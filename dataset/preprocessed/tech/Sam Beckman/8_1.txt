[Music] this is the galaxy s22 plus and right up front i'm going to tell you that i have nothing bad to say about this phone well except for one thing but we'll get to that a little later on but seriously for every phone i review there are always at least a few compromises that make them slightly trickier to out and out recommend whether it be something to do with the design or the cameras underperforming or something to do with the software even the price of a phone can be its achilles heel but like i said there is pretty much nothing bad about this phone which has made it such a joy to use so four months after its initial release and after a bunch of software updates i'm finally bringing you my in-depth review of one of the top contenders for phone of the year let's begin so as always we'll start with the design and whilst this pink gold color variant might not be my particular colorway of choice everything else about this phone's design is top shelf you've got that beautiful frosted glass finish on the back a pretty slim camera unit to go with the rails are shiny which i guess does make the phone a little slipperier than if they'd have been matte coated instead however they're also quite flat and chunky which makes the phone just that little comfier to hold and then on the front of the phone you have these ultra slim consistently sized bezels which makes the display look amazing that hole punch up the top in the center there for the selfie camera is also one of the smallest you'll find on a phone and then perhaps my favorite feature in terms of design is this beautiful flat display i've always raved about how much i prefer flat displays over curved displays and so because this phone has a flat display that means i have nothing to complain about in regards to design now speaking of that display as with all of samsung's top-end phones the display on the s22 plus is absolutely beautiful not only is it amazingly bright but it's also got that fancy dynamic 120hz technology which makes it super fast and fluid whenever you need it to be but it can also clock itself down to as low as 10 hertz to save battery life and whilst we're talking about battery that has been another standout feature of this phone i was actually using the galaxy s 22 ultra not too long ago and battery life was certainly not one of its strong points whereas with the s22 plus even though it has a smaller size battery inside it actually outperforms the s22 ultra for context nearly every day that i've used this phone i've been finishing with anywhere between 30 to 50 of battery life left when i'm putting the phone onto the charger at the end of the day there have been the odd few days of really heavy use where it's been a little lower than that but i've never really gotten close to killing this thing in a day so if you were weighing up between this phone and the s22 ultra and battery life was of the utmost importance to you then i guess this phone might actually be the one to get okay before we chat about the rest of this phone i do want to quickly thank today's video sponsor wondershare mobile trans now if you've ever made the switch from ios to android or vice versa then you'll know how hard it can be to transfer all of your data over and the best example of how ineffective this process can be sometimes are your whatsapp messages so that's where mobile trans comes into play all you need to do is download the app to your pc then plug both your iphone and your android device in and then you just hit start that'll then automatically transfer all of your whatsapp data over and that's it you can actually also use the app to transfer other data aside from whatsapp messages as well depending on the version of the app you get but then aside from being available for both windows and mac devices it's also available as a standalone app for both ios and android as well and you can actually use just the apps on your phones without having to use a pc at all if you like so check out mobile trends today and get transferring all right so with samsung already smashing the design display quality and battery life out of the park with this phone i'm happy to say that the trend continues with the fingerprint sensor not only is this fingerprint sensor in the absolute best of positions making it easy to reach and scan but much like the s22 ultra it is just shocking how quickly it registers a successful scan even with the slightest touch of the sensor the phone will be successfully unlocked and ready to go so another really impressive in-display sensor from samsung now last year with the galaxy s21 the biggest downside in my opinion were the haptics and it made an otherwise fantastic phone feel a little cheap but i am so happy to say that that is not the case with the s22 plus not only are the haptics in this phone super high quality but they're actually some of the best haptics you can find in a device period 2022 seems to be the year where samsung has finally nailed haptics with their entire flagship lineup because they seem to have gotten that combination of clickiness and subtlety absolutely dialed in it just makes typing and navigating around the os a true joy and for me this is the best upgrade samsung has made with this phone compared to last year's version okay so from there we have the cameras and whilst we might not have the exact same camera configuration as the one found on the s22 ultra aside from the lack of a 10x periscope lens the cameras honestly perform very much the same and that means that in pretty much all lighting conditions it's just really easy to capture a decent image and video colors have that rich but not overly saturated look to them the contrast and sharpness is very pleasing the dynamic range and noise performance is super impressive as well and the fact that we have three very different but very reliable lens options in the ultra wide the wide and the 3x telephoto lens it just means that it's a lot of fun using this phone to shoot photos and videos i kind of wish there was a way to switch between the lenses when shooting videos at 4k60 but i also don't knock the phone for this because most if not all other flagship devices also don't offer this capability and so finally we come to software and performance and for pretty much all of my thoughts on this topic i'm just going to refer you to my review of the s22 ultra because this phone has beat for beat the exact same software and performance as that phone but what i will add is just how impressed i've been with the reliability of all of samsung's top end phones released this year from day dot each one has just worked pretty much how they should with very few prominent bugs or issues being evident and this is often not the case with other devices particularly if you look at google's pixel 6 lineup which took about six months to become largely bug-free with that being said one thing i did mention in my review of the s22 ultra that is also true of the s22 plus is that even though i really enjoy the software experience overall and can attest to the fact that the phone performs really reliably the one factor that brings both phones down ever so slightly is fluidity it's not that the phone is janky or anything like that it's just that it always seems to take just the slightest of moments to catch up to my swipes and my gestures as i'm moving around the os whenever i switch to using a pixel or oneplus phone after using a galaxy device i always immediately notice how much silkier the software feels other phones just seem always ready to respond with no delay whereas that doesn't feel quite the case with the s22 plus or the ultra for that matter like i said in my review of the s22 ultra though it is by no means a deal breaker and you really can't notice it unless you're switching back and forth with a different more silky smooth device but it is the slight downside that i referred to at the start of the video that otherwise makes a pretty much perfect phone just that little bit more normal but that is it that is the only real complaint i have about this phone and in all honesty i struggle to even call it a complaint given that it's not really anything wrong with the phone it's just something to do with the way that samsung optimizes software but everything else about this phone is a total knockout display check battery check design absolutely cameras yes please odd and even more than that the price is really competitive now don't get me wrong it's certainly not cheap but i reckon it's the best phone you can get in this price range if you've at all been on the fence about getting this phone well i have no problems recommending it like i said it is a true contender for phone of the year and i'll be very impressed if anything released this year can top its price to value performance [Music] you
