if you're anything like me then you know how hard it is to pick a movie to watch on movie not sometimes it takes so long to pick the movie that you end up actually running out of time to watch the thing well using taste you can save a whole heap of time because the app will keep you personalized movie suggestions based on what you've liked or disliked in the past and with that we are backed with a fresh new episode of the top Android apps let's go rotation manager is a super neat application that lets you set your phone's rotation on an app by app basis for example I always prefer my phone being locked to portrait mode except for when I'm using Google Photos so I can use rotation manager to set it up so that whenever I open Google Photos it switches to auto-rotate and then back off again once I leave the app download progress is a really simple but very handy application once installed anytime you are downloading any sort of file instead of having to pull down the notification panel to track its progress this app will instead place a progress bar right at the top of your screen it's a super helpful feature to have and there are a range of customizations within the app as well not only that but the developer of this application has been kind enough to offer me some promo codes that I will be releasing over on Twitter in the coming week or so so definitely make sure to follow me over there if you want to have a chance at claiming one of those codes now squirt is a photo editing application but not in the way you might expect instead of changing up the tone or color of an image like pretty much every other photo editing app on the Play Store squirt instead focuses its energy on being a powerful perspective and lens correction tool and it lives up to the high there are countless amounts of tools included that will help transform the perspective of your images and often this is that last missing step in taking our images looking pretty good too looking downright amazing and believe it or not this developer has also been kind enough to offer me some promo codes though this time I'll be giving them away over on my Instagram page so again as above make sure to go follow me over there if you want to have a chance at claiming one of those codes lock screen widgets as the name implies brings back a beloved feature that Android killed off with the release of Android 5.0 lollipop yet works by placing a frame on top of your existing lockscreen and then from there you can then tap on it and then this allows you to start adding in widgets you can press and hold to reorder the widgets you can sighs and move the frame according to your preference there are also some customizations that you can make within the app itself but the best part is that any widget that you can add to your home screen can also be added to your lockscreen now for all the love that one plus gets for oxygen OS one feature that has been surprisingly left out is a quick toggle to turn on and off the Dartmouth well oneplus dark mode toggler is the app to solve this issue once installed no need to even open the app you will simply be able to add in the toggle using your quick settings menu keep in mind your phone does unfortunately need to be routed for this to work but it's an app that has vastly improved the efficiency of using my one plus eight pro device speech way is a really valuable application for anyone that uses their phone to record long selfie videos it's essentially a teleprompter application but just for phone videos you insert your scripted choice set up the speed at which you think you'll read and then you hit record the good thing is with the placement of the text it'll actually mean your eyes are looking closer to the selfie camera rather than your own face on the screen so a super handy app for sure cover is an incredible wallpaper application that will take any image you like and convert it to a live wallpaper it does this by scanning the image and creating a depth map prediction and this then allows the image to have that 3d parallax effect so that it moves and hops around as you shift the perspective of your phone you don't need to watch a 15-second ad every time you want to select a new image or you can upgrade to the pro version but it's a small price to pay for a pretty impressive application filmic Pro has long been a staple for those wanting to take high-quality videos using their smart phones but its most recent update definitely caught my attention so somehow before Google was even able to do it you can now use filmic Pro to shoot 4k 60 videos on the pixel for what but aside from enabling a feature that so many have requested Google to implement since the device was launched it's just an all-around fantastic application a must-have for anyone wanting to up their smartphone videography game and trust me when I say this it's well worth the price tag and finally alarm clock wakey is a pretty fun app that brings a bit more of a unique experience to an otherwise dull time of the day aside from a neat design with a whole host of cool animations that give the added life the app also offers a range of inbuilt alarm tones designed to wake you up in a more soothing kind of way as well as that if you're someone who struggles with hitting that snooze button one too many times in the morning then you can actually set up the app so that you have to solve mask gins to dismiss the alarm clock plus there is a heap of additional features too long to cover in this video that are well worth trying out but that is it if you enjoyed the video then a sub would be amazing and if you like this app style content then there's plenty more where that came from I'll leave a link to apply this as a card up there and down the description below aside from that hopefully you enjoy the video thank you all very much for watching and I'll catch you later [Music]
