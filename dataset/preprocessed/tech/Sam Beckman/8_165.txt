did you know that you can actually double tap and then hold to zoom in or out using Google Maps or that by downloading a simple application you can quickly trigger a sound recording from your quick settings well welcome to 20 more hidden Android features that are sure to improve how you use your phone let's go now speaking of your quick settings menu it doesn't just stop at triggering a sound recording using an app like tile shortcuts means you can actually place any app shortcut or website directly into your quick settings panel which has the possibility of improving your productivity big time switching back and forth between apps to copy and paste text can be a real drag but if you launch Google Chrome into split-screen mode then you can actually just drag and drop any text from Chrome into whichever app is open at the same time definitely a neat time-saver but first times where the app in question doesn't actually let you copy text like the Google discover page or you-tube using it Universal copy will actually scan the text and make it copyable do you ever find yourself in a situation where for some reason your phone just doesn't have great network reception well try switching on airplane mode for about 5 to 10 seconds then switch it off this will force your phone to start and use cell tower search meaning it will instead locate those that are nearby thereby improving your signal with the amount of apps we download it's hard to give a track of which ones have access to our camera and so using camera less allows us to manually switch off and disable all the cameras on our devices thereby preventing apps from accessing them you can even block the camera on an app by app basis enabling the simplified reading mode in Google Chrome will actually hide any ads you do so by heading into the settings menu then the accessibility tab and then by switching on simplified view for webpages not only will the articles and web pages look that much cleaner but now those pesky article interrupting ads are no more did you know that most apps have beta versions available that can sometimes offer a whole range of additional features like what's up for example for a long time they're using the beta version was the only way to enable the dark theme that so many of us had wanted for so long now despite this it can often be really difficult to keep a track of which apps have beta versions available and even if they're allowing in new members well you can use beta maniac which an app I've mentioned before to significantly improve this process it will periodically scan all of the apps on your phone and if a beta program becomes available it will send you a notification that you can subscribe to simply by clicking on it here's a neat one that may not be applicable right this second given none of us are really traveling but if and when we're getting back into it if you're heading out of town but you're gonna have limited access to mobile data and take screenshots of various routes within Google Maps so that you can reference them even without your mobile data even better yet downloading an app like maps dot me will allow you to download maps for offline use minute you can still use it for directions even when you're offline now we probably all know that the fingerprint scanners on our phones have the option of loading in multiple fingerprints and whilst you might be tempted to load in as many fingers as you can a better option is to load in your main fingerprint multiple times doing so will greatly improve the scanner speed and success rate the Google assistant has proven to be the leading option in terms of AI Virtual Assistants but the crazy thing is most of us hardly take advantage of all of its features for example did you know that you can ask it to remember things for you you can just say something like hey Google remember that I left my keys in my backpack and then that information is stored to bring back that information just say hey Google what did I need to remember and there you go you can also ask Google to tell you what song is currently playing simply by saying hey Google what song is this and this effectively removes the need to use an app like Shazam to identify a song ever again now taking screenshots has always been a two-handed job but with screenshot assistant you can actually replace your phone's assistant gesture so that it instead takes a screenshot so this might be a long press on the home button if you're using the traditional three button navigation layout or a swipe in from the bottom corners if you're using full screen gestures and the downside is you do lose access to whichever virtual assistant you use but for those who never use an assistant this app might be the perfect replacement if you wondering why sometimes photos end up being too bright it's because phone manufacturers tend to lean towards over exposing our images because we tend to perceive brighter images as better quality that said as a result we often lose detail in those brighter parts of our images what the easiest workaround to this is by tapping the brightest part of your image whenever you're snapping a photo which will help in retaining those details in the highlights and whilst the results will end up darker you're able to now have a lot more flexibility in editing and can boost those darker parts up all while still retaining those details in the highlights if you're looking to take control over the amount of notifications that you receive on your phone then day wise lets you batch notifications to come in together at different times of the day meeting you can set your phone aside along with those distracting notifications knowing you'll be able to catch up on them later on ok so we all have that friend who will ask to look at something on your phone but then will somehow find her way into the other apps installed in your phone well screen pinning helps to solve this you may have to first enable it in your phone settings menu just search for screen pinning and switch it to on but then when you're in your phone's overview menu tap the app icon and then tap to pin it now whoever is using your phone will only be able to use the app that has been pinned to unpin an app swipe up and hold or long press the overview button and you will have to unlock your phone using your preferred authentication method problem solved now what's wrong the topic of having to search through our settings menus to find certain features if you find yourself consistently going back to certain areas within the settings menu then save yourself a few taps by setting up a widget just long press your homescreen to bring up the widgets menu navigate down to the settings section and then drag it to your screen from here select whichever settings menu you like and by - boom but it being time-saving 101 speaking of time-saving if you're looking for a fast and efficient way to share files between devices even without needing access to the Internet then there's really no better option than Google's own files application just make sure that the app is installed on both phones then open it on the sending phone tap share and then send and then open the app on the receiving phone and tap receive the sending phone will create a hotspot for both devices to connect to and with speeds of up to 480 megabits per second your files should be transferred within moments and finally whilst at the moment we might not be having many people around to our homes get yourself set up for when that becomes the norm again by setting up a QR code that lets people log in to your Wi-Fi you can do so using the QR staff comm website and then you this out slap it somewhere on your wall or on your fridge and now when people ask for your Wi-Fi details just tell them to scan the QR code this will connect them to your Wi-Fi network without you having to give them your password but that's it if you
