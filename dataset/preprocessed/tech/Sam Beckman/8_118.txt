alrighty 2020 is finally nearing its end it's been an absolute howler of a year but there's a way to mark the end of this one and look forward to the next we're doing my yearly roundup of the best android apps so each and every month i showcase 10 new android applications 20 alone in january in fact and if i do my math correctly that is a whopping total of 130 unique applications that i've featured across the year so today i'm giving you the best 20 my favorites out of all of the apps that i've featured this year and as always i'm gonna let you know throughout the video which ones i'm still using to this day one final little bonus worth mentioning after i developed this list of my 20 favorites not before i developed the list i actually reached out to every developer where the app was either a paid one or where there were paid upgrades available within the app and i asked them whether or not they'd be interested in giving me some promo codes to give away to you guys as a celebration of another year of top android app videos to my surprise a lot of the developers came through and we've got several of the apps on this list today on board and i'll share which apps have promo codes available throughout as well as how you can go about claiming them at the back end of the video though spoiler alert as always it has something to do with my instagram page but without further ado here are my top 20 apps for 2020. so the first app that i featured right at the start of this year was a to-do list and reminders application called memoryg and let me tell you i still use this app every single day the design is fantastic and there are a bunch of helpful tools included throughout but for setting reminders which is what i use it for this app is the best we've got 20 promo codes available for three months of the premium version of this app but keep an eye out for some big changes coming to the app in early 2021 which i think are gonna blow your socks off now fingerphase is an app that is really only useful for those that own a rooted pixel 4 device but i used it on my pixel 4 xl right up until the end and it was honestly a big contributor that allowed me to enjoy using my pixel 4 xl as much as i did the module essentially tricks any app that's on your rooted pixel 4 that allows for fingerprint authentication into thinking that your pixel 4 has a fingerprint sensor but then it uses face unlock instead it's seriously an app that will vastly improve the experience of using any pixel 4 device around sound is an app that i no longer use anymore but only because i so rarely use the audio recorder functionality on my phone but what i really liked about this app is just one little feature that allows you to place a recording toggle within your phone's quick settings menu which means within a couple of taps you can be recording whatever is happening around you simple but effective now i had beta maniac installed on my phone for a large portion of this year i'm not really sure why it's not currently installed but if you haven't heard of it it is an application that lets you track the various beta programs for the apps installed on your phone some of the best features within apps are only available within the beta versions for quite some time so this app will send you a notification whenever an app installed on your phone opens up its own beta program and then you can just sign right on up given how many phones have punch holes for the selfie cams these days energy ring is perhaps even more prevalent now than when i first featured it so you use this app to showcase your phone's battery life around your punch hole there are customizations galore that allow you to dial in how the ring looks and whilst the link i've got down below is a general version of the app the developer has actually made a number of versions to support pretty much any phone you can think of now i love the volume styles app and i do still use it on any device that doesn't run stock or close to stock android this app lets you customize the look of your phone's volume sliders and it's got a huge range of themes to choose from depending on your style but there are also additional customizations that really just maximize how your volume sliders work brightness manager is one of two apps that i featured from the same developer and as the name indicates it's an app that allows you to automatically set your phone's brightness level depending on the app that is open this can be super handy depending on the scenario and we have 20 promo codes to give away for this app as well defuse is one of the best live wallpaper apps that you can get and it works by taking the album artwork of a song you are currently listening to blurs it to hell and then displays it as a real-time visualization it's a really neat way to spice up a home screen and we have 20 promo codes for the premium version of this app as well and this lets you enable live beat syncing which means the background will move in time with your music now i don't use super status bar anymore but its functionality has always impressed me and for those who love to customize the way that you use your phone well this app is definitely worth a try so this app allows you to change up the look of your status bar with a huge range of custom theming options and presets available to choose from and you can also set up custom gestures including my favorite dragging along the status bar to change your phone's brightness or volume level super cool rotation manager is the second of the two apps i featured from the same developer of the brightness manager application and this app is essentially the exact same thing but for rotation instead for me i prefer my phone always being set to portrait mode except for when i'm using google photos so i do still use this app very regularly on my phone for that exact purpose and it's completely free now another incredible app that i didn't feature this year that is actually today's video sponsor is widgery so widgery is a fantastic little app that lets you create widgets from any web page you can load as many of these widgets as you want onto your phone's home screen and this will provide you with live and scrollable previews of your favorite web pages the process of setting up the widgets couldn't be easier you simply share the page you'd like from your browser of choice to the widgery app and it will load it up for you then find the widgery app in your phone's widget menu drag it to your home screen resize it to suit your needs and there you go it really is the best way to get a quick glance of your favorite news blogs or tweets right from your phone's home screen and what's incredible is that the app itself is free so if this sounds like an app that you want to try out then make sure that you check it out using the first link down in the description below now i haven't made a home screen customization video in a little while for those who missed those videos in particular well just download true pics and i'm positive that that will satisfy your customization cravings this app is essentially designed to showcase really awesome home screen setups but by far and away the best part of the app is that all of the information you need to load the setups onto your own devices well they're right there and if you click on them you'll even be redirected to where you can download them absolutely excellent wavelet is an app that gives you precise equalization control over any set of headphones that you might own but what makes this app a standout is that it remembers the settings you set up for each set of headphones and it will automatically load the right ones up whenever you plug them in the core functionality is free but we've got some more promo codes to give away for this app and they unlock all of the various headphone sound effects and this just completes an already incredible app widgets dominated the news headlines when ios 14 was announced all those months ago and ios widgets the android app was one of the first android apps to come along and emulate these ios style widgets since then the app has been updated regularly and you now get access to 65 ios inspired widgets and we've got 25 promo codes to give away for this one as well now true amps was probably one of the most popular apps that i featured this year and for bloody good reason whenever you plug your phone in it showcases these really cool animations that look fantastic there's a heap of customization available within the settings as well some of which you do need the premium version for but good news i've got 20 codes for this one as well foco design is an app that i still have installed on my phone but i use it slightly less so of late only because i got most of what i needed out of it when i first installed it so what does it do well many things but the main of which is that it allows you to design custom instagram story icons that can really make an instagram page stand out you want a reference to what they look like well just go and follow me over on instagram and you'll see them right in action when the dark sky weather app was discontinued earlier this year climacell was there to take over it's a really well-designed weather application that is super smart as well providing you with lots of detailed information including minute by minute and street by street weather forecasts which is mind-boggling to say the least all of the essential features are free but if you want to remove the ads or get access to the upgraded radar map then hey i've got 20 promo codes for this app as well that will give you three months of access to these premium features so much like true amps liquid teardown was also an incredibly popular app with a somewhat similar custom charging animation functionality but what makes this one unique is that it integrates the animation with a sketchup of all of the internals of your phone since i featured it the app has been updated with even more devices supported and there's now even support for a generic animation for anyone whose device isn't officially supported and yep you guessed it we've got another 20 promo codes to give away for this app as well now if we're talking about apps that made my jaw drop well clip drop is probably top of the pack for the year with the app installed on both your phone and your computer you can take a photo of any object around you on your phone and then drop that cutout onto your computer's desktop it's copy and paste but for real life and it is seriously seriously impressive so if you're using a phone that doesn't allow for much home screen customization well shortcut maker will bring back a lot of that customization flexibility and this is the app that i used to customize my pixel 4a and pixel 5 home screens so you can set up virtually any sort of custom made shortcut widget that you can think of but then you can also really customize how the icons of these shortcuts look so you can use third-party icon packs or you can adjust the icon size and there's a heap of other customizations as well but the best part of all is that it's completely free to use no restrictions whatsoever and finally one of the most expensive items that i featured all year but well worth it in my opinion was the filmic remote application and if you're someone who uses the filmic pro app to capture videos on your phone well this app allows you to wirelessly control that application from another phone now as i said when i originally featured this app for all of the features that it gives you you'd normally be paying upwards of a thousand dollars and so whilst it might be slightly more premium than your average app it's honestly well worth every single cent but that is it those were my favorite 20 applications that i showcased throughout the year of 2020. and as i said we've got a lot of promo codes to give away 140 in fact if my calculations are correct and so for those who are interested here is how it's going to work firstly i'm going to be releasing 15 of each participating apps promo codes in batches over the next two to three weeks these are going to be released at random times throughout the day to account for all of the different time zones so you want to be following me over there and have story notifications turned on to have the best chance at claiming one of those codes so that leaves five codes per app to give away and for these codes i'm gonna be releasing them slightly differently so when this video first went live there would have been a corresponding post that went public on my instagram page at about the same time with all of the
