so Robi Rock apparently really liked the first two videos that I made for them and so it reached out and asked if I was interested in partnering up for another video and I was like you know what I'm kind of digging making the vaccum videos so let's do it am i a vacuum channel now anyway this video is a showcase of their Essex pure robot vacuum and keep in mind as with the other videos because this is a sponsored collaboration with Robo rock it means that this video will simply be a product showcase video and any opinions that I express throughout will be my own but with that said let's get into the Essex pure so the first thing you learn to oddly pick up on is that the Essex pure looks an awful lot like the s5 Max another robot vacuum in Robo Rock's lineup which I've also done a video on so then the question is how do they differ for starters the Essex pure costs $7.99 Australian dollars which means that while still not outrageously cheap it is definitely more affordable than its s5 max counterpart so then what sacrifices have been made to bring this cost down well in all honesty not money at all in fact the only difference is between the Essex pure and the s5 Max is that the Essex pure has a smaller water tank coming in at 180 ml versus the two 90 ml of the s5 max and the volume of the water coming out of the Essex pure can't be controlled via the Robo Rock application aside from that is pretty much identical to the s5 max it still has that high precision laser navigation system that spins at 300 rpm enabling it to map each room of your home and you can still split up your home into different areas within the app itself meaning you can set up schedules for the vacuum to clean your house whether it be one room at a time several rooms or your entire home in one go as with the s5 Max the Essex pure still uses adaptive algorithms to calculate the most efficient way to navigate through each room of your house and you can still use the app to set up no-go zones or virtual barriers meaning you can really dial in how you want the vacuum to clean your house the Essex peel also has 13 different sensor types all working together to give it super accurate fall avoidance carpet detection for boosted suction whenever it reaches a carpeted area of your home height sensitivity to avoid it getting stuck plus a bunch more like the s5 max the Essex pure still has that pretty incredible fifty two hundred million power lithium-ion battery meaning it can claim for up to three hours on one charge covering an area of 300 square meters at the same time and again like the s5 max the Essex pure also has that smart top-up battery feature which means if it gets low on power whilst it's cleaning your home it'll come back to the dock charge up just enough to finish off the clean then it'll go back to cleaning your home and once it's finished cleaning your home then will it return back to the dock to fully recharge up on top of that all the key components of the pure from the dustbin to the main brush to the water tank they're all super easily detachable making upkeep and maintenance on the vacuum a breeze now back to the water tank for a minute and whilst it is smaller than the s5 maxes larger water tank keep in mind that the Essex peelers water tank can still hold enough water to mop and vacuum an area of up to 150 square meters in size and whilst the water flow can't be adjusted within the Robo Rock app you can still adjust it on the vacuum itself meaning there is still a level of control you have over the morphing functionality to help tailor it to your needs so in the end the Essex pure is nearly identical to the s5 Max and in fact in a lot of ways it might make a lot more sense for those not needing the improved mopping functionalities if you're someone who's really looking for a vacuum that offers the full package in regards to mopping then it's probably worth spending those extra dollars on the s5 max but otherwise the Essex pure matches it in every other way and for a couple hundred bucks less it's definitely a very handy option if you learn more about the vacuum and grab a fifteen percent off discount for a limited amount of time then you can do so using the first link down to the description below but that's it for this video thank you all very much for watching thank you Rover rock for supporting the channel and I'll catch you later [Music] you
