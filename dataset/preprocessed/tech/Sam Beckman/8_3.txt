[Music] over the past couple of years i've created a number of ios customization videos that have unpacked really every single layer of customization that's possible with ios and whilst they take a long time to prepare for and to put together they're also some of the most rewarding videos to make and so because of this i decided to go back to the drawing board once more and create a brand new home screen setup and what you're seeing on screen right now is the end result much like my previous setups it's still really clean and minimal however we've obviously got a new wallpaper and a new widget alongside a completely fresh layer and so if you're wanting to recreate this on your own phone well buckle up and let's get straight in now let's first chat about the wallpaper and if you haven't yet seen either of my previous ios setup videos the wallpaper is actually the secret source to making our dock look invisible and i think making the dock invisible is the first step in creating an ios home screen setup that doesn't look like ios you can actually find a bunch of free hide the dock wallpapers online however as always to coincide with the release of this video i've just recently released a brand new wallpaper pack called paper and this is a modern art inspired wallpaper pack that comes with alternate versions of each backdrop that will hide the dock on ios depending on the theme you have set there are 15 main designs within the pack which you could obviously just use as is if you're not that interested in hiding the dock but like i said each version has at least one variant that you can use to hide the dock and for some wallpapers i've even made two variants one to be used with the light theme and one to be used for the dark thing i've actually also got three other wallpaper packs available on my shop all of which also include hide the dot variants so if you're interested in checking them out they'll all of course be linked below but if you're grabbing my latest paper wallpaper pack just be aware that there are also 15 bonus 5k desktop variants each of which have been custom designed for a widescreen display now as with my previous wallpaper pack i was really careful in designing this new pack to ensure that whenever you're setting them as your wallpaper all you need to do is disable the perspective zoom option and that's it which means if you ever accidentally change your phone's wallpaper in the future and you want to change it back you can absolutely do so without having to redo the entire setup i'm about to show you in this video alright if you're downloading this pack directly to your device then you'll need to decompress the zip file using the files application and after you do that you'll see three folders and to hide the dock you'll want to use one of the wallpapers within this ios variations folder and for this particular setup i'll be using the wallpaper called orb ios dark so i'll tap on that then i'll select the share icon down here and then finally i'll tap on save image before i set that wallpaper though i'm just going to also save one of the light wallpapers here let's do this one called fountain and as you can see when i tap on that it has white edges on either side but don't be alarmed that is fully intentional and i'll explain why i had to do that in a moment so i'll tap the share icon here as well then again tap on save image all right let's now close the files application and then open up the settings app and then we'll come down to wallpaper and select choose a new wallpaper now before i set the actual wallpaper i'll be using for this video let me just quickly show you the situation with the light wallpaper and why it has white borders so i'll tap on recent then select that light wallpaper i just saved and as you can see the actual wallpaper element of the image scales up as intended meaning when i tap this button here to disable perspective zoom and then hit set the wallpaper works as is and if i come back home with the light theme activated the dock has become invisible also as intended but check this out if i go back to the files application and then head back and into the finals folder then open the main variant of the fountain wallpaper and save it then come back into the settings app select that main version as the wallpaper and of course turn perspective zoom off and then hit set now when i come back home you'll see that even though the wallpaper is filling the exact same portion of the screen as the previous version did the dock is no longer invisible and after a lot of trial and error i realized that the reason for this is because ios actually changes the color of the dock ever so slightly depending on the colors it detects in the wallpaper and so even if you have a fairly light wallpaper like this one ios is still referencing all of those other colors and therefore tinting the dock as a result but with those white borders included in the image it actually tricks ios into thinking that the wallpaper is lighter than it is and therefore it retains the original colour of the dock meaning when we use the specially designed ios variants of the wallpapers our dock will be invisible once more it's just another example of apple making life harder than it needs to be but i did want to explain why there are white borders just in case you're a bit confused after picking up the paper wallpaper pack but with all that being said i'm gonna head back and into the settings app locate and select the dark orb wallpaper i just saved turn off perspective zoom and then hit set and then set both just before i head home i'll quickly navigate back and make sure that this dark setting dims wallpaper toggle is off which it is and with that done i'll quickly turn on my system dark mode come back home and as you can see as expected our dock is invisible all right moving on so for the layout of this setup i wanted to go with something a little more center oriented compared to my previous setups but as we know apple doesn't let us place icons or widgets just in the center on their own and so i had to get a little creative in order to achieve this and here's what i came up with so up the top is a medium sized widget which we'll be able to use to position a small sized widget into the center of the screen then below that whilst we'll have space for a layout of 16 icons in a four by four configuration i only want a two by four layout of icons in the middle and so i'll need to place eight transparent icons on either side four on one side and four on the other which will achieve the result i'm after so let's start simple with that clock widget up the top now a lot of people will say that having a clock widget on a setup is really unnecessary given that we already have a clock at the top of our display and yes i totally agree with that but i just really liked the look of this particular clock widget and honestly couldn't come up with anything else that fit this setup layout so with that in mind as always i have this particular widget on my website which you can download for free so once we've downloaded it all they need to do is long press our home screen tap the plus icon up here and scroll all the way down to the widget section we'll tap on that then navigate over to a medium size widget and then tap to add it to our home screen we can now remove all of the other icons on this page by tapping the little minus icon on each and then tapping on remove from home screen repeat that for as many apps as necessary and then once that page has been cleared i'll tap the little three dot icon down here and uncheck any other enabled pages so that we're left with just this one page with our medium widget at the top oh and whilst we're still in editing mode i'll just quickly swipe over to this blank page on the right and take a screenshot which we're about to use when setting up our widget okay with that out of the way let's talk about getting that widget set up so after you've downloaded the minimal clock widget file from my website we can then open up widget and navigate to the create page and then tap on import widget we then want to select import from files and then navigate to the downloaded widget file and that should import it automatically and we can then tap the back button then we'll come back to our home screen tap to open the widget widget select the recently imported widget and then we need to set our transparent background so i'll tap on add wallpaper and select the screenshot i captured earlier i'll then tap the tick button wait for the app to generate my background and then the last thing we need to do is select the position of our widget which for this setup is right up the top which is selected by default so i'll tap the tick button again and then tap on yes and that's it when we come back home our beautiful clock widget is complete now we get to the really monotonous part of the process setting up our icons for this particular setup i'm gonna be using the light icons with no background from my monochromatic icon pack and for everyone who's been emailing and tweeting at me asking for an expansion pack i have good news there is now officially big expansion packs available for both my monochromatic icon pack and my pastel icon pack both of which now have 50 new icons for a bunch of requested apps doubling both packs to a total of 100 unique icons or love now i tried all of my icon styles for this particular setup but i found the light icons with no background to look the best and cleanest but you could of course use any icon style you like depending on the look you're going for but to get these icons set up with a transparent background as with my previous videos i'll be using the transparent app icons application with that open we first need to tap to add a screenshot and select that same blank home screen screenshot we captured earlier from there we're going to first create the blank icons for the left and right side of our screen so i'll start with this icon here and i can then simply tap the download button then i like to go from left to right top to bottom so i'll then select the far right icon and again tap download then i'll move down a row and over to the left then tap download then over to the right tap download and so on and so forth you obviously need to do this for each blank icon which as you can see really doesn't take that long and once complete we now need to start creating our actual app icons so we'll close that app for a moment and open the files app navigate to the monochromatic icon pack and then open the folder that says white no bg then i need to find the first app i want on my home screen so i'll start with the camera app tap on that and select the share icon and then tap on copy then i'll go back to the transparent icons app move to the position where i want my first icon to be which is right here and then this time i'll tap on customize then i'll tap this little blue three dot icon here and select paste image i'll click done and with that icon pasted in i can now tap on save i then need to repeat this process for every single icon i want on my home screen but of course changing the position for each new icon and for this particular setup once i've completed that entire process i'll end up with 16 different app icons eight that are completely blank and eight that have my actual app icons on top and with that completed i can now jump into the shortcuts application to start creating my custom shortcuts i'll first start by creating my blank icons which once the initial setup is complete is actually a relatively quick process so on the my shortcuts page i'll tap this plus icon then i'll tap on add action and search for open app then i'll tap on open app and then tap on the word app as i said we're currently in the process of creating our blank icons and so there's a couple of different approaches you could take for this you could utilize the blank icons as actual hidden shortcuts to a bunch of different apps which could level up the functionality of your home screen or if you're just interested in getting the setup completed quickly then you can instead just pick one app to use for all of your blank icons which will save a lot of time in this setup process but again that will mean you'll have eight blank shortcuts to that one app on your home screen but i'm obviously interested in getting things done fast for this video so i'll go with the latter option and just select the weather app as my app of choice i can then tap this little blue settings icon here and then tap on add to home screen now i can tap the icon here then choose photo and select the first blank icon i saved which is this one here then i'll tap choose then tap the x here to remove the app label then i can tap on add then immediately i'll reopen the shortcuts app and once again tap on add to home screen i'll again tap here and select choose photo then select the second blank icon then i'll tap choose again then tap the x to remove the app label and then once again tap on add and i just need to repeat this process another six times and once i've finished i'll have all of my eight blank icons jumbled up on my home screen and with those completed i can now set up my main app icons this is very much the same process however you'll obviously need to make sure that the shortcut is set up to launch into whatever app matches the icon you're setting up i've now shown this process a number of times so watch the previous ios setup videos to see how to do this in detail but it's basically the exact same as creating the blank icon but instead of selecting a filler app like the weather app you just need to select the actual app that will match the icon you're setting up just again make sure to disable the app label for each icon before adding them to your home screen but with that completed we can come back home and here are all of our app icons looking pretty jumbled up so we'll long press our home screen and then start dragging our apps into the correct order and if you created each of your shortcuts in the same order as you did your icons like i did then this process should be relatively quick to complete but either way once complete your setup should look something like this now for this setup i did want to add an extra bit of functionality as eight apps is often not quite enough on any given home screen so i also thought that creating a folder of additional app icons would be a nice touch now for these folder icons i actually decided to use the light icons with the background which means i don't have to create custom icons using the transparent app icons application so all i need to do is go back into the shortcuts application and repeat the same process as before but with any app i'm wanting in this folder for the cleanest end result i recommend setting up at least nine apps to use for this and just keep in mind when selecting your custom icon instead of selecting choose photo here you can instead select the choose file option and then just navigate to the white with background icons via your files app again disable each shortcut name before adding them to your home screen but with all nine apps completed we can then come back home then long press our home screen tap and hold one of the icons then tap on seven of the eight remaining icons so you're holding eight icons in total then just drag this group of icons on top of the remaining icon to create a folder then we can tap to close that drag it to our dock hit done and there is our completed home screen setup and so that's it and whilst this setup was by no means a quick and simple process to complete i do like the fact that everything was just limited to three applications widget shortcuts and the transparent app icons application which does simplify it ever so slightly now in order to make the setup even more seamless and remove these annoying notification banners that appear whenever you tap on one of your custom app icons then i highly recommend watching the video that i've created that covers that exact topic which i will link up in the cards and down below oh and if you also wanted to make the setup switch themes automatically at any given time in the day using ios's cool focus modes feature then i've also got a video that covers that pretty cool functionality again linked up in the cards with that being said if you have any questions definitely feel free to drop a comment down below and i'll do my best to hit you up with the response and as i said links to everything mentioned throughout the video can be found down in the description below but that's it thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
