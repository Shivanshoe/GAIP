probably the most frequent comment I get across every video on my channel is where do you get your music from so I thought it's finally time to address this question once and for all if you're looking for a tail DR version of this video but then the quick answer is I've used epidemic sound for literally every video that I have created in I want to say the last four or five years and it's probably even longer than that so that's the really quick answer but I want to take some time to unpack firstly why I use epidemics and how I utilize their service most effectively and also why I think it's one of the best options for creators at the moment now let me be clear up front this video is not sponsored by epidemics sound they did not pay me or even asked me to make a video on their platform but that said I did just recently join their ambassador program about a month or so ago and so that means any time you use my link to sign up to their platform I do get a kickback so keep that in mind but as I said that was only about a month ago and I've been using their service unapologetically for the last four or five years so let's start with why I use epidemics and the number of years ago I was signed up to a YouTube network and as a part of this network they signed me up to epidemics and so in a sense I kind of just fell into it through their recommendation but then I parted ways with that network and at that time I was still a fairly small channel in terms of the revenue that was coming in and so I had to decide whether or not I wanted to keep using epidemics and and cover the cost myself and of course I did the reason being once you've signed up to their platform any song that you use is ready to go in regards to copyright it's one of the biggest hassles if you aren't on a platform like epidemic sound where you are constantly on the lookout for great tracks that are legally fine to use but that also don't sound like trash and that's another really big factor for me staying with using epidemics and in that the music available on their platform is seriously of phenomenal quality I'm yet to find a track that is anything but highly professional the other really key factor that makes using epidemics sound so great is that you can download individual instrument stems for every single track available on their platform now some other platforms do also have this feature but if you're not aware of what a stem is this is basically an isolated instrum tract so for example with epidemics and when you download all of a song stems you get access to the following an isolated drum track and isolated bass track as well as an isolated instruments track and an isolated melody track now when you line all of these up in your NLE of choice you get the full originally mixed song but with each of these tracks being separated and on their own layers you can take out certain layers all together or you can readjust parts of the song more seamlessly and honestly use this in just about every video that I make but before I show you how to do that in a real-world example I thought it might be helpful to dial things back a little bit and show you the entire process of using epidemic sound to even choose songs and then show you how I go about using them in my videos so on the epidemic website there's a couple of ways you can go about searching for music in it and navigate to the Browse section and filter through tracks via genre types or you can also navigate through curated albums that creators have put together which often have really helpful titles for specific video types but I personally tend to find myself more regularly using the Browse section of this site and for the most part I find myself often going back into either the beats funk or R&B and soul categories i do sometimes jump into the other categories but these are the ones that I regularly sift through now let's say if we jump into R&B and soul for example from here the first thing I do is jump over to the vocal section and enable instruments only now for each song on epidemic sound you can of course just download all the stems and the disable the vocals but in this research phase being able to listen to the tracks without vocals on the site itself I find to be really helpful and time efficient and then it's just a matter of sifting through the songs available you can of course refine the search even more so if you want to and often find myself using this similar feature over here which let's say you find or have used a song in the past that you really like the sound of if you click on this icon it'll bring up a massive list of songs that the platform deems is similar in one way or another this feature has saved me loads of time and is particularly helpful for those time crunch situations now generally speaking I'll start by just downloading the full track without any stems because save some time and use the full track and happy dates but more often than not I will find myself back and downloading all of the stems the reason for this is let's say I'm editing a project in Premiere Pro and I've downloaded a sweet track that just works perfectly for the first half but then partway through the song a huge synth sound comes in and just overwhelms any other audio that's in the video namely my voiceover he's a quick example of that [Music] now I could just fade out the music and switch to a different track at that point but more often than not that just doesn't feel right so if instead I load all of the stems into a sequence in Premiere Pro I can now come to that part of the track that was overwhelming the rest of the audio in my video make a simple cut and then delete that huge synth part and now it sounds like this and to be honest for a lot of my videos I usually end up switching off either the melody or the instrument tracks altogether and just leaving the drums and bass which I find gives me lots of flexibility in making the video flow how I want it to it also makes it easier to end tracks properly and when I say properly I mean the end where they're supposed to end rather than just fading off halfway through this song and this is because with the isolated audio tracks any cuts in the music become virtually impossible to pick up on here's a quick example of a track that I want to end slightly earlier without using the steps [Music] now here's me utilizing stems to help make that transition even more seamless [Applause] [Music] and that's it I cannot stress how useful it is having individual instrument stems and that along with the fact that I have this massive library of highly professional songs that are legal for me to use in all of my videos is why I can genuinely recommend that you at least check out epidemics sound and if you do then I would really appreciate you using my link down in the description below which helps to support the channel aside from that hopefully you enjoy the video thank you all very much for watching and I will catch you later [Applause] [Music] you you
