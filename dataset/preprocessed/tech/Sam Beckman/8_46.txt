so last month i created an in-depth 20-minute step-by-step tutorial video that covered the entire process of customizing your iphone on ios 15. but there were two tricks in particular that i showed within that video that i thought deserved their own video and they were removing the shortcut banners that show up anytime you use custom icons on your home screen and making the dock invisible so for anyone looking to achieve either of those things well this video is for you let's dive in so if you're using custom icons that you've set up using the shortcuts application each time you tap on one of these icons you'll get this annoying little banner that pops up at the top of your display it's not nearly as bad as it was on the first iteration of ios 14 where it would literally have to open the shortcuts application first before then redirecting you to your shortcut of choice but it's still kind of annoying so to remove this shortcuts banner we first need to head into our settings then to the screen time section and then we need to tap on see all activity if you scroll all the way down you'll see a section for your notifications and here you want to find the shortcuts application just keep in mind it actually might not show up here at first particularly if you've just set up your custom icons it didn't initially for me and so to bring it up i literally just tapped a whole heap of my app shortcuts over and over and kept rechecking until finally it did show up so once it does tap on it and simply uncheck allow notifications now you would have thought that this is all we need to do but no if we tap on one of our app shortcuts the banner still shows up oh and by the way if you like the look of this icon pack it's actually one that i designed myself which you can pick up over on my website link below okay the next step is to head into the shortcuts application and head over to the automation menu from here we'll tap on create personal automation we'll scroll down to where it says app and then select that then tap on choose and select one of the apps on your home screen so in this case i'll select the twitter application we'll tap on done make sure is opened is selected which should be by default and then tap on next then we want to tap on add action and here we want to find an action that runs in the background and that we don't really need to use so for example i'm going to search here for number and select the action called number from the calculator application and leave the default number as is this is just an action that will occur in the background and it has no impact on me so it works perfectly for this situation then hit next and disable the check mark here that says ask before running then we'll tap on don't ask and then tap on done now when we come back home and tap on the twitter application there's finally no notification banner how good is that just be aware the setting within the screen time notification section often resets itself whenever you reboot your phone so if it does all you need to do is just head back into that section and disable the shortcut notifications it's honestly not too big of an issue but definitely something to keep in mind all right from there let's chat about hiding our dock now to be clear we can't actually disable the dock unfortunately apple still doesn't let us do that but we can make our dock look invisible by using the right wallpaper with the right settings enabled we're essentially making the dock blend into the wallpaper giving the illusion that it is indeed invisible now there are a stack of wallpapers you can find that will make the dock invisible with the right settings enabled and i'll leave a link to an amazing website filled with a bunch of free options below but if you're looking for something a little less generic then i've actually also created two separate wallpaper packs that will hide the dock on ios as well the first is my mountain sky wallpaper pack which includes 10 different backdrops each with different mountain silhouette shapes and different sky components and then a version of each so that you can use them with either the light or dark theme activated so that should please those of you who like a photography based backdrop but for anyone who prefers a more abstract backdrop then i've also got you covered as well with my abstract base wallpaper pack called slide the only caveat with using the backdrops in this wallpaper pack is that in order to hide the dock you've got to make sure your phone's dark theme is activated i tried creating light versions as well but ios actually changes the color of the dock ever so slightly when you've got the light theme activated depending on the colors and luminosity it detects in the backdrop making it virtually impossible but i did also include a landscape variation of each to suit a pc device so you still get 20 files in total and again each of these will hide your dock if you've got the dark theme activated both of these wallpaper packs are available to pick up over on my website but again you can also just check out the free options that i've linked below as well but with your chosen wallpaper downloaded and saved to your device we can go into our settings then to the wallpaper menu select choose a new wallpaper and tap on the image you've downloaded for this video i'm using the dark version of the backdrop called mountain sky 10 from my mountain sky wallpaper pack before you hit set make sure you set perspective zoom to off and then reposition the wallpaper if need be so that you've got plenty of that dark section of the wallpaper visible down the bottom to cover up the area with the dock lips we'll tap on set and then the last step is obviously to set your phone's theme accordingly so for this wallpaper i'm going to go ahead and turn on the system dark mode and then when we come back to our home screen you'll see that the dock is completely invisible and there you have it if you found this video helpful then a sub to the channel would be greatly appreciated but hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i will catch you later [Music] you
