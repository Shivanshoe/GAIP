did you know that every single day there are often hundreds of discounts for paid apps across the google play store no well i don't blame you because there's no in-built way to find them and so play deals is an application designed to help this is a pretty fresh application so it's still finding its feet a little but it will update every single day with the latest app sales and discounts and if you find anything you like the look of just tap on it and download away you'll be surprised at how much money you could save just by browsing this app once each day all right from there we have video to wallpaper a no-frills application that does exactly what it says on the box you simply tap this plus button choose a video from your phone's local storage then you set the app as your phone's wallpaper and that's it you now have a video of your choosing set as a live wallpaper on your phone it works just as advertised and there are no ads whatsoever now if you're like me and you hate the new internet toggle on android 12 well wi-fi qs is just the solution so for anyone not using android 12 google opted to add this new internet toggle into the quick settings panel on android 12 devices which replaces the previous separate wi-fi and mobile data toggles and instead combines them into one and so that means if you're wanting to quickly disable either in particular the wi-fi it's now two taps instead of one and whilst there is a way to restore the older buttons via an adb command wi-fi qs makes it even easier you just download the apk via github and then once it's installed you can then navigate into your quick settings menu tap the edit button and you'll find a new wi-fi toggle all the way down the bottom drag that into position and there's your new wi-fi toggle you'll need to also manually grant the app location permissions via your settings menu in order to see wi-fi information on that little toggle but it works flawlessly making it a fantastic solution to a really annoying problem and then we have auto hertz which is a really great application that helps you to take control over the refresh rate of your phone's display now whilst our phones can be pretty reliable when it comes to automatically switching our display's refresh rate depending on the content that is on screen they still quite often get it wrong now you could of course manually force the refresh rate to just stay at the maximum all the time but that does come at a cost to battery life and so auto hertz lets you manually decide what your refresh rate should be set to on an app by app basis you can leave the toggle set to auto which will let your phone decide the refresh rate but then you can also manually set a toggle to 60 hertz or to your phone's max refresh rate that way you're guaranteed a high refresh rate when you want a high refresh rate but you can still save power from those less intensive apps like video players and if you want to get this app for free as well as some of the other apps featured in today's video then you might want to consider signing up as a channel member which will give you direct access to all of the promo codes from today's video as well as any future promo code giveaways plus a bunch of other perks as well i've left the link to where you can find out more below and aside from all of the amazing perks it's also just a really cool way to support the channel but with that being said let's press on okay for anyone who loves the idea of the material u auto theming functionality on android 12 devices but who have also been a little underwhelmed by the color options available well repainter is the tool for you now disclaimer depending on the device you use repainter on you will at the very least need to grant adb permissions via the shizuku application or you may even need root access so keep that in mind but with the app set up and ready to go you'll be able to start experimenting with a huge amount of additional theming options you can choose from a range of wallpaper based color palettes or even choose a custom color palette as well and then with your theme selected you can then dive into the settings to customize the theme even further it's a super powerful application if you're looking to really level up the material you theming functionality so definitely worth the price of admission in my book this app will also be a part of the channel member promo code giveaway so a huge thank you to the developer for jumping on board as well all right from there we have gremlin and that dubs itself is a toolkit for instagram and there are a stack of similar apps that offer a lot of the same functionality as gremlin does but there's one particular feature that i think makes this app really unique in comparison and it's not even mentioned on their play store listing and that is walk and scroll this will essentially place a transparent version of instagram over the top of your camera feed which means you can then walk and scroll without being unaware of your surroundings there's a bunch of other handy features as well like the ability to download reels or stories or posts plus a heap more and so after that we have cache and this is a pretty handy application for storing text copied from anywhere on your phone so with the app installed anytime you select and highlight text anywhere on your phone if you then tap the little three dot menu you'll now get a new option that says stash if you tap that the text will get transferred to your notification center as well as to the app itself and within the app you can then label that text making all of your selections easier to shift between later on it's a well-designed app that has the potential to come in really handy speaking of coming in handy if you're someone who has a number of different third-party launchers installed on your phone and you want a way to quickly switch between each of them without having to dive into your settings menu then launches quick tile is absolutely the tool for you as the name suggests with the app installed you'll be able to set up a new quick settings toggle that will bring up the home launcher switcher that's it super simple but outrageously useful second to last is a folder sync a pretty handy application for syncing anything you want from your phone's local storage to and from a cloud storage service of your choosing so whether it be an entire backup of everything stored on your phone or some really specific folders you can use sync to set up what are called folder pairs which means anytime those selected folders are updated on either your phone or on the cloud storage foldersync will then sync that information across to ensure both folders match identically you can customize how the syncing is set up if need be and you can also schedule the syncing which will automate the process even further and so finally today we have nomad sculpt a really cool 3d modeling application now i'll be upfront i'm a total novice when it comes to using any sort of 3d modeling application so don't take my examples of evidence of what this app is capable of but i can absolutely see how powerful this app is given the huge amount of tools available so if you're into 3d modeling and you've been wanting a solution for your phone or tablet device nomad sculpt is top of the pack you do need to pay a fee to unlock exporting as well as a couple of other tools and some might think that the cost is a little pricey but as far as i'm concerned the price is actually minuscule compared to what you'd normally have to pay for similar software on a pc device that my friends is it if you enjoyed the video then a sub to the channel would be amazing and as mentioned i do also have a bunch of promo codes to give away for some of the apps featured in today's video so a huge shout out to each of the developers on screen right now and like i said if you want to get direct access to each of these promo codes then all you need to do is sign up as a channel member which you can do so using the link below i'll be sending this month's promo codes to my channel members in about a week or so to give everyone a solid chance to jump on board but then if you're watching this video sometime in the future and you want to get involved in future promo code giveaways then as soon as you sign up as a
