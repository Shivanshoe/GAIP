[Music] customizing an android phone is one of my favorite things to do so much so that i actually created an entire application that allows users to submit and explore all sorts of amazing home screen setups if you haven't heard of it the app is called palette and what's really cool is it just recently surpassed 100 000 downloads on the play store which is incredible on top of that we've also just launched a brand new version of the app that brings with it a lot of requested features including being able to follow other creators so that you can view just their feed of setups you can also now upload and download custom widget backup files where necessary you can also have three widgets within one setup plus there's a bunch of other really cool changes throughout that make the app even better than what it already was and so for today's video i've picked another three incredible home screen setups from pallet to not only showcase throughout this video but to also walk you through the entire process of recreating each of the three setups featured in today's video can be found in the featured section under this new best of palette category and for each setup you'll be able to find every asset you need to recreate them on your own phone including backup and wallpaper files links to widget and icon packs as well as everything else so if you want to follow along make sure you download palette using the link below but with that being said let's dive in and take a look at setup number one all right so first up today we have this incredibly vibrant and eye-catching setup called tile theme it was submitted by crucial war who is a regular contributor to the palette application so highly recommend giving him a follow but this setup has been created using nova launcher and what's really great is that despite how it might seem it's actually very easy to recreate as you can see here on the setup details page within palette the icons used in this setup are from the gladian icons pack and the only widget being used in this setup is from the tile ui for kwgt pack if i tap on the little information icon up here you'll be able to see that custom has included the name of the widget which is a tile 5 so we'll make a mental note of that for when we're setting it up we'll close that and now we'll tap the wallpaper button down here and when we do we'll be redirected to the google play store page for the warleak plus application and if we open that the wallpaper for this particular setup can be found within the glass morphism category and it's this first one here called bubble v2 so i'll go ahead and set that as my wallpaper right away and then with that done the last thing i'll do is head back into palette and download the backup file and with all of the assets downloaded and ready to go we can now open up nova launcher the first thing i'll do is long press my home screen and tap on settings then i'll come down to the backup and restore section and tap on restore backup then i'll tap on the tile theme backup file that i just downloaded and then hit ok with that done as you can see we've got all of our icons set up and ready to go down the bottom here and then just this giant kwgt widget at the top so all i need to do now is tap on that widget then search for the number five and find the widget called a tile five tap on that to load it and then i'll come over to the layer tab and set the scale to 90. though this may need to be adjusted depending on the phone you're using the only other thing you'll probably need to do is to come over to the shortcuts page and change any of these shortcuts to apps that are actually installed on your phone for me i only needed to change the weather shortcut which i swapped over to the ever faithful frog weather shortcut application but everything else was working as expected with that done we'll hit save and there we go our home screen setup is complete and i just love how visually impressive and cohesive this entire setup is despite the wallpaper icons and that widget being from three different applications they go so well with each other and as you saw this setup was also pretty dang easy to recreate all right let's now take a look at setup number two so this next setup is called minimal camping and it's been submitted by a user who goes by the name authentic and as you can see this is a beautifully minimal and light home screen setup that looks incredible taking a look at the setup details page within palette and this setup has also been created using nova launcher it also uses icons from the kiesel icon pack which i'm a big fan of and what's really cool is that the time and weather widget you can see here is actually a custom widget that you can download directly by tapping on this custom widget icon the wallpaper has also been uploaded directly so we can tap on the wallpaper button to download that and i've also gone ahead and created a backup file for this setup as well so we can go ahead and download that and with all of those assets downloaded and ready to go we can now come to nova launcher and the first thing we'll do is long press our home screen and tap on wallpapers then we'll select pick image and choose that wallpaper we just downloaded we'll tap on set then home and lock screen and with that done we'll now tap on settings and navigate down to the backup and restore section we'll tap on restore and again select that backup file we also just downloaded all right all that's left to do is to tap on this blank widget then tap on import and select that recently downloaded widget file we also just downloaded just one thing to keep in mind is that if there's ever an error when importing a downloaded widget from pallet it'll most likely be due to the fact that the file extension has been removed and so to fix it just open up a file explorer application find the file in question and long press it then select the rename or edit option and then just type the necessary extension at the end of the file which for kwgt widgets is just dot kwgt but with that out of the way back in kwgt you may be able to just leave the widget as is or if you need to resize it you can obviously do so using the scale properties found under the layer tab but once that is the correct size we'll tap on save come back home and there is our completed setup and in reality i think the best part of this setup is that wallpaper it has that beautiful vector graphic at the top there which looks amazing but then that large section of white underneath is perfect for placing all of our icons and widgets fantastic stuff all right the last setup for today's video is this incredible home screen dubbed orange this one was sent in by adil ahmad and just like the previous two setups this one has also been made using nova launcher this setup however utilizes the orange line icon pack which looks pretty neat plus it also uses widgets from both the sun and c and glass 12 kwgt packs and if we tap the info icon up here we can see the widgets being used specifically so again make a note of those and then if we close that the wallpaper for this setup has also been uploaded directly so we'll tap to download that and finally we'll tap to download the backup file with that done let's come back home and once again long press our home screen then i'm going to tap on wallpapers and select the wallpaper file we just downloaded i'll tap set wallpaper and then home and lock screen and i'll now go into the nova launcher settings and once again restore that backup file we just downloaded all right with those two components completed i'll then tap on this bottom widget section then i'll search for ag 30 and select the widget that comes up then i'll come over to the layer tab and scale this right up to somewhere around the 95 mark and then adil did mention that he'd customize the colors of this widget to match the orange accent of the wallpaper which you can do so using the various settings found on the globals page but i'm going to skip that for this particular video okay i'll save that widget then come back home and now all i need to do is set up this top widget so i'll tap on that then search for 0.99 and select the sun and see widget that shows up then i'll tap on this overlap group swipe over to the layer page and scale this down to 75 then i can save that come back home and there you have it our final home screen setup is complete and again super impressive combo of widgets and icons used here by a deal to really tie everything together with that wallpaper so a fantastic home screen setup that's also pretty functional and so that's it and just a reminder if you've got the latest version of the palette application then you'll actually be able to follow each of the contributors from today's episode to keep up to date with any new setups that they upload aside from that if you enjoyed the video then a sub to the channel would be amazing oh and don't forget to check out my new shorts channel which i'll also leave linked below but that's it thank you all very much for watching and i will
