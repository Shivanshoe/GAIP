[Music] so this is the xiaomi 12 not the pro just the regular 12 and i've actually been using this phone for the past month as my main everyday device and now that the phone's officially out and available for purchase i thought it was about time to share my thoughts on and i've got to say up front this has been a very tricky phone to assess it includes a lot of features that justify its premium price tag but then it also has enough flaws or missing features that make you wonder whether it's worth it at all so let's unpack all of it [Music] starting with design and straight out of the gate this phone does have a very modern and clean look and feel to it which i quite like but i will say coming from last year's xiaomi mi 11 which this phone is kind of the spiritual successor to the 12 here does feel a little more i guess plain would be the word to describe it over the past 6 to 12 months we've started seeing some pretty unique design choices like the pixel 6 devices from google or the oppo find x5 pro even last year's may 11 ultra had that massive camera unit on the back and so in comparison to phones like those the xiaomi 12 feels very safe and on top of that i'd even go as far as to say it feels almost like a completely different phone from the me 11 in terms of design for one it's quite a bit smaller and where the mi 11 was quite a large phone this one definitely feels much more compact in comparison i actually think this is a welcome change because the me 11 was nearly identical to the mi 11 ultra in terms of size so it's nice that we have a smaller option in this new 12 line as well as that whilst the 12 has this really nice smooth textured glass panel on the back it actually feels a little more plasticky in comparison to the frosted glass finish we had on the back of last year's xiaomi may 11. now one improvement they have made with the 12 though is that the side rails are now matte textured and not glossy which i think makes a huge difference as to how this phone feels in the hand on the front xiaomi have actually now ditched that quad curve display they went with for last year's mi 11 and m11 ultra and now we have a much more standard display that is only curved on the sides which i think is the right call much like the mi 11 there is also still no ip rating with the xiaomi 12 and to be completely honest at this price point i think that's a little bit disappointing however if you made me choose between an ip rating and a phone having good haptics then i would absolutely choose good haptics any day of the week and thankfully the haptics in this phone are incredible tight and clicky but not too strong either and so ultimately the haptics in this phone are up there with some of the best it doesn't beat the pixel 6's haptics in my opinion but they're still very very good the fingerprint sensor is also very fast and reliable however for some reason they've made the odd choice to move the position of the sensor down towards the bottom of the phone this is actually what oneplus did with their phones last year and they got a stack of negative feedback from almost every reviewer about that change and thankfully oneplus did listen and they moved the sensor back up with this year's oneplus 10 pro but xiaomi apparently weren't listening to those negative comments because that's exactly what they've done with this device and again it's not a great call hopefully they sort that out for next year's phones and move the sensor back up to where it should be [Music] okay so from there let's chat about this display now whilst it is a slightly lower resolution compared to last year's may 11 just remember that this is actually a smaller device so it's not as big an issue as you might have initially thought in my day-to-day use this display has still been super impressive sharp good colors and buttery smooth thanks to that 120 hertz refresh rate it also gets decently bright with a peak brightness of 1100 nits which sounds really good and it is but when you remember that the xiaomi mi 11 display had a peak brightness of 1500 nits you wonder why xiaomi couldn't at the very least match it in addition to that the display on this phone really doesn't get that dim and i've actually had to start using a third-party app called screen dimmer to lower the display's brightness even further because honestly whenever you use this phone in low light conditions without screen dimmer the display is blindingly bright i'm honestly baffled that this is something modern phones still struggle with and google even implemented a software feature called extra dim with android 12 which lowers the minimum brightness even further but for some reason xiaomi decided not to bring that feature across with its version of android 12. and so whilst we're on the topic let's chat about software and for the most part it is almost an identical experience to last year's devices but with some minor improvements and some downgrades as well so firstly the phone is running me ui 13 which as mentioned is based on android 12 and the key aspect from android 12 on pixel phones that i was very happy to see brought across with some of those new system-wide animations now not every buttery smooth animation from the pixel phones is here like we don't have those clean widget closing animations on the home screen and this transition from google maps being open to closed is very janky but that elastic style over scroll animation within any app is indeed present and the keyboard does also stay open within an app even when you swipe into the reasons page so i was very happy to see those two ui elements making the transition to me ui 13. aside from that though the software is very similar to me ui 12. we still can't use third-party launchers with gestures it just disables them if you try we also still have a default home screen launcher that isn't amazing out of the box but that can be customized with a little bit of know-how we also have a lot of bloatware installed by default most of which you can remove some you can't and by default anytime you install an app from the play store you'll get this annoying full screen interface that scans the app and this will even sometimes show ads which is kind of crazy and a little bit disappointing you can disable this page however but the setting is buried very deep in the system settings but to do so you need to head into apps then system app settings then security then security scan and then finally you can disable this scan before installing toggle which if you use a phone running me ui that is definitely something you should do the fact that xiaomi makes it this hard to find this setting though is definitely a little frustrating one thing you can't disable though is this really annoying full screen accessibility warning that shows up whenever you want to enable accessibility for third-party apps not only does it require you to tap this check mark and then the ok button but it doesn't let you tap the ok button until a 10 second timer expires honestly this is ridiculous and it's nothing new it was also an issue with last year's xiaomi mi 11 and may 11 ultra but i really don't like it and i think that xiaomi should ditch this functionality altogether another thing i really don't enjoy with this software is that notifications don't stay on the lock screen after you unlock the device it's actually one of the bigger issues i have with ios and even apple acknowledged the issue by introducing a new feature called time sensitive notifications with ios 15 but there is no such option with me ui and it just means that if like me you're someone who relies on remembering notifications by keeping them on your lock screen well that's not possible with me ui in its current state and then the last aspect of this software that really grinds my gears is the system share sheet which for some crazy reason doesn't allow you to copy links as text it's got every other option in the book but not this really basic one which is super annoying now look whilst i have just piled nitpick upon nitpick regarding me why as a software skin i actually do want to dial it back a bit and say in actuality none of these issues are deal breakers for me personally are they annoying yes of course but in and of themselves they don't make me not want to recommend this phone or any phone running me you wife for that matter the only reason i bring up all of these quirks and bugs is in the hope that the good people from xiaomi are watching this video and that they'll take the feedback on board and make their software even better in the future so xiaomi if you're watching i love your phones but if you're able to fix some or all of these issues then i'd love them even more [Music] now given that this device has nearly the same size battery as the b11 but also a display with a lower resolution i would have thought that that would equal improved battery life but even after a month of using this phone which is plenty of time for the adaptive battery to load my habits and kick into gear i can barely get this thing to last a day in fact pretty much every single day has required a re-juice at some point for context usually it's sitting at about 20 to 30 percent by around 5 p.m and that's after a work day with fairly light use once the kids are off to bed and there's a bit of scrolling on the web and my various socials there's pretty much no chance of making it to the end of the day from that point on now it does have fast wired and wireless charging which is appreciated but i think it's the disparity between specs and real world performance that disappoints me the most a phone not being able to last a full day with light use in 2022 is a pretty average result for me fast charging or not so hopefully xiaomi can address this in the future all right the last thing to address are the cameras and much like the me11 i've been really pleased with the images and videos i've been able to capture using this device you get two main lenses a 50 megapixel main shooter and a 13 megapixel ultra wide both of which capture really impressive shots in pretty much all conditions with images having that sharp punchy yet not overly processed look to them which i quite like i will say portrait mode images are a little extreme for my taste so i've largely avoided using that feature but then aside from those two lenses you do also get a third five megapixel telephoto macro lens and don't let the word telephoto fool you there this is not a standard telephoto lens it actually just allows you to capture macro shots without having to get too close to your subject which can often mess with the lighting now often these macro lenses feel very tacked on and gimmicky and whilst i haven't found myself using this one all too much the resulting images are much more usable than those other you know two megapixel macro lenses we've seen on a lot of other devices just quickly in terms of videos this phone also does not disappoint and i've been really pleased with the videos i've been able to capture using this phone particularly with that main lens colors are really nice the image looks super sharp and you can even get some nice natural depth of field when shooting with my lens thanks to that bigger sensor all of that being said at this price point i do wish and actually think that xiaomi should have given this phone even just a two times telephoto lens and it does feel like a missed opportunity to make this device better value than what it currently is and that's really the tail of the xiaomi 12. it seems like a phone that should offer more than what it does whilst we don't know for sure the pricing of the phone in us dollars because it's not actually available for purchase directly in the us it does seem to sit somewhere between that seven to eight hundred dollar price tag which makes its main competitor the regular galaxy s22 and if you go with the galaxy s22 you get a brighter display a three times telephoto lens an ip68 dust and water resistance rating and dare i say a slightly less frustrating software experience now the s22 also has a smaller battery but in real world performance the two phones actually perform pretty much the same look despite how it might seem i've actually really enjoyed my experience with this phone and i think that most people buying it won't be disappointed i guess i was just hoping for some more tangible upgrades over last year's me 11. things that would have made this phone a much easier recommendation that phone was already a tough sell at its price point and the competition has gotten even stiffer since and so given that this phone has made very few improvements over its predecessor it does make it tricky to recommend if you're a big fan of me ui and you're in the market for a new phone at around this price point then i don't think you'll have any regrets buying this device but for me if xiaomi don't plan on making any drastic improvements to future iterations of this phone going forward then i'd love for them to just straight up drop the launch price and make this a value champ could you imagine if they'd made this phone the same price as the pixel 6 at launch that could have been a game changer and definitely would have gotten a lot of people talking but alas they didn't and so now we can only imagine what if [Music] you
