dear google not too long ago i was one of your biggest supporters when people slagged the pixel 3 xl i was there to tell people how much i loved it same with the 4xl people found everything wrong with that device but not me i found everything right with it but then something changed you weren't making as big a splash in the flagship realm so you tried your hand at the budget game and boy did you succeed the pixel 3a and 4a were fantastic value phones and they were very easy to recommend so you thought let's scrap the flagship game all together and try for the mid-range instead and see that's where you lost me and it wasn't just with the hardware side of things either but there's also been changes to your software lately that i just can't get on board with you see i used to love the pixel software and i was convinced that it was truly the best version of android that existed not anymore but i'm not one to just sit in the corner make some complaints and leave it at that no so i'm here to present you with 10 suggestions that i think you should implement if you make these 10 changes then i think it will truly make the pixel lineup of phones the absolute best that android has to offer you ready google let's do it all right let's start easy and work our way out from there yeah and so the first is software related now a few years ago the big difference between android and ios really boiled down to the fact that android was much more customizable and people lapped that up including me we were installing third-party launchers icon packs and widget packs and customizing our home screens until kingdom come but then that started becoming much harder to do when gestures became a thing it started in 2018 with android pie but then progressively became worse you see unlike the traditional three button navigation which was a separate system element to the home screen launcher gestures are actually directly integrated into the system launcher itself and so what this means is that when you switch to using a third-party launcher at best the experience becomes janky and less refined with studded animations but then in some cases gestures just get disabled altogether now to be honest this actually wouldn't necessarily be that bad if you just allowed us to customize the system launcher and on most android phones you can but on pixel phones nope not really an option you see they have two persistent elements on their pixel launcher that currently have no way of being removed the google search bar and the at a glance widget for anyone looking to make their home screen look unique well these two widgets just refuse to let that be the case now there are rumors that google might allow users to disable the at a glance widget in an upcoming update which is great but google please don't leave us hanging let us also disable the search bar as well and while we're at it give us icon theming support and more desktop grid sizes but at the very least let us remove everything from the pixel launchers home screen so that we can at least use widget packs to make it look how we want to or just let third-party launcher developers tap into the api for gestural navigation so that using a third-party launcher can feel just as seamless as the stock home screen launcher once more but either way please keep those of us who like customizing our phones in mind because there's a lot of us now speaking of software one thing android phones have become somewhat infamous for is their lack of reliability when it comes to down the line software updates at best some android phones are now guaranteed for three years of major os updates and four years of security patches and whilst that is heading in the right direction it's nothing on the seven years apple offers its iphone users so google you need to lead the chachi the rumors suggest you might be offering five years of support for the next pixel phones but i reckon go further set the example here and match apple seven years of guaranteed software updates would be amazing and we're not asking you to force other manufacturers to do the same but if you really want to be the iphone of the android world well give us seven years of software updates and then battery life pixel phones have never been known for their battery life actually they have been known for their poor battery life particularly out of the box so fix that enough with these subpar battery capacities in your flagship phones which are embarrassing compared to the competition it's time to beef them right up but not only that it's time to improve your fast charging technology as well i'm not saying you need to match the xiaomi's and one pluses of the world but 18 watts of fast charging are you kidding me let's get that up to 50 for wired 30 for wireless and call it a day now the pixel 4 xl the haptics were amazing and then not even a year later google thought that this was the area to cut costs on by using a much lower quality haptic motor on the pixel 5 and 4a liner so google no more of that please bring back the amazing haptics that we once had with your pixel 4 flagship phones and not just with the flagship line either go bold and put it into your budget a line as well i'd happily pay an extra 20 if it meant the haptics were top tier like they once were let me just say this do you see apple using subpar haptics on any of their lineup despite the price no and google neither should you and the same goes with your speakers once again for me the speakers in the pixel 4 xl were top of the pack in terms of the android world sitting just behind the speaker system on the iphones of the world and then you went and adopted this underscreen speaker technology with the pixel 5 which just bollocks this right up come on google you've got to find a way i'm not saying this one will be easy but with the edge to edge displays everyone's expected to put on every phone these days but you're google damn it you've got to return the pixel speakers back to their former glory now speaking of displays a few quick notes here firstly no more 60 hertz please not even on your budget range give the a-line 90 hertz panels going forward and 120 hertz panels on the flagships please but more than that you know it's finally time to put an a plus plus display on your flagship phone and the one key way to achieve this is simple make them brighter now i will commend you your displays have gotten better and better over the years and yet they've always been some of the dimmest at their max brightness settings especially compared to other phones in similar price categories and if you're worried about the hit to battery life well just remember as discussed you'll be putting in much beefier batteries into your phones right okay now this one might be controversial but if you really want to go toe-to-toe with apple and in fact perhaps even beat them then you've got to bring back face unlock when this feature came built into the pixel 4 flagship lineup everything about it was amazing except for one key factor you didn't force apps to update to support it this meant i could nearly never utilize this amazing biometric authentication to its full potential now there's a couple of caveats to this request firstly you've got to find a way for it to be under the display none of this large notch or forehead business no more and secondly you've got to keep a fingerprint sensor on board preferably and under display one that way should apps continue to take their time updating and supporting the technology we have a fallback all right number eight design you've kind of become a bit proud of your utilization of plastic lately as seen in the pixel 3a and the pixel 4a and 485g and even with the pixel 5 with that bio resin coating which let's face it just felt exactly like plastic now i have no problems with you using plastic on your budget range lineup that is a perfect way to cut costs in my opinion but on the flagship lineup no no no no no and you know what you've already developed in my mind the most premium finish on a phone ever as seen on the pixel 4 liner that matte glass finish not only looks super premium but more importantly it also felt amazingly high-end and premium in the hand so it would be amazing if you just cut out this bio resin nonsense and just go back to making phones that not only look high-end but feel it as well now second to last and this is a biggie but it's to do with your cameras for photos you really are still the king in terms of software optimization but in terms of your hardware you're well behind at this stage still using sensors that are four years old in your latest pixel 5. now the rumors do suggest that you'll finally be upgrading your sensors on your next lineup of flagships so thank you if that does indeed prove to be true but there's actually one other area that i think you might not yet be addressing and that's video quality for the longest time pixel phones have been known to have great pictures and yet not so great videos and i guess that's because it's harder to use software trickery to make videos more impressive than originally captured so hopefully the new sensors will help but you've also got to do some heavy lifting on the software side of things too 4k60 should be the norm not only with the main sensor but also with the ultra wide the telephoto and the selfie camera as well and then do some work with hdr and color rendering to make the videos look more pleasing straight out of the game apple is by far the king when it comes to video capturing so try and take a leaf out of their book and so finally for me it all comes down to this last suggestion now if you were to implement all of the suggestions that i've made throughout this video some in fact many might say that you've made nearly the perfect phone at least as far as android phones go and when you've created a phone as impressive as that you might be tempted to throw in a top-tier price tag to go with and if that's what you're thinking google stop it stop it now i'm not going to give you a number but i am going to say this you should baffle us with the price make it so low that it essentially forces people to really seriously consider buying your newest phones i'm not saying make the price so low that you start losing money but i am saying that you got to get people turning their heads potentially at the sacrifice of some profit i say look at any comparable phone on the market and take off one maybe 200 and let that be the launch price so for example the galaxy s21 ultra launched at 1200 us dollars if the pixel 6 pro matches it spec for spec make it 9.99 like i said baffles so there it is google if you implement these 10 changes then i say you'll not only get a solid footing back in the flagship smartphone game you'll bloody well knock down the door not entry so then what do you think was there anything that i missed chances are if google is watching this video then they might also be looking at the comments section as well so let them know the changes you'd like to see down in the comments below aside from that if you enjoyed this video and you agree with the suggestions that i made share it send it to google that's how we get them paying attention and hopefully taking on board some of the feedback that we're giving them but that's it thank you all very much for watching and i'll catch you [Music] later [Music] you
