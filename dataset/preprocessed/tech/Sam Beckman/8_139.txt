when it comes to customizing a home screen setup i've always looked to third-party launchers whether it be nova launcher or lawn chair or whatever else these third-party launchers just offer so much more flexibility in how you can set them up and they really do allow you to dial in pretty much every minute detail allowing you to get a home screen set up that is really unique to you but then with the release of android 9 pie back in 2018 and with it the introduction of gestural navigation third-party launches started becoming crippled because of the way that the gestures worked and that they were baked into the stock default home screen launcher so this meant you could still use a third-party launcher but the animations were janky and the overall experience of using your phone was not as smooth as it once was and this was only solidified further with the introduction of android 10 and the fully gestural navigation system and so for most of us we're left really with only two options we use a third-party launcher to customize our home screen setup but we suffer the consequences of the animations being all off or not being able to use gestures at all or we go back to using our stock boring home screen launcher and lose all of the customization flexibility that is unless you're using a oneplus device now the oneplus launcher has always been pretty much the only stock home screen launcher that allows for decent customization and the keyword there is decent because although the samsung launcher does offer theming options there really isn't a whole lot you can do to get it to look anything close to decent now with the oneplus launcher you can change icon packs icon size the grid size whether app names are visible or not and there's even a very much appreciated hidden space section that allows you to hide apps that you don't want cluttering up your app drawer now even though it sounds like a lot and it is in comparison to most stock home screen launches if you just come from using something as versatile as nova launcher or launch air then it really doesn't feel like that much flexibility in comparison and you are really limited in regards to the setups that you can achieve but if you're happy to be somewhat flexible with your style and get creative then you can actually end up with some really nice looking home screen setups and so that mentality is exactly how i achieved my latest home screen setup using the oneplus launcher itself so it is a two-page fairly minimal looking setup and before we dive into the nuts and bolts of what i've got loaded onto my new oneplus nord if you want to see a full step-by-step breakdown of how i've achieved this setup using the oneplus launcher and let's get this video up to 4000 likes and if it does get there then i'll release a separate step-by-step video tutorial so as i said i am currently using the oneplus nord i'm working on the full review should be live in the next couple of weeks so stay tuned for that but for those not in the know i've pretty much always rooted my pixel and oneplus devices for the past few years pretty much exclusively so that i can use an app called quick switch this app essentially allows the phone to set any supported launcher as the default stock home screen launcher which means it gets full access to the gestures with all of those nice animations but i really wanted to challenge myself and see if i could just for once not root my phone and instead rely on the stock oneplus launcher and i've actually been somewhat enjoying it now in regards to the wallpaper being used here this one has been taken from the walpy application it's by a photographer named oliver cole but i'll also link to it directly down below but then i actually also have a second wallpaper that becomes activated at night and this one is by a photographer named annie spratt also found via the wallpaper application but again linked directly down below as well so i set up these wallpapers to switch automatically at a particular time at night and in the morning using an app called auto dark thing you do need to set up permissions via adb first but the main reason for doing this is that the oneplus nord or really any oneplus device is still yet to add a quick settings toggle to quickly turn on or off the dark theme which is absolute bollocks it is apparently coming in the next android 11 update but until then aside from manually digging into the settings every time you want to switch the dark theme on or off this is probably the best approach and it automatically changes your wallpaper as well if you want it to now from there up the top i'm using a widget from the shadow kwgt widget pack which i've been digging lately it's widget 001 to be precise and i have this setup to launch into the battery menu within my settings the frog where the shortcut application the google calendar application and the clock application respectively when tapping on each of the different elements now below that we have six app icons laid out in the two by three configuration three apps across is less than what i'd normally like but again with not many grid sizes available to choose from this is the best result that i could come up with now for the first time in a very very long time i'm not using the kraton icon pack so here i'm using an icon pack dubbed white and i really enjoy the look of it in terms of applications real simple but in order we have google messages gmail and the dial application and then below that is the youtube creator studio application twitter and google maps below that we have a search icon widget taken from the waffle for kwgt widget pack i've used widget 35 as the base here but it has been heavily edited so keep that in mind but tapping on it launches into a google search shortcut but then swiping over to page two and here we have another widget taken from the shadow for kwgt widget pack this is widget 13 but again it's been edited slightly but these are essentially more detailed weather information widgets and tapping on both will also launch me into the frog weather shortcut application and below that we have nine apps in a three by three configuration so we have the play store the youtube app instagram google chrome whatsapp then i have microsoft outlook spotify pocketcast which is my new podcasting application and finally a shortcut to a work timetable widget that i've set up using the shortcut creator application so that's it for my home screen but then swiping up and into my app drawer if we do a quick swipe down you'll notice that every single app has its own beautifully designed icon from the white icon pack but guess what not all of these icons were provided by the icon pack and the oneplus launcher isn't great at loading all of them in either so i had to go through manually one by one for many of these icons i need to set up the correct icon when it wasn't loaded correctly or choose a different icon altogether that could pass for another app icon otherwise it would stick out like a sore thumb some apps worth mentioning here though are the graphi app which is actually where you can purchase and view my super in-depth course that unpacks how to create cinematic tech reviews nice little plug there but i'll link it down below if you're interested i've also been using memory g for quite some time now as my go-to reminder application then below that i use the preview application to well preview my instagram feed which i like to curate at least somewhat to give it a clean look if you're not already following me over there definitely make sure that you do so then coming below that and i still use simple note all the time for note taking and i even use this on my desktop machine as well and it has online cross device syncing which is amazing but everything else is pretty much business as usual and aside from that that's really all there is to this setup it's fairly clean and functional but it means i get to enjoy all the benefits of still using the stock default home screen launcher the main of which is the fluidity that comes as a result a quick reminder if you're wanting to see exactly how i set up this home screen using the oneplus launcher and all of the customization that went into the various widgets that you saw as well then drop a like and let's try and get this video up to 000 likes at which point i will release the full instructional step-by-step how-to video that will allow you to recreate this home screen setup aside from that hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching and i'll catch you later [Music] you
