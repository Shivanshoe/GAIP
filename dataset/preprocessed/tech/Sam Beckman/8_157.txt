a couple of years ago we were gifted a cordless stick vacuum that kind of changed how I felt about vacuuming instead of lugging around a huge corded vacuum that needed to change where it was plugged into every time we switched rooms now it was quick convenient and I'm gonna be honest with you somewhat enjoyable to actually clean the house now our old dyson v-6 is long in the tooth at this point so when Robo Rock reached out to partner up for a video and send their new h6 our way I was definitely interested now I went through a disclaimer regarding sponsored videos in the last row Barak s5 max video that I may which I'll ever link to up here and down there but basically because this is a paid sponsored video this will not be a standard review it will be a showcase video so keep that in mind but with that said let's get into it so firstly one of the big selling points of the h6 is its ultra long lasting battery which has a runtime of close to 90 minutes now this is in its Eco low powered mode but the fact that we have the ability to run a cordless vacuum for up to 90 minutes in any mode is really impressive on top of that the battery is more energy dense than your standard vacuum battery meaning it's able to maintain 85% of its power after four hundred charging cycles in terms of suction the h6 packs a punch with 150 air watts of suction power and it also has an extensive 5 stage filtration system on board which filters up to 99.97% of 0.3 micron particles now Robo rock are probably more well known for their robot vacuums but one technology that's been brought over in particular is what's called their boost mode this is where the vacuum will automatically increase its suction whenever carpet is detected for a more thorough clean in terms of design it's pretty sleek nothing outrageously unique though but what I really like is this bright OLED display that shows critical information including what I really appreciate which is how much vacuuming time is left using the mode that you're currently set to as well as that normally with stick vacuums you have a trigger switch which you have to hold continuously to keep the vacuum on now the H sticks does have this but also has a really neat locking button that you can just press once to keep the vacuum suctioning and it will do so until you press that button again right let's talk accessories the vacuum with your standard floor brush but it also comes with a carpet brush that is specifically engineered for deeper carpet cleaning in that it's slightly wider than your average brush and it also has a 50 watt high torque and durable motor that provides dedicated power to spin the roller you also get a dusting brush a crevice tool and a motorized mini brush as well as that the h6 also ships with a flexi tube which when combined with a crevice tool or the dusting brush makes cleaning those awkward hard-to-reach spots much much easier all of these accessories are easily mounted into this self-standing and wall mounting charging dock which keeps things nice and tidy now I know this video is sponsored but Robo rock are so confident in their product they actually also sent me the Dyson V 11 which is pretty much the main competitor to the h6 and they taught me to have at it and compare the two in this video now I'm not gonna go into heaps of detail here but here's a quick summary on how these two vacuums compare in terms of battery life put simply the h6 lasts longer here are some numbers for those wanting the specifics but at each various mode the h6 will last either the same amount of time or longer and what the V 11 does and it also charges quicker than the V 11 in terms of suction power the V 11 is top in class here playing 185 watts of suction power compared to the 150 watts of the h6 when it comes to noise the Dyson produces between 70 to 78 decibels of noise depending on the speed setting in use whereas the Robo rock emits 72 decibels in its maximum so they're both pretty much on par in this category the Robo rock weighs about half as much as the Dyson coming in at a mere 1.4 kilos which is great for long cleans but the Dyson has a larger dust bin that is nearly double the size of the Robo rocks both vacuums have displays the Robo rocks is OLED whereas the Dyson's is LCD and aside from that the Robo rock has that little handy lock button for continuous cleaning whereas the Dyson does not so the actually holds up pretty impressively to the Dyson V 11 whilst there are a couple of areas that the Dyson has it beat like dust bin size and suction power one big difference to keep in mind between the two is cost right now the baseline Dyson V 11 costs 1249 Australian dollars whereas the Robo rock costs $6.99 and with the 15% discount code they're offering anyone who uses my link down in the description below it costs five ninety five which is well below half the price of the baseline Dyson V 11 to me that extra suction power and bigger dustbin and not worth the additional six hundred and fifty dollars so there it is that is the Robo rock h6 showcased if you will learn more about this product or as I mentioned earlier score a 15% off discount code for a limited amount of time then you can do so using the first link down in the description below but that's it hopefully you enjoyed the video thank you all very much for watching thank you roba rock for supporting the channel and I will catch you later [Music] [Applause] [Music] all
