this salmon fillet didn't come from the sea it was grown in a lab to look just like the real thing there are a lot of questions that people have number one question is what does it taste like salmon is one of the most popular fish in the u.s and it usually comes from massive farms like this which can cause all kinds of environmental problems growing it from cells might one day offer an alternative it's going to be a long very hard journey to get there foods made this way aren't yet approved for sale in the u.s or anywhere in the world except singapore and even if they were are consumers likely to see them on a menu anytime soon we went to san francisco to try and find out for thousands of years salmon were abundant in what's now north america but in 1866 european settlers in the pacific northwest started preserving salmon by canning it it was the start of a massive commercial fishing operation soon fisheries were catching millions of pounds of salmon every year for a while the supply of salmon seemed limitless but it wasn't in fact wild salmon populations were already declining by the late 1800s and less than a century later some were at risk of disappearing forever is there a possibility of seven becoming extinct at this rate oh there's no question about it the idea of farming salmon came about in the late 60s by the early 2000s around two-thirds of the salmon americans were eating was grown on farms but that industry comes with its own problems farmed salmon are prone to parasite infestations which can spread to wild populations and salmon feed is made partially from other fish roughly 12 percent of all fish caught every year are turned into feed for fish farms and that has a huge impact on global fish populations especially in places like peru and senegal we just need another source of fish and and that's what we're here to provide [Music] all right this is arya elfinbine and justin kolbeck they co-founded wild type back in 2016. last one their goal was to figure out how to grow a piece of salmon from cells i started to think about a lot of my background in stem cell biology and wondered do we need animals to have meat one last piece it's yours wild type isn't yet letting cameras inside the lab where it grows the salmon because the process is still in development instead arya explained how it all works so the first step for us was to basically isolate the cells wild type got the cells from coho and chinook salmon the cells go into a steel tank like the kind you'd see in a brewery with nutrients like sugars and amino acids the tanks have the right temperature ph and oxygen level for the cells to grow and replicate the same way they would inside of fish but what comes out afterward still looks nothing like a piece of salmon that's where something they call scaffolds come in so if the product is going to be a block of salmon we'll create scaffolds that are those same dimensions and then the cells will grow into those dimensions they also help the cells mimic the textures of muscle and fat the cells attach to the scaffolds and grow into a shape similar to the salmon fillet you would buy at a store and that over time becomes the final product the growing process takes four to six weeks compare that to the roughly three years it takes to raise farmed salmon if it's still hard to wrap your head around how this is possible you're not alone arya and justin introduced us to adam tortosa a restaurant owner and chef he works with wild type to test how lab-grown salmon looks tastes and feels in real dishes it's just crazy that they're growing sam and me to be honest he says it finally looks and feels pretty close to the real thing i think if you like blindfolded me and like had me cut i couldn't tell the difference this one i would dip in the soy sauce but it wasn't always this way they walked into the restaurant and brought prototype one it was kind of wet salmon jerky maybe now he says even the taste is close it has the same mouthfeel same fattiness of course we had to try it for ourselves the flavor was mild but it really did have a texture that was close to salmon i would be happy to serve it to guests right now adam's restaurant is the type of place where wild type hopes to see its salmon one day when you go to the sushi bar you're sort of in an exploratory mindset the idea was if we're going to introduce a new way to make this product why not introduce it in a place where people are already kind of seeking out a new experience the company decided to focus on raw salmon for its initial product launch when we decided this was the way we wanted to go we had a lot of people on the team thinking like couldn't we start with something a little easier because it was very audacious somehow when i make cut rolls they look not as good as this i can never get it quite right like you can taste oceanic notes not the sort of like funky fish flavor these fancy dishes are hard to eat from right this is just one starting point for the wide variety of different flavors that this product is capable of but there are still two big problems the first is that it isn't even legal to sell cell cultured foods in the u.s that's because the fda is still figuring out how to regulate foods that are made like this and that process just takes time right to share how the technology works and just get the people who oversee the safety and security of our food system very comfortable with our inputs our processes but it's unclear when the fda will make a decision we hope it'll be soon the second challenge is cost a couple pieces of nigiri these days would probably cost 40 or 50 bucks ballpark that's the production cost which means if they started selling it right now the cost for consumers would be even higher nobody's ever created and scaled a company like this before and we're trying as hard as we can to move that along but but it is really hard wildtype says as they scale up the costs will come down but building large sterile facilities is expensive and some journalists who have covered the industry like joe fassler say we shouldn't expect labs to create competitively priced products anytime soon i think the more realistic voices i talk to in this space understand that it may be decades before these products are anything more than a novelty for the wealthy it's a challenge that doesn't seem to have scared investors away wildtype recently raised a hundred million dollars with reported investments from some big names like leonardo dicaprio and jeff bezos even though a survey of u.s consumers showed that only 19 were eager to try cell cultured foods this is new zealand farm salmon it's what we use in the restaurant in san francisco this is the wild type salmon i think lab grown meat at the moment is incredibly divisive there are some things that really recommend it and there are some things that you know are potentially drawbacks and there's also just a lot that we don't know arya and justin say they don't expect lab-grown salmon to become the only option our goal is to provide a new source of fish to take the pressure off our oceans lab-grown salmon is still a long way from that goal but i think at the end of that road lies very nutritious very accessible foods that are built on 21st century values [Music]
