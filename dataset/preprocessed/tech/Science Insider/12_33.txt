oh my god earwax is completely normal but it can become troublesome and that's when you might want to consider a procedure like this one i'm katherine schuster bruce a journalist and doctor working for insider and i'm going to watch some earwax removal videos yeah i think that is quite a big overreaction to how much pain or how uncomfortable that actually is ready so you can see here they've got a speculum and that is something that they use to keep the ear open so they can see the earwax as best as possible so earwax is completely normal and you should really only be having a procedure to remove it if it's causing you problems like hearing loss earringing a funny sensation in your ear if you're feeling like the world is spinning or if it's stopping things like you getting a hearing aid fitted for example [Music] so the tool to remove the earwax depends on where in the ear the earwax is how hard it is or how soft it is and how big it is so here you have a hooked shape instrument and that can be used to scrape the ear wax off the ear canal a bit like sticky toffee or fudge guide so there's two types of earwax the oily one which is softer and easier to get out and the dry one which is harder if you've got the hard type of earwax it might be worthwhile using some olive oil on your ear to soften the wax and then come back for the procedure so this hoover-like device is the micro suction and that is used to remove the earwax and you can use different tips on the end so you can use a smaller one to actually get the wax off the eardrum so you're more likely to get earwax if you're older or if you've got a small ear canal but there's also things that make it worse like using q-tips or earbuds this looks so crazy oh oh sorry as with any medical procedure there are some risks to be aware of so if you're getting this done you should stay still and let the person doing it know if you get any pain or changes in comfort so ear wax is completely normal it protects and it lines the ear canal and it also has some mild antibacterial properties because it's slightly acidic so it's made from dead cells some substances that come from the glands in the air and also some dirt and some dust so the person doing this procedure doesn't need to be a doctor but they should have the relevant qualifications so have a look before you get it done having this procedure done does remove the earwax but it can come back if you continue to use things like q-tips
