this glowing goo is lava but it's obviously not from a volcano the tilt furnace is really the statement piece of the whole operation it can hold hundreds of kilos of lava and execute experiments about viscosity morphology structures and formations when we jump it out here is about the meter that falls from the spout to the trough and through the trough we lose about 275 degrees fahrenheit by the time it hits the end we want to be at 2150 fahrenheit and that's the magic spot for the lava researchers are looking for that sweet spot between 1600 and 2200 degrees the range for natural lava knowing the lava's temperature at what time and where is crucial so the team has an array of 10 digital cameras to capture 3d images of the flow and a thermal camera which can read up to 3600 degrees fahrenheit
