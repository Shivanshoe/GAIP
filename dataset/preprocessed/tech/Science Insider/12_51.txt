hi my name is steph spears and i'm the co-founder and ceo of solstice and i'm cynthia morelli co-founder and chief operating officer at solstice and we are reshaping access to clean energy [Music] we live in a world right now where solar is cheaper than fossil fuels and if people could just get access to it they could save on their utility bills most americans cannot actually put solar on their own home and community solar is this idea that you can buy a portion of a neighborhood shared solar farm and switch to solar that way so the biggest preconceived notions that people have about going solar is that it's way too expensive or it's way too complicated and what we're trying to do at solstice is tackle both of those misconceptions more than half the country doesn't have that high credit score which means that we are locking them out of the clean energy market so we created the energy score there was a paper published last year that showed that our energy score is more accurate at predicting whether people will pay their utility bills on time and it's more inclusive of low to moderate income americans the product that we built makes signing up for community solar incredibly simple and by doing this you're helping to support more local clean energy helping to decarbonize our grid and you get to put a little money back in your pockets one of our most exciting partnerships was with a small town in upstate new york we've enrolled their residence into a local community solar garden and through our community wealth building program the town was able to raise enough money to invest in motion-powered solar lights good technology is crucial for our work lives because we run a software company as the nature of our work changes and people are operating more remotely we need to make sure we have the most portable tools in order for our team to be successful and productive i personally really love the touch screen on the x1 fold and the fact that it can fold into a very portable device in my job i'm traveling a lot and so it's really useful to have a computer that can either be a tiny laptop or a big screen so i think we have actually very similar work styles and we follow similar approaches with the rest of our team in startups there's an overemphasis on the founders and there's an overemphasis on financial capital but there's not enough of an emphasis on social capital and building your network around your mission and so a lot of what we're trying to do is put the community in community solar [Music]
