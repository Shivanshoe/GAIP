welcome to insider and cop 26 accelerating action to combat climate change presented by deloitte here's our host business insider leadership correspondent marguerite ward hi i'm marguerite ward correspondent at insider it's an honor to be your host for today's event insider at cop26 accelerating action to combat climate change presented by deloitte in just a few days global business leaders and policy makers will convene for cop 26 the 26 united nations climate change conference and the stakes could not be higher scientists confirmed in the latest ipcc report that the world is falling behind in the race to combat climate change insider in partnership with deloitte is here to talk with a few key people leading the charge for change in the u.s and beyond we'd love for you to be a part of the conversation by using the hashtag insider at also you can submit questions for our panelists through the dashboard at the bottom of the screen we also want your feedback so in the dashboard you'll see an icon for our survey you can take it at any time during or just after the event and now i'm delighted to introduce my guests jennifer steinman leader of deloitte's global esg marketplace valerie smith chief sustainability officer at city and charles argbone iii climate activist author and sustainability and social innovation strategist for deloitte welcome i want to start with you charles back in 2008 when you were just 12 years old you founded greening forward which would become one of the country's leading youth dr youth driven environmental organizations now you consult with companies on environmental practices what's your message to the attendees of cop26 feel free to be as broad or as specific as you want yeah so we've been having these conferences for so many years now right and the message has always been the same as we need to act quickly for climate change we need to mobilize resources to solve this pressing issue that is so interconnected to many other issues that our society around the globe faces i think what's really important is that we start to bring people into the conversation who don't know what cop26 is right who don't know a lot about climate change or how they can make an impact i think sometimes even maybe the people that are listening might understand the lingo sometimes of like what we're going to say on this panel but i think really our challenge is really getting out the word and the message to people who are not traditionally engaged in these conversations because we're going to need a greater pool of support to really mobilize effectively around climate change absolutely jennifer you're deloitte's global esg marketplace leader going off of what charles just said tell us briefly what is esg and what is an esg marketplace and how does it help us fight climate change thanks for the question and i agree with what charles just shared as well esg stands for environment social and corporate governance and actually putting those three things together is really important in the context of the work that we need to do to help affect climate change and so um when we think about it from a marketplace perspective that's just a designation uh from within deloitte that focuses on what we're doing to serve our clients so i serve our clients in the marketplace around esg awesome and what's your message to cop 26 attendees i do agree with what charles just shared and just thinking about the topic broadly it's really the defining issue of our generation and there is no single company industry individual that can solve it alone and so i think that the big message is that we need to come together we need to work together and take immediate action it's important for businesses and governance to work together it's important for us to think about things differently and start to develop processes where we can really accelerate the impact and summits like prop 26 are really critical to that and moving from commitments also to action is really one of the key things i think coming out of cop26 i love that moving from commitment to action valerie you're the chief sustainability officer at city helping one of the world's most important financial institutions become more sustainable same question what's your message to cop 26 attendees and how do you think it will play out yeah thank you marguerite and it's great to be here with all of you and um you know i'll echo what my my fellow panelists have said um the i think the first message would be the urgency that um i think we all see and feel on a daily basis now i think the second message would be you know on the on the action point that the private sector and civil society are really coming to glasgow in mass in force you know to showcase both commitment and action it's really important that we also know that we're there to support the very difficult negotiations that will be happening um you know cop 26 first and foremost is about negotiating some of the you know the details and ratcheting up commitments from the member countries and i think as we look at the commitments that you see coming out of the private sector the urgency that we see coming out of all sectors including civil society we know that we really need enabling public policy and leadership from governments to provide the the environment where these commitments can be can be achieved where we can you know ratchet down emissions and and um you know landed a 1.5 degree global warming situation in 2050 so i think the fundamental message is that um we need to be here to support and create the urgency for for government and the negotiators to get the job done at cop26 valerie do you think this year will be different from previous years you know as we started talking charles mentioned that we've been having these conversations for years now you know climate change the climate crisis isn't new how do you feel about this year particularly well i think apart from the fact that um you know what we've learned recently from the most recent ipcc report from climate scientists you know the urgency i think is real and is you know felt across sectors now but i think also what we've seen is the incredible groundswell of commitment so you see um you know many companies obviously cities in this mix as well making that zero by 2050 commitments committing to transition our own businesses and alignment with where climate science tells us we need to go and i think that um we've really seen over the past two to three years this significant shift and i think it's a significant shift in society and it's a significant shift in the business community and i think that in this crazy way covid and the tragedy that you know continues to be experienced from covid has really been an accelerant for um climate change and for climate action this sense of nature being out of control of the need for collective action to really solve you know these huge societal problems whether it's fighting covet or fighting climate change i think that that is another piece that to me feels new and different and has resulted in a whole new level of commitment in action right during covid as it continues you know thousands of people were quarantining social distancing at home and so you had that moment where people could really reflect and see the news see what was going on in the environment across the globe and in the u.s jennifer before your current role in esg you were deloitte's chief transformation officer leading strategy and innovation your role and job was to tackle big problems and prepare for the future how are you applying that same mindset problem solving to your job today you know it's interesting as we looked to define what transformation was for us at the time we decided to study what other companies were doing and so we did a bit of a back of the envelope exercise and looked at 37 companies that were in various stages of transformation and what that suggested was that you transformed from a position of power meaning the time to transform is not when your organization is facing challenges it's when you are on an upswing and so you know clearly the question around climate uh is posing challenges to all businesses and how they reflect and think about creating sustainable futures but i think the way we looked at transformation the way i apply it to this role is how can we help organizations uh actually move ahead uh based on a position of strength so that's that's one thing and then the the second area is really thinking about how you organize around that transformation and so looking at it from an end-to-end perspective thinking about navigating pressures such as investors the regulatory environment government how consumers are interacting with the organization the increasing pressures from different stakeholders including internal stakeholders looking at it from a holistic perspective and thinking about how that transformation is most affected uh is really important in this question as well jennifer i love that um you bring a really holistic perspective like you just mentioned you're working with some of the biggest fortune 500 companies to get them to buy into esg to push them further how are you feeling right now are you feeling hopeful about the future working with these clients do you feel that there's a lot to go is it a mix if i think about where we are right now i'm really encouraged by the commitments that we're seeing many organizations make and i think val is alluding to this as well there's a groundswell of activity and so that's incredibly important and one of the things deloitte does episodically is a climate check survey and our most recent one we looked at 750 executives globally and we saw through that survey that 60 percent of them believe that we're at a tipping point with climate change and despite the economic downturns that we've had as well as the pandemic 25 of those executives are planning to accelerate their climate actions and so i think that's really important in terms of the positive side of what is happening and what i i believe is um is important to the question the the however is that uh we we really need to be accountable for those commitments and i think forums such as cop26 can help press the accountability and put in place more structure around how we go from those commitments to the actions to we take to measuring those actions and the impacts that they have valerie i'm going to turn to you in just a second but charles i'm really curious you bring a really interesting youth perspective you've been in this movement for years with greening forward you created a blueprint for companies to follow do you think that cop26 will capture the youth urgency here that's presented so so yeah so i started yeah greeting for that helps young people take action against environmental issues in their communities but no longer do i qualify as a young person by the un's definition um that you have to be 25 or under um so i devote my time to uh really supporting young people who are at the forefront of this movement and i think that's one of the very actionable ways that everyone listening and everyone that's involved in the climate movement can really support our just transition is really looking to young people and empowering them what does that mean that means thinking about where you donate your dollars to and giving them directly to young activists thinking about where you volunteer your time and thinking about youth driven organizations that need your help and your support and your mentorship because i don't think that young people have to wait until they're experts to be um invited into the conversation the fact is that the reality exists now that like they're living in a world that is has a very uncertain future and we can start preparing them for that right now and i think the messages we've heard from young people are not new um greta tunberg really shocked all of us and we were all mesmerized but severan suzuki said the same thing in 1992 and we don't have a lot to say about like the different like that there's not much that's changed the situation has worsened and so it's going to take um giving up a lot more of what what we've already what we already have to really achieve that and so you know i appreciate what one of my fellow panelists said earlier about like corporations taking action and wanting to accelerate their impact but i would just challenge like how do we quantify that um because i think there's more that we could be doing so you're really saying to encourage corporate leaders ceos to invest directly in youth activists exactly valerie you've been in sustainability for years growing if you will with citi for several years now so you've seen what it takes to to make big change inside corporate america what's something corporations in general are doing really well right now and from your perspective what's something that needs to change a great question so yes i joined city in 2004 into the sustainability function and have really you know been able to grow and grow with the program and have seen such a significant shift over the past i would say you know two to three years as i mentioned earlier both in terms of how companies like the caliber and ambition of the commitments that companies are making but also the way that companies are reorganizing themselves so you know for example city has restructured some of our key business units to be focused on helping our clients to transition using banking and advisory services to help to finance and facilitate those transitions i think you know to sort of build on the point that jennifer made and you asked around um you know what should companies be doing more of well i think we do need more commitments from more economic actors we're really just at the tip of the iceberg in terms of the types of commitments that we need from the public sector as well as from the private sector but then i think you know digging into those commitments and this is work that city currently has underway what does net zero emissions mean for a bank well it means you know net zero operations we have about 7 000 facilities in 97 countries that's a big exercise in and of itself we're targeting 2030. it also means net zero emissions associated with our financing our core business and that really means helping our clients to achieve net zero with us it's a massive exercise around measurement around quantification i think you know charles would probably agree with me that there's incredible demand including from youth to have companies present their information about you know be really transparent about how they are you know what progress they're making even where it's harder than expected because this is very hard work that we're all engaged in and embarking on so i think what i would what i would ask and recommend is ambition combined with um i think honest commentary around how hard this is what the challenges are and importantly like really importantly continued engagement and transparency um it i think in this moment where we're all working on business transformations as jennifer said it feels um so tempting to take this off into a black box and you know work it but i think to to really accelerate our progress we have to be working it while we are sort of inviting you know others to be on this journey with us whether it's our clients our our stakeholders i think your point on transparency is so important i come from a diversity equity and inclusion background in my reporting so i report on how companies are transforming dei and making companies more equitable i think we have the same issue with climate change and the climate crisis companies need to get comfortable being uncomfortable sharing their transparency data around this is where we're at in terms of emissions fossil fuel partnerships and so i think we're going to have a lot more uncomfortable conversations valerie do you think ceos are ready for that i think this is such a great point marguerite and in fact well i think speaking generally the business community is getting ready for that but speaking specifically to city we have you know in our ceo jane fraser has specifically said we need to get comfortable with this uncomfortable disclosure around you know continuing representation goals diversity goals um you know the pay gap analysis that we've been publishing for a number of years now which i think has really you know both been a beacon for becoming transparent with uncomfortable information as well as action plans for improve our performance and we've really taken that to heart i think with regard to our climate transparency as well so you know first of all getting very comfortable with the data and understanding where our business is today and then being willing to be transparent around you know where we're headed and some of the big challenges ahead of us as we move toward our own net zero commitments so i definitely see you know obviously there's a ton of connections in the climate change space um with social issues and you know climate change really is a people issue um but i think also we can learn a lot from some of the progress we've made in recent years in the dei community and movement and apply that to some of what we have ahead of us in the climate change space as well exactly that was the next topic i wanted to talk with you all about how it's a people topic a people issue charles in addition to being an environmental consultant and expert you're a black man who is also openly queer how does your identity shape your work and how does that shape what you're telling companies um about how this crisis is not just an environmental crisis but a humanitarian one sure yeah i like to say that i'm not a tree hugger i'm a people hugger i think that really as far as it goes with climate change um the earth will still be here even through climate change and the catastrophic disasters that human beings are contributing to um it's really our own humanity that we're really fighting for here and climate change is going to be some calculus of mitigation adaptation and human suffering and how we act today is going to tip the balance on which of those are we going to experience more of and that experience is not going to be equal across different communities as well we're going to see that communities of color low-income communities communities that have been marginalized are going to experience climate change and the worst effects of it more so than other communities i'm able to see those interconnected systems and how justice is really needs to be a part of all of these conversations yeah there really is an intersectionality that ceos need to talk to talk about and confront there's so much data that shows that the climate crisis is and will impact historically marginalized communities like you just said do you think business leaders are really getting that that the climate crisis is inextric inextricably linked to dei and human rights not necessarily because the corporate community is still trying to get its head around dei as a concept and now and also climate change and i think it's it's it's there's some inertia in putting those two ideas together absolutely jennifer what's what's your take on that you consult with so many companies every day you know starting with your last question around how the conversation has changed and then leading into this question around um equity i think they're they're intertwined and both val was saying it in the context of the experience at city this is really complex and it took us many years and it took each organization many years to get to where we are and then we're trying to figure out what to do and in a sense you know what does a commitment mean for my organization uh for my industry um then you know how do do i even have the data that i need to be able to look at this problem do i understand it and then what do i do about it and at what pace how quickly what do i need to do in order to make sure that i honor those commitments how much change where is the change most impactful all of that's really complicated and then you layer on top of that the fact that we're still trying to actually properly define what equity means in the context of corporations properly measure that as well and set objectives that were transparent about and to charles's point you put those two things together and it's it's really hard to do and i i very much like the notion of us not setting an end point this is going to be continuous transformation and also being very systematic about when we make certain commitments not to isolate them and part of this is we compartmentalize in organizations that's a natural thing to do but we need to get much better at putting things together and from an equity perspective as we think about the transformation that organizations need to undertake in order to honor those climate-related commitments not to limit it at that but to also think about the unintended consequences and what our roles and responsibilities are and have that be within the scope of the discussion as well not something we do later once the action's been taken and going back to a point you just said i think is really important to have these conversations intersect so it's not just a chief sustainability officer working in a silo but it's that person communicating with the head of diversity equity and inclusion communicating with human resources to enact policies is that sort of what you were alluding to absolutely yeah absolutely yeah valerie city recently saw jane frazier take the helm as new ceo as you mentioned on her first day she announced the company would achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its financing activities by 2050. give me a little insight into what it's been like working with and for her how has she shifted the conversation well it has been really amazing i think to see both institutionally the build up to that announcement to have jane fraser decide to make this her day one commitment and then i think importantly to see how that leadership from jane really galvanized the company um i mentioned earlier i alluded to some reorganization that we've been doing um and it's partly designed to break down these silos so you know just sort of focusing on our banking teams for a moment we created about a year ago now a sustainability and corporate transitions team which is focused on advising clients and advising different industry groups of bankers on how clients should begin to think about transitioning from a climate perspective also from a broader esg perspective more recently we took our businesses focused on energy power and chemicals combined those teams into a group that is now focused on natural resources and clean energy transitions with the understanding that transitions for you know power companies might mean transitioning to more renewable electricity generation transition for an energy company could mean you know for an oil and gas company could mean looking more like a power company this is all part of the same value chain and we really need to think about it holistically i think the other the other change that jane's leadership is bringing about touches on not just the ambition not just the net zero commitment the commitment to really work hard with others in our sector to help to define what net zero means for a bank we joined something called the net zero banking alliance which was being put together and gathering up members in advance of cop 26 to put out the guard rails here's what net zero for a bank looks like here's what good targets between now and 2050 look like for your emissions associated with your financing so we are all learning how to count to report to measure this information real time it's important for tracking our progress and so i've really appreciated you know under our new leadership building on past leadership definitely this dual focus on commitment but also on the hard work and the transparency about what we're doing to get there there's no doubt that addressing the climate change crisis is going to take a lot of hard work and time here's a question i do want to ask for all of you and i'll start with you valerie how do you respond to critics who are saying you're not doing enough or you're not doing enough quickly enough how do you respond to that just because there's there's lives at risk here it's a great question and um it's probably the most challenging question that we receive because on the one hand we you know we've we've set out our our high level ambition we're working on our you know targets and milestones for getting there how do we demonstrate that we are helping our clients to transition i think this is a really important topic and it's really hard to communicate because we do all feel the urgency and so really what we're doing is you know again start with the high level ambition determine through engagement with our investors with stakeholder groups what are the proof points that we need to demonstrate as a bank that we are making good on our commitment that we are making progress and so really what i what i ask for when we engage with with you know communities and individuals that are asking us to you know move faster is i explain what we're doing i explain our commitment to transparency you know we have a long track record in the sustainability space working on environmental and social issues more broadly we are building off of that track record we're not starting from scratch and um you know we will be pr we will be publishing and engaging along the way i think that's an important part of the conversation that we'll be continuing to have at cop26 as well here's what we're doing here's how we're doing it we will be continuing to report on our progress through engagement we're getting smarter about how to do that as well jennifer i'm going to toss the same question to you how do you deal with this urgency with critics who say that consulting on esg might not be enough i think the way val decomposed it makes a lot of sense to me and the way we've approached it at deloitte is as a first step really taking a look at ourselves and so we've made some very public commitments and also very transparent about where we are in our own journey and that really helps create a degree of empathy as we have conversations with our clients and trying to help them uh succeed in this journey as well and i'll give you a couple of examples of what we've done so we've put in place training for all of our professionals we've got about 345 000 professionals worldwide on climate and if you think about that from a bottoms up and a next generation of leadership perspective that is really the intention behind it is to get this whole generation of future leaders educated so that it becomes ingrained in what they do on a day-to-day basis and how they help serve our clients it also gives them a sense of power in the sense that they know what actions they might be able to take individually to have an impact as well because their impacts at multiple levels personal professional organizational government society and so all of those things are really important to this and we are then also collaborating similar to what val described with city we're collaborating with vendors that we use and in helping them figure out what to do and holding them accountable potentially for encouraging them educating them and helping them think about establishing science-based targets as well so we can do more we should do more we will do more but i think this the the groundwork for that is there and the intention certainly is there as well absolutely uh charles i spoke with klaus schwab the executive chairman of the world economic forum earlier this year he told me that he's cautiously optimistic that this point of the climate crisis will yield innovation in technology and policies do you agree are we in a period of innovation or is it crisis sometimes innovation is the child of crisis and it's really up for us to choose it's as simple as that yeah um jennifer what's your take on the next five years with regards to the climate crisis are you hopeful are you worried um or are you somewhere in between like charles just said i think that's a fair uh categorization and somewhere in between hopeful because there's so much activity and i do believe that there's a lot of innovation in particular as we look at the role that technology has played and can play going forward there's a level of complexity associated with making this happen both in terms of the commitments that organizations make and then how we follow through on those commitments and so the part of it that i think is is important and we've alluded to in this conversation is that we need common frameworks definitions and we also need global solution for standard setting um and the accountability aspect of this and the need for transparency that we've already discussed so from a deloitte perspective we look at the ifrs which is the international financial reporting standards foundation and the work that they do and helping support what would ultimately be a common set of standards i think that's going to be really important as we move forward i think you both bring up really crucial points that innovation can come out of a time of crisis i think we witnessed that wouldn't you say back this past year and a half with kovid and as it continues as well as with the black lives matter movement we saw a moment of crisis after the murder of george floyd we're in a crisis point with with the ipcc report the world is literally on fire um valerie would you agree that innovation can really come from this time um and and how are you a part of that i do agree that innovation can come from this time um i think you know the climate movement can be a a tough place right there is a lot of gloom and doom associated with climate and you know the facts in front of us are pretty dire however i think there are you know i think that this is this is an optimist's place right like working on this agenda um whether it's from deloitte's vantage point charles vantage point cities vantage point um you really need to lean in with hope and optimism and i think there are really a couple of areas that give me hope and i i do agree the youth movement looks different from the past and i think has such a clarity a voice that that gives me hope the technologies that we need to solve climate change are all with us today they're not all commercial but we know what they are and there are a few even lingering in the side on the side that um you know could rapidly scale up so i think that what gives me hope is that we have the tools available we just need the collective commitment to really ratchet those tools up to scale that technology you know city has some substantial commitments in this space we have a one trillion dollar sustainable finance goal a big piece of that is focused on environmental and climate solutions so you know how can we collectively first of all have the the policy ambition that really creates the infrastructure for us to have that technology rapid scale up to solve the climate so solve climate change and i think it's so important that you three are coming from different vantage points but you have a common goal and you have so much power in terms of the technology and the suppliers and the partners you work with do you think there could be a ripple effect and i'll point that to you to you charles do you think there could be a ripple effect of cop 26 really dialing up the heat and creating those changes for other companies possibly i mean i also kind of want to respond to valerie's point about like the youth movement being different um and i and i think that's related to this question too because i i'm not quite sure that the youth climate movement is really different um i do think that what's different is that we're paying attention to young people and young people's voices differently and i think that that is related to how much of a crisis we're in is i think we're at a place where we're where we're desperate and hungry for optimism new energy new voices and i think that that has allowed us to be more open to what young people are saying today which young people of every generation have always been saying um and i think that the ripple effects that you're speaking of marguerite are also possible because as we recommit ourselves to solving the climate crisis we'll also realize the necessity of working with partners and creating some of those um ripple effects i love that and the partners include youth activists right yeah indeed um jennifer is there one thing you're looking to come out of cop26 is there a specific policy proposal or plan that you're looking at i think when i think about a successful cop 26 um we definitely need to see more formal decarbonization pledges and commitment to action by the biggest emitters both businesses and governments and then um commitments to finance poorer nations transitions away from fossil fuels i think that's really quite important uh coming out of this and from a delayed perspective given our work in this space we're hopeful that we start to see more standardization around how we think about esg metrics and bringing that to the forefront so that we have something consistent comparable um is a critical part of how we look at evaluating corporate sustainability and progress globally and the cop 26 delegates i believe can play a really significant role in globally issuing these metrics and it's my hope that when we start to have this commonality around language around definition of what success looks like around how we're going to measure that we will then be in a better position to look at the data and the insights coming from that data and then to the to your last question that allows us to then come together and actually create more innovative solutions to tackle some of these biggest challenges absolutely valerie what are you looking for specifically from cop26 well just to build on some of the comments that were just made by my fellow panelists i i think of cop 26 in three phases and the first is the acceleration of commitments from companies from countries that you're seeing in advance of cop26 events like cop26 are very helpful deadlines for all of us we all are good at working toward deadlines and i think some of the recent activities and commitments you've heard from different um participating countries is a great start in terms of that ratcheting up of ambition and then when we um when we arrive at cop26 i think one of the most important areas that we'll be looking at is around the point that jennifer made around climate finance the world made the commitment in 2009 at cop15 100 billion dollars a year in climate mitigation and adaptation finance from developed countries to developing countries i think this this commitment is really central to continuing to have the the buy-in and the action from the developing world which still needs to develop while also protecting themselves from the worst impacts of climate change and then sort of to the ripple effect question that you mentioned earlier i think what we can expect and hope to see following cop 26 sort of this third piece is we've had these commitments we hopefully will have this galvanization galvanization at cop26 in terms of the you know the will to do even more action how does that flow through how does it flow through the global economy the commitments that banks are making that investors are making flows through to their companies how does the commitment you know and the action taken um with with the youth movement with civil society how does that flow through to communities so i think these ripple effects after cop26 will be equally important to what's happening now and what we see at the actual event and charles same question what are you looking to come out of cop26 specifically focused on the youth movement yeah a re-commitment of resources to youth driven environmental movements that means young people who are who are at the helm of leading the environmental movement there are so many examples out there i think i think there are famous people that we become really fascinated by but a lot of young people in in local communities even are taking action against climate change and some of the organizations you might be able to find through greening forward wonderful i want to have another broad question before we turn to q a despite recent gains in energy efficiency and cuts and emissions the united states is historically the biggest gas emitter on the planet how are you changing the national conversation on the climate crisis um jennifer i'll start with you it's hard for me not to look at that question globally so i'll sort of answer starting there because i do believe that as we look to tackle the problem even in the united states uh that we can learn a lot from what's happening around the globe and we actually have um at deloitte deloitte climate deloitte economics institute that has been working on publishing a series of papers around the globe called the turning point and it's reports that are geography-based um the one on the americas is coming up it hasn't yet been published but coming soon and it really seeks to look at the importance of taking immediate and aggressive actions by government and businesses alike and what we are finding all of this data driven with a significant amount of primary research behind it is that the cost of inaction is significant and then correspondingly uh the opportunity associated with action back to your first one of your first questions around transformation is also significant so our european report which is just launching this week found that acting now to address climate change europe stands to increase gdp by about 730 billion euros by 2070 and our asia pacific report which launched in august had even more staggering uh findings revealing how the region could gain 47 trillion u.s dollars any economic value over 50 years and so as i mentioned our us report and our america's report is coming soon but part of the role that i think an organization like deloitte can play is really shedding light on some of the opportunity associated with action as well as the cost associated with inaction and we do quite a bit more but taking a really data-driven approach is one of the things that i think will help drive change in particular in the united states awesome now it's time for our audience q a let's kick it off and load up those questions our first one coming in is about corporate greenwashing it says that corporate america's actions according to this user are feel-good responses to public pressure and potential misinformation especially misinformation sometimes from the oil and gas industry how can we push these actions beyond the feel good and into the do good valerie i'll start with you on that one yeah i'm happy to take this and i'm glad that the question was asked because i know that the while the topic of greenwashing has been around for a long time it is now such an incredible area of focus and i think is useful in ensuring that we are all holding ourselves and companies are holding themselves accountable for making good on their commitments and so i think what i would say is there's been you know such incredible activity and attention in the esg and especially the climate change space that is now starting to settle from commitments to action and so my response to the you know questions around greenwashing that i think are very fair it's really similar to the responses to some of the the previous questions and the key points that you're hearing during this panel you have to follow your commitments you know make your commitments with ambition follow those commitments with engagement hard work and transparency and to build on jennifer's point disclosure and disclosure where it's you know easy for investors and the public to understand the progress that companies are making and compare them to others climate change is about innovation but climate change disclosure shouldn't be about choosing your own adventure we do need i think a common template for disclosure disclosing our progress our metrics as well as disclosing our ambitions yeah charles i saw that you were you were nodding your head um do you want to tackle the same question on greenwashing i think you come from a really interesting perspective of being an activist of being connected to those youth activists but also working with corporate clients do you feel that we're moving past greenwashing what's your take one of the really cool roles of nonprofits is being able to mobilize people around causes and really bring awareness to issues that even governments and businesses may not be prioritizing and so i when i think about the ecosystem of like non-profits and government and business and how we all play different roles that we need to work with each other that sometimes business can um operate at a larger scale and faster and sometimes governments also need to create the policies that make businesses operate at that bigger scale sometimes there are businesses that are just as big as governments in some instances but governments and businesses can create abuses against our environment against people and non-profits can really alert us to like what what that is and really mobilize um communities and whole nations around a better solution and so i think that we just have a lot more access to information awareness transparency which does help identify those green washing moments easier thankful for not many non-profit organizations for for i like to think that they're partly responsible for that they're largely responsible for that in many cases so i i think corporations are also learning that they have to be more careful in what they say because people are listening people are watching exactly people are really listening the next question is about the key challenge to achieving low carbon sustainability jennifer do you want to address what is a big problem in achieving uh or a key obstacle in achieving low carbon sustainability i think we've alluded to this in the in the conversation that we've had so far it really is around setting those objectives and tackling the issues across a whole constellation uh and charles was just talking about the number of parties involved in in making it happen the solution to it which is really what we're trying to work on and help our clients with at deloitte is not unilateral in nature either and so we've been talking about a system of systems and the need to work together across multiple organizations collaborating across industry in a way that's not happened before working with government entities and charles's point taking note of what is happening in the nonprofit community all of those things together allow us to deal with some of the biggest challenges associated with decarbonization absolutely let's take one last question and let's see what's coming through let's see this one's an interesting one do corporations have a responsibility to push for government policy on climate change often you know this conversation is uh the other way around government uh encouraging corporations what about the other way let's start with you charles do corporations have a responsibility indeed i mean corporations have already elected to involve themselves in politics right like so i think there is a responsibility with that as well um and i mean corporations unfortunately are vested in a lot of the fossil fuel extractive economies that are going to delay our progress against climate change right just as corporations have embraced that sort of involvement and lobbied for that sort of economy that we're built upon i think corporations can also decide to flip the script on that and also take a different um path with investing in a more just transition and that also means engaging politically i mean there there is that we all know right there's building congress right now that in in the united states where we could have greater investment around climate change greater investment around transitioning our energy infrastructure and that is all vulnerable right now we may not get that investment and i would like to see the corporate community actually take a bigger involvement in that i think that's a really important message to end on thank you again valerie jennifer and charles and thank you to our presenting partner deloitte i personally found this conversation not only incredibly informative but inspiring we learned about what leaders need to do to help abate the climate crisis how companies can be more inclusive in their environmental policies and what a successful cop 26 actually looks like these are topics we'll continue to cover at insider so be sure to follow us and remember to share
