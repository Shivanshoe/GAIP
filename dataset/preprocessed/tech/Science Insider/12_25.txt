turbine blades have been piling up in landfills in recent years that's the problem the company veolia set out to solve the blades come from all over the u.s to the town of louisiana missouri here workers cut them down before sending them to the shredder this machine is powerful enough to crush the 20-foot sections into pieces roughly the size of a football then the blade chunks go to another shredder that grinds them down even more next a sorting machine filters out any remaining large pieces violia also recycles non-hazardous medical waste and some of that is mixed in with the blade material cement factories burn the turbine blades for fuel violia says their product burns cleaner than coal it probably won't make that much of a dent in the cement industry's carbon footprint but it still prevents the blades from ending up in landfills
