sex position matters so that is a myth ivf guarantees pregnancy oh boy it's a tough myth for patients to hear eating pineapple can increase fertility oh that's a good one pineapple by itself if you have infertility is unlikely to reverse your infertility i'm dr cindy i am a fertility specialist based in las vegas nevada and i work with patients who are seeking to boost their fertility preserve their fertility or build their families hello i'm dr sriram ella swarfu and i'm a urologist at ucla my focus is on reproductive medicine for men as well as individuals born with testicles such as trans women and today we'll be debunking myths about infertility tight underwear is bad for sperm counts so there have been a number of studies looking at this issue for many decades and the inevitable question is boxers versus briefs in truth it doesn't matter a whole lot and we know that if the testicles are a little bit warmer that they are more at risk of having sperm count issues or sperm motility issues which is the way the sperm move in the body but in general it shouldn't matter too much just pick what's comfortable if you're going to be going on vacation and using hot tubs every day for hours a day i would recommend against that if you're going to be trying to get pregnant because prolonged warmth and repetitive warmth affecting the testicles can drive sperm counts down and i have seen that in my practice sex position matters so that is a myth no matter what position you engage in if you ejaculate you have the sufficient propulsion of the semen to make it up to the cervix any way you do it and a number of people around the world have actually studied it and no one position has been proven to be better than another putting your legs up after sex can increase your chance of pregnancy that is also a myth long before i even understood what pregnancy entailed i was seeing imagery on tv and stuff of people almost on a handstand upside down i think the thought is oh we need to counteract gravity but the truth is you don't need to lay and sit upside down or anything like that ivf guarantees pregnancy oh boy yes that is definitely a myth and it's a tough myth for patients to hear the ibm does present the highest chances of pregnancy absolutely there are a number of factors that play into ivf success one of them has to do with the age of the eggs being used it also has to do with the quality of the sperm and the egg when they come together it has to do with the embryo that is ultimately formed it also has to do with the genetics of the embryo and the chromosome makeup but then on top of that it has to do with the womb in which the embryo will be placed and a number of factors are not yet fully known so we know the immune system plays a role diet exercise probably play a role but we're still investigating that so biggest thing to know is it's not 100 stress causes miscarriages i think we're starting to get get away from the term miscarriages we're starting to use the term early pregnancy loss is that right that's correct and i think it's because you know miscarriage also comes with certain connotations where blame is also ascribed and the truth is most early pregnancy losses there's nothing the individual could have done about it at all and so now we call it early pregnancy loss before the end of the first trimester versus second and third trimester pregnancy loss we do not believe stress causes loss i know in everyday common conversation people believe that we know stress can impact one's immunity but we also know that many people around the world across millennia have gotten pregnant and remain pregnant despite tremendous stress so we know it's not simply stress nowadays though we know the number one reason for pregnancy loss is chromosomal differences in the formed embryo and so that's called aneuploidy 67 of first trimester pregnancy losses are due to chromosomal issues within the embryo itself other reasons would be if the thyroid was not functioning well if vitamin d is low if there's a fibroid in the uterus if you have a uterus and you've had two or more pregnancy losses you should be evaluated for many decades we always expected that it would be the individual with the womb and the eggs to be the one that gets evaluated for a pregnancy loss now the tide is shifting and individuals who contribute the sperm are also being evaluated when there's a pregnancy loss in the couple there's emerging data that things like dna fragmentation where the dna that are normally supposed to be very tightly wrapped up in the sperm are somehow unraveled and might have little breaks in the dna strands and those breaks can contribute to the pregnancy loss freezing your eggs guarantees that you can have kids later myth and the myth is in the word guarantee if you freeze your eggs you can stop the clock and so you're basically freezing the youngest version of yourself at that point however there's no guarantee that eggs even when frozen will thaw and yield a lifeborn baby so it's really a conversation that needs to happen with your specialist based on your age based on your egg number not every egg that's thawed after freezing will survive the thought not every egg that is injected with sperm will actually yield an embryo not every embryo that's created meaning not every fertilized egg will ultimately form a pregnancy but on top of that affordability is an issue access to clinics that have great protocols and great uh success rates with their egg fars you really need a clinic that has a good track record of successfully flying eggs and having pregnancies from bod eggs peeing or showering after having sex will lower your chance of pregnancy by the time you even get up off the bed and make your way to the bathroom sperm have made their way up the uterus and are on their way to an egg and so that should not be a form of contraception now what can decrease your chance of pregnancy is if you're someone who douches after sex and so we strongly recommend against douching in general it doesn't work for your vaginal microbiome it doesn't work for your general health myths we hear the most sperm quality doesn't decline with age we have this term that we use a lot in medicine called advanced maternal age so there was not this term advanced paternal age but that is starting to emerge and there's a lot of data now that is showing that individuals with uh sperm that is older uh say in the fifth sixth seventh decades of life and beyond is more at risk of forming embryos that have chromosomal abnormalities getting exercise eating well are things that can improve the general biology of an individual certainly if it's good for the heart and it's good for the brain then it's probably good for the penis and the scrotum and the testicles as well we talked about egg freezing but sperm freezing has its role particularly for individuals who may not be in a relationship or may not be thinking of a family at this time but later on down the road they might want to produce a family it's impossible to get pregnant after 35. it is possible to get pregnant after 35 the truth is though that the chance of pregnancy progressively declines as the age of the egg increases and so you might find greater and greater need for fertility treatments but when you're born if you're someone born with ovaries you'd have somewhere between 1 million to 2 million eggs in those ovaries usually by age 30 70 of those eggs are gone and by age 40 97 of those eggs are bond at the same time those eggs are also aging and so what we see is that the chance of pregnancy declines very quickly and then for some people it declines even faster so if you have endometriosis if you're someone who's maybe had surgeries on the ovaries or needed to be on medications chemotherapy radiation all of those things can also further the decline in the egg number so my recommendation is if you have ovaries at age 30 you should at least be asking your doctor to do a check of your egg number or what's called your ovarian reserve the best way to get pregnant is to have sex every day it comes down to the ovulatory cycles and making sure that your you're sort of timing things and tracking things particularly if you're trying to conceive deliberately we always get this question and i want to know what your thoughts are should the couple be trying to conceive every other day during ovulation or every day during ovulation i say every other day and it's because one we need to give the sperm and semen enough time to sort of re-accumulate so we can get those millions of sperm in the ejaculate so that's the first thing the other is sperm healthy sperm actually survive in the female genital tract for up to five days so once the egg is released from the ovary think of the fallopian tube as an arm with a catcher's mitt at the end the catcher's mitt captures the egg pulls it into the arm and then the egg sits around there for 12 to 20 hours waiting for sperm and then if you have intercourse anywhere within the next 24 hours sperm will also get to the egg so that's why we say every other day around ovulation so what that means is if you're someone who ovulates on day 14 you should really be trying to have intercourse starting day 12 then day 14 day 16 i usually say go out to day 18. there is this movement now particularly on the internet discussing what's called abstinence from pornography masturbation and orgasm or pmo it's also a movement called nofap and those individuals say to have the best reserve of sperm or the best sort of power with erections or orgasm that they should conserve for days weeks months at a time this stuff is not scientific at all and in fact after a week of storing up this sperm may not necessarily be healthy you are most fertile 14 days after your period starts that is only true if someone has a 28-day cycle if your cycle is 35 days you're actually going to ovulate on day 21 if your cycle is 25 days you're actually going to ovulate on day 11 after your period for some people they ovulate on day 9 after their period if they have like a 20 to 23 day cycle so it really takes getting to know your body know your cycle track your cycle so you can truly understand your frequency for your cycle you can never have children after a vasectomy it is in fact possible there are a number of ways to conceive a pregnancy after a vasectomy the simplest way to think about it is to get a vasectomy reversal there are ways of getting pregnant after a vasectomy that don't involve reversing the vasectomy one of those ways is to go looking for sperm in the testicles or in the epididymis which is the storage organ behind the testicles that holds the sperm that can be as simple as a 10 to 15 minute procedure that's done in the office but that sperm will then have to be used with in vitro fertilization eating pineapple can increase fertility that's a good one pineapple by itself if you have infertility is unlikely to reverse your infertility we know that pineapples have bromelain inside of them which is a compound that is known to be a blood thinner to a certain degree but it's very very weak and you'd have to eat so much pineapple to even have enough bromelain to have a little effect but if you're looking to add it as an adjunct to your meals etc go for it you should be having a meal balanced in protein complex carbohydrates and fiber so getting your usual multivitamins and folate into your diet because folate is really important for once you're pregnant but technically no pineapple by itself does not boost fertility you can't have children if you're unable to ejaculate you can have children from your own biological material if you cannot ejaculate if the inability to ejaculate is a medical condition because of prior surgery or because of a medication one is taking or if they were born with that condition there may be ways of reversing that condition there are individuals who come to me who the problem is not so much ejaculation but the problem is erectile dysfunction for those individuals we can use medications there's injections there's hormone treatments there's a variety of things that can be done to sort of treat or cure the erectile dysfunction more common in my practice is premature ejaculation and there are different kinds of therapy different kinds of medication that we can try to prolong the ejaculatory latency time you can't get pregnant right after stopping birth control that is a yes or no it depends on the type of birth control so when we use the term birth control we're referring to tablets we're referring to injections we're referring to iuds once we remove the iud you can start working on getting pregnant the following month if you're someone who is doing the shot like the depo provera shot it can take up to a year for your ovaries to wake up and start ovulating again if you're someone who was on a progesterone only pill they're usually able to ovulate again within a month to two months of discontinuing if you were on birth control for an extended period of time or what we call the combined oral contraceptive pills it could take up to a year myths parents used to believe if you've already had children then you'll always be fertile that is a myth and in fact there's something called secondary infertility secondary infertility refers specifically to people who already were able to have a child without any difficulty and then later on go on to develop issues so we've talked about age related changes with sperm so just because someone with sperm has caused pregnancy before it does not mean that they cannot now have issues with their sperm in fact 50 of the time uh when we're seeing infertility it involves not just something with the person who makes eggs but something going on with the person who's making this work irregular period cycles are a sign of infertility i've definitely seen people who thought that because they were ovulating irregularly meaning irregular periods they didn't need to use birth control or contraceptives and then were quite shocked when they became pregnant and so it's important to clarify that irregular periods while they need irregular ovulation they do not mean absent ovulation there are other people for whom their irregularity literally means they don't ovulate ever and if that's the case then whether you wait a year or six months you actually need help from someone with that taking prenatal vitamins will increase fertility i know nowadays in the fertility space it's not uncommon to meet a person who's taking 10 12 tablets per day because they're looking for every tablet they can find that says may boost fertility but you can certainly try to make sure your body is in its healthiest state when you start trying we recommend one multivitamin for a menstruating person in part because every month when you menstruate you're losing blood meaning you're losing iron you're losing some other minerals and nutrients so having a prenatal that will have extra iron in it is very helpful to just help keep your pounds up and also once you become pregnant if you are trying to conceive your body has to share its nutrients with the pregnancy and so a prenatal vitamin helps when people talk about them they're really talking about them in the context of maybe improved egg quality in terms of looking at them uh under the microscope etc but the question as to whether or not it leads to better birth rates more lifeborne babies the jew is generally out of that from a sperm standpoint there's been some recent very highly publicized trials that have shown that supplements are not necessarily useful contrary to that however there have been some smaller studies that show a benefit in antioxidants in general for overall healthy living and so if you have a healthy lifestyle that will improve your sperm quality you should try for over a year before seeing a specialist if you're under 35 you should try for a year but trying is relative if you're someone in a partnered relationship and you guys have access to sperm and egg you've been having regular unprotected intercourse around the time of ovulation with regular periods and it's already been a year and you haven't achieved i don't think you necessarily have to wait a whole year before you come see someone like me um it's okay to come in and get things checked out if you're 35 or older if you haven't tried at all then try for six months and then go in to see a specialist i would also caveat that at 40 i wouldn't even necessarily wait six months i would go in no later than three months into trying if an individual knows that they're going to be trying to conceive or if they've been having in the couple unprotected intercourse for say a year or a year and a half and no pregnancy has emerged just walk in get a semen analysis see where you're at but ultimately it comes down to eat well sleep well and move your body infertility while a daunting thought really there are lots of options available the first step is actually an evaluation fertility and infertility constitute this huge spectrum and there are many many ways to get pregnant and many things one can do to help facilitate that and you don't have to stay at home feeling embarrassed about it if you talk to a specialist like myself like dr ellis who we are experienced with this and know how to treat you or direct you to the right person who can help
