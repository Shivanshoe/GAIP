wearing a mask will protect me from the virus the problem is that people who wear these masks usually don't wear them properly the corona virus came from bat soup that is absolutely not correct the corona virus was deliberately created or released viewing humans a little bit too much credit here hi I'm dr. Sara Madonna I'm the senior director of New York City Health and Hospitals system-wide special pathogens program I'm dr. Steven Morris professor of Epidemiology at the Melman School of Public Health Columbia University we're here to debunk myths about the corona virus let's get started getting the corona virus is a death sentence well there's a lot we still don't know about the corona virus disease but based on the data that is coming out it seems to be a mild type of viral infection there's a 2% fatality rate and about eighteen to twenty percent that maybe in kind of in the critical condition range and those two percent who died or the sickest they're in the hospital already so even those in the hospital have probably a 98 percent chance of surviving so it's not a death sentence I only Chinese people have the corona virus well it started in China but the reality is that it's everyone's virus and if it gets far enough just like the flu it could be anywhere infectious disease do not respect boundaries or borders and for that matter everyone is susceptible the corona virus is the most dangerous virus that is not true there are a number of different viruses out there in the world so let's just compare it to another type of virus so you have the Ebola virus disease which has a much higher fertility rate associated with it I think the official count is now 6000 recoveries but you know one of the funny things is that we don't usually report recoveries when someone is discharged from the hospital so all those recoveries probably there are many more on the way as well wearing a mask will protect me from the virus a lot of people like to think so and of course a mask gives you a sense of security but the problem is that people who wear these masks usually don't wear them properly they've never really been trained they may not know what kind of mask to wear so there's two types of masks one the simple or surgical masks that you see the general population wearing and then there's another type of masks that healthcare workers wear it's called the n95 mask and it's a respirator and it is able to filter particles that are airborne with 95% efficacy and the one that healthcare workers where they have to go through what we call fit testing and so to make sure they have a perfect seal people who may think they want to wear an n95 find it very uncomfortable after a while so even if it's well fit it's it's then especially hard to breathe through and the mask is really for those that are infected with the actual corona virus disease not so much for a healthy individual so things that actually proven to be effective is washing your hands often well you know 20 seconds as well as obviously if you're sick staying home so a number of other public health metrics that actually are proven to be extremely effective the corona virus came from bat soup that is absolutely not correct so what we know about the current corona virus disease is that it started in Hunan Province in China in a wet market or seafood market if you will where there's a number of different animals there so there's a couple of different speculations out there but not from somebody obviously consuming Batsuit but what we do know obviously is that once you actually get the corona virus disease the form of transmission is obviously through droplet spread so coming in contact with somebody that is thick with the corona virus disease close contact with them or you know contact with their droplets right shortly after you can get sick from a package sent from China I think it's really highly unlikely when you consider the time it takes for a package to get from China and right now what we do know is that obviously these droplets that can contain the virus or the virus itself it may not be able to survive outside the human body for very long so even if it may for example come on a package or a box depending on how long it's been there it may not actually be able to survive outside but we still don't know closing borders will stop the spread of the virus these types of respiratory viruses they don't respect borders as we know and it's not the fault of a government that this type of outbreak is starting or spreading it's just the nature of the virus itself travel bans historically have proven not to be very effective in fact you know it seems that it was the opposite they caused more fear make more chaos people were reluctant to actually come forward with actually reporting that they were that they have the illness a lot of it is perception and with travel bans a lot of it politicians particularly I hate to say like to do that because it gives the appearance of doing something but it is often counterproductive the federal government does state non-essential travel should be restricted obviously to mainland China that's the epicenter and that's where there's a lot of community transmission but outside of China where you may see there's over two dozen countries that actually are reporting to have corner virus disease but if there is no community transmission there is obviously nervous to the general public but continue to look at Centers for Disease Control's website they have a travel health advisory section and that you can actually go to and put the name of the country and it'll tell you the precautions and as well as go to your health care provider they can provide some travel guidance to you if you need to travel to various areas that may be reporting outbreaks of coronavirus disease the virus only affects older people well that's kind of half true it affects everybody even children the older people however are the ones who are more likely to have severe disease or more serious disease so all of us older people have to be careful but it affects everybody and even the older people most of us will probably not even be that sick the corona virus is the same as SARS so the corona virus is in the same family as SARS it's a corona virus disease there are two various and now three corona viruses known to cause more severe infections in humans SARS is one of them MERS which is Middle East respiratory syndrome is another one and now corona virus disease that just started obviously SARS was more severe in terms of the fertility rate that we that was reported so it's about ten percent versus with the corona virus what we're seeing right now is about two percent but still it's way too early to tell this one is different this spreads a lot more like the flu but there are so many more cases simply because it spreads so well so many more people can easily get infected large numbers of deaths doesn't necessarily mean that it's a very lethal virus it just means that a lot of people have been getting it and some of them unfortunately died let's just excuse north flu for example seasonal flu this year started in October and the Centers for Disease Control prevention are already reporting over 10,000 deaths you know related to seasonal flu and over again you know 20 million Americans being infected so let's just put things into context the corona virus has something to do with corona beer know and beer won't prevent it either so Corona simply lacking for crown and they have a crown like appearance with those spikes sticking up but the beer is all on its own at it won't prevent corona viruses won't give it to you it's just a coincidence my pet could give me the virus so with the corona virus still weed you know there's still a lot we don't know right now what we we haven't seen any cases where pets are transmitting the virus to their owners you're more likely to give it to your pet than the other way around take good care of your pads the corona virus was deliberately created or released viewing humans a little bit too much credit here so we basically had three corona viruses in three decades but we know that there are a lot of them in nature that look exactly like SARS and this one doesn't look special so this is just another one to add to the collection infectious diseases can be caused by a number of different things obviously they're natural in the environment it could be due to obviously climate change ecological factors agricultural factors human behavior and these are constantly happening around us so outbreaks are inevitable it could be very surprising that anyone would have figured out a way to create it we still are way behind nature and being able to do that antibiotics prevent and treat the virus viruses and bacteria or two different microbes so we would use antibiotics for bacteria for viruses we use antiviral medications and so for example with seasonal flu that's a virus and so one of the ways that we can treat or alleviate some of the symptoms is by giving Tamiflu that's an antiviral medication so antibiotics in this context for this virus do not work unless you have secondary infections that are bacterial in nature and this is a very common misconception there are a couple of drugs now that are experimental but they're in the development stage that are showing promise against this particular virus we're still in the early stages of the corona virus disease there's a lot of rumors things that are not factual so really go to credible sources go to public health websites that are credible go to the World Health Organization's website go to your local health department's website or even go to your healthcare provider to get more information if you're curious and if you want to read about all the emerging diseases everywhere in the kind in the world you can get on the promed website or even get email and I think there has been a lot of fear around this partly because we've heard of these other corona viruses like SARS but I think panic or fear is not really what we need these outbreaks are inevitable and we need to continue to prepare for these types of efforts we need to invest in global health security a best-case scenario obviously is that it all gets under control and hopefully we'll have vaccines and other things and have learned something from the experience
