flowers trigger seasonal allergies that's actually not true if you have a hypoallergenic pet you won't have an allergic reaction unfortunately there is no such thing as a hypoallergenic pet you can outgrow your seasonal allergies so there's no definite way that you can outgrow your seasonal allergies my name is dr weiwei lee i am a board-certified adult and pediatric allergy immunology specialist my name is dr pail gupta and i am also an adult and pediatric triple board certified allergy asthma and immunology doctor and today we'll be debunking myths about allergies if you didn't have allergies as a kid you won't get them as an adult so that's a myth you can actually develop allergies at any point in your life especially now with people moving to different locations the change in climate location or sometimes adopting a new pet can increase your risk for developing allergies right so it's any new exposure essentially can cause your system to start reacting and develop an allergy i've also had at the reverse i've also had people who have lived with cats and dogs while they were children and then they decide to get a cat or dog as an adult and they're now allergic and so your immune system is constantly changing and so you can develop an allergy at any time you should only take allergy medication once you feel symptoms so that is a myth so if you wait until your symptoms get super intense and super severe then it'll be that much harder to get those symptoms under control so it's a good idea to start early like if you have pile analogy in the spring i usually say have the patients start pre-medicating with anti-histamine nasal spray or eye drops before the season starts i usually recommend as soon as they start seeing even a little bit of the pollen that they're allergic to especially severe seasonal allergy sufferers we have them take them even two weeks in advance just so they get used to taking them the timing sometimes can change from year to year depending on the weather so you can use the timing from last year to make a proximal guess to when you can start pre-medication tree allergies are mostly a springtime allergen grass allergies are for summer and weed allergies are in the fall so for people who have tree grass and weed normally it would have been maybe from like april until september that they might have had symptoms but now we're seeing even as early as february especially and then the weed allergen kind of ending as late as october november and patient asks us is it safe to take the medication every day i would say if you take the medication according to how we recommend it it is safe and effective and it's important to know that when you take your medications such as a combination of oral antihistamine and nasal spray together every day achieve a better efficacy than taking it sporadically only when you have symptoms flowers trigger seasonal allergies that's actually not true pollens from flowering plants are not the main contributor to seasonal allergy symptoms in order for pollen to cause allergic symptoms they need to meet three criteria they need to be small they need to be light and they need to be dry to be carried by wind so the pollen and flowers is actually large and it's distributed by insects and so that pollen is not in the air which means that it doesn't get into our eyes and nose however for tree pollen weed pollen and grass pollen because it's light and because it travels in the air more easily then it can get into our eyes and nose and airways more easily and because it travels at least around 50 miles that means it might not be a tree in your backyard it might be a tree somewhere far away that you're reacting to but i do hear that every year a patient coming and saying that this is the worst allergy symptom that i have compared to the past so i think that has to do with a number of factors such as climate change and also planting particular type of tree in certain location can increase the symptoms eating local honey can help cure seasonal allergies that is a myth because local honey contains pollen collected by bees so those come from flowering plants we mentioned before pollen from flowering plants are not major contributor to seasonal allergies and also we don't have a lot of studies done on the effectiveness of local honey so we cannot know for sure how effective they are in treating or helping to cure your seasonal allergy symptoms but i love honey because i use that to help with allergy symptoms such as ichi's scratchy throat so i have no problem recommending using honey as a way to soothe your throat your symptoms but i would not say it can cure seasonal allergies she nailed it hopefully i can do that every time if you have a hypoallergenic pet you won't have an allergic reaction so that's a myth so unfortunately there is no such thing as a hypoallergenic pet a lot of breeders will claim to have hypoallergenic pets but unfortunately there is no hundred percent animal without any dander the pet tender is the microscopic flex of skin that the pet shed so the same protein can be also found in their saliva so it's not the fur but rather the the shedding of the skin with their saliva it's important to know that even hair less stock can shed and that will contain some degree of allergens and so there might be certain breeds that people are less allergic to and that's all person-dependent so for example i have a cat allergy but there's certain cats that i do totally fine around and then there's other cats that as soon as i walk into someone's home and they have that cat i'll start reacting and so it is not just by touching or rubbing your face against the cat the dander is airborne so that can get into your eyes and nose and into your airways and start causing that ige antibody to react and produce that histamine which causes the symptoms frequent vacuuming is super important also air purifiers and so for somebody that really wants a pet or you know usually it happens the other way around is that they've already gotten a pet and they're not willing to get rid of it for those patients then we usually do attempt to do allergy immunotherapy and see how well we can control their allergy symptoms we don't have a test to test for particulation yeah we wish we did because if we did we would have a huge long line out the door of people wanting to get tested for particular breeds that they might be able to have in their home allergy shots don't work so allergy shots are immunotherapy and allergy shots actually have a lot of data behind them and they've been used for years and years and we know that they do reduce the not only the symptoms that people experience but also the medications that people are on and then there's also the allergy sublingual immunotherapy tablets that are fda approved so there's two different options and i just always like to mention that because some people are scared of shots i think there is this myth because people will misunderstood allergy shots as medication allergy shots are not medications they don't provide immediate symptomatic relief but see them as a way to naturally desensitize your allergens and to naturally develop tolerance you will still have to take your allergy medications such as antihistamine or nasal spray at the beginning of allergy shots to help you manage your allergy symptoms but over the long term allergy shots do work to achieve that natural tolerance you can outgrow your seasonal allergies that is not true because with your immune system changing sometimes your symptom can get better or worse over time so there's no definite way that you can outgrow your seasonal allergies sometimes people might have moved from the west coast to the east coast and all of a sudden they don't have those seasonal symptoms that they used to so they might say that oh i outgrew my seasonal allergies but it's really that they moved and that they're not exposed to the same pollens that they were when they were younger the most frequent symptoms that we see are symptoms of the eyes for example itchy watery eyes the nose can get congested you can have a runny nose itchy nose you can have a sore throat from post nasal drip and you can also have coughing wheezing shortness of breath if you have allergic asthma currently the closest cure we have for seasonal allergies is called allergy immunotherapy i think the important thing to remember with immunotherapy is that you have to be ready and committed for it for allergy shots you will need to go into the allergist office weekly for uh six to nine months and then it goes to monthly and we would say that you should continue your therapy for at least three to five years for it to be effective and then for the sublingual immunotherapy tablets it depends on which tablet you're going to start for dust mite immunotherapy tablets for example you have to take it daily and we would also recommend that you take them daily for at least three to five years in order to get the full benefit from them you can cure your allergies so we can't cure environmental or food allergies at this time we've come pretty close to environmental allergies but the reason is is that we haven't figured out how to definitively change the immune system's reaction to environmental allergens or to food allergens our environment doesn't stay the same all the time so with new exposure in our environment our immune system is constantly adapting to the new triggers in the environment so we can develop new allergies even if we cure the old allergies that's why i don't like to use the word cure because you can always develop new allergy symptoms after going through immunotherapy so once we have the allergy test results we always want to see what are your exposures knowledge is power so once you know what your triggers are there's a lot of things you can do besides taking medications their behavioral modification we always provide to our patient education what to do when you're allergic to certain pollen what to do during pollen season or what to do with pet dander dust mites we can help you to manage your allergies
