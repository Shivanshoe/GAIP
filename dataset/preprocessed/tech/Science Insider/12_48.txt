you have warts because your feet are dirty no no no no bunions are caused by wearing heels leave your stilettos out of this the stilettos did not cause your bunion cutting the sides of my toenail will prevent an ingrown toenail no absolutely not i am dr sarah holler i am a foot and ankle surgeon and i practice in new york new jersey i got into foot and ankle because i wanted to be a ballerina i wanted so badly but i was not that good so i ended up being a doctor instead and my feet definitely thanked me and i'm dr brad shafer i'm a doctor of podiatric medicine we treat everything below the knee and today we will be debunking all the myths about feet pedicures gave me toenail fungus i think yes and no i mean you can get fungus from anywhere you can be in a carpet so i can't prove that it's not gonna happen here but i can't prove that it will either i definitely take precaution when i go to a pedicure salon i bring my own nail polish and if this is part of your self-care ritual don't stop going but at the same time just be cautious that's all you can get toenail fungus from anywhere pedicures are safe if they're done in a safe sterile environment they do clean their instrumentation they have these sanitary bags that go inside of the the bathtub soaks that should be changed out between every person that comes through so they do take precaution but at the same time again anywhere there's a a warm hot moist environment it's like a breeding ground for fungus cutting the sides of my toenail will prevent an ingrown toenail no absolutely not when you cut your nail you're supposed to cut it straight across so when you do that the nail doesn't grow in to the corner creating an ingrown which can create infection and a lot of pain so what everyone thinks sometimes is that they got the actual nail around it it'll grow out around it that's not true because the actual nail matrix where the nail grows from from behind the actual skin it actually grows as a square you only see the rounded part so by actually cutting it how you want it to grow it's not going to change the actual root of it and how it's meant to grow right i couldn't agree more what's going to cause ingrown toenails is your toenail so when that gets cut too short it grows right into the corner of your skin it's like a little pin once that starts penetrating the skin it creates an infection pus swelling redness not a good look it hurts so just cut them straight across you'll be in the clear this is one i know i get all the time oh gosh all right you have warts because your feet are dirty no no no no you do not get warts because your feet are dirty warts are a virus you get viruses from all kinds of things viruses can hide anywhere and they just lay on surfaces they can be on yoga mats any kind of exercise equipment pools gyms showers they're everywhere but don't be afraid live your life just make sure you wear those shower shoes wipe down your mats if you're doing yoga or in a gym and you know don't overly share your stuff if you look at your feet there are small cracks between each of these skin layers and you don't even feel them they're not bleeding they're not cuts they're just microscopic tears in your skin and that's how the viruses get in when you do get a wart you know which ultimately is caused by a virus that little wart can spread into a huge wart cluster that's why you want to get checked out to make sure that that little thing can be treated real quick when you come to our office we do an acid treatment and what the acid does is it really just eats down at the wart so it exfoliates out the good skin and kills the virus sometimes there's a surgery that's needed and you actually pair out the wart but if you get it checked early enough you don't have to do that and you can get it treated in one treatment i actually love this one so it's only athletes get athlete's feet that is a straight no so athlete's feet is actually a fungus and it's called tinnie of pedis right so when you have a fungus like that usually it comes from warm moist environments a lot of times in our socks and shoes when we sweat it's kind of like harboring like a little petri dish in there once all that gets in there it festers and it can create a very good looking environment for fungus bacteria all types of not good things that's why you're always told to change out your socks when they start getting sweated if you're just working and walking around every day your feet can still sweat too not just athletes have those warm moist environments everybody does so change out your socks change out your shoes use some powder from time to time that'll help too bunions are caused by wearing heels no absolutely not leave your stilettos out of this the stilettos did not cause your bunion mom dad grandma grandpa somebody in your family your family tree passed it down to you baby you were born this way a bunion and actually it's not a bump growing off the side of your foot which everyone seems to think it's actually a deformity being the bone behind your big toe is actually shifting from this straight up and down position and tilting sideways it's like the leaning tower of pisa right it's not the actual stiletto that's the problem it may be worsened by wearing the stiletto where it pushes on the bunion and makes it bigger but it's not actually caused by the actual shoe you're wearing so what i tell patients that have bunions that they want to wear a cute stiletto maybe go a little bit lower so i recommend something where your actual bunion can maybe come out the side of it you can definitely support and help bunions right but they're not just going to go away they will develop throughout time and unfortunately sometimes get worse you know as we age there's no way to get rid of a bunion without surgery those things out there called yoga toes or like toe spacers are out there to help us but when you remove them not doing much good are they they're kind of like eyeglasses they only work when you wear them very true my feet are fine because i trained them to walk in stilettos i think yes and no i mean i don't think they're good for you but i definitely think you can train your feet because you can get used to them so when you're wearing these things your heel is going here and it attaches to your achilles and that's what actually shortens as you persistently wear these over time your achilles gets shorter and shorter which actually causes a ton of issues with the front of your foot that inserts down here this is where the ball of your foot is and that's where all of the pressure goes to five little bones in the base of your foot so i do think you can kind of train your feet to walk in stilettos but in no way shape or form is it good healthy or give you longevity like a valet shoe you know you're gonna park you're gonna get out somewhere you're gonna walk for maybe two steps and sit down that's a great shoe but other than that not a long-term shoe you can't do anything for a broken toe myth we get this question all the time oh my gosh and it's frustrating when you have a broken toe that's a bone you broke a bone in your foot right there's definitely stuff you can do for the broken toes with a toe it may not just be a simple fracture where the actual bone is cracked you can actually dislocate it which basically means not only is the bone crack but the ligaments are actually loosened up so it pops over to the side you need to get it popped back into place and then it needs to really structurally be supported by the other topos item otherwise it can re-dislocate and cause major issues down the line so it's really important that you get your toes checked out if you think you may have fractured or even bumped it wrong you see black and blue you need to go in and have it buddy taped basically when the toes can get taped together your doctor will teach you how to do it so you can safely heal it takes four to six weeks for a bone to heal so you better just get in there faster then i just start healing in a natural process so it doesn't have to be reset again it's normal for your feet to hurt from standing all day it is not normal my feet kind of bark at the end of the day especially when i'm in surgery for a long time but ultimately you know we have you know tips and tools where your feet should not hurt at the end of the day supportive shoes compression socks inserts all of these things can help prevent fatigue you know we have to support our arches i mean they are critical for the stability of our feet you have 26 bones and over a hundred ligaments in the foot there's a lot that can go wrong with our feet appropriate shoe gear is the key none of these like flimsy shoes in the office anything with a good sole and especially with a little bit of a higher heel like so you have like the nice support under your achilles i think really makes a big difference especially if you're standing or walking all day all inserts are the same you've got this a lot absolutely no my foot is way different than dr brad's foot we wouldn't need the same insert and i'm sure your foot is different and everybody has something else going on so just getting you know an over-the-counter insert for some people is okay but sometimes you need a custom one right i mean i couldn't agree more so if you look at my shoes i just wear an over-the-counter insole these insoles have nice arch support these are game changers and other people they have bigger problems so they need custom inserts and those are called orthotics and those are absolutely amazing too so it really just depends if you have victoria arthritis if you have arthritis in your midfoot it helps a lot of arthritic conditions which you may think is an old person thing young people can get arthritis too so orthotic can help anybody young too old if you have really flat feet as a kid those are really important to help stabilize the the growth plates as the kid is growing sprained ankles are no big deal false thank you yes i agree dude we get this a lot in our practice when you sprain your ankle there are so many things that can go wrong so there are three ligaments on the outside of your ankle and when you roll it they basically blow out so what you have to do is you have to stabilize that ankle so the ligaments hold in a natural position other than that it'll just grow back floppy and scarred down so that's not going to be good for anyone you're not going to be able to play the sport that you love so whenever you roll your ankle you have to stabilize it so it heals normal yes when it sprains you also run the risk of the bones hitting into each other so then that can cause cartilage damage cartilage damage is a really big thing because it happens and then you don't follow up you're prone to early onset arthritis and arthritis is in no way good if i can walk after an injury i don't need to see a doctor false absolutely false just no no no this is not true so i had a patient come in last week he fell off a porch while he was hanging out with friends but he broke his ankle and had no idea he walked on it for two weeks when i showed him the x-ray he was flabbergasted he walked around for you know a week and a half without even knowing that he broke it there's also a lot of patients that we see that don't necessarily feel their feet like diabetics out there sometimes you get stuff called neuropathy and that can be tingling numbing burning sensation in your feet and you just don't feel those injuries so it's important to just get it checked out by dr sarah or i and we'll tell you if there's any cause for concern we debunked a lot of myths here we went through a lot but definitely change your shoes regularly make sure that you you know don't share shoes with each other trim your toenails appropriately and go and get things checked out don't wait until the last minute because it could be broken even if you're still walking on it let's check my feet yeah i mean okay get flexible what yeah i mean it's kind of that's pretty close it's more impressive than i thought oh my gosh it hurt my hip come on you need bug in these myths
