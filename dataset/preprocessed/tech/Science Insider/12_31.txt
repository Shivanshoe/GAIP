flying doesn't affect your body it does autopilot flies the plane for you no it does not it is more dangerous to fly during the night than the day now it's the same hi my name is captain zoya and i'm a commander on the boeing triple sevens with indian flag carrier air india and i have been doing this for the last well 17 years i'm raj lakshmi ishwar people call me raji my first officer on boeing triple seven with our national carrier air india and today we are going to be debunking myths about flying bad turbulence can crash a plane not true so chances are the turbulence that you're going to face on your flight is not going to crash your airplane a lot of times how the turbulence happens is there is a wind shift the change of wind direction and or speed that's what destabilizes the airflow which is what causes turbulence we are well prepared to avoid these circumstances first of all we on ground go through all the papers and the research required to avoid them we have the weather reported to us we have radars on board which kind of depicts on our screen that there is turbulence this way and you may get it and even if we do enter some turbulence we can always slow the aircraft down these aircrafts are structurally built to withstand such turbulence so more often than not the turbulence that you encounter is probably just mild and something that you're going to sail through in just a few minutes so long as you stay seated put your seat belts on stay calm breathe in breathe out you'll be fine lightning can bring down a plane no i know it sounds scary right lightning there are occasions that there could be lightning around but the aircrafts that we fly these days are structurally built to handle these lightnings and we have static discharges and various other things that just discharges any lightning that could possibly strike an aircraft so that right there is a meth cabin air will make you sick does it cabin air will not make you sick we have air purification through hepa filters on board that air is continuously recirculated which is mixed with the outside fresh air it's going through various filter various status before it reaches you so at any point in time you're breathing in fresh combined air probably one of the other thing that you're confusing is motion sickness or altitude sickness but it's not the cabinet so watch your food intake please be hydrated and you will be fit as a fiddle flying doesn't affect your body it does have you gone on these flights and then you come land and then you're like so exhausted and dehydrated i wonder all the time all the time so yes flight does affect your body let's start with the dehydration bit right your aircraft there is pressurized and it is pressurized to an altitude between 5000 to 9000 feet it's not natural to be at such an elevation for a human body and then secondly the aircrafts do feel pretty dry in the air what you're dealing with is very very dehydrated air the humidity levels of the air is extremely low and also you know when you're in the airplane taking those 16-hour long flights chances are you're gonna have coffee and alcohol perhaps which is going to dehydrate you further secondly you're also sitting down for a long period of time and you have limited space and that kind of reduces the airflow in your body which is why we're always encouraged on the flights to move around every now and then to increase the blood flow in your body the best thing you can do is hydrate yourself and maybe get up and stretch a little bit your body will definitely re-adjust once we land so don't worry about it it is more dangerous to fly during the night than the day no it's the same the only difference is that during the day we have some visual references which probably makes us feel slightly more comfortable but with the instruments that we fly day or night makes no difference typically as pilots we fly instrument right rules which means that we have predefined routes so we don't require any visual references in the night we have the route data which we put into the flight management system and pretty much guide the aircraft through the route we ensure that whether it's day or whether it is night those air outs are followed to the t flying is more dangerous than driving no no no no no no is by far one of the most safest means of travel if you ask me we follow high standards of safety everything from the get-go the aircraft is maintained with safety in mind pilots are trained with safety in mind air routes are planned with safety in mind imagine a million miles of air travel and not a single accident now imagine a million miles on the road do you think it'd go on without an accident no no no right i guess there must be something right yeah so flying is i think way safer than something like crossing the road it's super super safe everything is based on passenger safety that is a priority autopilot flies the plane for you no it does not there are so many times i'm with friends and they're like you have an autopilot right it pretty much does your job you're pretty much sitting back and relaxing while your autopilot is doing your job we control the autopilot we tell the autopilot what to do we give all the commands for it what altitude to fly what airspeed to fly what route to fly we are right there monitoring every single thing and the purpose of the autopilot is to reduce the workload of a pilot so the pilot can think on the bigger picture thinking about what next can we do to make the flight better in every single way pilots must have perfect vision no perfect corrected vision that's something we need you must see plenty of pilots with glasses on right even if you have spectacles on as long as it is 20 20 vision it's all right i have six by six she has six by six which is 20 by 20 over here over here but by far so long as you have corrected vision um well you can totally fly yes pilots all have parachutes under their seats no we don't only the uh fighter airplanes yes yeah like not the commercial ones what we have is life vests which is same as every other passenger on board pile of sleeve for most of the flight yeah we don't have that choice like really we don't i mean except if it's like a long-haul flight and you have multiple crew when the flights are very very long that's when you are given your designated dress and which you must rest which is what exactly we did yesterday from delhi to new york we flew almost 16 hours yeah on the other side of the world when you're doing such long flights uh you do have multiple set of crew two captains to first offices what normally happens is there is one set of crew that sits on the control in the cockpit while the other two goes into the bunk rests up so that when the first set of crew is tired we come and replace them and we sit while they go sleep because it is humanly not possible to be attentive for 16 17 hours straight staying awake through a flight will cure jet lag no no no it does not in fact it'll worsen what i have discovered in my career is there is no cure for jetlag there is no shortcut for jet lag you know i've been asked this question so many times oh you must be a pro at handling jet lag no you never pick up a pro and handling jet lag i wish i did you can minimize it by resting you can minimize it by staying fit hydrating yourself and the best thing to do is when you land back just try to adjust as much as you can to the local time try to eat at their times sleep at the times that's the best you can do but you have to go through the process sorry yeah all of us do after every flight it's just there and there is no escape i wish there was a magic potion though yeah i'll be the first customer so for people who are boarding an aircraft please don't be afraid to fly you are in hands of very well-trained crew pilots and the aircrafts are built to handle the stress so don't be afraid
