what people refer to as styrofoam is usually expanded polystyrene foam a company called renueva has found a way to make money recycling this cheap product workers first grind the material to make it easier to manage then they apply heat and pressure in a process called densification which squeezes out excess air leaving reusable plastic behind a machine heats the material and molds it into these spaghetti looking strips the company uses a chemical that's a bit like antifreeze to cool the strips and finally a machine dices them into rice sized pellets renueva sells these pellets to companies like marcos and marcos which turns them into frames the process is actually pretty similar to renuevas you heat the pellets mold them and then assemble and decorate the frames accordingly different companies use renueva's pellets to make heels for shoes and to make more foam [Music] renueva is working on making plates and cutlery but first it needs to make sure the recycled plastic is safe for food
