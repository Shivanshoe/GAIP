the ground can open up during an earthquake everything disappears in the earth earthquakes don't operate like that you should always try to get outside when an earthquake occurs in the midst of running you can get seriously injured california will fall into the ocean well the answer is of course not hello i'm veronica cedillos i am a structural engineer in by training i am currently president at geo houses international my name is gerardo suarez i am a senior scientist at the institute of geophysics at the national university of mexico today we are debunking myths about earthquakes and earthquake safety these are myths from social media doorways are a safe place to take cover during an earthquake and veronica i think you're better prepared than i am this is uh definitely a myth something we've heard from i think past very old construction and that was when the frame around doors was actually part of the skeleton of the building that really kept up the buildings was a really strong part of the structure modern construction does not have that in fact the doors are not in any way stronger so they're really not helpful or very protective during earthquake shaking and in fact i would say that holding on to a door frame if you have a swinging door during strong earthquakes you can actually get quite injured there's no universal recipe to be safe it depends on how your house your apartment building is built and where you live even in what part of the city you live in the work has to happen before the earthquake in terms of finding a safe place create a safe place so trying to figure out okay if there was shaking looking up in your own home and seeing what could fall over or topple that can be heavy this question is about the triangle of life will it save you you can see some of these voids after the shaking has happened but what you don't see is what happened in between and so it may have been that this very dense object with strong shaking might have moved quite a distance or those objects can actually topple and in many cases can actually be way more dangerous to be there if you could get under a sturdy table or that would probably be best protecting your head and neck are really important but yes there may be some cases where people were saved because they accidentally were trapped between a very strong object and perhaps a beam or something that fell down but i think it is more circumstantial evidence than anything else earthquake proof buildings are indestructible i want to make a distinction between earthquake proof and earthquake resistance so in practice we don't usually design or build earthquake proof buildings so a similarity might be waterproof versus water resistant and i think for a very long time we went from really trying to ensure that our designs were life safe so they really were protecting the occupants inside the building um now what we've learned as we've seen earthquakes in other parts of the world that doesn't mean that you're not going to have damage to a building and so it may be that after an earthquake your building no longer functions so you can no longer stay in it and if that happens on a grand scale all of a sudden you have an entire city that can't be housed or buildings that can be used for businesses and so it really affects the economy and the communities as a whole and now there's a big movement to try to move towards designing not just for life safety but actually what's called functional recovery with the idea that you can recover in a shorter time span small earthquakes prevent bigger ones from happening well i i bear bad news for people who believe in this because uh you know people do say oh it's been very active you know lots of small earthquakes so they're taking up the energy that's concentrated on default and indeed yes they're releasing some energy and that happens in places that we call subduction zones where one tectonic plate goes under another one that there are dozens literally hundreds of small earthquakes in a certain time frame in a certain place but eventually in these active faults you will have a major earthquake and by major i would just say larger than magnitude 7.5 that is required to release the energy that has been accumulated i think there's a misconception that it's only the very big one that's going to be the most dangerous but in fact what we see is that even with moderate earthquakes there can be a lot of actually injuries and death even unreinforced chimneys we know are very vulnerable to collapse and under very low levels of shaking and those falling into a household for example can be very dangerous we are overdue for a major earthquake so when we say overdue we imply that we know the earthquake should have occurred before and it hasn't and this is uh something that we simply do not know prediction versus forecasting i think that's where we get a little bit of misunderstanding because we can forecast usually improbabilities we said there's a probability that there'll be this size of earthquake within this region and so we really can't predict specifically where and when something will an earthquake will occur everyone who lives in a seismic area should be aware everyone should have a kid at home you need to have some water you need to have a lamp light and so on and so forth okay these are myths from pop culture you should always try to get outside when an earthquake occurs but for the most part it's really this is probably not a very safe practice to run outside during our place shaking especially because many times things can fall outward in the midst of running you can get seriously injured in the one situation where it is a good idea and that's an adobe urban building that is not strengthened um or reinforced in some way those buildings are particularly dangerous when you have a heavy roof if you're on the ground floor one of these buildings you do want to try to run out assuming you're running out into a space that's open but if you're already outside you know stay outside kind of you want to try to get away from from building facades because there can be bricks falling you want to be very careful about that the ground can open up during an earthquake it is a myth that has to be debunked this myth comes very much from earthquake movies where you see that during the earthquake there's a big crack that opens and it swallows buildings and people are cars and then it just boom it shuts tight and everything disappears in the earth and this this doesn't happen earthquakes don't operate like that in certain type of soils cracks are formed because of the very strong shaking but these are very relatively shallow cracks i mean they wouldn't swallow not even a small cat and probably that image was extrapolated into this fantastic idea of of these huge mouths swallowing everything in its surroundings so no the the answer is is definitely not in the u.s a big enough earthquake on the west coast could be felt on the east coast it will be so big that even though it's happening here in california you will feel it on the east coast no that is not what we expect it's just a big enough distance that we don't expect for anyone to feel any significant shaking on the east coast from a large earth on the on the west coast the plates and the type of rock that we have on the east coast versus the west coast they are different and so what happens is that the type of uh rock that we have on the east coast the earthquake wave seismic waves can actually travel much further so what happens is that in the east coast you'll be able to perceive or feel significant shaking actually much further distances from the um the epicenter of the origin of work where the earthquake shaking started as opposed to the west coast where those sex make waves actually that energy is absorbed much quicker and so it doesn't travel as much of a far distance we are able to predict earthquakes this is a very simple answer it is no no we cannot yet predict earthquakes and i added the word yet i wouldn't say that now it continues to be the goal of seismology to be able to predict earthquakes i believe the goal of everyone who works in seismology or in engineering seismology is not to predict earthquakes but to be prepared for major earthquakes to understand the phenomenon there there are use of what we call earthquake scenarios um and what those are they're not predictions but they're incredibly useful in the sense that many times we don't see changes in codes or anything until after there's an earthquake and we learned everything that went wrong we use the tool of an earthquake scenario so we choose a believable earthquake that could happen in a certain area to try to understand what may be some of the key vulnerabilities around that particular city or area whether it's the water system or the housing or the hospitals um to try to get ahead and trying to instill safer practices or actions that will help us address those vulnerabilities before an earthquake or first myths expert here the most so in tall buildings it is always safer to be on a lower floor if you're in a tall building especially in a place where the codes are usually followed it's likely that they're actually under even a higher requirements in terms of design and so on the building is safe it doesn't it doesn't matter too much where you are that being said if there is more movements that's when there is really really important to make sure that the contents within your house or whatever the office building are secured and that they can't you know fall over and topple over and hurt you california will fall into the ocean well the answer is of course not you know california would not fall into the ocean part of california the westernmost sliver of california it sits on the pacific plate whereas the rest of california sits on the north american plate and these two plates move one relative to one another at a rate of about five to six centimeters per year so yes when people say los angeles is going to end up near anchorage well yes eventually but in many millions of years okay there is such thing as earthquake weather but no there is no season for earthquakes there is no weather for earthquakes and there is no specific time for earthquakes you might be thinking of a very very convenient time that an earthquake would happen it might be very inconvenient when you think about earthquake shaking you have to think about different times of the year and different times of the day you might be sleeping or it might be winter it might be raining and so the danger is that you're not thinking of kind of all these scenarios bigger earthquakes happen under full moons people connect that to the pool of tides and it's true we are very used to the ocean being deformed and the water level changing due to the tides depending on the cycles of the moon and this also happens in the earth the earth itself the continents themselves are deformed because of this rotation of the moon the deformation is not large enough to produce earthquakes and people have looked at statistics to see and there has been absolutely no correlation at all a lot of the actions that you need to take to really protect the community and to protect people need to be taken years before the earthquake actually arrives
