red wine is good for your heart okay actually this is the biggest myth of all time meat is a necessary part of a balanced diet this is a controversial one and i love this topic fruit is as unhealthy as candy if it's orange soda and snickers or an apple eat the apple hi i'm tamar samuels a registered dietitian and the co-founder of coolina health hi i'm vanessa rosetto and i'm a registered dietitian and co-founder of kalina health and today we are debunking 19 diet myths myth number one beans are toxic no beans are not toxic they have fiber they have protein they come from the earth i mean tomorrow i think this is just another way to like vilify carbs i think maybe people mistake a little bit of gi discomfort with toxicity beans as vanessa said are really high in fiber which is a good thing but a lot of people don't eat enough fiber and when you first reintroduce fiber it can cause a little bit of indigestion some bloating maybe some gas but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing it means that you should probably just start slower with a smaller portion and build your way up to you know a full cup of beans okay myth number two bananas pack the most potassium potassium is found in pretty much every fruit and vegetable also kiwis have the most potassium and that uh bananas thing is just like a marketing scheme from the 80s so they had like the chiquita banana and it was like get all your potassium from bananas delicious chiquita bananas are rich in potassium number three honey and agave syrup are better than sugar actually there's no difference right sugar is sugar is sugar ultimately the way that we process all of these simple sugars is exactly the same in the body although honey and depending on the type of agave may have a slightly higher nutrient profile so it might have a little bit more minerals than the sugar itself which has absolutely no vitamins minerals or phytonutrients myth number four fat-free foods are always healthy first of all everybody responds to different foods differently fat free foods can be healthy but a lot of the times they're not healthy often times when we take away the fat we take away the ability of the food to make us feel full and then we also add in things like sugar to make the food more palatable to make it taste better which can actually end up making the food itself not healthy at all it's not worth it just just eat the regular serving of fat and you'll be better off myth number five fruit is as unhealthy as candy fruit has antioxidants and vitamins and minerals and fiber which no one gets enough of so please eat the fruit like if it's orange soda and snickers or an apple eat the apple yes this myth is especially dangerous because i think people will equate fruit in that bad food category and then avoid it and they're missing out on a whole set of nutrients and then also tend to overeat candy so they'll say something like my doctor said that i have to be careful with the fruit that i'm eating because it increases my blood sugar and then they'll over eat you know chocolate at night myth number six breakfast is the most important meal of the day i think this myth can be harmful because for people who have all or nothing thinking they believe that if they don't get breakfast right or have a healthy well-balanced breakfast then the rest of the day is sort of ruined and they use that as an excuse for them to not make healthy choices for the rest of the day the reality is that every time we eat is an opportunity for us to take care of ourselves and eat a nutritious meal if you do not eat if you spend long periods of time not eating then your metabolism doesn't know to do its job even having like a small piece of fruit and like nut butter or nuts in the morning is just like enough to fuel your metabolism and get yourself going and likely making sure that you're not gonna overeat at later meals myth number seven you must drink eight glasses of water a day you know there's like these quick and dirty calculations that dietitians use to determine how much water someone should drink and so it's usually your weight in kilograms take that number and you would times it by somewhere around 25 to 30. it puts you somewhere in like a two liter range a day which i know can be scary for some people they're like i have to go to the bathroom all the time but spoiler wearing coved so drink the water and then you could train your bladder and you'll be right at your bathroom so it's totally fine but that helps you with your skin it helps you with your hair it helps you with your nails it helps you with fullness it helps you with digestion it helps regulate your bowel movement so water is obviously something we need to be doing and we need to be doing more of because people really don't drink enough water you can get water from other places so you can get water from teas specifically herbal teas you can get water from coffee but coffee is also a diuretic so you're going to sort of eliminate some of that water a little bit more than you would if you got it from an herbal tea that doesn't have that diuretic effect you can get water from soups and then most fruits and vegetables have a really high water content myth number eight you can't eat cheese if you're lactose intolerant this is a pretty dangerous myth because skipping out on any food group can be harmful for missing certain nutrients especially dairy products not all dairy products contain high amounts of lactose so people who are lactose intolerant actually tend to do well with cheese especially hard cheeses the soft cheeses tend to have a little bit more lactose in them yeah like parmesan cheese for example has no lactose in it also if you're lactose intolerant you could train yourself to tolerate 250 milliliters that's about 8 ounces of lactose you know the bottom line is you can eat some cheese even if you're lactose intolerant myth number nine red wine is good for your heart okay actually this is the biggest myth of all time i understand where it must come from right you know it's made with grapes grapes have antioxidants and you know they have flavonoids those tend to help with the heart so like that's fine and you know one glass of red wine isn't going to hurt you but out of like a 250 000 participant study about the effects of alcohol on the body there are no real benefits to alcohol alcohol the body sees as a poison the body has to do a lot of work and sacrifice a lot of metabolic processes in order to metabolize alcohol if you're looking to support your heart instead of picking up the closest bottle of wine think about ways you can incorporate more fiber more heart healthy fats and of course increasing your physical activity yeah you can't increase your physical activity if you're hungover from the night before and dehydrated yeah myth number 10 fresh produce is always better than frozen produce fresh produce is definitely awesome there's nothing wrong with having fresh produce but not everyone has access to fresh produce and the cool thing about frozen produce is that it's often frozen at peak ripeness so we can capture all of the vital vitamins and minerals and nutrients within the product without having to sacrifice sort of convenience for being able to store these things in our freezer myth number 11 you need to drink milk for strong bones again this is like the dairy council i don't know i'm like afraid they're like gonna come and find me milk is not necessarily going to help with strong bones you can get the same amount of calcium in a stock of broccoli as a glass of milk the reason why milk is so called good for our bones is because as vanessa said the calcium content but milk is also fortified with vitamin d which means that it doesn't naturally contain vitamin d most foods don't so one of the best ways that you can get vitamin d is by getting out there and getting some sun so actually getting sun might be just as helpful for strong bones and drinking a glass of milk if not more helpful myth number 12 probiotics are good for everyone everybody has probiotics in their gut already so when we talk about probiotics in a supplement form some people who have compromised immunity or who have certain gut conditions like small intestine bacterial overgrowth actually tend to do pretty poorly on probiotics for the vast majority of the population probiotics are good for everyone that doesn't mean you have to take a supplement you can definitely get it in food fermented foods like sauerkraut kimchi myth number 13 an apple a day keeps the doctor away well kind of i think this myth needs to be 10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day keeps the doctor away making the choice to have an apple instead of candy is a good choice and that is certainly going to help support your health but if the rest of your diet consists of mostly refined processed foods that are devoid in vitamins minerals and fiber then the doctor is still going to be an important person in your life myth number 14 cravings mean you're missing something from your diet there's certainly no science to say that if you crave x food then you need to have more of why food in your diet so cravings can come from a lot of different places but i've found that that's mostly from not having balanced blood sugar and from emotional psychological reasons you know the clients come in and they're like i don't need carbs i'm really good about not eating carbs but at night i eat an entire bag of hershey kisses you're like because you need carbs eat the carbs so there is a condition where people deficient in iron they actually create soil and clay it's called pica and so there is something there that exists around cravings for certain flavors i don't know why people want to eat dirt when they're anemic but that is something that is real it happens a lot especially with pregnant women myth 15 everyone should cut gluten out of their diets no if it bothers you then cut it out or if you have celiac disease then cut it out just the regular person walking down the street doesn't necessarily need to cut out gluten right tomorrow everyone's coming in wanting a gimmick yeah a lot of people cut out gluten and they feel better but that's mostly because they cut out gluten containing foods which tend to be unhealthy so i think people tend to confuse the benefits of cutting out those highly processed refined carbohydrates with gluten itself myth number 16 white potatoes are bad for you oh this myth is so sad so many people are missing out on delicious potatoes the potatoes are actually quite high in potassium and the skins of potatoes contain a decent amount of fiber as well white potatoes also have a good source of vitamin a so it's good for your eyes the serving size though is a half cup i think that's the other problem you think that the because the potato is purple or you know it's a sweet potato so it's like more complex and better for you like but the serving size really is half of a small one or half a cup myth 17 activated charcoal is a superfood what is even a superfood like everyone talks about these superfoods this is not a real thing also charcoal is not a food it doesn't have a nutritional value it's not something that we can eat and gain benefits from it actually passes through our body completely and if we have it in large amounts it can be toxic myth number 18 meat is a necessary part of a balanced diet this is a controversial one and i love this topic we do get a lot of nutrients from meat some of those nutrients we cannot get from plant-based foods or it's not as easy to get them from plant-based foods one of those is b12 so people who have a mostly plant-based diet need to supplement with b12 for the most part that being said we can absolutely have a plant-based diet and be incredibly healthy you can also have a plant-based diet and be unhealthy you probably shouldn't eat meat breakfast lunch and dinner you want to have some plants in there those are all like sensible things and also if you're 100 vegan don't turn your nose at me because i'm eating a burger but everything you eat is from by chloe because that's also not really healthy either myth 19 you shouldn't eat after 6 p.m remember oprah in like the 90s had she lost a bunch of weight and she was like i don't eat after six and then everybody was like don't eat after six you want to give your body time to digest everything should be metabolized by the time you go to bed so you can have a restful sleep there's no hard and fast rule that you need to stop eating by 6 p.m it's individualized if all else fails focus on the basics of eating more fruits and vegetables eating meals throughout the day that are balanced with proteins carbs and healthy fats and if you can start there that's a good place it doesn't have to be over complicated do your research make sure you understand you know all the facts presented and then at the end of the day just do what's right for you also ask like professionals not not the internet guys
