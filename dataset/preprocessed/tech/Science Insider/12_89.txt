Kovach 19 myths have spread just about as quickly as the disease itself but one myth in particular just won't go away that Tsarskoe v2 the virus that causes Kovac 19 isn't naturally occurring and was actually man-made in fact one substantial survey found that almost 30 percent of Americans believe that this virus came from a lab but scientists believe that they can confidently say that the virus wasn't created by humans and the myth going around is nothing more than that a myth so how do they know with such certainty the key is in the virus's genetic code this is the genomic sequence for Tsarskoe v2 it was decoded in January 2020 just weeks after the world started to learn of this novel coronavirus each of those letters is a genetic building block known as a nucleotide and when built up they form an organisms genetic code which we can use to understand them each organism has a different code and a varying amount of nucleotides a human has about 3 billion of them whereas a virus such as SARS CO v2 has about 30,000 your genetic sequence can give information about your hair I color sex and lineage and just like your genes give clues about who and where you come from scientists can use a virus genome sequence to help explain where that virus originated as well an ancestry test for viruses if you will we honed in on the parts of the virus that we thought were unique and it might play a role in the evolution of the virus but also in the pathogenesis of it and a couple of things get out really quickly when we started to pair with the other viruses that had come before that's Robert Geary a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University along with his colleagues he used the virus sequence to try and understand where Tsarskoe v2 came from they first looked at the viruses backbone that's the whole genomic structure unique to each virus like a viral template simplified the backbone for SARS Co v2 and it's 30,000 nucleotides looks a little bit like this each section is responsible for a part of the virus for example this one is responsible for the Spike proteins you may have seen lining the virus shell so it may not come as a surprise that to engineer a virus in a lab you would need to start with a backbone but to manufacture from scratch the backbone of a virus that can also cause disease is almost impossible I mean people just don't know enough about what makes a virus pathogenic to be able to assemble that how do you pick all the possibilities to get to that last little bit that's going to turn it into the worldwide pathogen which sequences you think about to put in there simply there's just not enough knowledge about how to make a new virus that would also cause significant devastation like SARS Co v2 has so creating a new deadly backbone is pretty much impossible but there is another way the novel coronavirus could have been created in a lab and that would be using an existing virus backbone or genetic sequence as a starting point with a recycled backbone two main methods could have been used to create the new virus they could have either quickly mutated it or added and deleted parts of the existing virus but additions and deletions and a virus leave a trace that can be pointed out pretty quickly a little bit like removing a red brick from a wall and replacing it with a black brick this is exactly what magic bony an associate professor at Penn State looked for you might see an insertion that looks unusual and you look out in nature and you see that no other viruses have genetic insertion like that we did not see any genetic insertions that also identified in nature so there's no evidence suggesting with man-made or laboratory created to mountain so what if they went with the other option and mutated an existing virus this is known as serial passage and acts in a similar way to selective breeding scientists are able to mimic evolution to a degree by forcing the virus to mutate over and over again into a potentially different form this can be used to weaken a virus which is how some vaccines have been made or to strengthen a virus say by making it more transmissible but for this to work the existing virus would have to show significant genetic similarity to the new virus in fact they would have to be almost identical because this process only speeds up viral evolution and has a limit it's not possible to direct mutations into a completely different form yet Gary and his team found that the backbone for Tsarskoe v2 was strictly unique differing significantly from other corona viruses for example Tsarskoe v the first SARS has only about a 79% genetic sequence match to Tsarskoe v2 so it's ruled out the best candidate is our ATG 13 a bat coronavirus with a 96% gene sequence similarity 96% sounds pretty close but in genetic terms that's actually pretty long ways away to put it in perspective humans and chimpanzees share 99% at the same genome and you may have noticed there's still a large difference between the two for Tsarskoe v2 and our ATG 13 that 4% is the difference of about 800 nucleotides or about 50 years of natural evolution 800 is too big a barrier you had something that was 99.5% of 99.7% similar maybe only 20 and 30 nucleotides you might get away with it you might be able to manufacture that but it just wouldn't be possible with current knowledge and existing viruses there's also another part of the gene sequence that helped Gary and his colleagues learn about the natural origins of Tsarskoe v2 in particular this set of nucleotides in the gene sequence you might remember those from earlier they're responsible for the virus spike proteins the pointy claw like arms the outside of a virus that give it its distinctive appearance and coronaviruses their name specific viruses including corona viruses use these arms to enter and takeover host cells but this piece of the spiked protein helped tell the researchers that this virus originated in nature this set of nucleotides relates to the receptor binding domain or RBD that's the part that latches on to the receptors on targeted cells as viruses can only survive when inside other cells this is a vital section that you would have to focus on if you were to make a virus in a lab Gary Anna's team found the RBD has evolved specifically to bind to the human cell a ce2 a receptor usually used to help regulate blood pressure but it's the way it so successfully binds to the AC e2 receptor that is crucial you see when a scientist tests what aspects would make a virus more potent they run models through computer simulations but when researchers put this sequence through those simulations they found that Tsarskoe v2s RBD shouldn't be successful at all and would actually cause poor efficiency and transmission which we know is not the case yeah by working in the lab working at the computer trying to figure it out I mean they just went down and come up with this particular way to have this virus buying good receptor a very important part of the whole replication process in other words if your goal was to make a virus to infect humans you wouldn't have chosen this one basically what nature isn't a solution for binding that is better than any computer and ultimately better than what any scientist would so we know why scientists confidently say Tsarskoe v2 wasn't made in a lab but that's not the end of the story it's also been rumored that Tsarskoe v2 was a known virus that was accidentally leaked from a lab now we can't say for certain this isn't the case but it's highly unlikely for one this virus wasn't sequenced before January 2020 and if it was the world would know because the Wuhan Institute of ayala G was specifically looking for something like this in order to protect the world from any outbreaks sorry Khurana buyers that with 76% similar to the original guitars one I mean they would have published that as fast as they could that would have been at least in the scientific world big news but it's also just statistically highly unlikely so just that in nature there means the people that are having millions of encounters with these animals and you know we're talking about a handful of you designate in the whole world scientists that go out and track that so just on the awesome of things it's just a miniscule chance that it was was one scientist that accidentally infected himself and that's very sophisticated laboratory setting so Tsarskoe v2 s origin is no longer a mystery but where and how it jumped in nature well that's a question many are still trying to answer
