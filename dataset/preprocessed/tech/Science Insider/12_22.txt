biting your nails when you're stressed is it just a bad habit whoa this is a good one taking a vacation will cure burnout big big myth stress is always bad can i do this stress is not always bad hi i'm stephanie cook i am an assistant professor at new york university school of global public health i seek to understand how things like stigma and discrimination based on race and sexual orientation are associated with mental and physical health and i'm terry solero i'm an associate professor in clinical psychology at rutgers university and i study the intersection of anxiety stress and substance use disorders and today we'll be debunking myths about stress if stress-free life is the best life stress-free life is definitely not the best life we need it to survive imagine you are out on a hike with your friends and in the pathway ahead you see a mama bear in her cubs immediately you're going to start sweating and your heart's going to start racing really really hard this is called a fight-or-flight response and this is a stress response and for these situations stress is very very valuable because it helps us as human beings decide are we gonna fight or are we going to run from the stressor i also like to think about it as something that can motivate your behavior when we feel stressed out we're often going to be motivated to work toward a goal and to work hard toward it however over time when this stress response system is continually triggered and it's prolonged in any way this can be bad for our health it opens us up to all kinds of sicknesses and disease associated with foreign mental health welcome the good stress and do your best to mitigate the bad stress you should shield kids from stress this is a good to all the parents out there who do do this on a regular basis i feel you right however you're doing a disservice to your child we often call this helicopter parenting hovering over them making sure that all barriers all dangers are swept to the side unfortunately kids with helicopter parents often develop difficulty with anxiety and self-regulation we have to learn stress processes and how to handle stress when we're young so that they can learn to tolerate distress and learn how to self-regulate and develop adaptive coping tools make sure that they know that you're there supporting them and to valid and acknowledge the emotions that they're experiencing while allowing them to work through them on their own we want to raise resilient children and the way to raise resilient children is really to help them learn how to deal with these experiences at an early age oh i love this one taking a vacation will cure burnout big big big myth you're preventing it in the moment you get back home and all of those feelings of exhaustion and issues are going to return immediately so burnout is actually a prolonged form of stress and exhaustion caused by a variety of stressors but we're often thinking a combination of a different responsibility that you don't have the capacity to manage and feel overwhelmed by the only way to really cure burnout is to remove that aspect of your life where you're burned out which isn't a possibility for most of us but as a clinical psychologist i think of what are kind of the basic emotion regulation tools that you can make sure that you are including in your every day so um making sure that you are going to bed at a reasonable time waking up at a reasonable time eating relatively healthy and throughout the day staying away from mood altering substances taking prescriptions as prescribed to getting your regular exercise in and pleasurable activities another strategy to think more critically about is mindfulness or meditation so really taking time throughout your day to center yourself and breathe just try not to think about it uh okay i have a task for you don't think about a pink elephant for the next 30 seconds anything at all yeah okay so stephanie already right two seconds later she's like yep ding ding ding thinking about a pink elephant when we try not to think about something we're actually more likely to then think about it and if you actually think about something in a lot of detail you can actually kind of bring down the distress associated with it what i want to know is is it a thought or is it a fact we call that flexible thinking or cognitive restructuring can you actually challenge the thing that you're thinking about is there any evidence of it can you come up with a more helpful alternative or can you at the same time maybe hold to a posing perspective so i think what you're saying is we really need to think about the stressor to deal with the stressor yeah in that way we'll start to feel better about it in some way or we'll start to get some resolution about it absolutely stress helps people work faster and better we all have those moments who are like yeah nailed it under pressure got it done right but that's that's not the norm that's more the exception to the rule when you put people under stress they're more likely to make silly mistakes that they wouldn't otherwise make especially if you're working under prolonged stress this is not going to go well in the long term when people report that they work better under stress usually it's actually other factors so they happen to work better at night or work better in the morning but they're saying oh i think i just work better under stress it's also really important to think more critically about the working conditions in which you work best in so do i work better at home do i work better at the office because the whole idea is to reduce stress and improve the output and the quality of your work biting your nails when you're stressed is it just a bad habit it's not just a bad habit there's a physiological component to it nail biters usually bite their nails because they're under arouse actually meaning they're really bored or overarousal so an overall for example of the stress system if you like bite your nails a lot you open yourself up for infections some of the ways to prevent nail biting number one we need to understand the stressor can we reduce that stressor in your life and if so does that handle the nail biting issues if the stressor is constant and chronic put nail polish on your hands and then also you know in more extreme places people wear gloves alcohol helps you de-stress alcohol is something that can alleviate stress initially but if we think about consistent use over time it's actually going to increase the likelihood that you develop problems with anxiety and just regulate your stress system overall leading to poor physical and mental health outcomes we really want people to be developing more long-term adaptive techniques to cope with stress can we do a quick distraction or game so if i turn to stephanie right now and i say we're going to go through different types of food i'm going to start with the letter a you go b and so forth ay apples b banana the carrots the point is that when we do something like that we become focused in the moment we're able to maybe add some levity to the situation so that when we're done going through the alphabet we can choose a more helpful activity maybe i'm gonna go on a run do some yoga bake some cookies call a friend to catch up stress is always bad can i do this stress is not always bad it really depends on the context and our interpretation of it if we're getting ready to walk down the aisle and say i do to somebody for the rest of our lives we might feel really really stressed out right but in this case it's accompanied by this positive warm loving excitement so stress can actually indicate that you're really really excited about something thinking i can do this i've got this this stress is actually going to help me to perform it actually allows our blood pressure to go down a little bit so our heart is working hard but it's able to actually get that blood through our body to our brain where it needs to get to add on a little to moderate stress good research shows it's good think of it as a helpful friend that's going to push you over the finish line stress eating is no big deal i'm a big stress eater i am confessions but stress eating isn't great for us guys it's a negative feedback loop you know you might have a really stressful day at work and in addition to your lovely glass of red wine you have have a chocolate cake you might have immediate relief from your stress you'll then feel bad about eating the chocolate cake and then you'll feel stressed out about it and then you might want to eat again and have a rest to that cake exactly everything in moderation right we are absolutely not saying to not eat or avoid eating when you're stressed we're just kind of warning about the potential negative effects of it when it becomes kind of this relied upon a quick fix in the absence of other coping strategies ptsd only affects soldiers and people in war zones ptsd does not only affect soldiers and people who have lived in war zones historically a lot of the work that we've done to understand trauma and ptsd has been with our armed forces and veterans the first term for it was shell shock however post-traumatic stress disorder can arise based on intimate partner violence or big events like 9 11 we also see post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosed based on things that we might not see as big traumatic events so for example experiencing a microaggression so you know a smaller discriminatory event and it's important to note that the majority of people who experience the trauma won't go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder so when we're talking about post-traumatic stress disorder diagnostically we are looking for a few criteria we want to first establish what the traumatic event is or was then we're looking for intrusive or unwanted thoughts about the trauma they relive the trauma you know in terms of nightmares but also during wakeful hours as well we're also looking for avoidance so avoidance of situations that might remind you of the traumatic event we're also looking for alterations in cognition or emotion so these are changes in the way that we maybe think about the world as being safe or unsafe we might have emotional blunting it might be difficult to have warm positive strong emotions that you used to have and then we're looking at changes in arousal here we might see an exaggerated startle response to something that wouldn't otherwise be alarming or distressing and so a lot of what people in my field are working on now is trying to structure prevention interventions to address non-military-related trauma stress is this natural process it's helped us survive as a species to this point identify things that cause you negative or harmful stress in your life and develop adaptive coping tools and make sure that you're also paying attention to ways in which you might be coping in ways that are unhelpful so stress is not a bad thing it's important but if you don't have it you're going to get mauled by the bear in the world [Music]
