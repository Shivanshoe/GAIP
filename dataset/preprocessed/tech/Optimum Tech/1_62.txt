so a while ago i made a video showing that the quick latency difference between wide and wireless gaming mice was basically nothing to consider there was no correlation showing that wireless gaming mice was slower than wired as some people still believe today and really more than anything it's the d-bounce delay of the mouse that has the biggest impact on quick latency more than anything so for those that were currently using or considering upgrading to a wireless gaming mouse this was basically proof that wireless technology wasn't going to hold you back but there's one thing missing from that testing and it's when it comes to the sensor and with a lot of gaming mice becoming wireless and a lot of new brands coming to the market you have to wonder if all sensors and firmware are made equally are all modern sensors actually the same are they all good enough and what does that mean when it comes to sensor latency well to start answering at least a few of these questions i built this it's a belt driven machine which can independently control a gaming mouse and at the same time trigger nvidia's ldap software so that we can measure mouse sensor latency so let's take it through a bit of a test run today with some different gaming mics and some different settings and without spoiling anything yeah there are some very interesting results [Music] so first of all let me explain how all of this works basically using an arduino and a few lines of code both a stepper motor and a speaker are triggered at the exact same time the speaker emits a loud beep which triggers the ldap software and the stepper motor moves the mouse these two separate instructions are executed only 150 micro seconds apart so they're happening pretty much at the same time once the ldap software hears the beep from the speaker it then waits for mouse movement at which point it detects that and it'll flash the screen once the screen flashes we get our result which is the delay between the mouse movement and the movement being displayed on the screen i will also mention that the movement of the mouse is completely automated with no human input whatsoever it basically just repeats the same move over and over again for a total sample count of 50. so of course before we actually go ahead and test anything and compare different gaming mice in different settings we need to first see if this thing actually works in the first place and well yes it actually works really well admittedly a lot better than i expected so here's the same gaming mouse the logitech g pro super light taken through the same test five different times and between each test it was removed and then reinstalled back into the test rig and the results here are incredibly close what's even cooler to see is the incredibly small standard deviation for each individual test run illustrated by the orange line here which is about 1.4 milliseconds for each test here over 50 samples all right so the test rig works everything is good to go and the first thing that i wanted to test here was whether or not higher dpi would result in lower sensor latency dpi is essentially the set resolution of the sensor the amount of dots per inch that the sensor is reading so we'd assume that with higher dpi and more samples that information can be read sooner and that results in lower latency and yeah that's pretty much exactly what we see not only does sensor latency decrease as we increase mouse dpi but the standard deviation also shrinks a noticeable amount as well with the mouse sensor set to just 100 dpi we're getting mouse movement registering on the screen at 25.7 milliseconds on average but with some readings above 30 milliseconds now i don't know anyone who plays on 100 dpi most people play on either 400 or 800 and there there's about a two to 2.5 millisecond difference in sensor latency the latency benefits then trail off the higher that you raise dpi 1600 gives us a further 1.7 millisecond improvement over 800 dpi but 3200 dpi only gives us about a half millisecond improvement on average so while it's pretty cool for me to measure and be able to show you these differences it's not enough for me to convince you to bump up your mouse dpi however another factor at play here is the actual movement speed of the mouse the results that you've seen so far have been with the mouse moving at a pretty typical movement speed if you play on a low or moderate sensitivity or from another perspective if you're flicking to an angle or different target in game but what about if you're moving your mouse less for example using only wrist movement to track an enemy at a moderate or long distance with less mouse movement there's less information for the mouse sensor to collect and so potentially higher dpi might be more useful here luckily we can test this just by simply changing the speed of the motor and just as we expected the differences in the results do grow with the higher dpi setting showing more beneficial for reducing latency when you have slower mouse movement now again obviously no one is going to play on 100 dpi but it's pretty crazy to see the insane sensor latency that this results in over 50 milliseconds from end to end interestingly though the dpi settings that players are using 400 800 and 1600 there is a measurable decrease in sensor latency about six milliseconds going from 400 to 800 dpi and then a further three milliseconds by bumping up to 1600 so what we can conclude from this testing is that if you play on a higher sensitivity it's more beneficial for you to get that higher sensitivity from your dpi as opposed to just cranking up the sensitivity multiplier in game for example if you play on 400 dpi 1.0 cents in valorem you'd be better off playing at 0.5 at 800 dpi or maybe 0.25 at 1600 dpi effectively the feel and sensitivity will be identical but you'll have lower sensor lag and higher sensor resolution at those higher dpi settings and i think even for low to moderate sensitivity players this can still be beneficial when it comes to micro adjustments tracking and anything that involves fine mouse control the next thing that i wanted to test was whether plugging in the g pro super light would somehow improve or change the latency result just out of curiosity and nope the result is pretty much exactly the same nothing really worth noting or wasting time on here next up though let's compare a bunch of different wireless gaming mice different sensors different firmware different battery life and battery saving techniques but the sensor latency difference between them is surprisingly similar at most there's a 3.5 millisecond latency difference between the g pro super light and the pwnage ultra custom honestly i was expecting some bigger differences to talk about here but it looks like they're all within pretty much the same range but lastly what about wired gaming mice here there's no need to consider any battery saving techniques or sleep modes you can just continuously sample the sensor at full capacity at 1 000 hertz polling rate but does that actually make a difference well actually kind of i'll highlight the wired gaming mics here for reference in white and yeah they do trend towards the top of the stack when it comes to sensor lag granted it's only by two to three milliseconds on average and again we are measuring the entire latency chain here which includes the pc and the display but it's still really really interesting to see the only wide mouse that sits towards the bottom here is the final mouse ultra light 2 and that's because that mouse has a max polling rate of 500 hertz whereas the other mice are set to 1 000 hertz so yeah some pretty interesting results for sure that in the end the difference here from top to bottom is only 5 milliseconds that's not a perceivable difference or one that will help you win most gunfights but it does highlight that there are measurable differences here for whatever reason that is still though when we're comparing wide and wireless here for a mere two millisecond increase in sensor lag in return for a completely wireless tether free connection that's a trade-off that most people should make especially if you play on a lower sensitivity wireless is significantly more comfortable to play with than slapping around a cable on your desk you'll probably make better plays in return and your accuracy will probably be a little bit better as well than any 2 millisecond latency reduction can give you at the very least i'm really glad that i built this tool at least to validate new models or brands of gaming mice on the market especially the wireless gaming mice era that we're all trending towards no doubt we will see some different wireless implementations and sensor sampling techniques in the future and you can bet more gaming mice will be put to the test the next step for the tool will be to evolve it to test things like mouse acceleration sensor accuracy micro tracking and things like that i will need to 3d print some more upgrades and write some new testing which will take a couple weeks but i'm really excited to push that testing further and further and don't worry mouse reviews will still focus heavily on shape and build quality and all of that important stuff as well but i think that you know sensor latency and quick latency tests are really important too moving forward until then a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
