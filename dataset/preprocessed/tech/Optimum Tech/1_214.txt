it might be hard to believe that just three years ago the fastest mainstream socket gaming CPU that you could buy it was Intel's a quad-core i7 7700 K that was until AMD showed up with first generation of Rison CPUs and illustrated that core count does in fact matter for a smoother gaming experience and soon after Intel followed suit and so there seems to be a bit of a CPU core count battle happening between Intel and AMD at the moment actually it's not that much of a battle because AMD is clearly winning in that regard that Intel is trying their best to follow suit and so the result is that we end up having 6 & 8 core CPUs now which are considered mainstream because I think it's fairly well established that 10 cores and above for gaming certainly he's not going to give you more framerate in games but it's kind of up for debate whether 6 or 8 core CPUs is better strictly for gaming fields for example is it better to go with an 8 core CPU is that necessarily in a future-proof your system or perhaps a 6 core CPU is that can a bottleneck your system in some games those are the kind of questions that we're going to be answering today [Music] there are a couple of things that prompted this video firstly I'm seeing a lot of PC builders opt for the 8 quart risin 3700 X 4 strictly gaming builds and secondly with upcoming CPUs from both Intel and AMD this year there's no doubt that the marketing behind these processors will place a huge importance in total core and thread count so how many CPU cause do you really need for gaming these days to keep things simple we're going to be comparing two CPUs from the same generation and architecture and both with simultaneous multi-threading so for the 6 core we have the super popular Rison 5 3600 and for the 8 core we have the risin 7 3700 X now the 3700 X does have a higher boost clock than the 3600 so we can definitely expect it to be faster in games regardless with that alone but don't worry because we will be comparing performance at the exact same clock speed as well and something I want you to keep in mind throughout these benchmark charts is even if the 3700 X is faster in some titles is that necessarily worth 120 dollars over the risin 530 600 because that price difference alone is enough to upgrade from something like an rx 5600 XT up to a 5700 XT and that is guaranteed to give you a big performance bump across any game out there so let's jump right into the performance comparisons then and let's first take a look at the average frame rate with both processors out of the box so here we have the 8 core rise in 3700 X in blue and the 6 quart rise on 5 3600 in orange and I'll first note that these benchmarks pretty much illustrate the worst case scenario for CPU load in gaming what I mean there is that we are using an RT X xx atti at 1080p resolution which is going to increase the amount of draw calls needed to be sent by the CPU and in some cases we are testing some fairly AI and logic dense games so with both processes out of the box there is a clear difference in some titles csgo is a bit of an outlier there's a 15 performance difference there in favor of the 3700 X overwatch and assetto corsa show 8.6 percent and a more modest 2.8 percent for Rainbow six siege remember though the 3,700 X does boost a bit higher than 3600 out-of-the-box but what happens when we run both CPUs at the exact same clock speed say 4.2 gigahertz well the performance margins tightened up significantly for some titles previously that showed a 5% or so difference there's now basically zero difference between a six core 3600 or an eight core 3700 X when clock speed is equal there are only really four titles here that show any meaningful difference for average frame rate the two racing and AI heavy games project comes to and assetto corsa and two of the competitive FPS titles overwatch and csgo make of that what you will but at least for the two racing games I would definitely upgrade my GPU instead but now let's shift the conversation from average frame rate and take a look at the lowest 1% of frame rate basically looking at whether the six core CPU occasionally has a lower frame rate than the eight core CPU and again taking a look at performance out of the box there is slightly more of a difference compared to when we take a look at the average frame rate but this is again partially due to the difference in clock speeds when we run both CPUs at 4.2 gigahertz again the margins do tighten up significantly this means that even in terms of frame rate stability when clock speeds are equal between the 3600 and 3700 X there is a negligible difference between the two we do see better performance here for a few titles product cars to battlefield 5 csgo and over watch but it is hard to justify that as a 120 dollar improvement lastly let's take a very close look at the frame rate data from a few of these titles and what we're looking at here is whether the six core CPU shown in orange has anymore frame rate drops or dips than the eight core 3,700 X in purple by the way this chart and the next two following are all built in game benchmarks so it's an identical benchmark run and game camera every single time and it's extremely reliable so at least in shadow of the Tomb Raider the six core CPU still provides a very very stable performance definitely no stuttering here similar story in Rainbow six siege running the Vulcan API even when this game is running north of 300 frames second you're not going to have any issues with the 6-quart risin 5 3,600 keeping up with the 8 quart risin 3,700 X at least when they're at these same clock speeds and lastly here we have Far Cry 5 which is a very CPU intensive game and with the built-in benchmark you can actually reproduce a few framerate drops but as we can see it's pretty much identical between these two CPUs they both dip at around the same areas and by a pretty much identical amount and some of you might be wondering well these benchmarks were done with no background tasks running what happens when you run a few background tasks like Spotify discord and a few chrome tabs surely there's gonna be a difference there well this is a very very hard thing to test accurately and reliably and you're more often than not going to be memory or ram bound before us or CPU bound anyway basically unless you're doing something super CPU intensive like video encoding or rendering which I'm not sure why you would be doing that in the background of your gaming anyway but you know these two processes are going to handle a couple of background tasks exactly the same certainly a couple chrome tabs discord and Spotify is not enough to justify an extra 120 dollars and an extra couple of CPU cores in your system but obviously if you do have some non gaming tasks like video editing or video encoding that do require those extra two calls then obviously the third 700x is a sensible upgrade over something like the 3600 but strictly for gaming that 120 dollars would be better off spent on upgrading your GPU instead if you are looking for a meaningful upgrade over the Rison 5 3600 for gaming I'd instead go for a higher clock CPU instead of like a 9700 K or 19 900 K but those are much more expensive CPUs and I'd only really recommend those for enthusiast gaming builds where you need every last frame and some of you are probably wondering about quad-core CPUs what about the new rise in 330 130 300 X and we will be taking a look at those very very soon as always guys hey huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
