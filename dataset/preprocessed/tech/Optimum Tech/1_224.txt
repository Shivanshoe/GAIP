when we take a look at the multi-core performance of AMD processors like the horizon 3900 X and 3950 X it's a pretty clear win when you compare that to intel's current flagship offering in the same market simply put if you're a creative professional you can quite easily put money back into your pocket with the amount of time saved with these CPUs and let's not even begin to discuss thread Ripper because those CPUs are truly in their own category so why then if these new rising CPUs are so great for creative professionals and multi-core workloads why have I not myself migrated from my 9900 K machine to something with the 16 core 32 thread 3958 and for those wondering it's not because these CPUs are harder to call the 3900 X and 3950 X are actually pretty ITX friendly this is something that a lot of you guys have asked me about why do I still use an Intel CPU in my main machine that is used for video editing and I'm going to explain exactly why today with some performance comparisons but I'm also going to explain why I do expect to be making the switch sometime this year [Music] so before we dive into some performance comparisons and explanations let's take a look at my current gaming and editing rig and some of the more demanding workloads that it's responsible for I'm currently using Intel's I $9.99 hundred KS slotted into the asou Strix Z 390 i motherboard along with 32 gigabytes of memory and 2 terabytes of MDOT to nvme storage on the flip side we've got a liquid called RT X 28 ETI with 11 gigabytes of gddr5 from gaming this GPU is leveraged for a ton of compute work for daily use now this might surprise a few of you but when it comes to gaming I'm all about 1080p 240 Hertz in competitive first-person shooters simply put I want the system with the lowest latency possible and when it comes to the majority of first person shooters played at a high refresh rate Intel's 9700 K and 9900 K are still the best options now to be fair AMD isn't far off on average and for casual gamers the difference won't be perceivable but if you do fall into these slim percentage of users like myself who are using an RT X 20 atti T game at just 1080p with low to medium settings to get the highest refresh rate and lowest latency experience possible then it only makes sense to pair it with something like a 9900 K or 9700 K because that's going to give you the best results the CPU is responsible for sending out draw calls to the GPU under gaming workloads and when it's doing that at over 200 times per second in addition to other tasks clock speed and single threaded performance will always come out on top the common thought then is why would I give up you know having doubled the core count on a mainstream soccer 16 course here for the 3950 X and potentially having a much faster video editing machine why would I give that up just for 10% to 15% of FPS in games and the answer to that is that after actually taking a look at the benchmarks for the editing software and encoding settings that I use I don't actually gain any benefit from an increase in core count at all so my editing software of choice is DaVinci Resolve Studios 16 and this software does an absolutely amazing job at leveraging the parallel compute power of the GPU looking at timeline playback of 6k Blackmagic raw footage it's seriously as real time as it gets with no room for improvement we can also see how little the CPU is loaded during this task at around just 15 percent utilization whereas the 20 atti sits at around 1/3 usage with half the memory capacity taken up again this is fully graded 6k raw video when it comes to tasks like video stabilization the GPU is responsible for basically all of the compute workload here - upgrading to a higher core can seep you wouldn't let you an increase in performance here one area where you will see an increase in performance that is video encoding or exporting but that if you're using the CPU as the encoder for example when we encode in h.264 using the CPU we do get a chunk of time saved over the 9900 K and this would definitely scale the larger and more complex that your project grows however with an NVIDIA GPU you can leverage the on-board encoder to export in h.265 at seriously lightning speeds even a beefy 20 atti gets a pretty nice workout here with encoding capacity pretty much maxed out the Knights 900k on the other hand barely sits at 60% usage now while you won't see any real benefit by upgrading above say an 8 core CPU in DaVinci Resolve studio because it is mostly a GPU based program the same cannot be said for Adobe's Premiere Pro that's an editing software where the results do speak for themselves and where I think horizon 939 50x would be totally ideal however you really could not pay me to go back to using Adobe Premiere Pro it's an unbelievably inefficient video editing software and the amount of crashes that I had using that software I mean it just cost me so much time and work so if you are an editor yourself I would highly push you in the direction of DaVinci Resolve studio so those are the two most frequent use cases for my system high refresh rate gaming and video editing in results studio however there are other less frequent use cases of the system which are equally if not more computationally demanding for example streaming while traditionally a high coil count CPU has been the go-to if you're looking to livestream your gameplay to a service like twitch that all changed when Nvidia updated their invent encoder at the same time as their r-tx launch in short I found this to be an incredibly efficient way to livestream games it requires less power and you actually get better framerate performance overall but with all of this in mind I am still expecting to switch to an AMD Zen three CPU later this year when they're released of course we have no idea what the performance is going to be like it's gonna be an iteration on their current seven nanometer architecture but with the current trajectory of Rison at the moment we can only expect a serious stab at Intel if not for the improvement in performance but at least for the efficiency at this rate I am expecting AMD to at least tie the 9900 key in gaming across the board not just in some titles like it does at the moment whilst being more power and thermally efficient to be honest I'm also really itching to jump at an x5 70 ITX motherboard seeing as Z 390 ITX options are fairly stale in comparison so that's currently where I'm out with AMD rising CPUs and my own workflow and kind of explaining why I haven't made the switch my current workflow is mostly revolving around GPU compute and where I do need a CPU or sort of the most demanding CPU based tasks that I have is high refresh rate gaming and it's pretty well-established at that point that the best option there would be a 9900 K so has always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
