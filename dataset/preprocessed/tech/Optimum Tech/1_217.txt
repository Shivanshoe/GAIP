[Music] the last time we looked at the street comedy before things didn't exactly go to plan but that's not because there's anything wrong with this case in fact the day before has been designed extremely well but to truly use this case to its full potential you need this piece of kit right here this is the dedicated GPU calling kit which will allow us to build a completely passively cooled gaming system in this case completely passive means zero offence and that means it's zero noise and the results here are much better than our initial video with the D before where we used a Rison apu and we did have to compromise quite a bit on gaming performance this time instead we're pushing some seriously high frame rates because we're using a dedicated graphics card but it's not without a few tweaks [Music] so a quick refresher on this case for those that missed the initial build video and case review the goal of the screw comb db4 is a bit unconventional from what we're typically used to seeing from a PC case instead of ventilated cut out and tons of ventilation for your radiators the db4 doesn't accommodate the calling it is of the cooling your CPU and GPU transfer heat directly to the side panels of IV copper heat pipes and cooling plates and while this won't be enough for an i-9 CPU and an RT X GPU I'm interested to see how far we can push this cooling method for the CPU end of things were going with Intel's six core i5 9400 on the msi z 390 i edged motherboard and the reason that I didn't go with Rison here is that I found AMD rise in CPUs to be a bit more voltage dependent during gaming loads compared to Intel what I mean there is that it's fairly typical to see something like an r5 3600 or 3700 X pull upwards of 1.5 volts just during a fairly light gaming load and while that is fairly manageable with active cooling maybe not so much for the passive solution that we've got here with the i5 9400 we can undeveloped that chip to around 1 point 1 volt and still get it running at its usual boost clock of around 4 gigahertz the GPU though that's where things get really interesting so in the initial DB 4 video I tried to run this exact gtx 1650 super with the stock air cooler and it was an absolute disaster with the cooling kit though we're able to call the GPU directly with one of the side panels just as we do with the cpu the gtx 1650 super is currently one of the best options for a budget GPU at 159 dollars you're getting a ton of value and some pretty confident gaming performance at 1080p resolution especially if you're mostly interested in esports or competitive titles you could easily see 144 frames per second and beyond just by dropping the quality settings to around medium so the ultimate goal here is a dead silent gaming system that can play eSports titles at very high frame rates now despite this being a fairly low power budget card with a 100 watt TDP that does significantly exceed the recommended TDP for the street comes at DB for cooling kit which is just 65 watts more on that in just a minute so the installation of the cooling kit is the same as for the CPU you've got four copper heat pipes that connect to an aluminium cold plate on either side and then a copper shim between the GPU die and the heat pipes themselves one thing to know here is just how soft and malleable the copper heat pipes are it's very easy to accidentally bend them out of place so try not to do what I've done here and apply too much force if you do Bend or kink one of the pipes it's pretty much impossible to get it back to its original shape and then it won't fit properly within the grooves of the cold plate I was able to get a good and now fit on both sides but it is far from perfect and for some reason it is a bit more difficult compared to the heat pipes used on the CPU but just like with the CPU you'll want to apply a decent amount of thermal paste between the cold plate and the side panel and of course double checking that there is enough mounting pressure between them and so our completely passively cooled system is finally finished with not a single fan installed the power supply is also passively cooled it's the HD Plex 400 watt DCT ATX plentiful of this little system I'll admit powering the system on for the first time is a bit of a weird experience since you have no real audible feedback that the system is even on the ultimate question though is what is the performance like well we've already taken a look at CPU performance we'll come back to that in just a minute but looking at our gtx 1650 super evidently the 100 watt power draw of the card proves to be a bit too much the GPU hits 86 degrees C at around the 16 minute mark in heaven 4.0 at which point it does throttle fairly aggressively as shown by the power draw and GPU frequency to be honest though this is kind of what I expected plan B is of course to under volt so by running the GPU at 1650 megahertz and just 775 millivolts that's around 250 millivolts less than typical we finally get some promising results after 30 minutes the 1650 super lands at around 77 degrees C power draw is a lot closer to Street comms recommended spec of 65 watts and the interesting part were able to maintain a higher boost clock than before personally that really surprised me so with a bit of manual tuning were able to reduce both thermals and power but with a higher clock speed after a sustained period and gaming performance was surprisingly good I tested a bit of overwatch at medium settings and consistently saw frame rates above 140 frames per second there was no stuttering no throttling and no noise after about an hour of gaming which also included a bit of cue and idle time the GPU was sitting comfortably at 77 degrees C just like with our test with the CPU hovering between 75 and 80 those are very safe levels we've got around nine degrees worth of Headroom for the GPU and about 20 degrees worth of Headroom for the CPU I'll also mention that you could probably improve these results quite a bit just by opening a window or a door or something and have at least some level of air movement in the room all the testing I did here was with all windows and doors completely closed for those concerned about coil whine I will note that under vaulting the GPU seemed to help things quite a bit here but it wasn't too bad to start with with that under vault in place that we do get absolutely silent performance now throughout the process of this video I thought you know this is going to be a pretty cool project and you know it's people going to enjoy it but no one's actually going to go out and build something like this because you do have to compromise the performance quite a lot but after using this and gaming on it I take that back and I do think that there are people out there who you know really like the exterior of the db4 and really want a completely silent system not just kind of silent and actually would build something like this after gaming on it it is something that I can actually recommend now obviously for most of us who are primarily focused on gaming performance and you're getting the most value for your money this isn't something that we're going to build but for those of you out there who do really like the look of the db4 maybe you don't need a ton of performance maybe you do a bit of eSports gaming on the side and maybe you really value the you know silent approach of the db4 then this build is totally doable personally I think this cooling approach is really interesting and I'd love to see what would happen if you pushed it just a little bit further added a couple more heat pipes made the cold plates a bit bigger and you know what would happen if you put an RT X 27 T mini in here that would be really interesting to see as always I would love to hear thoughts and comments down below a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
