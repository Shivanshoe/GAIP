[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right so it is finally done the dual 240ml radiator custom loop in the nks m1 a builder that i have been planning and teasing for quite a while so to 240ml radiators in under a 15 litre case I mean that's pretty impressive and what that means in simple terms is that they should basically give you the best thermal and noise performance of any case or configuration under 15 liters in total volume so in terms of ITX builds I would definitely consider this a zero compromise performance build I won't be personally using this build as my gaming and editing machine because I think it's gonna be a little bit overkill for that but we will see what the performance is going to be like I definitely think a build this overkill is better suited to a 3d rendering machine or a video encoding machine use cases and applications where you do need something compact but also where time is money and like many of the ITX custom lips that i've done the hardest part was figuring out where and how to route the tubing trying to choose the most efficient paths as I could but from here on I do think it can be easily replicated firstly let's take a look at all of the parts that went into this starting with the two most important ones the radiators and the fence now there are many ways to do an n case m1 custom loop many of the ones that I've seen so far just use a single 92 mil or 240 ml radiator but I wanted to build a configuration with the best cooling performance possible in this case this build is all about performance per litre so for the side mounted radiator we're using ek2 40 mil cool stream PE radiator that's 38 millimeters thick and I've paired that with two of knock tours nf8 12 by 25 fans this is most likely the biggest radiator in terms of thickness and a height that you can install into the nks m1 and will be responsible for most of the lips cooling and for those who noticed I did actually have to swap the power plug and nameplate position to get the radiator to fit and for a good like this I do think it's really important for the user to be able to access the complete interior of the case access the motherboard the memory if they want to upgrade that the end or to drive and possibly the CPU even if they need to up that down the road so the side mounted radiator can actually be fully disconnected from the loop without any training whatsoever this is of course thanks to Alfa calls quick disconnect fittings which will allow the fastest and most leak free disconnection of reconnection of the loop in a matter of just seconds you might still see a small drop on the very rare occasion during the unlocking of the fittings so just make sure you have a paper towel or something close by another really cool thing that was kind of unintentional about these quick disconnect fittings is that you can completely connect the loop without that side mounted radiator and you've kind of just got cooled by that bottom mounted radiator but if you don't need a ton of cooling and instead you want to use the side mounting bracket for say storage or something like that or a pump even this could be a totally viable option the bottom mounted radiator is the excess PCT x 240 ultra slim radiator just measuring 22 millimeters in thickness and I've paired that with two of Noctua slim nfa 12 by 15 chrome axe fans in total you've got 50 millimeters of clearance underneath the GPU waterblock so with this setup I've got around 13 mils of clearance for air flow if you are having trouble sourcing the ultra slim TX 240 which is pretty likely you could probably go up to a 28 mil thick right here to here but any more than that and you'll have virtually zero clearance the fittings and tubing will probably look very familiar at this point as it's what I've used for pretty much all of my ITX custom lit builds it's eks 16 mils EMT tubing paired with alfa corse compression fittings i've also added two additional ports to the loop for filling and draining that's done with two of eks3 weight terminal splitters speaking of filling handed draining the loop that is something that did take quite a while for this build because the loop is fairly complex and we are working with two radiators in other words there are lots of little spots and places where air can get stuck and trapped so I started filling the loop via those two ports that I added that pour directly into the radiators and that was enough to get around 60% of the loop filled up and then I filled the remainder up by disconnecting that side mounted radiator and fill up to the brim separately and then reconnecting that to the loop now the CPU pump look that I'm using is the Swift tech apogee drive - which uses a relatively powerful DDC pump which i've done testing on previously a very impressive product from Swift tech which is basically what makes this entire build possible many of you know that I'm a big fan of alpha cools LT solar pump block which is basically the same thing but has a much weaker pump and I have actually tested these two against each other back when I had the custom looped goes to s1 build and I found absolutely no difference in terms of thermal performance despite the apogee drive to having a significantly faster flow rate for a dual radiator custom loop like this one though I really don't feel confident in using the LT solar because it is simply not designed to be used in applications like this but I will be doing some pump speed benchmarks to see how much of a difference the flow rate makes to thermals with the apogee drive - one issue I did have with this pump lock though is that you will need to use low profile memory and even then one of the tubes is currently pushing on one of the memory sticks which is not ideal at all to fix this I'd need to rotate that pump lock fitting and then use a thinner radiator but that's something that I don't really want to do for this build for the CPU I've gone with the ten core ten 900k and plug that into the MSI z4 90 I unify and for the GPU it's an RT X xx atti of course the thermal and noise performance numbers will hold the real answer as to whether this was worth it or not but to have two to forty more radiators in under a 13 litre case I feel like this really shows how space optimized the NK someone actually is so if you are interested in any of the parts that went into this builds I will leave them linked down below do subscribe if you haven't already for part two a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
