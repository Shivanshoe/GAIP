[Music] hey what is up guys so some of you may remember this build right here this is the completely liquid called 9900 KS and 2080 ti built in a case called the sign armed t1 if you haven't watched that video yet I would highly recommend you go back and watch that it will give you some context of what's going on here and I do just consider that to be one of the better views on the channel one of the current problems with the build though is that the GPU fittings a little bit too tall so the side panel on the GPU side doesn't actually close because they do extend beyond the case however we do have a solution for that today this is e Kay's terminal fittings they mount directly on top of the water box so the things go vertically instead of sort of mounted directly on the side you'll see what I mean what hen stall these in just a second but yeah so far the system has been excellent apart from not cutting that side panel on I haven't done any real thermal testing for the system just yet but just by playing some games and you know while editing videos and just monitoring some things on the side the thermals look about on par with my previous system which was a liquid-cooled that goes to s1 that system was just slightly bigger than this one but it was a little less and ventilated I will also mention that I did install the incorrect radiator that was sort of designed around this case so the radiator that I installed in there is alpha cools st 30 and the designer of the case actually recommended that i installed the LT 240 which is quite a bit slimmer than the one that i've got in there I believe it's 25 mils compared to the 30ml one I've got in there at the moment so that's why we had the majority of the compatibility issues for the initial build but one thing I will say is that the pump noise is a lot more apparent than compared to my previous build in the ghost s1 so with this build the pump is actually facing me it's on the left side of the build and since the case is more ventilated than my previous build I can definitely hear that pump noise a lot more so one thing that I want to focus on today is a pump noise benchmark or a pump speed benchmark that is how fast do I need to spin the pump to actually get good thermals out of this system so enough talking let's roll the intro and get installing these new fittings [Music] [Music] all right so the new low-profile fittings are finally installed and I've got to say it feels really good to have this system finally done after all it is my personal system that I use for gaming and editing pretty much every single day the fittings swap itself was pretty easy I didn't bother draining the entire system just enough to safely work on the top of the GPU using these terminal fittings we have absolutely zero issues with clearance now seeing as they mount directly on top of the water block for the sake of ease though I did keep the initial barb fittings on the tubing but regular compression fittings would work here just fine I did have to change the tubing run from the GPU to the radiator so let me know what you guys think they're probably not as clean as I had it initially but still relatively tidy but now finally let's take a look at the thermals because at the end of the day we are cramming a ton of power into such a tiny case so for airflow we've actually just got to slim knock to a 120 ml fans at the top they're sitting just above the radiator they're pulling fresh air through the side panels up into the radiator and then exhausting that hot air through the top panel we're keeping the interior nice and cool as opposed to dumping a ton of heat into it and warming up other components like the drives and the power supply so let's start with GPU thermal sing as the RT X xx atti does demand quite a bit of cooling and here I just wanted to show how effective under vaulting can be for a build like this at stock xx ATT eyes will run at around 1,000 millivolts to 1050 millivolts depending on their temperature but by under vaulting the card to around 870 millivolts were able to achieve around 810 degree reduction by reducing the voltage of the card were able to reduce its power draw by about 20% and this is what effectively gives us those significant temperature reductions this xx atti sample can still run fairly typical boost clocks to at stock it'll naturally boost to around 18 80 megahertz but with the undervolt I've said it just runs 20 megahertz lower overall virtually zero performance penalty by under vaulting here but a much more power efficient and running GPU I will know that this was with the radiator fan speed set to 1800 rpm but more on this in just a minute next let's take a look at the pump speed comparison that I mentioned at the start of the video so the pump that I've got in there running the entire loop is alpha cause I spare LT so low it's technically designed for just modular and expandable a iOS but I found this to work perfectly when it comes to small custom loops as well at 2800 rpm the pump can get a bit audible especially when the fans aren't spinning that loud but we see here that even with the pump spinning at its lowest setting 2000 rpm there's basically no significant difference in CPU thermals compared to spinning it at max that's with our ninety nine hundred KS running at 4.7 gigahertz 1.16 volts in blender and after thirty minutes it levels down to 70 degrees C with the radiator fans at 1500 rpm I tested GPU thermals here to with the minimum and Max pump speed and seeing as we are pumping a bit more heat into the system here we potentially do see a difference of about 1 degree C but with all of this in mind I'm going to set the pump speed to top out at 2400 rpm during full gaming loads definitely no point in running it at max speed with that increased noise but for fan speed the slim knock to is that I've got in there top out at 1800 rpm and they do definitely get a little bit portable at that range having said that this system does benefit from fan speed quite a lot comparing 1800 rpm versus 1400 RPM we're looking at around a seven degree difference for the GPU with the fans at 1,400 rpm and 62 degrees C we are still within a very safe range though and the trade-off there for reduced noise levels is definitely worth it in my opinion but something that I was really curious to compare was this system versus my previous system in the ghost s1 seeing us they are very similar both sandwich layout cases both with the radiator up top the only real difference is that the ghost s1 is less ventilated and 2 litres larger but to that system's credit it was running full sized fans versus the slim fans that we in this build and looking at GPU thermals here things are looking about the same if anything maybe the sidearm t1 build runs a couple degrees warmer when you equate for noise and fan speed I am definitely happy with that trade-off though this build feels a lot cleaner and stealthier overall so for actual use I've got a fan curve set in place based off of the CPU temperature and the goal here was to have those fans sitting at 1200 rpm under full gaming load after about an hour of playing some apex the 20 ATT I was hovering at about 60 degrees C with the 9900 KS sitting at about 70 now I could no doubt get those thermals down a bit more but the main goal for the system was to run it as quiet as I could while thermals were still within a safe range it makes no difference to me whether the GPU is running at 50 C or 60 C but the fan speed and noise levels between those two values are noticeable and personally I do prefer the quieter but slightly warmer operation speaking of noise here's an idea of what the system sounds like at full gaming load with the fan spinning at around 1200 rpm so I measured just below 36 DBA wall under full load with the fan spinning at around 1200 rpm and that is basically silent with headphones on and tuned into a game it's so quiet that the primary noise of the system actually becomes the electrical noise from the GPU and that is pretty much unavoidable for now I am really really happy with this build as I said in the initial video this is probably one of the cleanest builds overall that I have done and when I call this my end game build that's pretty much what this is this system covers all bases for me in terms of the performance that I need from a gaming and editing machine while barely occupying any space in my studio at all there's no doubt that something down the road will eventually replace it as my daily driver but I have a feeling that probably won't be for quite a while so I'd love to know your thoughts on this build down below and if you're interested in any of the parts may it be the fittings the tubing the pump I will leave those links all down below in the description as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
