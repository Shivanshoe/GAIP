this is the 500 rtx 3070 it's the final gpu to make up nvidia's ampere lineup for now and if you believed nvidia and all of the hype and the rumors about this basically being a 500 rtx 2080 ti then actually yeah that's kind of what this is more on that in just a moment of course we'll take a look at the performance numbers but i just want to mention that yeah this is the fastest 500 gpu that you can buy today so it's kind of an easy review in that regard but it's also a bit of a blind review because we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow when amd announced there are dna 2 gpus but we'll talk more about that towards the end but for now let's see what this thing can actually do and take a look at the performance [Music] this is the last of the three gpus that nvidia announced a couple of months ago for the ampere series and probably the most interesting for the majority of gamers out there the 499 dollar price tag is identical to the rtx 2070 from last generation but as we'll see this thing is in a completely different league when it comes to performance that's mostly in the form of the new ampere architecture but also the big increase in rops and cuda cores surprisingly though we actually get the same memory configuration eight gigabytes of gddr6 with identical peak bandwidth this is one advantage that the rtx 3080 and 3090 have as well as a bunch more silicon in general this also means that nvidia have left a little bit of room for themselves to potentially release an rtx 3070 ti or super variant down the road with the faster gddr6x memory but that does seem likely so we'll have to wait and see the total board power of the 3070 is 100 watts less than the 3080 and for a total of 220 watts we should hopefully see some more compact card designs nvidia's own founders edition cooler is another really unique and interesting design from them a bit more compact than the rtx 3080 at just 242 mils in length but identical height and still two slots that reduced length means that both fans had to be placed underneath the card where they'd usually be although this cooler still has the same airflow direction and flow through design as the 3080 and 3090 founders edition that means that the rear fan will push air out of the case like a blower fan but also exhaust a bit towards the front of the car near the power connector at the same time the second fan will be pushing air through the card and through the exposed heatsink and as we've taken a look at you'll want to avoid this cooler design with sandwich layouts more form factor cases the 12 pin connector is still present here just as with the 3080 and 3090 fe although this time they include a single 8 pin adapter instead of a dual 8 pin also the 12 pin connector here unfortunately isn't angled like it is on those cards so that bulky adapter will be protruding a fair bit but enough of that let's dive right into the performance numbers and see what this thing can do spoiler alert it's an absolute beast considering the price is it faster than an rtx 2080 ti well it's very close in most of the games that i've tested and it's important to consider that the 2080ti here that we're using for comparison is a factory overclocked evga xc ultra so that's likely going to give the 2080 ti a 5 or so advantage taking a step back this is death stranding running completely maxed out at 4k the previous gen 2070 can't deliver anywhere close to a stable 60fps whereas the 3070 can do that quite easily when we crunch the numbers the 3070 is over 50 percent faster here than the 2070 so 500 is definitely buying you a ton more power this time around when we drop the resolution to 1440p the 3070 leads by a very similar amount and manages to edge out the 2080 ti here by a very slim margin now just to manage expectations a little red dead redemption 2 here showed the biggest difference between the 30 70 and 2080 ti that i tested of around nine percent in favor of the 2080 ti again once you factor in that the founders edition 3070 isn't factory o seed like the 2080 ti here is a real apples to apples comparison will probably close this margin close to three to five percent now for those who aren't aware this comparison might seem a bit odd but the reason i'm showing it is to test nvidia's own claims that the 3070 is as fast or even faster than a 2080 ti not that these gpus are comparable on any other level especially price the 2080 ti was upwards of a 1200 card so anywhere near close to that four five hundred dollars is extremely solid now at 4k with a fairly demanding list of settings you're looking at an average frame rate here of around 60 which for the 2070 to achieve that result you'd really need to compromise on the visual quality in this game quite a bit so this is definitely a 4k capable gaming gpu but high refresh rate 1440p is where i think this card shines the best no doubt though you could definitely stretch the settings here to make this easily playable at 4k for those wondering how close the 3070 is to the 3080 which costs 200 us more performance margins are anywhere between 20 and 30 at 1440p resolution like you see here in this case it's 23 that puts the 3070 as the overall better value card here that is the cost per fps unit is slightly lower 4.58 per fps for the 30 70 versus 5.20 for the 3080 where the 3080 can really stretch its legs though is 4k resolution and here you'll see performance margins consistently above 30 over the rtx 3070 into this case a pretty massive 43 so if you are playing at 4k resolution the value proposition between the 30 70 and 3080 is fairly similar just slightly more in favor of the cheaper 3070 what it comes down to really between these two is what frame rate you'd find acceptable in the games that you're playing and how much money you want to throw at your pc for 500 though i think it'll be very hard to be disappointed with the rtx 3070 and even at 4k you'll need to run some really heavy titles to push it under 60 fps with max quality settings compared to the 2070 in rainbow 6 the 30 70 leads by a huge 58 at 4k and 55 at 1440p those are extreme margins for a single generation in battlefield 5 again the 3070 is pretty close to 2080 ti performance at least on average here as you'd expect in most games the 2080 ti does have an additional 3 gigabytes of vram with a much higher bandwidth though and i believe that could be what allows it to just edge out in a couple of those games here and there dropping the resolution to 1440p we're close to where you'd be able to completely max out a 144hz monitor and i personally think that's where the rtx 3070 is best suited now shadow of the tomb raider shows massive gains here over the rtx 2070 again 48 and relatively close to the rtx 2080 ti performance here both at 4k and 1440p if you do have a high refresh rate 1440p gaming monitor that you'd like to get a bit more out of and you do have something like a 2070 or gtx 1080 the 3070 would definitely be a solid upgrade in f1 2020 we're able to overtake the rtx 2080 ti by a few fps and this game especially seems to love the new ampere architecture quite a bit here we're running the game at 4k resolution with the ultra high quality preset so pretty much maxed out and for anti-aliasing we're using the taa setting switching to the nvidia dlss though deep learning super sampling both gpus enjoy a fairly decent frame rate boost so despite the 3017 not having anywhere near as many tensor cores and rt cores as the 2080 ti the frame rate gains that dlss has to offer are still very respectable at 1440p we are able to edge out the 2080ti again here that's by around four percent on average fps for around 700 dollars less now looking at full rtx performance in control at 1440p that's with ray tracing effects set to high and dlss rendering resolution set to two thirds the 3070 is able to play extremely confidently here just slightly behind the 2080 ti the 2070 on the other hand isn't enjoying this experience at all with average frame rate just a hair below 50 fps now when looking at the rtx off versus rtx on performance scaling between this handful of rtx gpus the scaling looks pretty similar between all of them here we're basically just seeing how well do all of these cards handle the rtx effects in this game and most cards here drop a couple of percent of frame rate except for the 2080 for some reason which seems to gain a couple of percent when we switch to 4k interestingly enough the 3070 is able to leapfrog the 2080 ti here with rtx on gaining a 9 net frame rate bump compared to rtx off so overall the rtx capabilities of the 3070 are looking pretty strong and at the very least don't expect it to be a weak card when it comes to ray tracing and ai operations just because it's the cheapest in the stack so far now if you thought the gaming performance was impressive check this out in blender the rtx 3070 is an absolute beast in this fairly short render scene it's able to beat the 2080 ti by 19 and the 2070 by 81 when we bump up the resolution and sample count those margins grow even further by a lot so for 3d artists out there the 3070 is really just an absolute steal using nvidia's optics renderer as opposed to cuda the margins look quite similar to before but as a whole we're able to cut our render time across the board by around 30 to 40 percent depending on the gpu performance in v-ray as well is just as impressive performance here is a solid leap over the 1200 2080 ti from last generation again just mind-blowing performance here for the price when it comes to video editing performance was close to the 2080 ti but not quite on par in davinci resolve studio but still very respectable performance as a whole render times were only 13 percent faster than the rtx 2070 here and i believe that's due to both cars having identical memory configurations same story when it comes to video stabilization decent performance here as a whole but not a serious upgrade over the 2070 if you're currently editing with a 10 series gpu however even something like a gtx 1080 as you can see that would be a solid upgrade now when it comes to clock speed expect slightly higher clocks than the 3080 and 3090 the founders edition 3070 here eventually settled to 1920 megahertz i haven't attempted to overclock the card just yet but i will be doing that very soon with some aftermarket cards as well from board partners the compact cooler is also an excellent pair here thermals topped out at just 70 degrees c with both fans leveling out to a fairly quiet 1600 rpm again hopefully we do see some compact card options out there it's clearly viable taking a look at this result and throughout this review we've been taking a look at how close the performance is between the 3070 and the 2080 ti but what's more impressive are the power savings on top of that the total board power here is just 220 watts which although that is around 50 watts more than the rtx 2070 i think it's contained quite well in terms of thermals and definitely in terms of performance overall the rtx 3070 is just as exciting as the 3080 in my opinion maybe even more since it offers slightly more value and if you are in the market for a 500 gpu this is looking like an absolute no-brainer but what we don't know is what amd are going to announce with their rdna 2 gpus in about a day of this review going live so definitely some really interesting timing there by both nvidia and amd so do subscribe i will be doing a full kind of breakdown when we have the full picture of those gpus from amd but to just close things off i think it's safe to say that the rtx 3070 is an excellent gpu from nvidia the price to performance here is simply insane for 500 you're basically getting a graphics card that can confidently play 4k 60 in most games completely maxed out so it's going to be interesting to see what amd delivers in a couple of days until then a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
