[Music] 400 watts of passive calling that pretty much sums up what you're looking at right now and it's appropriately named the beast from a company called monster labo and despite being a fairly small brand they have some pretty big ambitions here you see with completely passive calling and i mean completely passive no fans at all there has always been this compromise when it comes to component choice like sure you can have this completely silent zero fan pc that you've always dreamed about but when it comes to the components you really have to dial things back quite a bit this pc on the other hand is completely different here we have an overclock 10 900k and an rtx 3080 and yeah this is one of the most interesting pcs that i've ever built of course to accommodate that much passive calling the beast is pretty big just slightly larger than your average mid tower case but over half of that volume is pure heatsink the heatsink fins are spaced out quite a bit and so are optimized for completely passive operation allowing all of that hot less dent and slow moving air to make its way up through the fin stack there are also two 140mm fan slots up top though if you do want to run the beast in what you can think of as an assisted airflow mode and although the purely passive performance mode here is really really impressive a couple of fans at around 700 rpm can make a decent impact i'll also note that there are two independent heat sinks here one for the gpu and the other for the cpu with mounting positioned on opposite sides the interior layout is also completely unconventional compared to your standard mid tower which makes the beast really refreshing to work in also big thumbs up for that super clean logo on the front so let's jump in and see what components i used for this build for the power supply i went with silverstone's night jar nj 700 it's a completely passive 700 watt 80 plus titanium rated unit which is really a perfect fit for what we're building here super powerful super efficient and also completely silent this will also be the first component that you'll want to install into the build pretty straightforward it just bolts in vertically right at the bottom and you can face the power supply whichever way you prefer for the cpu i've gone with the intel 10900k more so as a bit of a challenge to see what the beast can really handle as this chip can quite easily exceed 200 watts by itself now of course a ryzen 5900x or 5950x would be the most sensible choice of course with power draw typically at around the 140 watt mark at full load but in either scenario there are new cpus from both intel and amd around the corner so the choice today probably isn't that important now one thing that's really important here when it comes to the motherboard choice is opting for something with a borderline overkill or just a really over-specced vrm if you can get something with a decent heatsink on it and just a ton of power stages that is really a good idea because we have no active airflow in this build whatsoever the one that we're going with here for example is the asus maximus 12 hero and this thing has 16 power stages rated for 90 amps each so honestly in this scenario running this vrm completely passive won't be an issue now installing the motherboard is probably the trickiest part of the entire build process first you need to install the mounting bracket onto the heatsink for whatever socket you're going with and i will note that the included spacers don't really do anything either way it's a pretty simple and straightforward process next though is really really fiddly basically you need to plug in a bunch of stuff into the motherboard before installing it the front i o the 8-pin cpu cable the 24-pin motherboard cable and the included pcie 4.0 riser cable the easiest way to do this is like shown with the bottom of the board facing the front of the case and of course with the entire build laying flat on its side here comes the real tricky part though you need to line up the motherboard with the mounting hardware that you just installed while at the same time making sure the cables are not getting jammed or blocked on the other side might take you about five minutes to get right but it is totally doable in the end then just tighten it all up with the included springs and thumb screws plug in the power supply cables and that's the hardest part over so yeah no motherboard tray or anything like that in your usual build the motherboard here is literally just attached by the heatsink but surprisingly it's held in there pretty well and lastly we have the gpu here we're going with the rtx 3080 trinity from zotac which is one of the few supported models on their compatibility list and despite being a fairly long cooler design the pcb is actually pretty compact which does help us out a little bit when it comes to installation this is also a really straightforward card when it comes to the tear down process just a small phillips head screwdriver and a bunch of screws nothing tricky just a really average teardown the first part of gpu installation is installing the heat spreader for our memory and vrm these components can get seriously hot if not cooled correctly so i would definitely recommend going with the spreader option as opposed to just sticking on your own heatsinks or even worse leaving that portion of the pcb completely bare the included spreader is from ek and is made pretty well so we need to mount this to the gpu heatsink while including some thermal paste in between to allow for some decent heat transfer then it's as simple as mounting on our rtx 3080 just as if you were bolting on a water block and then lastly comes the back plate all in all though the finished build looks pretty epic the completely closed look of the build is something that i'm a huge fan of and the tempered glass works really well to keep things looking clean and understated at the same time you can still see a bit of what's happening on the inside most notably the really unconventional hardware layout which is probably one of the most interesting things of this build for now though let's get to performance and with a 10 900k and an rtx 3080 in there it's clear that some tuning and under vaulting is necessary so let's start with the cpu monster labo claims that the cpu heatsink is rated for 150 watts of cooling in a completely passive state and after some tinkering our 10900k seemed good for a sustained 4.5 gigahertz at 1.13 volts across all 10 cores that's really not bad at all considering that's still a decent overclock compared to an actual default spec stock 10900k performance which at 125 watts typically sits at around 4.1 to 4.2 as for the gpu well that took a lot more tinkering to get things right but you can still get an rtx 3080 in here running completely passive no fans at all and holding clock speeds nice and steady but again you do have to kind of tune things and play around with it we'll get to that in a second but first it's important to understand how the airflow works in this case so you know relying purely on natural convection there isn't actually any cooling or airflow in the monster labor beast until things actually start heating up at that point the air becomes hotter less dense and so now being lighter rises upwards through the heatsink and starts cooling it and it's honestly really mind-blowing to feel the speed of which the air is moving through and upwards out of the case without a single fan definitely not something that i've seen before in any other pc build the gpu heatsink in the beast is rated for 250 watts of passive calling which is really insane but still that's not enough for our 320 watt rtx 3080 at least at stock so after a bit of tinkering this is the profile that worked for me in msi afterburner i set the voltage and frequency curve to 1710 megahertz at 743 millivolts which is a pretty hefty undervolt and i also locked the power limit to 70 to prevent the card pulling beyond that because another thing that ends up happening in this build is a power leakage scenario where the gpu exceeds 80 degrees c and because it's getting hotter it leaks more power to perform the same task so that power limit cap is really useful to prevent the gpu from doing that and instead it will just pull about 30 to 50 megahertz less from time to time but yeah in the end with this tuning profile i was able to get the 3080 running completely passive sitting at about 1700 megahertz and not budging from that after an hour of consistent use there was no air conditioning in the room no fans no windows open just pure natural convection doing its thing in the end that's about 150 to 200 megahertz less than what you'd expect from an actively called rtx 3080 but the difference here is that we are 100 silent what i would recommend though if you are going with an rtx 3080 or higher and especially if you're going with like an rtx 3080ti or a 3090 is by adding just a couple of 140mm fans at the top of the case and running those as exhaust sure it's not going to be completely silent anymore but you know even spinning these at like 600 700 rpm you can make quite a bit of a difference in gpu temperatures and the amount of performance that you can sustain it doesn't really make sense to spin these fans faster than that after all the heatsink design is optimized for slower moving air but even with these we can reclaim back about 150 megahertz the profile that worked here was setting the gpu clock to 1875 megahertz the voltage to about 870 millivolts and the power limit at 90 percent again without that power limit enforce we do run into a scenario where the gpu will just start using more power despite being undervaulted simply because it's getting hotter some of the time that meant even tipping over 300 watts despite normally operating at about 260 watts with this frequency and voltage at normal temperatures so yeah we're still losing a bit of performance here maybe 50 to 100 megahertz at most compared to stock but for virtually silent operation it is really hard to complain as for the cpu performance with that fan up top well our cpu temps drop about 10 degrees compared to before which is a slight improvement giving you about 100 to 200 megahertz of extra headroom if you do want to bump things up a bit with total cpu power sitting at around 190 watts monster libo claim up to watts of cpu load can be sustained in the fan assisted mode but that's likely with better fans with what we're working with here in the end though here's how the build sounded with and without those fans installed the last thing i'll mention here is the electrical noise which for a completely passive fanless build that is a really important topic of discussion but also a bit of a subjective one so when it comes to the gpu coil wine which is usually a big problem here it really wasn't i mean i barely noticed it at all in this build and that's with a 3080. sure the under vault here does help things quite a bit but i think the electrical design of the 3080 trinity from zotac just seems to be pretty good what was noticeable for me anyway was the high pitched noise coming from the power supply this is something that was really obvious to me although i did get used to it over time my partner on the other hand she could not hear it at all pc on pc off she really couldn't tell the difference it all sounded completely the same to her according to linus tech tips and their team they seemed to have pretty much the same experience as my partner they couldn't really hear anything so it's clear that this will differ from person to person just note though that if you are sensitive to high frequencies especially if you are a little bit younger and you have really good ears it's just something extra to consider overall though what this build can do is seriously impressive 400 watts of passive calling is right around what i was getting on this thing and if you do require or just really badly want a truly silent high performance system there actually is no other option the beast is by far the highest performance lowest compromised passively called system that exists today they do have a kickstarter campaign coming up in a few days if you are interested and there are plenty of customer bought builds out there from previous pre-orders if you want to check those out as well and honestly the pricing isn't even that offensive at around 900 to 1000 us dollars just looking at their previous campaigns you really are getting quite a lot for that kind of money the entire case all of the heatsinks the spreaders all of the accessories and when you consider what kind of money you would have to spend on like water cooling hardware to get close to these kind of noise levels i honestly think it would be quite comparable so i will leave this one linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
