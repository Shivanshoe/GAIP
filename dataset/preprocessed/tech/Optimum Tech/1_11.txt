gpu prices are tanking and at the same time news headlines of the rtx 4000 and rd and a3 gpus are popping up every day so what do you do do you buy a gpu at the current prices or do you wait a little bit longer and see what's coming next well i think it'd be a bit of a shame not to address this because it's kind of been my reality as a content creator around pc components for the last year and a half ever since these gpus launched they were really hard to get your hands on almost impossible and when you could they were really overpriced in every build guide in every gpu review there's always that disclaimer of if you can actually get your hands on them so it's nice to have that relief and finally see people being able to build the pcs that they want but at the same time i also do feel this kind of lingering hesitation by a lot of people by no means our gpu is just flying off the shelf for pretty much any card at any big retailer you'll see multiple models just sitting there every single day so starting with case king over in germany for example we have the white dots here on the graph which indicate the msrp for each gpu the colored dots indicating what you can actually expect to pay for them and then of course the colored lines here indicating how much that pricing is over msrp so most cards are still definitely above their listing price europe in particular has showed the least amount of price drop compared to other regions but there are still some cards like the 3070 ti for example which stand out as being pretty good value overall over in the uk the 37 eti continues to be a standard gpu in terms of value respective to the other models here so definitely keep an eye on that one with gpus like the 6800 and 6800 xt being surprisingly overpriced pck skier here in australia has seen some absolutely mammoth reductions though over the past couple of months rtx 3080s for example here have been consistently around the 2000 to 2500 aud mark and now they're in stock for around 1400 bucks again though check out that 3070 ti if you're in the market for a mid to high end gpu it's that one that's kind of standing out as the best value another gpu that i've kept my eye on here locally though is the 3060 and for a long time it was sitting here at around a thousand dollars aud but now thankfully the price is a lot more realistic and then over in the us which is where most of you are undoubtedly watching from very similar trend rx 6800 and 6800 xt pricing is way out of whack and here i'd mainly be looking at the rtx 3070 for something mid to high end in fact at just 600 usd that's only 100 above its launch msrp and you know about the margin you can expect for some of these triple fan custom card designs then taking a look at the budget-ish gpus they have also dropped a couple of bucks here and there with the 6600 in particular being the closest to msrp and looking like the preferred pick i will also say that you know rtx 3080 pricing pretty much in every region you know it has dropped substantially but it is still way off that 700 msrp so still quite a bit of room to drop there and hopefully we will see that because there are just plenty of cards just sitting around in stock then gpus like the 3080 ti 3090 and the 3090ti which i really didn't even bother including because it would have skewed the graph quite a bit they'll continue to be very very expensive now if we take a look at the recent steam hardware survey we can get a better idea of what gpus people are actually buying the most popular gpu upgrades people are making are to the 3060 and the 3070 with the 3060 ti not too far behind strangely we do also see people upgrading to the 2060 and 1060 despite those being much older models obviously the 2060 is still in production but that 1060 is kind of a weird one maybe secondhand gpus and also a bit of a fun fact here upgrades seem to be coming from budget pascal and touring gpus like the gtx 1650 and 1050 seeing as those were the largest drops so you could definitely upgrade i mean the prices are looking pretty good not ideal but you know not bad at all availability is also looking quite good you've got different retailers offering different graphics card models you can kind of take your pick or maybe even go for the cheapest one if you prefer but the real question is should you and obviously this is like a really hard question to tackle it's like extremely broad because everyone's in a different position but one thing i kind of want to get out there first is that if you've made it this far you know not upgrading your gpu and where a year and a half post launch now did you really need an upgrade because i feel like by this point you know these gpus they feel like they've been out for quite a while the people that really needed to upgrade probably have done so they probably stomached the extra cost and just moved on now there's undoubtedly a number of financially irresponsible people that probably also fall into that group but you get the picture most people who really needed an upgrade have probably done so already so what's left over at this point are people who simply refuse to upgrade without getting a good deal and people who are new to pc gaming in general so just something to think about if you're someone who is still hanging for an upgrade after this long just consider if you really needed an upgrade to begin with i would also say that you shouldn't fear kind of missing out on these good deals i know kind of everything is dropped all of a sudden but it's really been like this for the last month or two gpu prices are not going anywhere all of these cards are kind of remaining in stock so by all means if you are putting together a new pc i would you know maybe even recommend doing it week by week shopping around and trying to get an even better deal now the key phrase there being week by week and not month by month or else you might as well wait for the next generation of gpus planned later this year that would be the rtx 4000 series from nvidia and the rdna 3 series from amd i'm not going to dive too deep into the leaks because it's not really what we do here and because we are quite a few months out from expecting anything but after nvidia's data breach last month most leaks point towards a huge bump in cuda cores paired with a bunch more power draw this will be their lovelace architecture and it will operate on the tsmc 5 nanometer process compared to the current ampere architecture which is made on 8 nanometer samsung don't get too caught up in the exact nanometer figures these days they're merely an indication of increased transistor density not a measurement of the transistor pitch like it was previously on the note of rdna 3 leaks from amd there's nothing really concrete at all amd hasn't had any data breaches recently so all we know at this point is that they're confident that new gpus are on track for the second half of this year and it's rumored to be on a mix of five nanometer and six nanometer both companies at the moment are reasonably tied when it comes to gaming performance and it's really anyone's guess what could happen next until then i wouldn't recommend wasting too much energy on speculation but a good estimate of five to seven months is probably when you can expect these to come out it's also less likely that we'll see an out of stock error like last time nvidia and amd will hopefully be a bit more prepared this time with more stock and better security and mining profitability seems to be on a bit of a downward trend so there's probably less people interested in these upcoming gpus exclusively for mining and i also think there's going to be less people in general interested in whatever's coming next rtx 4000 rd and a3 because people who kind of upgrade their pc on a two to three generation cycle kind of maybe have already done so i mean there are a lot of people who upgraded to rtx 3000 for example and i highly doubt they're going to be upgrading again to rtx 4000. now if you have decided that you do need to upgrade your gpu maybe you just want more fps or you wouldn't mind faster render times then i would actually encourage you to do so sure new gpus are coming out later this year but that's kind of how it is every second to third year you don't get caught up playing this waiting game for the next generation every single time because that game can be played indefinitely so after so long of these cards being so expensive and so out of stock it is finally nice to see that kind of switch around and at least for the next few months we have cards that are actually in stock and people can actually build and upgrade the pcs that they want if you are interested i will leave some links down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
