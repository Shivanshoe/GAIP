all right so here we have it the new rtx 3060 which is launching today at an msrp of 329 us this is an extremely popular price point of gpu and no doubt a lot of gtx 1060 owners out there will be looking at the 3060 wondering if it is worth the upgrade too so that's exactly what we're going to take a look at today and overall there is a lot of things to consider if you are kind of thinking about picking up the 3060 for example is the 360 ti potentially worth the extra cash or maybe should you wait for what amd has to offer around the corner let's take a look [Music] let's start with the spec changes first versus the rtx 3060 ti because there are a lot more changes here than you'd expect firstly there's a massive 26 percent reduction in crude core count 3584 versus the ti's 4864 although clock speeds are a little bit higher on paper we do get 12 gigabytes of gddr6 video memory as opposed to eight gigabytes that'll make more sense in just a moment but the bus width and consequently the peak bandwidth are a big cut down from the 3060 ti tdp is 30 watts lower and we're looking at a 330 product as opposed to 400 although don't be too confident with that pricing one reason for that is that the rtx 3060 will only be offered in custom card variants like this which are absolutely fine i have no problem with these at all especially when it comes to cooling just a 170 watt gpu but the problem here is that there is no real way to enforce that 330 base msrp as many of you have seen with the rtx 3070 and 3080 the only way to really get those gpus at msrp like the exact msrp is to buy the founders edition models if you were lucky enough to have them offered in your region so for all of my friends watching in australia and new zealand this doesn't really affect us because the founders edition model weren't available to purchase in the first place and we get absolutely slapped when it comes to custom board pricing anyway but i can definitely see this affecting the real available pricing of the 3060 in other regions so then what's to stop ethereum miners buying these things in bulk like they have done with previous 30 series launches well supposedly nvidia have enforced a hash rate limiter on the rtx 3060 which effectively cuts the mining performance in half i did ask my contacts at nvidia about this limit and how it's done and i won't quote their exact answer but they seem pretty confident that it can't be bypassed another effort to persuade cryptocurrency miners away from buying gaming gpus is with the introduction of nvidia's cryptocurrency mining processors or cmps for short i'm not going to talk about these in detail but my thoughts are pretty consistent with what linus had to say in this video right here nvidia have also worked with motherboard partners to include resizable bar support for the rtx 30 series gpus and that starts here with the 3060. for those familiar with amd's smart access memory that's essentially what this is allowing the cpu to take advantage of gpu memory this is likely one of the reasons that the 3060 has 12 gigabytes of memory as opposed to the six or eight gigabytes that you'd expect in this class gains here are going to be a little bit all over the place expected to be anywhere between zero and ten percent at this point it's probably worth enabling if your motherboard supports it but i need to test a lot more games to determine the average gain over just the standard memory usage but overall what can we expect from the average rtx 3060 performance let's start off by looking at the brief evolution of this series of gpu from the gtx 10 series till now the six gigabyte gtx 1060 over on the left there launched at 300 us back in mid 2016 then we had the rtx 2060 at 349 dollars at the beginning of 2019 and now we have the 329 360. so at 1440p resolution this is a capable gpu and as you'd expect it's faster than both its predecessors by a considerable chunk but the distance between the 2060 and the 3060 might not be as much as some of you had expected given what we've seen from other 30 series gpus like the 30 70 and 3080. nvidia state that the rtx 3060 performance should line up right around rtx 2070 performance and as we can see that's pretty much what we get the bigger question though do you get this or the rtx 3060 ti well it's not until you put the 3060 right next to the 3060 ti that you realize how much of a performance difference there are between these two gpus remember we're getting a 26 reduction in cuda core count here from the ti model and a slower memory bandwidth with that you'd expect about a 25 to 30 percent reduction in performance and that's exactly what we see here in cyberpunk 2077. another side by side comparison shows this as well shadow of the tomb raider at 1080p the 3060 is no doubt a measurable bump over the 2060 but against the 3060 ti there is really a wide gap of course the 360 ti is more expensive but it does raise a few questions which we'll answer by the end of this video then at 1440p we get the expected result of the around rtx 2070 performance which nvidia state but here we can see that the 360 ti is 25 faster for 21 more cash if we're going off the msrp figure so to be honest what 350 dollars bought you a year ago versus now with the 3060 it's not a massive difference in terms of normal gaming performance if you do have an rtx 2060 or rx 5700 for example you're most of the way there personally i'm not one to complain when we get a gpu that's faster than its predecessor at the same price even if it's 10 faster i still think it's a better product but here i think there is something else at play so here's the thing the performance of the rtx 3060 puts it in a position which is very easy for amd to counter with something like an rx 6700 or 6700 xt which we know are on the way soon when that point comes nvidia have given themselves a lot of room to play with here between the 3060 and 3060 ti and then they'll potentially offer a 3060 super card with more performance at around 350 dollars so making a comparison across 10 games at 1080p i found the 360 ti to average 148.3 fps whereas the standard 3060 average 117.4 oddly enough this lines up pretty much with the cuda core percentage difference between the two where the 3060 ti is 26 faster what's more interesting is that i found the 3060 ti to be the slightly better value gpu offering more fps per dollar despite it being the more expensive gpu which is pretty unusual to see when we bump things up to 1440p the 3060 ti stretches that lead a little bit further now 27 faster on average across 10 games and this might be the faster memory bandwidth taking effect then the big chunk of missing cuda cores versus the 3060 ti can also be seen in production workloads where both blender and v-ray show a noticeable performance deficit versus the ti variant performance as a whole though is still really exceptional for a 329 gpu with performance exceeding both the rtx 2070 and even the 2080 in these workloads although the nerfed memory bandwidth means that video editors should probably throw in the extra cash for the ti variant or a higher end 30 series gpu sure we do have 12 gigabytes of vram to play with here versus the 8 gigabytes but most general users working with 4k footage and lower might benefit more from the ti's wider bus width and lastly thermals for the gigabyte eagle card that i used for my launch day review sat under 70 degrees c on an open test bench with clock speeds around 1900 megahertz overall this is pretty expected performance and it looks like a dual fan cooler can handle this gpu no problem at all so overall the rtx 3060 is probably the first 30 series gpu where i kind of caution you before picking up you know the 30 70 30 80 and even the 360 ti are great value when it comes to gaming and i think can't really be beaten but the 3060 i mean the 360ti is just much better value unless in your region somehow the 3060 is the much better pick at least you have those average fps values to kind of plug in your own currency and price points and make the decision for yourself i think the bigger play here is going to be an rtx 3060 super once amd launched their 6700 series cards because as great as it would have been it just doesn't make sense for nvidia to lay all of their cards on the table just yet before we see what amd has to offer at around the same price point and i do want to reiterate that this is not a bad or slow gpu by any means and of course pricing in norwegian might change the conclusion for this entire video and if you're just gaming at 1080p resolution you can get a really solid gaming experience especially if the games that you're interested support dlss and ray tracing value wise though the 3060 ti is just better if we're going off the msrp figures and i do think that this card will be counted in about a month or two so really hope this helped you out if you are interested in the 3060 or some other gpus i will leave them linked down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
