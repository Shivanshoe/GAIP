for those of you who didn't know i currently swap between two monitors for my own desk setup one is a 4k 60hz ips panel from lg for video editing and content creation and the other is alienware's 240hz 1080p tn panel for high refresh rate gaming and today that changes because this monitor claims to deliver the best of both worlds a display that is suitable for both professional media use with its 4k nano ips 10 bit panel whilst also delivering a 144 hertz refresh rate with one millisecond response times that combination is extremely valuable to me as an end user so much so that i paid full price for this monitor with the full intention of using it as my primary gaming display so after a few days let's see if it really is possible to replace two of my current monitors with just this now i won't spend too long on the design because let's face it there are a lot more interesting things to talk about here the stand is okay it's sturdy enough to keep the actual display nice and rigid but for some reason i did expect it to be at least part made of metal but it's unfortunately just entirely plastic there's also a red layer on the bottom of the stand that i'll probably end up painting black you've also got this huge rgb ring on the back of the monitor and i was surprised just how bright this actually gets it is enough to throw a bit of light on the back of the wall behind it and potentially reduce eye strain and it is easily controllable with a small scroll wheel my favorite part about the entire design though is without a doubt those ultra slim bezels these are the slimmest bezels that i've seen on any gaming monitor to date and it's just so refreshing to see there really is nothing more that i want from a monitor design so big thumbs up to lg here you've also got plenty of adjustment in every direction except swivel but for most users i don't see that as an issue so let's tackle the first and easy part of this monitor first and that's when it comes to content creation and professional media use my own use cases for this display are revolving around video editing as most of you could probably guess more specifically uh editing and color grading the 12-bit raw footage that you are watching right now that demands critically accurate colors with a wide color gamut and that's exactly what the 27 gn 950 gives you out of the box the white point is spot on at 6 500 kelvin and we get superb color gamut coverage over 96 of dc ip3 this is objectively and just my opinion the best looking panel that i've ever seen and it's an absolute pleasure to work with for color critical work and some of you might be wondering why not go for an ultra wide if you're going to be video editing and a lot of it does come down to personal preference although i used to edit on a 3440x1440 resolution ultrawide i'm now really enjoying working with a higher density 4k panel i have window scaling reduced to 125 percent from the default 150 which ultimately gives me more pixel screen real estate to work with in the end but now let's get to the important stuff and that's 4k gaming specifically 4k gaming at 144 hertz and i'll just start off by saying that 4k gaming has really been used to sell this incredibly immersive experience beyond anything else but it's not the sheer resolution that creates that really immersive gaming experience that most of you are after but in fact more often than not it's refresh rate and frame rate so i played a fairly large variety of games here to test things out everything from call of duty warzone to the new star wars squadrons red dead redemption 2 and also valorent and the experience was mixed in games where i could hit 144 frames per second or even exceed it the gaming experience was simply awesome it really is the best of both worlds but games where i couldn't hit that target even ones that ran at around 100 frames per second the experience was honestly kind of average so 4k gaming all of those pixels and all of that detail is really worth nothing without a high refresh rate and frame rate by its side otherwise not only will your games look like a blurry mess but your inputs into the game world will feel severely delayed and to be confidently gaming at 4k in a range of titles today you'd ideally be pairing this display with an rtx 3080 or a 3090 if you can somehow justify the over 2x price jump and 24 gigabytes of vram i did test the 27 gn 950 on both an rtx 2080 ti and the rtx 3090 and the experience was actually very clear cut between them the 30 90 delivers around 45 to 50 percent more performance than the 2080 ti at 4k and that's the difference between getting 100 fps or completely maxing out the adaptive refresh rate here of 144 fps speaking of which this monitor is both freesync and g-sync compatible so there's adaptive refresh rate here regardless if you're using an amd or nvidia gpu however to achieve 4k and 144hz you'll need to make sure that your system is running a gpu that supports display stream compression over displayport 1.4 that means an rtx 20 series or rx 5000 series gpu or newer otherwise you'll be limited to 4k 60hz and on the topic of response times they're about what i expected from a 144hz ips panel but maybe with a bit more ghosting the 27gn 950 has three response time modes normal fast and faster the last of which is what lg likely used to obtain that one millisecond greater gray response time result as we can see though this results in brutally obvious pixel overdrive artifacts and i'd consider this fairly unusable and distracting in game the other two modes normal and fast seem close enough to recommend either one but i do think the normal setting just looks slightly better it's not until we compare it to one of the fastest displays on the market currently though asus 360hz ips that we can see just how much more smearing the lg actually has this isn't to say that the 27g n950 is unusable for competitive shooters because that is far from the truth but i think this just shows that yes you definitely will get improved motion clarity on many of the faster 240hz and 360hz monitors out there so with that in mind would i consider this fast enough to realistically replace the 240hz 1080p monitor that i use as my primary gaming display and actually with a powerful enough gpu yes in most games games that i don't consider super competitive 144hz is by no means slow at all and at 4k resolution this is pretty much as good as pc gaming currently gets however in those try hard competitive shooters that i like to play like valorent cs go and overwatch although this is more than feasible in those titles i'll still be keeping my 240hz display on standby for those sweaty competitive sessions but again for most titles especially the ones that i've been playing a lot lately like star wars squadrons and warzone this really hits that sweet spot between speed and immersion and best of all it's an excellent display for professional creative use so after a night of video editing if i want to play a quick few rounds i can easily do that for me that is extremely valuable however if you are not after a monitor that also doubles as a display for creative use and one with supreme color accuracy or 4k resolution then i would definitely steer you in a different direction something like a 1440p 165 hertz or even a 240hz monitor at the same price would be a much better use for most of you out there and as i alluded to earlier in the video try not to get sucked into the 4k gaming hype that's not really why i bought this monitor it's mainly for that 144hz refresh rate which is really what makes the 27gn 950 worthwhile in my opinion 4k gaming is definitely nice don't get me wrong but i'd much rather be playing at 1440p 144hz or 165hz than 4k at 60hz or 100hz so if you are looking for an upgrade i will leave this one and a few others linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
