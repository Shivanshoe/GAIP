it's no secret that intel are lagging behind AMD a little bit when it comes to the desktop CPU market right now but things are about to get really really interesting we've now got the full picture of what to expect from Intel's tenth generation desktop CPU lineup and without them advancing their 14 nanometer manufacturing process to say 10 nanometer or seven nanometer like AMD they're basically throwing everything they can at these new CPUs to improve performance that's from adding hyper threading across almost the entire process of line up to claiming boost clocks of up to five point three gigahertz as well as an improved thermal design so today we'll be discussing all of that plus a little bit more so I think first of all let's take a quick look at the entire 10th generation processor lineup because there are quite a few big changes here so Intel's flagship product here is the eye 9/10 900k it's a 10 core 20 thread CPU with a single core boost of up to five point three gigahertz and then all core of up to four point nine pricing there has an RCP of 488 u.s. dollars but keep in mind that our CP doesn't reflect what the MSRP or shelf price of these products will actually be so expect the 10900 k to be around the $500 mark once it actually hits stores this makes it a direct competitor to AMD's rise in 3900 X which can be had for around 550 at the time of filming but you do get an extra two calls and four threads there so we'll wait and see how the benchmarks pan out between those two but I think it's gonna be really interesting so I think the big number that sticks out there is definitely 5.3 gigahertz because 10 cores and 20 threads that's nothing that impressive compared to what AMD's putting out with the 3900 X and 3950 X not to mention those processors came out quite a while ago so 5.3 gigahertz that makes it a 300 megahertz up with from something like at 9900 K and you know we're still working within the 14 nanometer process so it's going to be quite interesting to actually validate that and you know what we can expect in terms of overclocking across all cause moving down the products stack is where things get really interesting though the i7s now get the hype threading back whereas Intel had removed this previously with nitrogen to create some product segmentation but with the 10 700 K we get an 8 core 16 thread processor with a single core booster 5.1 and the pricing here will sit right between the risin 3,700 X and 3800 X making this very competitive on paper honestly though the processor I'm most curious about is the i5 10 600 K because finally we have hyper threading on the i5 S on paper this looks like a decent competitor to the Rison 5 3600 although pricing does have the Intel processor a bit more expensive also note that memory spec here it's back down to ddr4 2666 with the i5 s and below whereas the i7 and I nines now have been raised through 29:33 by default do note though that's only a consideration for the locked non K processors on boards other than a Z 490 moving down to even the new a3 models again we get hyper threading across all the processes here which is great and these will compete directly against that new Rison 330 130 300 X which we will be reviewing very soon one big mistake here though in my opinion is the fact that there isn't any quad core processor here with overclocking enabled because when you're claiming that this silicon can hit five gigahertz all call no problem I think that's a big missed opportunity one clear reason that until I've done this is to sort of encourage consumers to spend a bit more money and get an overclockable I 5 or I 7 instead but consumers who are looking at these budget products might even just look in the other direction instead and get a rise in CPU even if most consumers buying overclockable processors don't even overclock them in the end especially these sort of budget and our CPU is like a risin three it is still a nice to have feature to be able to overclock if you want and I think that definitely plays on the purchasing decision of the consumer now seeing as inter are still working with the 14 nanometer manufacturing process pumping more cores and higher clock speeds into the same silicon without improving power efficiency like AMD has can only lead to more power and heat so to improve the thermal design and attempt to overcome this again this is something that we will test although this could just be for i7 and I 9s a thinner CPU die and heat spreader has been implemented we are also working again with the solar thermal interface material between the two just as with ninth gen as Intel has absolutely no business using thermal paste at this point with 14 nanometer also Intel have taken a page out of AMD's books here when it comes to selective CPU called boosting all i7 + i9 CPUs will now be able to prioritize the best performing CPU cores for single and dual core workloads and now one of the drawbacks Intel's chipset lifecycle which typically only lasts around two CPU generations and that means that this time around with 10th gen processors you will need a new 400 series motherboard that means AZ 490 motherboard if you're interested in overclocking one of those K series CPUs I do have a couple of those on hand at the moment that I'm looking forward to testing as well as a few more on the way also 10th gen CPUs and the Z 490 chipset now support 2.5 cubed Ethernet and Wi-Fi 6 for a nice little update in faster networking and lastly there's an update coming to Intel's XTU overclocking and tuning software most notably with 10th gen you will now be able to set a custom voltage and frequency curve so pretty advanced overclocking a lot more than what most people will need but it's great to see that feature now for enthusiasts so I think this is definitely one of the bigger rebuttals that we've seen from Intel toward AMD ever since the first generation rise in CPUs launched one of the biggest reasons that these are so popular Rison 5 CPUs is because they're capitalizing on the fact that the competitor Intel Core i5 s do not have to processing threads per core whereas the Reisman 5 CPUs do so now that we do have that enabled on the Intel Core i5 lineup there's finally going to be some really solid competition there in terms of the high-end SKUs I think the rise in 3950 X will undoubtedly still hold the crown when it comes to multi-core performance but I think the 3900 X + 10 910 be a pretty close match up Intel's big focus here is clearly on clock speed and that 5.3 gigahertz number and that's what they're good at so it will be interesting to see whether that is attainable across all CPU cores with overclocking and if so what amount of power and voltage of that would require there are of course advantages that AMD still holds over Intel like being able to overclock any of their CPUs on pretty much any affordable motherboard as well but we'll get into all of that in the full review until then I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments down below a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
