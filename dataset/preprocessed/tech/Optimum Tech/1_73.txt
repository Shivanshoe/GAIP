this is the most expensive itx case that i've ever reviewed at 500 us dollars once you add in the few necessary options that's what it comes out to and surprisingly it's one that you guys have been absolutely begging me to check out and it's called the winter one and it promises both the best at build quality and the best airflow that you can get from a space optimized itx case essentially if you're building a custom water cooled pc with an rtx 3090 and two radiators and sparing absolutely no expense along the way this might be something that you're actually interested in so let's get this thing built up and see if in any world there is a way to possibly justify that price [Music] so unboxing the winter one this might surprise some of you but you do actually have to assemble the case first just like with the form t1 for those of you who are familiar with that case all of the parts do come flat packed and stored individually but there are two main reasons for this for one it helps lower the price of the final product and the shipping cost and also because building in the winter one you would need to disassemble most of the case first anyway and just like the t1 assembling the case is super rewarding because the parts that you're working with here are unbelievably high quality i mean it truly is seriously insane for a pc case and easily up there with the best all of the panels are anodized and sandblasted aluminium which leaves a super premium finish kind of like an apple macbook and the machining too here is absolutely flawless at least on this review sample the power button here too is pretty cool and uses a kale box switch for some extra tactility and so the build quality of this case is borderline obsessive i'll say it's really really good machine work is super solid but the airflow design is what has me most interested because that as well has been kind of approached in the most optimal way so we've seen with previous sandwich layout cases like this where you have the spine in the middle and you've got your two separate compartments that negative pressure is what works the best that means pulling air out of the case and then kind of encouraging air through the side panels to your components so if you're using an air cooled build for example that means that you'll have the freshest air coming through the side panels and kind of leading to the best temperatures for your graphics card and cpu cooler but also if you're using a liquid cooled build it's really important too because that means that both radiators get the kind of cleanest freshest air and they're not passing hot air from one to the other the cutouts in the panels as well for airflow are huge compared to your typical pc case which i can see a lot of people actually not liking visually but they do offer much less restriction if you're not interested in these perforated side panels you do have the option to go with solid ones instead and there you do save a few bucks but for a high performance system i would recommend going for the fully perforated ones they do look super interesting as well i do like the look of them personally but just be warned they do reveal a lot of your interior components in the end we're left with a super high quality 15 and a half liter case that's a bit bigger than the nk sam1 and a bit smaller than the nr200 but costs more than these two cases put together at this size it's pretty much perfect for a high performance desktop itx pc but definitely not something that i recommend traveling around with now building the case up i did unfortunately find a couple of imperfections that are worth noting firstly one of the side panels was actually somehow bent and didn't line up with the top panel at all which really at any price point is something that's worth noting but for a 500 case it's just straight up offensive i did manage to straighten it out with a bit of manual force which no user should have to do but it is what it is and now with the panel straight it is actually somehow a bit loose which means that you do get this annoying rattle also the anodizing on the side panels is lighter and more matte compared to the rest of the case which can be a bit jarring in certain lighting and same with the rear bracket that secures the graphics card anodizing is always a really challenging thing for these cases and it's really hard to get it consistent across all panels but for a 500 case i would expect this to be consistent all right but enough talk about the shell of the case and the build quality let's take a look at what you can actually fit inside here and i think the most important thing to point out for the winter one is that it's mostly optimized around a complete liquid cooling loop that is a full custom ward called build sure you can do an air cooled build or an aio build like this with an air cooled graphics card but at that point there is a bit of volume at the bottom of the case that does go to waste because you don't have a bottom radiator and let's be real the only way that you can really justify the price of this case is with a really high end fully water cooled system now for whatever reason if you do want to stick an air cooled graphics card in the winter one you can fit up to an rtx 3090 fe in here if you're just going with top mounted fans and not a radiator and cpu cooler height tops out at 70 millimeters allowing you to run an octa and hl12s and then for aios and liquid cooling 240 or 280mm rads can be installed at the top and bottom with a total of 57 mils of clearance to play with so your typical 30mm thick radiator paired with your standard 25mm thick fans do make for a really close fit just make sure that you also double check the width and length of the radiators that you're planning on using though because many will actually be too big as for actually building in the winter one it's easy enough but still a far cry from something like an n case or an nr200 where you basically just open up the side panel drop in your hardware and call it a day to start with the built-in i o shield on my motherboard was somehow preventing the standoffs from lining up correctly so i had to remove that before getting the board fully installed secondly the power switch cables are way too short luckily i didn't have a problem with them here but plenty of other boards definitely will then getting the gpu riser cable to properly clear the top mounted fans on the aio was a bit more challenging than i've seen in other cases and graphics card mounting itself is just barely adequate it has a lot more play than i'd like the final fit and finish of the case as well is something that i'll just re-mention with the front and rear panel not completely lining up with the top panel which is a bit disappointing and for those wondering it was actually like this before installing any hardware now although this is primarily a custom loop focused case let's take a look at what the thermal performance of our test system looks like here against other itx cases not surprisingly the winter one is towards the top of the stack with some very cool performance under a 70 degree average here for our overclock 10 900k it's only beaten by the subs meshlicious when that case is running a positive pressure setup and intaking air from the front but when it's also running a negative pressure setup which is better for the gpu like the winter one that's where the winter one can beat it by a single degree this makes it about two degrees cooler than the nr200 and about eight degrees cooler than the encase m1 gpu thermals for the rtx 3080 fe are also very strong especially for a sandwich style case tying the thermal and noise performance that you get from one of the highest airflow mid towers that you can get on the market the phantek p500a it is beaten here by the nr200 by one degree but considering the difference in noise level i'd say that overall performance here is about equal so overall thermals here are pretty good i think most of us expected that but the true thermal capacity of this case isn't fully realized until you go ahead and build a custom loop with two radiators along with some serious hardware at that point you're almost certainly going to exceed what you can do in an nk sem1 or a meshlicious or an nr200 but to the credit of those cases they are significantly cheaper and are in no way limiting in terms of thermals not to mention they also aren't covered in massive holes from front to back to achieve that kind of thermal performance in this way they can kind of disguise the interior of your system a little bit better to be completely honest with you guys i'm not sure if i will actually get around to building a custom loop in this case because this aio based build was tedious enough and i really don't know how many of you actually care about a custom loop in this case because it is really expensive and that's the other thing for that price i was just left a little bit frustrated with certain aspects of it at that price it should definitely not have mismatched or misaligned panels but here we have both my top itx case recommendations are still the nk71 the nr200 and the subte meshlicious those cases are much easier to build in less than half the price and you won't need to wait around till the end of the year to actually get them technically you can get the pricing of the winter one down to 389 us with no options but with just a 3.0 riser and solid panels it's almost an even harder sell in my opinion so to the small team behind the winter one what you have here is a really really good starting point the machining and the anodizing for 99 of the case is really really good and some of the best that i've ever seen but i can really tell that this is your first pc case some of the work here that just you know like the gpu not fitting and the side panel is not aligning properly that stuff really needs to be perfect for an upwards of a 500 uspc case and the pricing isn't even the biggest problem here because i know plenty of people who are you know putting an rtx 3090 and a 5900x and liquid cooling it in a case like this and they are more than fine to pay that kind of money for their high-end system but again for that price the case really needs to be perfect so i think that's where we'll personally leave the winter one for those interested i will leave links down below and i'd love to hear your thoughts down there as well as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
