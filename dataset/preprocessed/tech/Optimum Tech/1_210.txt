so on paper these two CPUs look very very similar for cause eight threads both on AMD's 7 nanometre architecture same memory cache and boost clocks are around 300 megahertz apart if you're an average consumer you'll probably just choose the cheaper one and save a few bucks but that would be a big mistake because under the covers the core layout of these two CPUs is quite different and in my testing I've seen these lead to significantly different results even when clock speeds voltage power are equal between the r3 3100 and the r3 3,300 X you could be looking at up to a 10% performance difference in production workloads and gaming and also a difference in CPU thermals as well again same clock speeds same power output the different performance and different thermals when it comes to these two quad-core CPUs of the same generation in some games and workloads you're not talking about a small difference either so let's take a look at those differences and see what you need to know if you're interested in these two new rising 3 CPUs now I'm not going to focus this video on comparing these new rising 3 CPUs to Intel's ninth gen C P use although of course there will be some comparisons in the benchmarks to follow you shouldn't be making a purchasing decision just yet until Intel's 10th gen TV use are released those 10th gen I threes will be seriously competitive against these rising three CPUs and most of you should wait to see what those have to offer however I will say that if you do have a Rison 3 1st gen or 2nd gen CPU on a be 450 motherboard can't be a 320 or B 350 then these new horizon 3 CPUs will be a very very smart upgrade for 100 to 120 dollars it really is going to be a big performance bump from what you currently have so the main difference between these two CPUs is not the fact that one is 20 dollars cheaper than the other or one boost 300 megahertz higher it's that the internal core layout on the 3300 X offers lower latency and better performance in some cases that performance bump is significant the Rison 3100 has to cause across 2 CC axes a 2 + to configuration whereas the 3300 ex has a four plus zero configuration four cores packed into a single CCX again even when clock speeds are equal there's still a performance difference between the two and a thermal difference as well but before we dive into that let's take a look at how these two CPUs perform out of the box so in a blender render with no cooling limitations we're using a 240 mil a IO on an open test bench here the 3300 X will naturally pull a bit more voltage and power than the 3100 and boost around 300 megahertz higher as well and it's not just a little bit more power we're looking at around 20 watts more power draw but when you run them on the Wraith stealth cooler that comes stock with both processes that's where things get really interesting the 3300 ex runs at significantly hotter than the 3100 now although this is partly due to the 10 watts of extra power draw this is mostly due to the difference in the core layout between these two processes remember the 3300 ex has a completely saturated quad-core CCX just like the risin 3950 X and so power and heat density is a lot greater than the r3 3100 but that additional heat density may be worth it because as we walk through these production workload benchmarks we can see a significant difference between the our 330 130 300 X now aside from these differences between the two that we're highlighting here taking a big step back these processors absolutely destroy ninth gen f3 and even the i5 when it comes to any multi-threaded workloads and whereas the 1st gen and 2nd gen rise in 3 processes were kind of miserable when it came to any light production workloads the 30 130 300x are very very capable having said that if you are after the most multi-threading performance that you can get per dollar you might be better off with the previous gen 6 Corizon 520 600 if you can find that for a good deal but when it comes to gaming we see even more of a performance difference between the 30 130 300x especially in those cpu intensive titles in some cases you think that these two CPUs are from two completely different generations whereas the Arthur 30-100 typically performs around the r5 2600 in gaming the 3300 ex is consistently around the 3600 thanks to its lower latency and fastest single total performance this is completely out of the box stock performance though and the common understanding which is usually right is that you can just take the r3 3100 overclock it up to 3300 X speeds and get the same if not more performance but unfortunately that is not the case with both the r3 thirty one hundred and thirty three hundred x clock to four point four gigahertz the 3300 X is still two percent faster in Cinebench eight percent faster in our Lightroom export and eight percent faster in v-ray but there are even larger differences when it comes to gaming it's pretty clear at this point which Rison 3 processor is the better choice and also that overclocking won't save the r3 3100 in Rainbow six siege for example there's still an 8% difference between them when they're at the same speed and that performance difference seems to be fairly consistent or I would say even minimum compared to what you can expect in other titles it's not a clear win for the 3300 X though because as we looked at before packing all four cores into a single node means that you're getting a greater heat and power density compared to the r3 3100 this means that if you are interested in overclocking the 3300 X you won't be able to do that with the stock of red stealth cooler but you can on the r3 3100 however ultimately the 3300 X is the better choice over the 3100 just in terms of raw performance and I would recommend just running at stock alongside a fast memory kit but if you are interested in overclocking you can do that with an aftermarket cooler down the road v 3300 X is a really solid upgrade over something like an r3 1200 or 2200 G there it's a very smart 120 dollar upgrade that'll see a massive performance boost for your system both for production workloads and gaming however if you do not have a current B 450 system with the first gen or second general rise in CPU and you're looking to upgrade to one of these new rising 3 CPUs I would highly recommend just waiting until the 10th gen r3 cpus are released that way if you're looking to build fresh budget system from the ground up you've got a clear view of what both sides have to offer instead of just jumping the gun now and perhaps maybe even regretting it because there's quad-core 8 footed Intel CPUs are going to be quite good when it comes to gaming I think that's what most people are expecting otherwise if you are interested in either the 3100 or 3,300 X I will leave them linked down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
