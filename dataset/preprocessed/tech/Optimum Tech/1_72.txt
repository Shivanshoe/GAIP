all right so you know times are tough when i'm getting excited over a pre-built gaming pc typically the consensus has been that building something yourself you can save a ton of money which can then allow you to budget for better pc hardware these days though as we know things are a bit different actually getting your hands on a current gen gpu is incredibly difficult and even if you can prices are absolute insanity to give you an idea this rtx 3060 ti should retail for about 400 to 500 us which here in australia that would mean about seven to eight hundred aud instead these are going for double that at around 1500 aud this entire pc on the other hand only cost me 2 000 aud and it does include an i7 which is an 8 core cpu you've got 512 gigs of nvme storage and some reasonably fast memory in there as well and i did also add a liquid cooler but we'll talk about that in just a minute but today we're going to see if this is actually worth it and what you need to know if you are going to buy one as well so if you're buying a double xps pre-built this is what you get the enclosure itself is actually reasonably compact which i can appreciate and aesthetically i think we can agree it's an okay design as well the entire xps enclosure comes in at just 18.9 liters in total volume which technically passes this as a small form factor case it is just made of steel and plastic though so don't expect much in terms of build quality then at the front you'll have your power button and a ton of front i o including usb type-c and a handy sd card reader otherwise it's a very basic looking pc and opening it up it looks even more basic and oem than you could imagine this specific machine is fitted with an eight core intel i7 eleven seven hundred sixteen gigabytes of memory clocked at 29.33 megahertz one and a half terabytes of total storage including m.2 nvme for the boot drive and the main event of course the rtx 3060 ti this is the entire reason that this xps pre-built is interesting in the first place dell being a big system integrator and maker of pre-builds they are among the first priority when it comes to gpu stock allocation so that's why they're able to get 30 series cards in the first place while you can't get them at retailers and that's also why the pricing isn't so bad either also the 360ti oem card that's included here does seem to be actually not bad it's a very compact two slot dual fan cooler design and a section of the back plate is cut out to allow for some of that hot air to escape towards the case's rear exhaust fan i'm also very happy to report that there's nothing horrific here to note when opening up that side panel and this machine does at least seem to be assembled with some care cable management is good enough all of the connectors are plugged in where they should be and the ram dimms are inserted in the correct slots i also do like the anti-sag bracket for the graphics card which is mostly to keep it nice and safe during transport then as for the power supply it's an 80 plus platinum 500 watt unit and for future gpu upgrades you have an 8 plus 6 pin pcie connector so what would something like this cost if you were to build it yourself well sticking to the australian market just to keep it as an apples to apples comparison it would cost me about 600 or 30 percent more not factoring in case fans aftermarket cpu cooler or a windows license key in the us this spec would put us at around 1800 usd which is definitely less of a deal than the one i've got here but still not bad at all given the current circumstances and you do have a lot more customization there in the us market alright but that's enough talk let's see if this thing is actually any good one of the first things that you'll want to do on any pre-built gaming pc is a complete wipe of all of the third-party software this stuff cripples performance by running in the background uses up a ton of memory and is just generally not useful this dell xps 3060 ti machine is no exception upon boot i was constantly spammed with pop-ups for the installed antivirus and dell's own support software but most concerningly there was an audio driver process that was absolutely eating up all of the memory no exaggeration here you can literally see it consuming more and more ram by the second until total ram usage for the system is completely maxed out why this real tech audio process running in the background needs over 11 gigabytes of system memory i have absolutely zero clue it was also causing the cpu to pull a hefty 70 watts plus just idling which meant that a few cores here would consistently sit above 85 degrees c and that meant that the fan speed was pretty audible there just sitting on the desktop at this point i just did a fresh install of windows expecting it to be totally clean afterwards but unfortunately it seems that dell pre-built will default back to reinstalling their version of windows with all of the bloatware that's originally on it so that means that the antivirus and general dell junk was just back on it and also the super weird real tech audio driver that eventually consumes all the memory was back as well so really the only option that you have here is to manually uninstall all of these third-party apps and then as for fixing the real tech audio driver you need to open services enter that specific process and then restart your pc now for whatever reason it won't consume a bunch of memory and strangely system audio sounds exactly the same so at this point we're ready to talk about performance how exactly does a dell xps machine with a 3060 ti in there perform when it comes to gaming and heavy workloads well some of you may have noticed this block of metal that dell strapped onto the cpu and called cpu cooler basically this is inadequate in every single way and is highly recommended that you swap it out in heavy cpu workloads it will the 8 core to pull below 70 watts just so that it can maintain a safe thermal range and that means that all cores will settle below 2.7 gigahertz and of course it's nowhere near adequate to handle the i7 during shorter duration bursty workloads where it can pull over 190 watts there you'll see all cores at 100 degrees c pretty quickly how dell thinks this is adequate i have absolutely no clue it's a bit better when it comes to gaming though generally sitting around 85 degrees c for the cpu but again that's while consuming lower power and running at lower clock speeds with the fan speed on the cooler pretty loud as well as for our rtx 3060 ti though it surprisingly looks pretty solid and i'll admit taking one look at the xps enclosure i thought that this thing was going to choke to death immediately but here is surviving more than fine at 75 degrees at a room ambient of 20. that's also while running at pretty typical 360 ti performance and clock speeds as well so what options do you have for upgrading that cpu cooler well weirdly not many at all for whatever reason dell have actually integrated the cpu cooler mounting bracket into the case which is probably the weirdest thing that i've seen in a while and this prevents us from installing our own cpu coolers and mounting kits funnily enough though what does manage to fit perfectly into this mounting bracket is acetec's own mounting kit for intel cpus so nzxd kraken coolers for example will technically be absolutely fine here but then of course we run into another problem this case doesn't have any radiator support that's except for the 92 mil fan slot that you have at the back of the case which means that one possible option is ace attack's own 645 lt a pretty powerful 92 mil aio installing this one is pretty simple positioning the fan as exhaust plugging the radiator fan into the cpu fan header and then plugging the pump connector into the system fan header along with one of noctua's low noise adapters this will prevent the pump from running at its max 6000 rpm and instead a much quieter 3 800 or so if that's still too loud for you you can just simply add another adapter so yeah i didn't expect to be liquid calling this one that's for sure but it is actually a very viable option to get more performance out of this machine for one thermals across the board are significantly lower and that means that our i7 can now run at significantly higher clock speeds in cinebench we improve our score by over 20 percent just with a cooler upgrade with the cpu now comfortable at a much higher 3.2 gigahertz and 96 watts continuously while only being 60 degrees c this does mean that we technically have more headroom for overclocking but since we're working with a locked cpu that doesn't support that that's not an option what we can do in intel's xtu software though is increase the duration that the cpu runs at its first power limit of 225 watts and we can increase that from 28 seconds to 128 seconds this means for heavy cpu workloads that run for upwards of two minutes you'll get a significantly higher performance now at 4.4 gigahertz and our liquid cooler seems to be able to sustain that no problem weirdly though the cpu cooler swap didn't see any increase in gaming performance really much at all as the i7 seems to manage its power reasonably okay there even with the stock cooler for cpu intensive games though you would expect there to be a small difference there at least so with a 30 60 ti and an i7 in there i'd say that this is the sweet spot for a 1440p gaming machine story based single player titles can be played with high graphics and decent enough frame rates and competitive titles won't feel lacking at all in the end you get the gaming performance that you would expect from a 3060 ti gaming machine most notably here with this pre-built gpu thermals and clock speeds are totally under control which is great and the system really isn't too loud to sit next to now even quieter with that liquid cooler so i would say that yes pre-builds at least this one here they are a viable option for a gaming pc today and the value totally makes sense too in our current times it is so weird to be saying that because usually it's the complete opposite but these days if you're building something yourself high chances are that you're being significantly overcharged that's not to say that this one was perfect in fact far from it the dell xps is your usual pre-built bundled with a ton of bloatware that needs to be eliminated and insufficient cpu calling not to mention i did have to wait a couple of months for this one to actually arrive although other configurations would have shipped a lot sooner after some tweaks though for sure this is totally a great gaming machine for the money in today's almost impossible pc hardware market also if you're looking for more benchmarks for the 360 ti and what kind of gaming performance you can expect there i will leave my full performance review linked down below as well as the double xps machine itself too as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
