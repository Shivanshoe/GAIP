[Music] today we say goodbye to my custom loop in the ghost s1 I've been using the system for a few months now and I'll be honest it's been an absolute blast I really could not ask for more when it comes to a compact desktop system when I'm playing games it's super quiet thermals are good enough and while I'm editing I don't really hear a peep from the system at all but having said that every now and then it is nice to have a bit of a change so today we're taking the custom look that's in there that's an 11 litre case and we're cramming it into an even smaller case this is the nine and a half litre sidearm t1 some of you may have seen the review that went live about a week ago but to sum it up this is a more compact case than what I've got currently but thermal performance is actually better that's mostly due to it being just incredibly well ventilated I mean you can see through the entire case right there and I'm hoping that film performance will be slightly better than I've got currently but at the same time having a more compact desktop system I'll also mention that since moving to a completely liquid cooled system even though it is quite compact and Fillmore's aren't as good as they're going to be with a larger radiator system in say a midtown case I really don't think I can go back to air cooling specifically for the graphics card having a you know really quiet gaming experience I've realized is really important to me because you know I don't want my system screaming at me when I'm trying to kick back and enjoy a few games with some friends and some of you are probably wondering about this case right here so this is the N case m1 this is twelve and a half liters so slightly larger than these other two options and some of you may have heard me say that this is kind of the holy grail of compact PC cases that you can currently buy you can do so much with this case it really is incredible so some of you are probably wondering why I haven't moved my custom loop main system into this case instead and the simple answer is I don't really need to the thermal performance like I said in my current smaller case is more than fine and if I was going to move to this case it would be a dual radiator custom loop so one of the radiators on the side and one of the radiators on the bottom I really don't need that sort of level of cooling performance just yet but we might in the future but for now we will be moving to this t1 without further ado let's get started [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so that is the teardown of the ghost s1 complete pretty straightforward as you guys saw no real hiccups or problems that we came across now comes the hard part though which is figuring out how to fit this all into a smaller case I will give a shout out to alpha call for making radiators with the g1 quarter ports on both sides which as you guys saw allows you to fill and drain the system just by opening up one the other side that you're not using and that was really a lifesaver when it came to draining the system but I was really surprised with how little dust there was throughout this whole build this build has never used any dust filters at all and you know using it for about four or so months I've never cleaned it at all so the only real traces of dust are throughout the radiator and then on the fan blades the motherboard and GPU are completely fine even the case itself really doesn't have much dust on it at all and lastly just to mention of the GPU water block which since we're just using distilled water mixed with a clear concentrate coolant there's definitely no reason to take the water block off this GPU and clean it or anything like that because there's no clogging and that's why I'm going to leave the motherboard completely assembled as is I'm not going to take the pump block off there because I just assume that's gonna be healthy as well so in summary teardown was nice and simple but now it really comes the hard part [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and here it is my new daily driver in the sidearm t1 and I've got to say this is easily one of the cleaner systems that I have ever built somehow the tubing runs just worked out and they weren't as much of a problem as I thought they would be initially and I think it's actually one of the best parts of the build there is still a bit of air in the loop that I do need to get out and that just requires a bit more time and patience but as epic as this build is not all things went to plan if you guys saw the build video of my liquid-cooled ghost s1 the previous bill that I had you'll remember that the GPU fittings were just slightly too big to get that side panel on we did eventually overcome this with lower profile barbed fittings but these in the scion t1 are just still a little bit too tall so that's one thing with the build currently the side panel on the GPU side won't close but I do have some low profile terminal fittings on the way which should hopefully fix this now let's talk about that 240mm radiator at the top there and I knew this would be tricky it is a really small build after all but the 240 mm radiator brackets are included and I was told that it did fit in there with a little bit of you know tweaking with what fans you choose but let me just say if you do get the chance to build in this case do not bother with a 240 ml radiator even just a standard off-the-shelf 240 ml AIO really to not bother the initial plan was to mount a full-sized fan up front and then a slim fan at the rear seeing as this is what I had been told was compatible from the creator of the case but the mounting he just did not line up the only option here was then to use to slim fans and I decided to mount these between the panel and the radiator so the 240 ml radiator is mounted to the bracket underneath the motherboard pretty secure but the fans aren't actually mounted at all they just kind of sandwiched in between the panel and the radiator and stuck in place the reason for this is that there is literally zero clearance in there for screws even with the fans just sitting in there the panel does have a slight bulge and does need a bit of pressure to get on if the t1 was just one millimeter taller in this compartment it would have been perfect for this build in terms of the practical effect that has on this build I'm not really too bothered by the slight bulge in the top panel I mean you can really barely see it in person and even on camera it's really not that apparent but the reason I'm bringing this up is just for you guys who plan on building in this case eventually when it does get released just avoid 240 ml areas altogether it is not supported well enough for me to recommend that you guys do it the thermals with a 120 are good enough that I really would push you in that direction instead now in terms of thermals I'm going to wait until I've got the proper GPU fittings until I do some longer thermal testing as that way we'll actually be able to get the side panel on but I'll just say for now that thermals look about as good as my ghost s1 build as I mentioned in the initial sidearm t1 review you will see better thermal and noise performance by having the case flipped and radiator and fans up top so this is how I intend to run the case for personal use now despite this couple of hiccups I've got to say that I am super happy with how this bill turned out and I really can't wait to clock in some game time and some editing time with this thing because I mean under 10 liters and so much performance here I really can't wait to use this thing properly so of course we will do a follow-up video when I get the proper terminal fittings for the GPU and we'll follow up with some proper thermal testing as well until then if you guys are interested in any of the parts I will have this linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
