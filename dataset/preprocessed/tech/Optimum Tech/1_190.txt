whenever I build a brand-new gaming PC there are a few things that I consider an absolute must to change whether you're using this system for gaming work or a combination of both these few things will make your Windows 10 experience a lot better and in other cases make your new PC run a bit nicer too and to kick things off if you're new build is oriented around gaming and especially for first-person shooters this first tip is definitely something that you'll want to change and that's disabling Mouse acceleration this setting seems to be buried more and more as Windows 10 gets updated which is really unfortunate to disable this open settings in the Windows Start menu then click devices than Mouse then additional Mouse options then click pointer options in the new window then uncheck enhance pointer precision so with mouse acceleration disabled your cursor will now move according to the distance that you move your mouse that means no matter how fast you move between two points your cursor will always travel the same distance every single time this means that precise aim in game is a lot more predictable and something that you can actually train yourself to repeat by default though mouse acceleration is enabled in Windows 10 this means that the faster you move your mouse the more distance that will be added between those two points a more sensitive cursor on the contrary slower movement results in a less sensitive cursor in game what this means is that your sensitivity is constantly changing and scaling up or down depending on how fast you move your mouse making it pretty much impossible to have any aim or cursor consistency whatsoever this is also fairly critical for design oriented programs like Photoshop or illustrator where cursor accuracy also needs to be sharp and predictable so please make sure that you've got this one disabled the next important one for any brand new gaming PC build is to make sure that your display scaling and refresh rate is correct I can't tell you how many stories I've heard of users buying 144 hurt or higher refresh rate monitors only to discover later on that they've been playing at 60 Hertz Windows 10 will always set a 60 Hertz refresh rate by default and this does need to be changed now by installing the correct graphics driver that should take care of things like resolution resolution scaling and the right color settings to set the correct refresh rate though you'll want to right-click the desktop and click display settings then scroll down and select advanced display settings then a display adapter properties and then in the monitor tab select the correct refresh rate in the drop down menu now this next one might not bother you guys but I personally cannot stand it when I've installed all the apps on a new PC and they all decide that they need to watch at startup this can make booting to the desktop feel very slow even on a high-performance system and let's face it it's highly unlikely that you really need a Dischord steam origin battlenet and Spotify to start running the instant that you boot up your PC you don't realize how nice it is to boot into a fresh Windows desktop where nothing is trying to launch and distract you until you fix this so to do that just head over to settings in the Windows Start menu click apps then startup then uncheck the programs that you don't need the instant that you boot your PC of course it's a good idea to leave cloud services like one Drive and Dropbox active if you use those now the next one isn't necessarily something that I change but I do consider it to be probably one of the most important programs that you could download for a gaming PC and that's hardware info 64 this will give you access to all of the available sensors and readouts on your new PC so if you want to check the temperature of your CPU GPU motherboard or even your SSDs that can easily be monitored through this software this is the exact software that I use to create logs of temperature power clock speed and basically anything that I then used to generate graphs like this for the average user though this is just a really handy tool to have at your disposal to make sure that your system is running within a safe temperature and also to check things like fan speed also if you're doing any overclocking on your CPU just talk and show you the fairly precise voltage that your CPU is running at which is often a bit different to the one that you set in the motherboards BIOS so download hardware info 64 launch it with sensors only and feel free to leave it running in the back well you play some games or do some work MSI Afterburner is also a great tool if you want a live overlay of things like temperature and clock speeds while you're actually in game that way you don't have to keep alt tabbing to monitor those stats to do this download and open MSI Afterburner click the gear icon right here and then in the monitoring tab check show in on screen display for the stats that you want to see in the overlay MSI Afterburner isn't anywhere near as detailed as hardware info I wouldn't use it for validating and monitoring over clocks but I do think it's great for users who just want to make sure the system isn't getting too hot while gaming and this ties into my next tip which is something that I find myself changing on pretty much every system that I use for actual gaming and video editing and that's the CPU fan curve if you're new build uses high-speed PWM fans upwards of 2,000 rpm or even more there's a good chance that your CPU coolers fan curve is probably a little bit too aggressive and same goes for your case fans I find this especially the case for AMD rising builds which typically have higher than normal idle and general use temperatures it's very typical to see Rison processors spike up to 55 to 65 C when handling everyday tasks so to prevent your CPUs fan curve from sporadically ramping up and down head into your motherboard BIOS by restarting your PC and repeatedly clicking the delete key find the fan curve adjustment section and I'd recommend lowering the earlier portion of the curve this will make your PC quieter for general use and only reserve those higher fan speeds when it actually needs active cooling like while gaming or doing some work also same goes for your case fans fan curve as well those don't need to spin too fast to give you decent cooling and as a little bonus something that I do for all of my personal systems is GPU under vaulting and know this isn't just reserved for small tightly packed ITX pcs GPU under vaulting can have a seriously positive effect to any gaming pc out there at the end of the day who doesn't want their PC to be a bit quieter and cooler when they're kicking back to place in games this is fairly easy to do on pretty much any GPU out there and you can often see as much as a seven degree drop with lower and speeds as well I've done a full guide on how to do this for various GPU architectures that are out there and I'll leave a link to that down below in the description so hopefully these quick tips helped you guys out and if you want to add to this list down below in the comments I'd be interested to see what changes that you feel are necessary to a brand new gaming PC as always a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
