mainstream gaming consoles like the upcoming PS 5 and Xbox series X will never be able to outperform the PC master-race when it comes to graphics performance and that's okay because they're not really trying to instead they're trying to aim for the mainstream market and hit a certain price point to do that you do have to make some compromises on performance but if you don't like compromise and you still want a console esque gaming system then you might want to consider building in this this is the Slugger Co 520 or as they like to call it cons wall and it's up there with some of the better console like PC cases that I've built in you can pack some really powerful hardware into this thing and power a 4k gaming experience no problem but how good is it compared to cases like the Sentry 2.0 and node 2 or 2 let's take a look firstly the Slugger Conte wall comes in two sizes the one that I have here is the 8 litre CL 520 but there is also a slightly larger version that can fit 3 slot graphics cards and larger CPU coolers on the exterior the CL 520 has a very similar design aesthetic to the other Slugger cases that we've looked at here on the channel like the Cerberus and SM 580 so it's built like a tank it's relatively heavy for the size but I will give a thumbs up to Sluggers design team for keeping things relatively clean and minimal it's clean enough that it will blend in with its environment perfect for a living room gaming system and the front IO is exactly what users would want for a console like case in some ways it does look a bit dated mostly thanks to that power button but I might be being a bit picky at 8 litres it is fairly compact and fit right between the Sentry 2.0 and at node 2 or 2 but overall I wouldn't consider the CL 520 to be as space optimized as the Sentry as with a lot of slag is recent cases there is quite a bit of wiggle room and extra space in the interior even after installing some fairly conventional ITX Hardware reference length cards have a ton of room in front of them and above them and the SFX power supply has plenty of room for cable management so if you're a die-hard small form-factor enthusiasm would not have minded this being just a bit smaller but on the bright side it does make the co 520 fairly easy to build in for beginners CPU coolers up to 53 millimeters tall are compatible here and the one that I've got installed in there at the moment is the cryo rig c7 G with a slim 92 mm knock to a fan graphics card support is fairly strong here for an eight-litre case you can fit a 2 slot card up to 324 millimeters in length and 157 millimeters in height including the power connectors if you have a graphics card above a 2 slot thickness which is actually fairly common these days you might want to opt for the larger co 530 which has a three slot card support and it might just be me but I personally think that's almost too much graphics card length and height to be supporting at the end of the day this is a small form-factor case and they really aren't that many graphics cards out there and 300 mils in length now these slim console-like cases are very well known for being very poor at exhausting the hot air from within the case essentially once you start gaming on them all of that hot air kind of becomes trapped and recirculated within the components so swagga have attempted to overcome this by mounting to slim our 120mm Noctua fans directly behind the graphics card although one of the fans is pretty much completely blocked by the graphics card a riser cable regardless it's highly recommended that you run these fans as exhaust to help extract the hot air from your GPU just keep in mind that if you're using the co 520 in its horizontal orientation those fans won't be as effective as they'll be pointed towards the floor or desk but it'll still be worth having them there spinning at a lower rpm one thing I will say about these fans though I'm not sure if it was really the correct design decision versus just supporting thicker graphics cards for example if you removed those fans from the design and shifted the PCI expansion slots back you could quite easily support two-and-a-half slot cards but then on the flip side without those fans to extract the heat you might not actually get any thermal and noise benefit from running those larger cards and this is actually the first case that I have ever reviewed that just doesn't support two and a half inch drives and they've kind of just recommended that users go with end up to storage instead now motherboards with two m dot two slots are becoming a lot more common these days so I don't really see this as a problem but still I've reviewed cases that are full liters in volume that you can fit two two and a half inch drives so I'm not really sure how I feel about that because there is quite a lot of extra volume and breathing room in this case with that could have been done but let me know your thoughts on that down below now in regards to thermal performance it's clear that those side exhaust fans are helping out quite a bit by spinning them at just 900 rpm you can reduce GPU thermals by up to five degrees as the co 520 isn't overly ventilated these fans are pretty much a must I also didn't find sitting the case horizontally to worsen GPU thermals that much either provided that you use the included case feed to elevate the case of centimeters and lastly there's a very small improvement by flipping the case so that the graphics card is towards the top this will allow some additional GPU exhaust flow overall GPU thermals are about average with the GTX 10 atti settling in at about 72 degrees C about on par with the larger NZXT h 200 when that has two 120mm intake fans and the NZXT h1 it's the much better choice here over the fractal design node 202 but isn't as good as the Sentry 2.0 the center is a much more ventilated case than the co 520 and although it doesn't have any active exhaust fans it's ventilated enough to accommodate enough GPU exhaust but let's not forget that the co 520 can accommodate larger graphics cards than the Sentry 2.0 so although there is a small thermal difference there and the Sentry does run a little bit cooler you can overcome that small thermal gap by using a larger graphics card in reality if you do use a longer triple fan card in the co 520 you should pretty much get the best thermals out of any console sized PC case now my usual 9900 Kay test system for ITX builds was a bit too much to ask for this sub 50ml CPU cooler but here's what you can expect from an eight-core rising 3700 X at full load in blender so again we're using the cryo rig c 7g here with the fan swap to a slim 92 mm knock to a fan and that's perfectly capable of cooling this cpu for gaming builds in this case I'd highly recommend using the Rison 3300 X 3600 or the 3700 X here which would also be a great option for a more production focused build and Intel's 10 600 K would also be a great fit overall the slider co 520 is one of the better console light cases that you can buy right now it's not overly special and optimized but it's a great option for those interested in this form factor I'd also consider the co 530 which is the 3 slot variant it is a bit chunkier than this one but it's much more of a unique and special case in my opinion you can get the price down on the CL 520 to 149 us or 179 including those two slim Noctua fans and that does include free shipping within the United States I do think the century 2.0 is the better case overall but you can't actually buy it anymore so it's almost irrelevant and I do think NZXT sh-1 or the a bit bigger thirteen and a half litres is also something to consider as well especially for a living room gaming PC so if you are interested in building a console killer PC I will leave a link to the CL 520 down below as well as some of the hardware that I've used in this build and would highly recommend as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
