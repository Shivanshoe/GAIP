today we're going to take a look at this absolute sledgehammer of a graphics card from msi this is their rtx 3080 gaming x trio and we're going to take a look at things specifically like clock speed and thermal and noise performance if you are looking for gaming benchmarks please check my video that i uploaded two days ago which is specifically looking at gaming performance for the rtx 3080 across 1440p and 4k resolution and in that video we take a closer look at how the rtx 3080 performs in gaming versus the 2080 ti 2080 and other relevant gpus the bottom line is that this is the best high-end gpu that you can buy right now of course when stock permits but seeing as there is so much interest for the rtx 30 series for good reason at least for the 3080 that we have here i figured it was definitely worth taking a look at some individual cards and cooler designs as well when the opportunity arises especially while we wait for some more stock to arrive so let's see if this one is worth considering [Music] so first off i have to give a big thumbs up to the design crew at msi who have really improved things over the last couple of generations not ruined by red outlines or accents the new gaming x trio is completely neutral from front to back except for this little red fan header that they managed to sneak in so overall a really great looking design one slight disappointment with this card though is the fact that the back plate is actually made of plastic which is not what you typically find on a flagship cooler design msi say that it is actually a graphene composite material and that should boost the thermal properties a bit more than a typical plastic backplate as backplates also serve to remove a lot of heat from the back side of the pcb specifically the underside of the gpu memory and vrm where there are actually thermal pads i think we all would have preferred a full metal backplate here there's a reason that's what they've decided to go with for their more powerful rtx 3090 gaming x trio the total board power for the rtx 3080 gaming x trio is 340 watts which is the same as the asus tough oc that we looked at in the launch review and that's 20 watts more than the founders edition here that's also delivered across three eight pin power connectors at the end of the card as opposed to the usual two eight pins which you might find on most rtx 3080 models i'll also note that although many rtx 3080 cards i've seen have a shorter pcb and extended heatsink which will allow air to pass all the way through the gaming x trio has a more conventional approach with the pcb reaching the full length of the card here the hot air from the card will be exhausted down towards the motherboard and pcie slot and also towards the front of the card where the logo is now i've had an absolute ton of questions on rtx 3080s and itx case compatibility specifically what rtx 3080 is the best choice to put in an itx case and kind of what itx case would that be so fairly loaded questions and not ones that i can kind of answer within a single paragraph and there really is no simple answer here most of the rtx 3080 designs out there are two and a half slot plus 300 mils plus and triple fan designs they are big big cards the most compact triple fan design that i've seen so far is the xc3 from evga which is barely over two slots in thickness only 111 millimeters in height and 285 millimeters in length so far the most compact design overall though is nvidia's own founders edition which is exactly two slots in thickness and only 285 millimeters in length however the cooler design does pose some issues for sandwich layout cases like the ghost s1 and den a4 if i had the founders edition card you guys know that is something that i would absolutely test but i do not but coming back to the gaming x trio like most rtx 3080 designs this is what i'd consider to be a pretty beefy card it's two and a half slots 323 millimeters in length and 140 millimeters in height with slightly recessed power connectors itx cases that can fit this card are mostly around 16 litres and beyond like the cooler master nr200 and the sliger sm580 of course this will have no problem fitting in most mid towers your only concern there would be the front mounted radiators and fans and how much clearance you have at the front of the card for your particular build there's not many reasons that you'd need to disassemble this specific card but if water blocks are released in the future and that's something that you are interested in then disassembly is a fairly easy process there are several screws on the back plate which connect to the heatsink and these are all identical so don't worry about mixing them up you've also got four main screws behind the retention bracket and gpu and it's best to progressively loosen these one at a time as opposed to completely removing one of them and moving on to the next one so revealing the cooler design we've got seven heat pipes that make it direct contact to the gpu and then we have cooling plates connected directly to the heatsink which make contact with the vrm and memory chips we can also see that the mounting pressure between the heatsink and the surface mounted components looks spot-on with a defined imprint on the thermal pads now in terms of performance i found clock speeds for the 3080 gaming x302 average out to around 1930 megahertz this was completely stock with the fans at auto tested on an open test bench so that seems pretty good but it's around 30 megahertz lower than the asus tough oc which i've also tested under the same conditions that starts to make sense when we look at the thermal performance between these two cards and we can actually see the msi gaming x trio is configured with a very quiet fan profile 72 degrees c is definitely a safe level for the gpu to be operating at and i do respect this approach from msi because the difference between 60 degrees c and 70 degrees c on your gpu isn't actually going to impact your performance or user experience but how loud the card is running in your case will be noticeable so it seems like msi have gone for a fan profile that gives the gpu the quietest operation while still maintaining a comfortable temperature target the asus tough oc on the other hand runs at a significantly cooler 60 degrees c and i'd honestly say that this was still within a very quiet range so to confirm which cooling design is actually better between the two i brought the fan speed of the msi card up to meet the same noise level of the asus tough oc which ended up to be almost an identical fan speed and the results are that the msi card runs five degrees warmer at the same noise levels so this means that the asus tough oc actually has more effective noise and thermal performance overall and that's surprising seeing as it will be the cheaper card between them a quick mention on power consumption it's pretty close between these two cards only 7 watts between them which isn't a meaningful difference now if you're interested in water cooling down the road the 3080 gaming x trio doesn't have water blocks currently announced for it however the 20 series did see water blocks for the gaming x trigger line so i'd expect something very similar for the 30 series especially for how popular these cards will be in comparison so if you are interested in the rtx 3080 when it eventually comes back in stock should you consider the gaming x trio from msi after all it is their flagship cooler design personally i was you know kind of expecting much better results compared to what is almost an entry-level model from asus i'm not sure what the pricing difference between them will be but looking at some listings online it looks like it's around 70 us and the gaming extruder is more comparable to something like the asus strix which i have not tested at least with no stock available for pretty much any of the 3080 cards right now you have some time to make your decision and check out some more reviews there is a lot more content around the corner so do hit that subscribe button if you haven't
