[Music] so the time has come we can finally talk about Intel's tenth generation desktop CPUs and let's keep things off with the new 10 core 10 900k we're naming scheme but let's try and avoid discussing that throughout this review we also do have the i5 10 600 k this one rack here this will rival md's rising 5 cpu and it will have a dedicated video on that tomorrow at around the same time but for now let's focus on the 10 900k and specifically how this stacks up to aim DS 12 core 3900 X and also the 1350 X if you're willing to spend a bit more money there are a few interesting angles that you can approach this comparison with depending on what your primary use cases are going to be with these enthusiast CPUs and we also need to address some of the rumors and marketing claims that have been floating around leading up to this review [Music] let's start by clarifying one thing first and that's that the tenth generation at ten nine hundred KN all the other 10th gen CPUs share the same 14 nanometer manufacturing process as the six generation skylake CPUs which launched in 2015 so as opposed to shrinking the manufacturing process and improving transistor density which has proved to be quite the hurdle for Intel they've instead been forced to improve each generation by adding more cores and refining the process to yield higher clock speeds and honestly at this point I'm convinced that the 10900 K represents the true limit that this process is willing to be pushed to because although we're looking at the same manufacturing process Intel have still managed to pump quite the specs into the ten nine hundred K and all for the same price as the previous gen eight core ninety nine hundred K and honestly so they should because aim DS 12 and 16 quart rise in CPUs have been absolutely rolling Intel when it comes to multi-core performance but although Intel isn't quite ready to compete at those core and thread count on a mainstream platform just yet clock speed is one area where they continue to have an advantage over AMD and this leads us to our first topic of discussion with the AI 910 900k and that's what boosts clocks does this thing even runner because Intel are claiming a fairly high 5.3 gigahertz single core boost clock and an all called this clock of 4.9 and there is a catch to both of those starting with the all core burst clock you only see 4.9 gigahertz sustained under longer duration workloads like rendering when the long duration power limit setting in the motherboard BIOS is set above 200 watts by default Intel specification lists the ten nine hundred K at 125 watts here which otherwise cripples the CPU to as low as four point one gigahertz under those longer duration workloads so I tested this on a three of the enthusiast tears II 490 motherboards that I have here for testing and while gigabytes or as master and MSI's unifier gave the ten nine hundred K as much juice as it wanted to maintain that four point nine gigahertz boost you will see some boards out there adhering to Intel spec of one 125 watts as an example a Seuss's Maximus 12 euro was one of them unlocking the power limit is pretty straightforward though if you find that your motherboard is holding things back just look for a setting called long duration power limit in the BIOS under the CPU settings and set that to its max value that will claim back the huge 700 to 800 megahertz that you lose under workloads that are longer than a minute or two and on the note of that 5.3 gigahertz single core boost just know that it is something that you will rarely and I mean very rarely see it seems that Intel have taken a page out of AMD's books here where they feel the need to list the highest possible clock speed that you will achieve if several conditions are met including the stars aligning and a full moon so I wasn't able to fully validate the 5.3 gigahertz single core turbo but the z4 90 horas master was the closest out of the three boards that I tested if the 10900 K did have no issues boosting to 5.3 gigahertz on a single core then we'd see match our all core 5.3 gigahertz overclocked in the single threaded test which it doesn't again it's pretty close on the Auris master but I feel like this will be way off on most of the z4 90 boards out there especially once you get Windows 10 fully up and running with a couple of background tasks in the mix because even with just a very light monitoring software running in the background it seems that we almost never see 5.3 gigahertz achieved so with that background info out of the way now let's take a look at the benchmarks the main comparison here is against AMD's 12 core rise in 3900 Rex and keep in mind that this can actually be had for a bit cheaper than what we expect the 10900 K to launch at the fact of the matter is the 24th read on the rise in CPU can true through a lot more parallel work like rendering and encoding than the 20 threads on the 10900 K and unfortunately for the I 9 the faster clock speed isn't enough for it to catch up to the rise in CPU in most workloads even in video editing which is usually until strong point the 3900 X would be the slightly better choice it is close in some applications though but ultimately if you need much multi-threaded processing power that you can get in a 500 dollar CPU the 3900 X does edge out as the better choice some of you might be willing to trade that slight difference in multi-threaded performance though for the improved clock speed of the 10 900k and I'd personally say that that is a valid choice because not every tool in program that you're going to be running is going to be optimized for parallel compute but almost every program out there will scale with a faster clock speed so just keep that in mind and this brings us to gaming and seeing as the 10900 K is the fastest clocked CPU out of the box that we've got here it breaks through the top of the stack in every game that I tested in some titles the difference between the 10900 Kate and the 3900 X is really significant and it's a very valid point in my opinion to choose the i9 if you care equally about a high frame rate gaming experience but also fast render times keep in mind though the 10900 k's main advantage in gaming over the 9900 K isn't the additional 2 cores but instead that faster clock speed so when it comes to gaming there's no doubt that the 10900 K can really pushed some frames but now let's take a look at what you can expect in terms of overclocking now I will have a completely separate video soon on overclocking the 10900 K which will be a lot more in depth but in summary here's what I was able to achieve on the MSI's Z 490 UniFi 5.2 gigahertz was completely stable at a fairly modest 1.25 8 volt and 5.3 was stable in gaming and non AVX workloads but blender did ultimately prove that this was unstable so 5.3 should be doable on the 10 900k but will most likely require a load voltage of above 1.3 5 volts and an AV X offset of minus 1 as with most CPUs this overclock will see a nice performance bump in pretty much any workload out there and of course that includes a gaming and now let's dispel one of the bigger rumors floating around of the 10900 K and you might have seen the headlines floating around by some of these websites that have claimed that the 10900 K is impossible to call it's an absolute furnace and that you need a 360 ml cooler to you know just run it at stock simply put that is incorrect app stock in a blender render the ten 900k tops out at just 71 degree C on its hottest call with a 280 ml liquid Cola pulls around 200 watts and maintains a four point ninety Gert clock speed this is going to be motherboard dependent though some boards will run the ten nine hundred K at a higher voltage and power than others but to run a ten nine hundred K above 90 C and 250 Watts like some of these headlines are claiming that would be completely broken even when overclocking to five point two gigahertz at around one point two six volt we see a peak CPU core temp of only 81 C with most of the CPU cores sitting at around 70 to 75 C and only point around 30 watts more power than stock Intel did claim that they improved the thermal design between the CPU die and the heat spreader and that seems to be true by looking at these results so sure if you're going to be overclocking the 10900 k at around 1.25 to 1.3 volts I would recommend a 280 ml or 360 ml a IO but if you're just going to be running this at stock I think a single tower or dual tower air cooler would be quite fine put that in a well ventilated case and you're not going to have any issues so in summary the new 10900 K is in a bit of a weird place because these days if you're going to be buying this for multi-threaded workloads like rendering most of you would be better off with AMD s rise in 3900 X not only would you be seeing better rendering performance there but you would actually be saving at least $100 u.s. once you factor in that the 10900 K doesn't come with a CPU cooler whereas the Rison 3900 X it does ultimately the 10900 K is for those users who just want the fastest gaming CPU that they can currently buy and don't mind spending the extra cash for the extra couple of CPU cores that they can perhaps use for things like a video editing don't get me wrong though I actually recommend that most of you just looking for the best gaming CPU that you can buy grab the new i7 10 700 K instead which is basically a slightly faster 9900 K for around $100 less you'd be better off spending that saved $100 or so on a faster GPU or faster memory kit instead of the additional 2 cause on the 900k that most likely you do not need if you're primarily a gamer so that's why the 10900 K is in a bit of a weird spot it's tough to recommend exclusively as a rendering or workstation CPU because the 3900 X is just the better choice and then as you know an enthusiast gaming CPU well you don't need to be spending this much money you definitely don't need 10 cores and 20 threads for gaming and instead I would recommend something like the i7 10 700 K the 10900 K also lacks the upgrade path to a higher core count CPU like the 3900 X does where you could possibly upgrade to a 16 core 3950 X down the road but on the flip side I've got to say at the same price as the lower core count and lower clocked 9900 K from the previous generation it's hard to complain with what Intel are bringing to the table key with the 10900 K and although the 3900 X is a better rendering CPU and the 10 700 K would be a smarter option for enthusiast gamers if you want the best CPU that can do a combination of both then that's where I can recommend the 10900 K it's for those users who do value faster rendering and encoding times but also don't want to compromise on gaming performance one bit in return and do stay tuned for tomorrow's video where we will take a look at the i-5 10 600 K which will definitely give AMD's Verizon 530 608 decent run for its money so if you're interested in any of these CPUs you can find them linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
