my interest in compact itx pcs has always been around how you could use them to allow for more space on your desk setup after all most pcs these days aren't using more than a single graphics card and cpus are becoming a lot more power efficient but there are of course a group of users who are interested in small form factor computers for the portability aspect the fact that you can easily take them in carry on luggage or your suitcase or maybe even a backpack so that's where this comes in because for that to work you obviously need a monitor as well so this is the asus xg17 a 17 inch portable ips 240hz gaming monitor basically the king of portable gaming monitors but i do have some questions about this display that i want to go into in this video and just this general portability kind of itx pc setup in general for example what are the pros and cons of this versus just using a gaming laptop is the 17 inch display good enough to use as your single main monitor is it big enough to do that and also who would even be interested in a setup like this let's take a look so these days the amount of performance that you can get from a single graphics card and mainstream socket cpu is undeniably more than what most people will need and that means that power efficiency has also taken some huge leaps my own system is a great example of this it's up there as one of the fastest configurations that you can build right now for gaming and it's under 10 liters in volume that means it can squeeze into a generously sized backpack if you need it to along with this portable monitor and everything else you need so on the surface the asus xg17 is really solid the exterior is mostly aluminium which keeps it nice and strong and that means that there's not much flex in the body at all but it also keeps it relatively lightweight it's also very thin just a bit slimmer than a 16 inch macbook pro the bezels are slim enough the back of the monitor has a nice brushed finish and overall you are getting a premium product you have two options when it comes to the stand you've got the foldable cover stand which kind of sets the monitor up at a typical laptop viewing angle or you could set it up like a typical desktop monitor with the all metal tripod stand big thumbs up for the implementation here it mounts to the back of the monitor with a quick release mount that screws into the back this stand allows for plenty of flexibility including height adjustment and 360 degree swivel you've also got two choices when it comes to the display signal here too a micro hdmi port or a usb c port both can support the 1080p 240hz signal however the micro hdmi port does not charge the device in addition to outputting the display signal whereas the usbc port does so i'd highly recommend sticking to the usbc cable if possible it really is so nice to just use a single cable running to your monitor if you are using the micro hdmi port on the other hand though you'll have up to around three hours of built-in battery with the monitor to rely on but you can additionally charge the monitor at the same time to avoid draining it surprisingly this monitor also has g-sync and freesync support although i could only enable that through the usb-c port this is especially handy though for those lower refresh rate games you've got a few buttons on the side to navigate through the osd which gives you access to things like brightness color settings viewing the battery level and also adjusting the pixel overdrive level for faster response times it's set to level 3 by default and cranking it all the way up to level 5 i thankfully didn't notice any visual artifacts also since this is an ips display color accuracy is quite good and definitely suitable for content creation as well this was straight out of the box with the factory color preset i only found the white point to be a little bit on the cooler and at 6 900 kelvin so now let's talk about what this monitor is actually like to game on and this is something that i was personally really interested to test out because i've been using for the past year and a half or so a 25 inch 1080p 240hz monitor so very similar to this but just a bit bigger and then with a tn panel instead of ips firstly and surprisingly it actually felt a bit faster than my desktop 240hz display this makes sense because you are working with a smaller panel overall with stronger pixel density the distance between the individual pixels is smaller so the transition between them is less noticeable so for games that really benefit from that high refresh rate and low response times like csgo valorem and so on you have absolutely nothing to worry about in that regard this panel feels super quick and responsive to game on but by far the biggest difference that i personally noticed between the xg17 and my daily desktop monitor was how much closer i had to sit to the xg17 to actually game confidently in competitive titles otherwise if i was sitting at my normal viewing distance hitting targets and peaking corners was much more difficult not to mention hitting any headshots was pretty much impossible without sitting really close that's kind of the main compromise that i found but i did adjust to it fairly quickly at which point i was kind of calibrated and everything felt back to normal if you do find yourself using this monitor and sitting really close i'd recommend playing at a lower brightness just to make sure that you don't ruin your eyesight i will mention one benefit of the small display though is that pixel density is pretty strong at 127 ppi which is higher than what you'd get on a 27 inch 1440p panel so games themselves actually look quite crisp especially single player titles which you might otherwise play on a larger 1440p or 4k display so the question then becomes could you potentially use this as your only monitor for gaming and everyday use and i think the answer is definitely yes it's fast enough it's color accurate enough and it's generally just a little bit bigger than what you get from most laptops but just because you could doesn't mean that you should and don't get me wrong if you personally think that you need a portable gaming setup like this then you don't need me to tell you whether you should get it or not you've probably made your mind up by this point anyway but i do have some thoughts that i want to share on the kind of portability of a dedicated itx pc setup like this versus a laptop setup firstly it goes without saying despite this being easily transportable in a decently sized backpack it's not something that you would use on a plane or bring to university or to your local starbucks but that is something that you could easily do with a gaming laptop or just any laptop where this setup becomes more practical is where you need something semi-portable where you're between homes for a few days at a time for example or maybe you're an interstate truck driver who's also a gamer or maybe you travel for work and you just want to game in your downtime again whatever it is it's one of those things that you will know whether this is for you or not and i personally think that is a small group of users of course you could also pair this monitor with consoles or maybe with a laptop as a secondary display for editing for example but i feel that you might be better off with a cheaper 60hz model there instead so that's the kind of use case and scenario that i find the monitor falls under but you still need to worry about the pc this is really going to come down to your own needs and whether you need to prioritize portability versus performance you could build something as small as the 4 liter k39 from aliexpress which can fit up to an rx 5700 gpu or you could potentially go as high as the 12 liter encase m1 if compromising on performance isn't really an option and finally one reason that you might want to stick to a gaming laptop is the price the xg17 comes in that 599 us for the full kit which gets you the tripod stand as well as a carrying case supposedly there is an option with just the folding stand and the monitor for 4.99 but i personally can't find that available anywhere and that is a very steep price about double what i paid for my desktop 25 inch 240hz monitor but at the end of the day there just aren't that many portable monitors out there that can compete with the xg17 in terms of specs or performance and i can definitely see why some users would be happy to pay that price there's no doubt that this is the ultimate portable gaming monitor and when paired with a compact itx gaming rig you will have an absolute blast it's just up to you to decide whether this is something that you really need or maybe you could be better off with a really portable gaming laptop if it is something that you're interested in i will leave a link down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
