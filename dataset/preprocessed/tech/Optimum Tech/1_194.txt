the risin 3300 ex is easily one of the best gaming CPUs that you can buy right now considering the price point for cause eight threads and some of the fastest boost clocks that you'll see on is n2 despite it being just 120 US dollars there's no reason that you couldn't pair this with an RT X 27 in super or 5700 XT and so today we're going to see how you can make sure that you're getting the full performance out of Rison 3000 and specifically the 3300 X that we're using today as an example and one of the big focuses here is going to be on cooling because despite the 3300 X just being a 65 watt quad core processor it does run fairly warm and that does impact performance probably a bit more than you think we'll also take a look at varying ddr4 memory speeds and the impact of there where the CPU overclocking is worth it and also generally how to make sure your system is running up to spec [Music] firstly before we dive into the tuning details there are a couple of things that I'll mention that are probably fairly obvious to most of you but can be easily overlooked by beginners and could impact the performance of your Rison system significantly first up do not use a Windows 10 build rive from a previous machine especially if it's from an Intel build or an older AMD platform even though your new Rison built might accept this drive it'll get you far from optimal results and may even give you stability issues in some programs the only case where this seems to be fine is when upgrading within the same platform for example from a first gen Rison build to a second or third gen where you're also upgrading the motherboard as well of course if you're just upgrading your CPU and dropping it into the same motherboard there is nothing to worry about and another obvious but under mentioned one is making sure that you've installed the latest chipset drivers and BIOS version for your motherboard I've seen this improve the power profile and boosting behavior of Rison 3000 significantly so it's a good idea to keep up to date also a good idea to make sure that you've got the correct power profile selected that'll make sure that your system doesn't turn into a jet engine every time you want to open a file explorer when it comes to choosing a memory kit the short answer is a low latency 3,000 to 3,250 3,250 all though performance does start to level off there at 3600 megahertz and below the fabric clock and memory clock will be coupled whereas memory speeds above 30 600 megahertz require the decoupling of the fabric clock and the memory clock what this means is that there will be an increase in latency now which actually results in lower performance despite running a higher speed kit so if 3200 megahertz C or 15 kit is a good place to start and make sure to check the motherboard vendors qvl list to make sure the kit that you're buying is validated at those speeds for your board a low latency 30 600 megahertz kit will give you optimal results but might be only worth it for those buying a 3700 X and above because they are a bit more pricey and even if you can't budget for a thirty-six hundred megahertz memory kit you can usually squeeze a little bit more performance out of a three thousand to thirty two hundred megahertz kit with manually overclock in this usually involves increasing the DRAM voltage to around 1.4 to 1.5 volts granted you have a memory kit that scales with voltage and then either tightening the timings or increasing the speed or a combination of both if you're lucky memory overclocking is a lot more complex than those couple of steps and in most cases will only net you a few FPS in gaming at most and worst case will introduce instability to your system still though it is worth mentioning because it does technically improve performance in most tasks and yes while you can overclock the fabric clock it's just generally not worth your time you might be able to get plus 100 megahertz if you desperately want to run a 30 800 megahertz memory kid just be careful of the additional instability now let's talk about the Rison 3,300 X specifically because the biggest challenge that most users are going to have with this CPU is cooling especially if you're going to be using the stock cooler now if you happen to use this CPU for things like video editing and 3d rendering which isn't such an unrealistic scenario because it is a quad core 8 threaded processor then you will definitely run into some thermal challenges and likely you will see the 3300 X hid around 80 to 85 C in some cases above 90 C the sample that I've got here did top out at ADC during a blender render but this is on an open test bench with just an 18 degree C ambient room temp so if you add a few degrees to bring the ambient room temp up to something normal like 22 C and then another few degrees when installed into a case things will start getting pretty toasty even in gaming things are going to be on the wall and even when not fully utilized again if you're installing the CPU and cooler inside a budget case with less than ideal airflow not to mention with the graphics card also heating up the case interior it's easy to see that many 3300 X systems out there are running fairly hot now the main reason that the 3300 X runs as hot as it does is that it packs all four of its calls into a single core complex die or CCD for short as a Perl to the risin 30-100 which splits for calls across to see CDs but despite the much warmer thermals on the 3300 ex it is actually the better choice over the 3100 based on performance because separating those cause among separate C CDs results in higher cortical latency as an example when both the 3100 and 3300 XR at the same clock speed the 3300 ex is the better performer but runs significantly hotter and I would consider this a very important background info if you have a 3300 ex because arguably one of the best things that you can do to improve performance of your Rison 3000 cpu is to improve your cpu thermals then to respond fairly drastically to CPU thermals and the cooler that you can get you'll CPU to run the faster you will run and we're talking sometimes a shift of 200 megahertz or more for example swapping the stock wraith stealth core for a 240 mm a i/o although it doesn't make sense from a budget perspective for the 3300 ex it does give us a massive boost in clock speed of around 200 megahertz that'll definitely shave off some time when it comes to renders or video exports and might give you a few more FPS depending on the game so when it comes to see if you use like the 3900 X and 3950 X the answer is pretty simple pair them with a top-of-the-line air cooler or high-end aftermarket liquid cooler because thermals do matter evidently and you likely have the budget for it if you're buying a verizon 9 CPU that recommendation though doesn't really work with the $120 Verizon 3300 X because then you're spending more on the cooler than you are on the processor itself even if you paired the CPU with a $50 single tower air cooler you're now approaching horizon 3600 pricing and that would be the better choice now you could lower the PPT or power target in rise and master software that does force the 3300 X to pool less juice and in return output lower thermals but it will also reduce the clock speed directly so I only recommend lowering the PPT as a last resort if you're 3,300 X or other rise in CPU is overheating and you can't budget or fit a stronger cooling solution and although under vaulting can give you huge success on achieve and Intel CPUs manually reducing just the voltage for rise in 3000 introduces nothing but problems and it should definitely be avoided I was able to get a negative offset of minus 75 millivolts on our MSI be 550 tomahawk without any noticeable loss in performance but it just didn't seem to do anything significant voltage offsets larger than this resulted in significant performance drops so I don't consider this an option so Rison 3000 performance scales directly with CPU thermals the cooler that you can get your system to run the faster it will run but the only option that you have to do that is by upgrading your CPU cooler or moving to a higher airflow case or by adding case fans to your system unfortunately there just aren't any tweaks or adjustments that you can do to voltage and power as workarounds for the 3300 ex one of the best performance upgrades that you can do apart from a decent memory kit is pair it with a decent but still affordable cooling solution even upgrading to a $30 hyper 212 will be worth and over the stock Wraith stealth and I'll leave a link to that and a couple others down below in terms of overclocking the 3300 ex anything lower than an oak or frequency of 4.4 gigahertz isn't worth it for gaming seeing as it naturally boosts above that you will get a nice boost in production workloads seeing as the or core frequency will be lifted from around 4.1 depending on which color you're using but in gaming even at 4.4 there are minor gains to be had for the trade-off of increased power and thermals in my case 4.4 gigahertz required around 1.3 6 volts on the msi be 550 tomahawk and it's impossible to call that with the stop cooler in closing there are a lot of factors that can impact the performance of a risin 3000 based system and the 3300 ex specifically is a tricky one because it benefits tremendously with additional cooling but at the same time that additional cooling can be more expensive than the CPU itself and of course a lot of these factors apply to all of the rise in 3000 cps anyway especially when it comes to memory speeds so feel free to use this checklist for other risin 3000 CP use as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
