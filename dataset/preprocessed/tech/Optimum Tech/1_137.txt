today we're checking out the rtx 3060 ti which is an unusually named gpu seeing as there is no regular 3060 to speak of but regardless this is an exceptional gpu at the 400 price point with also no real competitor in sight so some questions that we'll be answering in this review how close is the performance of this versus the 500 rtx 3070 should you potentially wait for the standard 3060 or maybe a competitor from amd 400 bucks buys you a ton of gpu power this time around so let's take a look at what you need to know and what kind of performance you can expect [Music] so first off under the hood how is this different from the recently released rtx 3070 because they look pretty similar on the surface well the memory configuration is identical between these two cards eight gigabytes of gddr6 with a 256 bit bus width then in terms of the gpu boost clock only 60 megahertz separates them on paper and in reality it's a lot less than that the difference comes with eight less streaming multiprocessors for the 3060 ti resulting in 17 less cuda cores rt cores and tensor cores but for a 20 reduction in price that trade-off might just be worth it total board power comes in at 200 watts and the 36 ti shares the same compact founders edition cooler design as the 30 70. it's just in a much lighter silver compared to the dark grey of the 30 70. so could this be the new 400 mainstream gpu king well i think the obvious answer to that is yes and that's because this is the cheapest gpu among the current generation of gpus between nvidia and amd as a reference take a look at the performance jump over the last generation rtx 2060 super here at 1440p in red dead redemption 2 the 3060 ti is 25 faster demanding games like this at 4k really will test this gpu though for the most part you will get more than playable frame rates but as we'll see 1440p resolution is really where this gpu shines nvidia we're also very careful not to compete too hard against their own car the rtx 3070 although in some games it is pretty damn close considering the 100 price difference in the new assassin's creed valhalla there was just an 8 difference between them at 1440p on average although this is one of the smaller margins that i measured in fact there was a 14 difference between the 3060 ti and 3070 on average between the 10 games that i tested at 1440p but there were a few games in that mix that saw upwards of 20 percent in favor of the 3070 so in my opinion the two can co-exist quite fine and the 100 difference is enough of a separation also an interesting comparison amd's last generation rx 5700 xt previously represented excellent value at the 400 price point but in this example the 360 ti is almost 19 faster so it'll be interesting to see what amd's eventual answer to this gpu is their cheapest card at the moment is the rx 6800 which i've yet to do a full review on but it is incredibly quick for 579 dollars but that's quite a big leap versus the 3060 ti and not really comparable and another comparison here versus the previous generation 400 gpu from nvidia the rtx 2060 super in rainbow six siege running maxed out at 4k i found the 3060 ti to be almost 40 percent faster which is a huge generational leap now i don't anticipate that many of you will be playing this game at 4k resolution but those performance gains translate well into 1440p as well there there's a 37 jump in performance versus the 2060 super with the 3060 ti now averaging 230 fps at 1440p now it would have been really interesting to have this card compared to a hypothetical radeon 6700 xt but for now amd just doesn't have anything that can compete against the 3060 ti this side-by-side comparison and death stranding shows your current 400 to 600 gpu options with enough cash separating each one that in my opinion any of these three gpus are worth picking up in this example death stranding is running at 4k max settings we've got the 3060 ti averaging 64 fps the 30 70 averaging 73 fps and the 6800 averaging 84 fps if you are one of the few gamers using a 4k monitor or perhaps a high resolution ultra wide i would steer you in the direction of those last two and also the rtx 3080. for 1080p and 1440p though the 360 ti feels like a great deal at 400 us also keep in mind that most of these games have been benchmarked at the highest graphics preset there's plenty of headroom for a higher frame rate if you don't mind dropping things at one or two tiers star wars jedi fallen order showed the smallest difference between the 3060 ti and 3070 in the benchmark stack only a 6.7 percent difference separating these two at 1440p resolution so for most games the 17 reduction in crude core count is represented fairly accurately but there are some games that will play a little bit closer between these two gpus some additional perspective here is that the 3060 ti is consistently faster than the previous generation rtx 2080 so you really are getting a solid deal for 400 before we talk about ray tracing and dlss he is a slightly larger comparison of the 360 ti versus the 30 70 at 1440p for the 20 difference in price the performance difference does make sense it's not enough to separate these gpus into two different categories where one is capable at a certain resolution and the other isn't i'd consider both of these gpus to be capable at 4k and ideal for 1440p on average i found a 14.6 difference between them across these 10 games and despite also having 17 percent less ray tracing calls and tensor cores than the 30 70 it's still perfectly capable when you turn rtx on in control at 1440p with otherwise maxed out settings enabling ray tracing and dlss leaves you with a comfortable frame rate above 60 fps for some perspective that's something that the 100 more expensive rtx 2070 before it couldn't do but it's really dlss that's the real hero here and i'd consider this one of the major features to weigh up when choosing between amd and nvidia the supported game library is growing and it can make for a game changing frame rate boost and in some cases improve visual quality at the same time watch dogs legion for example enabling ray tracing in this game and 1440p on the 3060 ti absolutely tanks performance to what i consider unplayable frame rates dlss can be used in conjunction with ray tracing to bring frame rates back up to pretty much what they were before without dlss in action here many of us wouldn't consider that a worthy trade-off now of course you can enable dlss without also enabling ray tracing and that's where you can make high resolution games a bit more viable here for example running 4k with the dlss balanced preset is really the only way we're able to play at this resolution now on the note of production workloads such as blender v-ray and video editing in davinci resolve the 3060 ti is super capable for the money i'm tempted to call this a little budget production workload gpu but when it's beating a 2080 ti in blender and v-ray i think it deserves a bit more credit it's also perfectly capable for video editing and the eight gigabytes of video memory will be plenty for editing 4k video in terms of clock speed i saw the founders edition 3060 ti to average out to 1900 megahertz flat after 30 minutes in heaven 4.0 and that's just 20 megahertz less than the 30 70 fe then thermal performance between the two was pretty much even at 70 degrees c power consumption is also right around where you'd expect for that listed board power as well total system power at the wall was just 319 watts and that's alongside an overclocked 10 900k the biggest question that most of you probably have now though is if this is the 3060 ti where's the regular non-ti 3064 cheaper and there's no news on that just yet but you can only assume that nvidia will have one currently in the works after all how long can a 3060 ti exist without a regular 30 60 buy it side surely that would be confusing for consumers so if you are still holding out for a more affordable option say around the 300 price point waiting an extra month or two might be something to consider for a slightly cheaper alternative otherwise the rtx 3060 ti is an excellent gpu to be looking at for 400. a massive leap from previous generations and like i said there really is no competitor at the moment so it's up to you if you want to wait uh alongside the 3070 i believe the two can co-exist both of them are great options for a 1440p gaming monitor but if you're looking at high refresh rate 1080p i would definitely go for the 3060 ti instead when this thing is faster than an rtx 2080 i would probably consider this overkill for 1080p now as for amd they're still stuck competing in what i would call the enthusiast tier gpu market around 600 plus but given that they are competitive in that price bracket against nvidia you can only assume that they'd be competitive at 400 as well so waiting for a 360 ti competitor is definitely an option although i think that might be a while amd barely seemed to be filling stock even for those existing premium cards for now though the rtx 360 ti gets a big thumbs up from me cheaper gpus is exactly what we need right now with you know tons of gpus coming out and they're all hundred dollars plus you know not everyone wants an expensive gpu like that in their gaming rig especially with most of your gaming at 1080p so 36cti is perfect for that in my opinion as always uh the links will be down below so you can check pricing and availability in your region and i will see you all in the next one
