i hear you guys loud and clear in the comments even if you can buy these new gpus pricing is nowhere near what us reviewers are quoting in our reviews so does that change whether they're worth it or not take the rtx 3080 for example which should be a 699 card but pricing for the aftermarket boards is commonly around that 900 dollar mark the only problem here is that we don't really know what pricing and availability looks like until these cards actually launch so the best that we can really do is test them and present that information to you at launch so you at least have that to work from but after seeing the huge price discrepancy between the rtx 3060s msrp of 329. and the actual pricing of listed cards which are in excess of 500 i felt like my own review became instantly invalidated so today we're going to take a look at what you can actually expect to pay for these new gpus take a look at the performance and the value that you'd be getting and whether they are still worth it or not to be clear this video is neither a rant about the current gpu pricing situation or an encouragement to pay outrageous prices i want to have a productive discussion about whether these new gpus still make sense at their actual listed pricing right now and since we're on the note of the rtx 3060 let's start with that one first so i had actually planned a video between three rtx 3060 models the gigabyte eagle the asus strix and the msi gaming x but after seeing what these cards were actually priced at that comparison became completely irrelevant the rtx 3060 is already a tough sell within the 30 series lineup with roughly rtx 2060 super to 2070 performance so you have to ask yourself would you have paid 500 us for an rtx 2060 super definitely not my advice here is that unless you can get a 30 60 for 350 us or under it's just not worth it funnily enough any more than that and you're actually approaching 30 60 ti territory speaking of which it is actually possible to buy a 3060 ti at its msrp of 399 us but that's only if you get very lucky with a founder's edition model which aren't even available in all regions pricing for custom 3060 ti cards also seems to be around that 500 mark like the custom 3060s with some models even in excess of 600 dollars so referring back to my launch day review the 3060 ti performs about in line with the 700 rtx 2080 from last generation but to be fair that car didn't offer very good value at all a more productive comparison would be against the radeon 5700 xt which commonly sold for around the 450 mark and offered tremendous value at that price so 500 then for a 30 60 ti doesn't actually look so bad sure it's 100 over msrp which is quite a lot but if you're sick of waiting it's not a terrible deal once you begin approaching 600 though the 3060 ti begins to resemble just slightly better value than a gtx 1080 ti which would be fine if it was a 4 year old gpu and that's where the 3070 comes in with listings in excess of six hundred dollars us for what should be a 500 card no doubt more than a few of you have gotten your hands on a founder's edition model if you were extremely lucky and if it was even available in your region to start with but for most of the custom cards out there expect to pay between 600 and 650 and at that pricing the value of the 3070 is still overall not bad with performance about 15 percent faster than a 30 60 ti so paying about 15 percent more would make sense some would even justify slightly more given how close the performance is to the 1 000 plus rtx 2080 ti from last generation but i think the main point here is to not pay too much more than a 30 60 ti or get too close to the 3080 whatever that pricing looks like in your particular region now before we go any further i know what a lot of you are thinking these cards aren't even in stock at this pricing anyway and you would be correct at this very moment no they're not but stock does frequently refresh so you'll need to stay notified and keep up to date for when new stock does come in maybe even buying them in store on specific days if possible if you don't take my word for it check out this poll that i ran a couple of weeks ago with a good chunk of you guys actually getting your hands on the new gpus also in my upcoming video where i check out some of your gaming setups i was really surprised by how many of you actually had rtx 30 series gpus so those comments about nvidia making like three rtx 3080s in total they just aren't true and with that in mind let's actually talk about the rtx 3080 so same thing here 699 us for the founders edition model if you get really lucky with a restock or a pre-order or even manage to buy it in store which would be seriously lucky this would be more of the unlikely scenario that you'd be able to get your hands on a founder's edition model most likely availability of the custom cards is what's going to pop up a lot more frequently and those are priced at 850 plus and just to be clear this isn't scalper pricing which you'd more likely see close to the 1 000 mark on somewhere like ebay this is just really elevated pricing for aib cards at retail stores but to play devil's advocate here even if you were to pay a thousand dollars us for an rtx 3080 you'd still be getting better value than an rtx 2080 ti speaking of which was priced at around 1 000 to hundred dollars and offered anywhere between fifteen to thirty percent less performance depending on the title and the resolution again i'm not recommending that you actually pay that sort of money because you'd be paying about three hundred to two hundred dollars more than what you should be just comparing it to the value of the previous gen 2080 ti for some extra scope and then we have the rtx 3090 which is actually one of the more in stock cards that i'm seeing out there in the wild mostly because it's super expensive anyway even at the 1500 msrp and because the 24 gigabytes of video memory probably isn't useful for that many people there's not much reasonable advice that i can give here but the custom boards are going to land around that 1700 to 2 000 mark at this point i think we can agree the only people buying the 3090 are those with a truckload of disposable income and they just want the best of the best and also those who actually need that much video memory for their particular line of work and the difference between paying fifteen hundred dollars and two thousand dollars honestly probably isn't a big deal so what about the amd radeon 6000 cards like the 6800 xt well amd stock situation appears significantly worse than nvidia's again referring back to that poll that i ran a couple of weeks ago the number of you in comparison that own radeon 6000 cards is extremely slim personally i think the whole amd vs nvidia has a lot less to do with it and it's more about what cards are actually available if you really like nvidia but the 6800 xt was the only card available of course you would just get the 6800 xt uh something that might be a bit of a fun fact for you guys is that i have a lot of rtx 30 series cards here for testing and for review but i do not own a single radeon 6000 gpu my review units from amd were snatched up pretty much immediately after the review was done and i haven't been able to buy a single one since i have on the other hand at least managed to purchase a 30 90 which i liquid called for my personal system a 360 ti that i used for a recent mini itx build and also a recent 30 70 for a friend and at least for the radeon 6800 and 6800 xt listings that i can see online the pricing is just seriously out of this world about 300 dearer than the competing 30 series cards that might differ slightly depending on your region but globally the rtx 30 series do at least look a little bit more attainable so that leaves us in a really interesting spot for upcoming gpu reviews such as the upcoming radeon 6700 xt that's supposed to be a 480 gpu but i just don't think that's being realistic i will say at least from a reviewer's perspective the desire to do like really in-depth gpu benchmarks with analysis based on value between the msrp of different gpus and the frame rate per dollar it has really evaporated and diminished after each gpu launch sure we can still test the absolute performance of these cards and that's great still useful for the consumer 100 but any closing statement or recommendation based off of the msrp of the card at least the ones that the manufacturers give you just becomes totally irrelevant when the gpu actually launches in saying that some of these cards not the 3060 are still worth it even 100 to 200 over the base msrp so if you're sick of waiting around that sort of pricing will likely be your best chance for a while so really hope this video helped you out as always a huge thanks for watching stay tuned for more gp reviews in the future based not off of msrp and i will see you all in the next one
