now I don't usually dedicate an entire video to a single graphics card unless it's part of a GPU launch or it's really interesting ITX graphics cards this small are part of that really interesting category because it is fun to explore how companies have crammed so much power into a small PCB and cooler and I'm really glad that I tested the new rx 5600 XT I TX from power color because not only is it the smallest 5600 XT that you can buy at only 175 millimeters but it also has a really big problem that you guys should be aware of it's the kind of problem that will give you a headache in the literal sense and if you're not careful probably set off your fire alarm as well for those of you who are prepared to do a bit of manual tuning though this card does have some hope and it could still be a viable option for those with a seriously tiny gaming rig so power color I'm sorry but I really do have to put you under the flame for this one it's not something that I usually do but someone over there really is not doing their job now I understand that for most of you IT excise graphics cards aren't totally relevant seeing as even full-length cards that do fit in cases under 15 litres these days but if you're building something really really small say under five or six litres usually only cards under 175 to 200 mils will fit that means for cases like the sky Ridge for many the volca three and in tolls nook nine extreme these graphics cards are relevant and it's great to say that they're still being made so as a point of comparison we'll be comparing power colours ITX model to the full sized sapphire poles which I'd say is one of these safer options on today's market and by full-sized it's by no means a triple slot triple fan behemoth that would be pretty overkill for an Rx 5600 XT GPU anyway but it's definitely a regular sized card that a lot of people would be more inclined to buy now let's just skip straight to the thermal performance because that's where things get a little bit concerning for whatever reason the fan curve on power colors.i tx/rx 5600 xt is just completely broken to the point where I'd say it's actually dangerous to be around somehow power color thought it was a good idea to reduce the fan speed as the GPU hotspot approaches 91 degree C I'm not kidding the fan speed literally slows down as every component on the card gets hotter now to be fair the fan curve on the sapphire pulse also slows down over the first couple minutes and settles down to a steady-state but at least it's sufficient enough to keep the GPU hotspot under control not only that but power colors ITX fan curve is just a complete mess in general it's all over the place so instead of having a slightly louder and much cooler system you can now enjoy a burning smell in your room and I really need to emphasize that burning smell here because it reminds me of the times when I used to run my 3d printer in my room next to my desk and I'd have to open the window and leave the room because it would give me a migraine it's enough to leave you with a really really strong headache that will linger for hours which is exactly what I got here only having this car testbench for 30 minutes now some of you might think that I'm being a bit harsh to power color here because at the end of the day you can overcome this burning smell and really hot thermals with a manual fan curve which we'll take a look at in just a minute so I'm not doing this for clickbait or drama I don't enjoy doing that kind of thing the reason I'm doing this is because 90% of people buying this graphics card won't see this video review and they also won't know what to do when they smell a burning smell in their system they won't know what hardware monitoring software to download and then what fan training software to download to fix it in fact if they're going to be building a complete system from the ground up they won't even know that it's coming from their graphics card they might think it's coming from their power supply they might think it's coming from you know the motherboard connectors that is going to cause the end user a you know hours and potentially days of troubleshooting and what makes this worse is that power color have had a similar thin profile issue with their 5600 XT red dragon resulting in the same burning smell it's simply unacceptable and it honestly makes it look like power color don't even care about what they're producing now the good news is is that if you're watching this review you probably know that you can manually set your own fan curve in a program like MSI Afterburner and this will completely fix that burning smell that's created for example with the fan speed set to 2,000 rpm as opposed to the 1000 or 1200 rpm at stock thermals across the board are now a bit cooler than the larger sapphire pulse again there's no magic here we haven't under vaulted we haven't replaced the thermal pads and we haven't increased the mounting pressure of the heatsink all we've done is lift that fan curve of course it is a bit louder but by no means was the ITX card unbearably loud so apart from the horrible stock fan curve and the potential to give you a literal headache power colors 5600 xti FTX is a capable little graphics card this model does have the updated v bios with a raised power limit and 14 gigabits per second memory clock to allow to perform right in line with nvidia czar TX 2060 as does the sapphire pulse which performs pretty much identically performance at 1080p makes this card pretty much ideal in terms of value and I could see this being very suitable for a tiny portable gaming rig while also being cheaper than the RT X 2060 ITX cards power color also makes the same card in an RX 5700 variant but I'd personally avoid that one you'd be paying around $50 or so more for not much of a performance uplift over this 5600 XT so after manually setting the fan curve this is a pretty capable card and I can recommend it I'm a little bit hesitant there because it does leave a bit of a bad taste when it does actually give you a headache after testing and not modifying that stock fan curve but if you are buying this card manually tuning it is 100% necessary there's no question about it and for the guy or team over there at power color who is responsible for the fan training of their graphics cards this is a big mistake because it not only leaves a scar on this graphics card but across your whole product lineup and your whole brand now customers who might have bought the red dragon or the Red Devil both really good cards might pass up on those and buy something else if you're after the most powerful graphics card to fit that ITX spec of 175 millimeters your best option is still the RT x 2070 mini from msi however quite a few of you have said that that is a bit hard to get your hands on so if you don't mind setting your own fan curve in MSI Afterburner this is a graphics card that I can objectively recommend that quite reluctantly I will leave it linked down below for those interested as always a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
