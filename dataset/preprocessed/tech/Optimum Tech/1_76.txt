today we're reviewing the rtx 3070 ti and after the appalling value that we saw last week with the 3080 ti hoping this one is a little better as usual we'll take a look at gaming performance production workloads and thermals and the main focus of this review will be looking at how the 37eti compares to the 3070 and the 3080. the pricing of the 370ti puts it dead center between the 3070 and the 3080 are on paper at least so let's see if it's any good how is this compared to an rtx 3080 [Music] now the cooler design for the rtx 3070 ti founders edition is actually a unique one that we haven't seen from nvidia just yet it's kind of like a hybrid between the cooler that you'll find on the 30 70 and then on the 3080 and the size sits right between them as well coming in at 267 mils in length for reference that's the exact same length as a lot of the other founders edition cards on the market and reference cards so fitting this into your compact case of choice shouldn't be an issue what might be an issue though is the 290 watt tdp that is a monstrous 70 watt increase over the standard 3070 and just 30 watts shy of a 3080 so it's pretty clear why they had to opt for a much larger cooler here spec wise it uses a slightly beefed up ga 104 gpu that you'd find on an rtx 3070 just with an additional 256 cuda cores here for the ti and it's running at a slightly higher boost clock as well the main upgrade here is in the form of memory where the 3070 ti gets upgraded to gddr6x memory running at the same clock speed that you'd find on a 3080. then when it comes to the pricing it's dead in the middle of the two at 599 us although with the current state of the market it's really anyone's guess what the real pricing will be here at launch but given the rare occasion that you might have the opportunity to buy a 30 70 30 70 ti or 3080 even if it's among different models of pre-builts for example which one should you go for let's start off with battlefield 5 at 4k ultra settings with a direct comparison between the 3070 3070 ti and 3080 where exactly does the 370 ti fit between them well here it's definitely closer to a 30 70 than a 3080. the 370ti is around 12 percent faster here than a standard 3070 but the 3080 is around 19 faster again with the same price margin typically the higher up the gpu performance louder you go the less performance you get back in return but that's not exactly the case here in fact we see quite the opposite those margins do look a bit more reasonable at 1440p but still there's a bigger gap here between the 3080 and the 3070 ti historically that's not what you'd expect from a ti branded card at all in death stranding though performance looks slightly more reasonable remember the 37etis msrp although fairly useless metric in today's market is dead center between the 30 70 and the 3080 so you'd expect it to at least perform better than the direct middle of those two cards the differences in gpu and memory spec between the three cards makes that pretty hard to achieve in every game it's not going to be exactly balanced but so far we're seeing pretty average performance from the 30 70 ti in fact unfortunately this is one of the smaller margins that i saw between the 3070 ti and 3080 because pretty much in everything else the 3080 is a good chunk faster and the 100 between the 3070 ti and the 3080 goes a bit further in terms of performance than the 100 that you'd spend upgrading from a 30 70 to the ti that might change in the real world maybe the price difference up to the 30 80 will be bigger in comparison and in that case maybe the 30 70 ti wouldn't be so bad there's an 11 uplift here between the 30 70 and the 30 70 ti at 4k in shadow of the tomb raider but then a hefty 22 uplift to the 30 80. at the end of the day the 3080 has over 40 percent more crude calls and a wider memory bus width than the 3070 ti so it's not unrealistic at all to see these kind of performance margins when you look at the specs horizon zero dawn at 4k is another great example here we're paying the extra 17 for the 3080 on paper at least results in about a 20 uplift in performance typically at this performance range that's considered a really good deal and of course to add even more gpus to the discussion you also have the radeon 6800 xt although that's a card that's even more difficult to find than the 30 series for what it's worth though performance of the 6800 xt seems to cut right between the 3070 ti and the 3080 here in rainbow six siege at 4k although since it uses a completely different architecture that performance margin will shift around quite a bit depending on the game when looking at the full stack we see a similar picture here to the other titles 12 between the two 30 70s and then a bigger 18 percent jump to the 30 80. once we drop to 1440p those margins do close a little bit as we start to encounter game engine limitations and the game becomes a little bit more cpu bound but overall the scaling does look pretty similar and actually an interesting comparison here is against the rtx 2080 ti which launched almost three years ago and could be bought for 1200 u.s given today's gpu market has there actually been any improvement i mean if the 37 eti ends up selling at retailers for a thousand dollars plus then we are basically looking at no improvement in value here not to mention the 3070 ti actually pulls around 20 watts more power than the 2080 ti here of course if the 3070 ti actually exists as a 600 card it completely wipes the floor with the 2080 ti here but i strongly doubt that's going to happen the way things are right now one thing's for sure though the 3070 ti is at least a little less enraging than at the 30 80 ti this comparison in cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p with ray tracing and dls enabled shows exactly why with single digit percentage points gained over the 3080 for an extra 500 in the end there are now seven rtx 30 series gpus on the menu and the best enthusiast choice is the rtx 3080 so concluding gaming performance of the 3070 ti it's okay it sits between the 30 70 and the 3080 but unfortunately most of the time it is closer to the 30 70 and again who knows what the price differences will actually be like in the real world but based off of msrp at least here you should either go for a 30 70 or a 30 80. as for production workloads the story might even be more underwhelming here believe it or not since the 3070 ti only has two additional sms over the standard 3070. it really lacks the engine to get anywhere close to the 3080 when it comes to rendering so for a production workload card again the 3080 would be the better pick or just save the cache and go for the 3070 which is plenty fast for most users video stabilization in davinci resolve looked a little bit promising though which shows that in memory intensive workloads like this there will be a noticeable uplift as for clock speeds and power the 3070 ti settled in at 1890 megahertz after a 30 minute benchmark run and pulled an average of 280 watts while doing so clocks overall look pretty stable and we don't seem to be power limited here which is good the cooler on the 3070 ti also looks kind of average running a bit warmer here compared to a 30 70 or a 3080 under the same conditions you also have to keep in mind when installed in a case and positioned in a warmer environment that's definitely enough to push the temps into the 80s in the end the rtx 3070 ti is a kind of average kind of underwhelming gpu offering especially since it's been around nine months since the first launch of the 30 series gpus including the 3070 and 3080. really the only reason that this exists and that the performance and value is so mediocre in comparison to those gpus is because of the current state of the market this isn't too far off from being a physical 30-70 only around a 10 to 12 performance difference between them but it still will have no problem selling at all so really there isn't much reason here for the 37 eti to exist and honestly if it eats into the production of the 30 70 and 30 60 ti then that makes it even worse uh at the moment the best gpus for gaming 30 series at least 360 ti 3070 and 3080. so if you can find some good prices on those three cards then that would be ideal and especially if you're looking at pre-builds those are the three gpus to definitely take a look at historically the ti branded gpus have always been exciting for consumers because it often bridges that gap between in this case a 30 70 and 3080 so it would have been really cool to see a 100 cheaper rtx 3080 competitor here but that's just not something that you can expect from a video when gpus are selling so easily right now as always guys a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
