if you're interested in gaming mice you'd probably know about the g pro wireless the razer viper ultimate as well and maybe even the glorious model oh but most of you have probably never heard of the pwnage ultra custom symmetrical the name is a mouthful but i'd easily put this mouse right up there with the best on the market personally i put this in my top three come on what makes this so special then well for starters it's a lightweight wireless gaming mouse for just eighty dollars us and that already puts it right up there with the glorious model oh wireless in terms of value that's a gaming mouse that was super hyped up for those few reasons alone and surprisingly this is actually pretty damn good wireless implementation as well there's a usb dongle included which attaches at the end of the charging cord just as you'd expect from those more premium offerings and charging is done via usb type c i couldn't measure any difference in click latency versus my logitech g pro x super light or any wide mouse for that matter so i'm more than comfortable using this for online competitive matches the shape is what really drew me towards this mouse though because it's based off of the shell of the very popular zowie s2 a mouse that is perfect for claw grip users like myself that's this mouse right here as you can see i've modded this one slightly with some new glides and an ultralight cable because i did actually use this as my main mouse for a couple of months and still to this day this shape is undoubtedly one of the best that i've ever used but there are a few reasons that i decided to ditch the s2 firstly the scroll wheel is absolutely trash and a real pain to use for everyday use secondly is the weight i just prefer something a little bit closer to that 60 to 70 gram mark and lastly i really do enjoy the total freedom that you get from wireless so you can think of the ultra custom symmetrical as like a wireless zowie s2 with a lighter shell and a much better scroll wheel there are other differences that we'll get into in just a moment but those are the main differences that you need to be aware of and for that reason many will consider this as a clone or a copycat product but if the company is building on the original product and making it significantly better which is what this is then i'm okay with that and that leads me to the next point of discussion which is customization this mouse has the most extensive customization that i've seen from any gaming mouse and it's done incredibly well the honeycomb back cover is magnetically attached and can be completely removed and there is a solid cover included which you can replace it with and apart from there being a black and white model you also have the choice between honeycomb cutouts on the sides or just completely solid the one that i've got here is honeycomb and it's okay but the grip is just not the best i definitely recommend getting the one with solid grips instead so basically that gives you the option for a full honeycomb shell which brings the mouse to around 72 grams or a completely solid shell which should bring the weight to around 77 grams now one really important thing to note here is that you'd think that with these clip on button covers and shell components that you'd be left with a kind of cheap feeling build quality but that's not the case at all in fact there's absolutely zero play in any of the magnetically attached parts which is great to see so you are getting a product that feels very well designed and put together the sensor here is the pixart paw 3355 which feels great and playing at my usual sensitivity and 800 dpi felt very familiar one big catch though the lift off distance of this mouse is definitely on the higher end and this is 100 something that you should consider before picking it up if you're someone who mostly uses your wrist to aim with a high sensitivity and you make lots of small lift off adjustments like this the higher liftoff distance of this sensor will catch you off guard if however you play on a moderate to low sensitivity and you really only lift off with a big swipes then it's not something that's really going to bother you personally it is something that i got used to pretty quickly even with the big swipes and 180s i didn't feel the mouse freaking out when i reset it on the pad but it's definitely a point worth considering if you primarily used your wrist to aim and you make a lot of frequent small lift-offs here's a quick listen to the buttons which use 50m omron switches slightly heavier than the gpro wireless and the s2 but overall very comfortable to use in terms of battery life i'm seeing about a week on a single charge which is actually pretty solid for a very small company i'd say it's about a couple of days behind my g pro x super light which is the longest lasting wireless mouse that i've used the software is also super basic you can change the dpi settings the polling rate and also the rgb lighting overall you've got everything you need here for normal use but the interface is visually pretty lacking so how would i rank this versus other top wireless options like the model o wireless g305 and g pro x super light well in the end a lot of your choice is going to be based off of the size and shape of the mouse and your own grip preference i have medium to large sized hands and use a claw grip so naturally that makes the pwnage ultra custom symmetrical a great fit for me i even managed to beat my high score in aimlab's grid shot and finally passed over 90 000 so i personally find this mouse really really comfortable to use i'd still say the g pro x super light is the ultimate wireless gaming mouse that you can buy right now but there are just plenty of people out there who prefer the shape of the xaoy s2 as well as something a bit more affordable so to have that here with wireless a better scroll wheel and a much lighter customizable shell not to mention just 80 bucks it's a no-brainer i'd even go as far as ranking this mouse ahead of the model o wireless and the viper ultimate especially if you prefer a claw grip and that larger rear support it really is crazy though how we have these really small brands who have been able to catch up with the giants like razer and logitech in terms of wireless implementation the ultra custom symmetrical is the perfect example in my opinion of an excellent affordable wireless mouse that i think a lot more people should know about so overall a really awesome mouse i think a lot more people should know about especially given the popularity of the zowie s2 and how many people love the shape of that mouse i think the lift off distance is going to be the kind of deal breaker for most people so if you're someone who primarily risked aims and makes adjustments like this then it's probably not the best kind of option for you i will leave some links down in the description for those interested as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
