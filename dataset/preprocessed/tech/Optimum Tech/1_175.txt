today we're testing four of these b550 itx motherboards to see which one is the best one for your amd ryzen system we're testing them with a 16 core ryzen 3950x which may be a bit overkill for what you guys might be playing but we'll be analyzing vrm and cpu thermals as well as cpu boost clocks overall you've got some really good choices here if you're planning your next itx gaming pc build with a third or fourth gen ryzen processor however there are some big differences between them that you should definitely know about firstly some of you might be wondering why choose a b550 motherboard in the first place for an amd ryzen build why not go for a cheaper b450 motherboard or maybe a premium x570 board instead and there are a few reasons why i feel b550 is the way to go for most users but maybe not all to start with vrm design on b550 is very comparable to x570 with some boards that we're looking at today using 90 amp power stages the b550 chipset also doesn't need active cooling like x570 does so if you want to go for a completely fanless motherboard then that's an option and compared to b450 you also have the peace of mind when it comes to fourth generation ryzen cpu support you know that it's guaranteed to be supported not just attempted to be supported and you don't know what features might be missing not to mention getting the full rated speeds out of your high speed memory kit is still a bit of a hit and miss on b450 but you're much less likely to run into an issue with b550 of course though there are exceptions if you're going for a no compromise rendering build and you need a ton of rear i o x 570 could definitely be justified as can be 450 if pricing in your region is favorable and you're going to be building something really on the budget end of the scale with no plans to upgrade to 4th gen ryzen so hopefully that outlines my current views on b550 versus b450 and x570 now let's take a look at the specific boards that we'll be testing today first up we have the asus b550i strix which actually borrows a lot in design from its more expensive x570i model one of those being the integrated vrm fan which can be useful in cases with restricted motherboard airflow and i will note that this doesn't actually spin up until the vrm starts warming up next up we have the msi b550i edge gaming and overall a great looking board on the surface the heatsink design here is fairly reserved but msi do include a cooling plate at the rear of the board directly behind the power stages now i will note there is one thing that i did encounter and i seriously despise it about this board and that's that the clear cmos header is hidden behind the pre-installed i o shield what this means is that if you run into any problems with cpu or memory overclocking and your system doesn't post you can't reset the bios without actually removing the board from your system and shorting these two pins most users hopefully won't need to worry about this but it doesn't excuse this absolutely terrible design choice on the plus side we do have an actively called m.2 slot on the front so if you are running a high-speed toasty m.2 nvme drive this might help you avoid throttling next up we have asrock's b550i phantom gaming which is a huge step up from what we saw from their b450 offering there's not much to say on this one it's a very reserved board on the surface which could be a good thing but i will highlight the stacked right angle sata ports which i feel is a great use of space now as for gigabytes b550i aorus pro ax it's the heaviest sport out of the four here and as with their z490 itx board they've decided to include this fairly pointless metal block that covers the m.2 heatsink and only really serves as a visual accessory personally i'm not a fan of this and i'd prefer if it was actually part of the m.2 cooling design otherwise i'd say the gigabyte board has the best passive vrm cooling design here it's the only board that features a heat pipe to help dissipate that heat elsewhere and i also give the cooling plate on the rear a big thumbs up the power stages here are absolutely sandwiched between the heatsinks on either side and as we'll see this is very effective when it comes to vrm calling unfortunately though this board is the only one out of the four to not have a front usb type-c header and that's a real shame if your itx case otherwise has that to offer now when it comes to the vrm that's the section of the pcb that's kind of responsible for the power delivery to the cpu all four of these b550 itx motherboards are definitely adequate and a huge step up from a b450 the asus strix uses a paired four plus two phase configuration with 50 amp power stages amounting to eight power stages in total for the cpu it's also the only motherboard here with an actively called vrm and that might come in handy for exceptionally small cases overall this vrm is the weakest out of the four here but only marginally msi's edge gaming is a bit better with a true 8 pwm phases for the cpu portion of the vrm the soc portion also gets two of these 60 amp power stages but this is only with a single pwm phase azerox phantom gaming uses a six plus two phase configuration with 90 amp power stages all around so they're going for a smaller footprint approach on the pcb but with higher potential output gigabytes aurus pro ax is also using a six plus two phase layout with 90 amp power stages with the same pwm controller as the asrock board overall a fairly beefy vrm and a massive step up from their b450itx board and as we'll see in just a couple of minutes all four of these b550 itx motherboards can handle an overclocked 3950x in blender no problem at all even after a sustained period so i don't think it's worth being hyper focused on the vrm design and maybe primarily choosing a board over another one just simply because it has a slightly stronger vrm most of you are not running overclocked 3900xs and 3950xs in your system and really the vrm shouldn't be the deciding factor between these boards for most of you out there and that follows nicely into our first test which looks at what kind of performance these boards will actually give you when running a ryzen 3950x at stock settings as some of you might know by now the word stock especially when it comes to amd ryzen is really up to the motherboard and how far it wants to push the cpu stock can mean different things depending on which motherboard you're using all of these motherboards are running their latest bios revision and here we're taking a look at the stock performance in blender with a ryzen 3950x after just simply loading an xmp memory profile the child on the left is intentionally zoomed in the y-axis starts at 3800 megahertz and not zero and this way we can clearly see the difference in boost clock performance between these motherboards then on the right we have the temperature of the cpu and it goes without saying we're using the same cpu cooler thermal paste ambient room temperature pump speed and fan speed for all of these runs the only different variable is the motherboard and still we get some drastically different performance the asrock board in purple ran the 3950x the fastest here with all 16 cores averaging out to almost 4.1 gigahertz but you will pay for that performance with cpu thermals around 10 degrees warmer than the other boards otherwise the other three b550 itx boards and the x570 board performed very similarly boost clocks were within 100 megahertz of each other and cpu thermals were within 4 degrees c if we really had to nitpick the b550 itx boards from gigabyte and asus gave us the best balance of clock speed and cpu thermals both were above four gigahertz and around 61c and as you would expect this varying boost clock performance corresponds directly to actual performance here in cinebench with all threads enabled the difference from the top and bottom score is around four percent single threaded performance on the other hand was pretty much identical between all of these boards so for those types of workloads there's nothing really to consider and lastly we have the vrm thermals after 30 minutes of sweating it out in blender and as i mentioned in the vrm design section all of these boards are totally viable i will give the gigabyte board some praise though for achieving vrm thermals that are just slightly better than the x570i strix if the build you have in mind involves a lot of cpu based 3d rendering or video encoding then this is definitely a chart to consider however for gaming focused builds it's important to have some perspective any b550 itx board here will pass this vrm thermal stress test and shouldn't be the main point to decide on so the ultimate question after all of that which board do you actually go with because they all seem to be fairly evenly matched the initial reaction is to suggest this board here this is gigabytes b550i aorus pro ax it had the coolest vrm thermals out of any of the boards that we tested i personally like the bios user interface quite a lot when it comes to overclocking and fan tuning and it just so happens that this is the cheapest of the b550 itx boards that we tested at around 180 us dollars which the other boards come in at around 200 to 230 so it's an excellent board however there are two things that i really don't like about this board firstly it doesn't have a front usb type c header which means that you can forget about using that type c port on cases like the nzxt h1 and case m1 or den a4 and so on and it also doesn't have any onboard debug leds which the asus and msi board do have if you don't care about either of those two things then this board would definitely be my first pick but if you do care about those two things then it's between the asus strix and msi edge which are priced identically at the time of filming at around 230 usd the msi board doesn't have rgb backlighting which some of you may care about and it also lacks a 12 volt rgb header the asus strix has both m.2 drive cooling should be a bit better on the msi board but as i showed earlier if you're ever in the position where your overclock doesn't go to plan you're going to be absolutely kicking yourself to access that clear cmos header so that leaves this board here which is asrock's b550 phantom gaming itx which kind of has everything on the surface doesn't really have any missing things or problems however it did run the ryzen 3950x at stock a bit more aggressively and quite a bit warmer than the other three boards however do note this is kind of irrelevant if you're going to be overclocking or just manually setting your own frequency and voltage i will note personally i think the asus b550i strokes is the most complete board out of the four here in the sense that it checks the most boxes it doesn't feel like it's missing anything at the same time though it does have a marginally weaker vrm than these other options and that is definitely something to consider if you are planning on heavily overclocking a 3900x or 3950x and to make your decision harder rear i o is also painfully similar on all of these boards they all get 2.5 gigabit lan wi-fi 6 bios flashback usb type-c and a display output for ryzen apus so as you can see choosing between any four of these itx boards is pretty difficult and you can make a case for either one based on their pros and cons it really comes down to whether you need those missing ports or headers or whether you're going to be overclocking and tinkering with your cpu and memory otherwise i will leave them linked down below in the description and you can make your decision based off of pricing in your region which is actually a very sensible thing to do if some of these things that i mentioned kind of aren't relevant to you and your build as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
