today we're testing this insanely compact dual to 40 ml radiator custom loop that I built in the nkm one in my last video we've got a slim 240 ml rat at the bottom paired with a couple of slim fans and a 38 millimeter thick 240 ml ramp from ek mounted on the side what I'm really interested to see here is how the film was compared to my own system which also uses an r/t X 20 80 TI but is around 3 liters smaller and only uses a single 240 ml rad so this is pretty much the densest hand case m1 that you can build and to put this into perspective there are plenty of mainstream mid tower cases out there that don't have this much radiator volume that they can accommodate so let's see how this thing actually performs [Music] for those that missed the initial video this build uses an RT X 20 atti a 10 900k a low profile 32gb Bakiyev 3000 megahertz memory to full copper radiators a bunch of soft tubing and a few tightly packed compression fittings also since this build has no reservoir it had to be really patient in filling up the loop to the brim ideally you'd connect an external reservoir by the quick disconnect fittings and then bleed the loop with a high pump speed over a couple of hours the pump that's running the entire loop is the 4500 rpm DDC pump that comes mounted to the Swift tach apogee drive to cpu pump block I saw a few comments asking whether this was indeed powerful enough to run the entire loop so I've done some testing here at a few different pump speeds these set up for air flow has both radiators taking in fresh air from the exterior and then exhausting that into the case but because the nkm one is so well ventilated the hot air doesn't really have a problem making its way outside of the case and that's made even easier thanks to the four total fans there is quite a lot of pressure in there the result is that most of the hot air end up exiting through the top and the rear and also a small amount up the sides just above that bottom radiator so a lot of the thermal testing that I did here is just aimed at answering quite a few questions that have had with this build for example how fast we need to run that pump how fast we need to run the fans and is there a big difference between the dual radiator configuration and just the single radiator at the bottom let's start off by taking a look at that RTX 2080 TI which is undoubtedly what's going to contribute most of the heat into this loop and running it completely stock with the fans at 1500 rpm the 20 80 TI sits at just 50 degrees C which is a pretty mind-blowing result for a PC under 15 liters now I've outlined the benefits of GPU under vaulting in many previous videos but in short if you want to significantly reduce power consumption thermals and coil whine there's no better way to spend five to ten minutes with a fairly conservative undervolt on the 20 80 TI running 1900 megahertz at 900 millivolts we get a 7 degree reduction with the GPU now at just 43 c to illustrate how these GPU thermals are let's go ahead and compare this to my own personal rig which also uses a 20 80 TI but on a single 240 ml radiator so there's around a 13 C difference between them and that 63 C that's a fairly warm result for a water-cooled 2080 TI this is the main reason that I run a permanent under vault for my GPU as for CPU thermals well we can only reduce that so much by adding more and more radiator volume because there are other limitations such as the thermal transfer between the CPU diet and the heat spreader and then the heat spreader to the CPU block having said that we do get a very respectable result for our 10 900 K which is running with unlimited power on the MSI z4 90 I unify motherboard pulling close to 200 watts and running at 4.9 gigahertz vrm thermals were also absolutely fine here despite a lot of concern for how densely packed this build is settling under sixty degrees C after thirty minutes in blender fan speed does play a big role for this build to decreasing all full fans down to an almost silent 1000 rpm saw the GPU temperature by six degrees C as compared to 1500 rpm but it's still within a very very safe range also this is with the stock 20 atti pushing around 260 watts into the loop which makes this even more impressive you could probably get it back down to that 50 C mark with some under wall thing and for those who were questioning the pump choice be assured that it's plenty fast enough to run this build by increasing the pump speed from 2500 rpm to 30 750 rpm we only see a 2 degree reduction and by reducing it to its minimum speed just 1250 rpm the result isn't that much warmer at all beyond 3000 rpm is where this pump starts to get audible and honestly at its max 4500 rpm it is insanely overkill and not really worth testing you could totally run this loop at 1250 rpm if you really wanted and lastly just because we can let's see what happens when we disconnect to that side mounted radiator from the entire loop and leave that bottom mounted radiator to cool the entire system well it is still viable and I have seen a lot of n case m1 loops designed this way but you'd probably need to under all the 2080 TI the dual radiator configuration is significantly better and highly recommended and lastly here's a quick look at the noise levels between the two tested fan speeds so after taking a look at the thermal performance of this build I think we can pretty confidently call this a no compromise ITX system it runs significantly cooler than my own personal rig which uses a single radiator and it really crushes anything else that I've built previously under 20 litres while it might be a bit overkill for a video editing an eSports gaming machine which I've optimized my current smaller machine around this is seriously perfect for those that need to cram an uncompromising level of power into a tiny case now of course there's no such thing as no compromise right especially building ITX there are obvious compromises like you can't put thread ripper in here you can't put multi GPUs in here and you can't put multiple three and a half inch drives especially with the amount of sort of space that's taken up by the radiators but in terms of raw performance thermals and noise levels this is the best ITX machine that i've ever built today and although i'm not going to be using this as my personal build just yet I do eventually see myself arriving at this configuration when I do need more power and more cooling for those of you who are interested in the parts that went into this build I will leave them linked down below in the description as well as the initial video if you happen to miss that as always a huge thanks for watching guys and I'll see you all in the next one
