all right so recently i posted my review of the m1 max 16 inch macbook pro and yeah this thing is damn quick uh it can handle my 6k video footage no problem at all 60 megapixel raw photos in lightroom also no problem all while basically sipping power and making no noise so with this insane performance i am just personally really curious to see you know what the performance compares like versus my desktop pc setup which is honestly kind of insane it's one of the fastest pcs that you can build at the moment and you know the comparison here i'm just wondering how much performance i would be sacrificing if i was to take some of that video editing photo editing workflow and go portable because with my 2020 macbook pro yeah i could do that i definitely could edit on the go but by doing that i was probably making the editing process about twice as long at the very least this video should give us an idea of how the fastest pc that you can build today compares to apple's fastest current silicon which is the m1 max so here's the pc that i've been using for the past year all up we're looking at about 6 000 us dollars crammed into a sub 13 liter mini itx case and it's fully piped with the best watercoloring components on the market it's packing some of the fastest components that you can build with right now apart from the cpu which was recently dethroned by intel's 12900k still though with a ryzen 5950x and an rtx 3090 in there at the moment this build just tears through absolutely everything i can throw at it i use it for all of the video production stuff here on the channel and it also doubles as my streaming and gaming pc as well at the same time this thing needs a ton of calling to stay happy and despite it being compact and somewhat portable it's not like i'm going to lug this thing around with me to do some editing on the go and i've actually been asked about this quite a lot and that's the whole portability aspect of these compact computers that i'm typically building here on the channel for me the tiny form factor doesn't really have anything to do with portability at all and it's almost entirely just about not building a pc bigger than it needs to be now sure you could chuck this thing in a very large backpack and take it around with you but then you also need a monitor a keyboard a mouse and most importantly a power outlet even when i've gone to computex where i'm editing and publishing a couple of videos per day at least i've always just brought a laptop and then just compromised on the footage itself usually that means filming and editing in 1080p rather than 4k or 6k whenever i've gone on holidays as well i typically like to bring a little bit of work with me there too and again it's always a laptop not a mini itx pc with a ton of stuff around it with the new m1 max though that's not really a compromise that i need to make anymore as my initial review showed i can edit 6k video on this thing no problem at all and at the same time things like timeline scrubbing image stabilization color grading even exporting speed wise it at least feels exactly the same to my desktop pc and while we're on the note of video editing let's talk about that first because the results here are honestly quite insane so i'm currently shooting on the sony a7s3 which is a 4k mirrorless camera but i'm also using the blackmagic pocket cinema camera 6k when it comes to b-roll and stuff like that and you know just having that raw footage to dial everything in just the way i want it but you know whether i'm using the 6k footage or the 4k footage from the sony it just honestly feels exactly the same on either device whether it's the new m1 max 16-inch from apple or my 30-90 pc chopping up editing the footage color grading all of that stuff you know user experience wise speed wise i'm not being slowed down by either device which is really good to see what's really interesting though is when we take a look at the export times for the 15 minute 6k demo project that i've created here and what's really interesting is the new 16-inch m1 max it's actually faster in fact almost twice as fast when we're exporting this in 6k resolution this was a bit hard for me to believe at first so i kept repeating and repeating the same benchmark over and over again and double checking all of the settings and i kept getting the exact same result for whatever reason apple's m1 max 16-inch at least are the metal integration with resolve studio that seems to be working incredibly well when we export in 4k resolution instead of 6k which is what i usually do anyway when i'm publishing here to youtube the results do get a lot closer still though the m1 max is faster than my 6 000 plus pc and that should just not be happening when we take a look at image stabilization that's where the pc has a bit of an edge this is mostly a gpu and gpu memory intensive workload so we would expect the rtx 3090 to get the job done a fair bit quicker in the end it's about 27 faster next up i wanted to quickly test how either device would handle 8k red raw footage which you know i don't personally use in my workflow but hey maybe in the future uh but at the very least i'm just trying to find the limits of this new apple macbook pro you know uh here we can scrub fine with the uh rtx 3090 pc color grade no problem and surprisingly so can the new m1 max and honestly in terms of like timeline scrubbing playing back the footage that was identical on both the pc and the new macbook even with a fresh render cache so you know completely nuking the render cache so that's not done at all there was no problem just dropping the footage on the timeline starting to color grade it and you know chop it up just as you would with a normal edit so yeah if you do this sort of stuff for a living very heavy you know high resolution raw video editing then the 16 inch m1 max could easily become your single do it all video editing machine which is pretty cool next up i want to talk about 3d modeling and rendering in blender which is not a very frequent workload for me not something that i do a whole lot of but hey when the project calls for it it is quite an intensive and time-consuming task uh so i do want the fastest machine that i can get i definitely don't want to be held up rendering when i could be doing other work and being productive so with an rtx 3090 here and a 5950x this is basically as good as it gets i mean viewport rendering is i mean almost instant you can make changes to your models changes to your scenes really really quickly unfortunately that is not the same experience on the m1 max because blender does not support the gpu on m1 chips at least for now hopefully we do get support soon for apple's metal api because i'm really looking forward to seeing what the gpu on the apple m1 max can do in blender but for now we are stuck with cpu rendering only the 16-inch m1 max is still surprisingly usable though especially considering it's just the cpu that we're using here the huge difference though really comes when we look at the render times the apple m1 max chip took a little under six minutes whereas the pc can do it in 25 seconds so yeah a pretty insane difference and one which even when metal does get supported here in blender i'm not sure that that would be enough to catch the current power of a full desktop rtx 3000 gpu so when it comes to blender projects especially for those that use animations i will 100 be sticking to pc the macbook pro is still totally usable for the modeling aspect and you know texturing aspect and stuff like that but rendering performance is yet to show its full potential here and lastly we'll take a look at photo editing in adobe lightroom here we're looking at a handful of 61 megapixel raw photos shot on the sony a7r iv and before we take a look at the export times i'll just say that actually applying adjustments copying those changes to each image and the actual editing process all of that feels identical between the macbook pro and the pc this is not a super multi-threaded or gpu-intensive program in fact it seems to mostly scale well with how good the single threaded performances of whatever cpu you're using on your machine that's pretty much confirmed here when we do take a look at the export times where the result is pretty much the same between the two i would actually say that if photo editing is all you're interested in doing maybe the most demanding thing you do with your device uh save your money and go with a much cheaper m1 laptop performance will be likely very very similar and we'll just finish up here with a look at a couple more benchmarks cinebench while rendering on the cpu only shows that the 5950x is about twice as fast as the 16 inch m1 max but that's while having over three times the amount of processing threads and pulling about four to five times as much power so with that in mind i think we can agree the performance here for the m1 max is pretty respectable at least single threaded performance in cinebench is also quite interesting with the ryzen 5950x only taking a six percent lead v-ray 5 goes absolutely crazy on amd ryzen though for whatever reason about two and a half times faster here versus the apple m1 max again though context matters uh if apple built a 16 core 32 thread cpu which runs at 140 watts plus we'd be looking at some very different results here but again totally respectable performance here when looking at the raw cpu rendering performance so in particular heavy video editing with raw footage high res footage 6k plus that seems to be what the m1 max is doing so well here in comparison to my six thousand dollar plus pc i was really really surprised with the results and also that the editing and color grading experience was pretty much identical between the two so if that's what you're interested in and you also need the mobility of a laptop perhaps you're working from home and the office and you know you need a single machine for both ideally then i honestly don't think there is a better tool than the m1 max and this also gets me really excited for the future of apple m1 desktop products i mean we are seeing the slow evolution and scaling up of the apple m1 silicon and i would love to see what apple could do in terms of performance when not restricted to a laptop form factor of course i still will be using my desktop pc i think that's pretty clear especially when it comes to gaming and streaming that's probably the area where apple has the most catching up to do to pc and just other windows devices in general for me i'll say that both devices have a place in my own workflow and it's just really nice to be able to take that heavy video editing and drop it on the laptop and go portable whenever i really want or need to and have that as an option now and just have that full performance on tap hopefully these results were interesting or helpful to you in some way as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
