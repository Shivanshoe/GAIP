all right so some of you might have no idea what this is right here but it's actually a pc case that i've been looking forward to for over two years now it's called the dan c4 sfx uh some of you might be familiar with the much smaller version the a4 sfx this is a fair bit bigger but it can fit so much more hardware believe it or not it's slightly smaller than the nk7 but somehow more flexible more build opportunities with larger radiator and fan support as well so today we'll take a look at those different layouts which ones are good which ones should be avoided and what kind of thermal performance you can expect and ultimately just how this does compare to something like an encase m1 which is a very similar size so on the outside the dan c4 sfx looks like a pretty typical small form factor case manufactured by liam lee and the result is a 12 liter shell that looks like a hybrid between the encase m1 and the ghost s1 this size is pretty much perfect for a minimal desktop itx system in my opinion any smaller than this and you start compromising on thermal performance for high-end systems and any larger really isn't necessary for most builds since it shares the same bloodline as the m1 everything from build quality and the look and finish of the side panels are pretty much identical it's a very premium aluminium case that will last multiple years and many rebuilds just like the m1 this could very well be the last pc case that you ever buy and another reason for that is just how much hardware you can fit inside it the first layout here that we'll take a look at is the classic layout it's a very intuitive very m1 like layout that's proven to be pretty much as space optimized as a 12 liter pc case can get in this layout you can do either air cooling or liquid cooling for the cpu up to a 240 or 280 mil radiator can be mounted on the side bracket and then for air cooling you've got up to 130 mils of clearance to play with so your best option here for air cooling would be the noctua u9s with a dual fan setup but just like the m1 you can also fit the slightly better c14s by relocating the power supply to the front of the case this brings me to another really cool feature about this case and that's that it can be completely flipped and used upside down and this is probably the best feature of the dnc iv sfx and the main advantage over the encase m1 flipping the classic layout for example now means that the graphics card doesn't need to fight to pull fresh air from underneath the case and instead now there is a ton of air up above to take advantage of this does raise a concern though and that's that you now need to consider more carefully where that hot air from the gpu ends up for example if you're running an aio with fans as exhaust a lot of that heat is just going to get sucked into the radiator and lead to much warmer cpu temps now the other layout of this case is the sandwich layout allowing you to vertically mount your graphics card in front of the motherboard and then liquid cool the cpu with a 240mm eio but we'll come back to this one in just a minute because long story short it needs a lot of work now strangely despite this having a slightly smaller frame than the nks m1 it actually supports bigger radiators and fans you can install two 140mm fans at the bottom directly underneath a two slot graphics card and then on the side bracket you can install up to a 280 ml radiator or two 140mm fans for air cooling this also means potentially you could do a dual 280 mil custom loop inside the c4sfx which is absolutely insane for a 12 liter case very important note though if you are flipping the case which actually ends up being the recommended way to go here 140mm fans will no longer fit at the bottom since you now need to make room for the top panel mounting clips you can still mount a pair of 120mm fans here though which will be powerful enough to feed air to your graphics card and another really important note one which i hopefully gets fixed flipping the case means that there will be no panel at all on the bottom so hopefully that gets sorted before launch because the cables kind of just end up hanging out now as for building in the c4sfx it was super super easy and almost identical to the encase m1 graphics card installation actually was a bit easier in fact since the locking bracket can be completely removed and the gpu can just be dropped straight in three slot graphics cards up to 315 millimeters in length and 130 mils in height can be installed here leaving you with plenty of options so in the end the c4sfx in classic mode looks just like a slightly smaller slightly smoother edged encase m1 this test build uses an overclocked 10900k a 280mm liquid cooler and two 140mm fans at the bottom all fans are positioned as intake and the case is passively exhausting all of that hot air out the top so how is the performance well in terms of cpu thermals our overclocked i9 10900k runs about one degree cooler than the nksm1 at an almost identical noise level seeing as we're able to accommodate a 280 ml liquid cooler versus the 240 in the end case when we flip the case though cpu thermals increase by about 3 degrees seeing as we now have less room to exhaust all of that hot air keep this in mind because it's a really important node when we take a look at gpu thermals though surprisingly they are measurably worse than the nks m1 at 76 degrees c for our 2070 super until we flip the case positioning the gpu now as top intake gpu temps now improve by 4 degrees giving us one of the best results in the stack which is not bad at all now what happens when we throw in an rtx 3080 founders edition this card runs at 320 watts and has a much more unique way of getting rid of all of that heat as we've seen previously this design works incredibly well in the end case m1 but it's a bit more challenged here in the c4sfx here we actually have less of an air gap in the middle of the case part of which is blocked by the tubing of the aio and this is really the only path for that second gpu fan to exhaust all of its heat in the end we run about four degrees warmer here than the nksm1 since we're working with a tighter space that does improve a little when we flip the case but now we run into another problem some of that hot air from the gpu is being passed straight into the radiator although this is ideal for the gpu that's a great way to run into cpu thermal problems especially in combined cpu and gpu usage scenarios like a very cpu intensive game for example now i'm actually not going to spend too long talking about the sandwich layout of this case because to be completely honest it has one major downfall that needs a lot of work and that's cpu cooling despite being able to accommodate up to a 240mm aio here it basically gets no airflow at all in fact under the same test conditions as other cases even those with smaller coolers the dnc 4s fx runs significantly hotter when used in this layout so there are three main reasons why the cooling is so bad here firstly when the case is flipped air has to pass through two layers of ventilation one for the top panel and then one for the frame this means that the effective ventilation for those top fans isn't actually as much as you'd think in fact just by removing the top panel i was able to drop cpu temps by over 5 degrees secondly about half of the radiator is blocked by the riser cable making it very difficult for air to pass through and lastly probably most importantly the 240mm aio can only pull fresh air from one side of the case so it's not like the form t1 or ghost s1 where a top mounted radiator can pull air from both the gpu side and motherboard side here only one side gives access to airflow so the sandwich layout in the dan c4 sfx needs to be reworked heavily in my opinion because cpu cooling is just not viable with this setup gpu cooling with this setup on the other hand is rock solid though about one degree better than using the classic flipped layout with an aio so maybe there is something promising here so at this point there was one more build slash configuration in the dnc forest fx which i think would be ideal for extracting the most gpu performance that you could out of this case and one which could actually beat the end case m1 and that's this build here so we've got air cooling the cpu with the knock to a year 9s we've got a 140mm fan and then a 2 slot gpu at the top assisted by some fans are pulling air through so we've got intake here intake for the cpu and then all of that hot air that's building up inside the case is being exhausted by the 140mm fan so with this setup we get our lowest gpu thermals yet especially when using the 3080 founders edition now we're actually able to properly exhaust all of that hot air building up inside the c4s fx and i'd happily conclude that this is the optimal way to run this case for a gaming focused build most notably you can achieve gpu thermals here that are slightly better than the end case m1 and i think the difference here would be even greater if you were using a larger two and a half slot or three slot graphics card without the additional fans helping it underneath flipping the c4s effects is so vital because then graphics cards don't need to fight to pull air from underneath the case and that is more challenging for the stock slim fans that you'll find on those bigger graphics cards the only downside of this layout is that cpu cooling will take a bit of a hit your best option here would be the noctua u9s with two fans and i'd say you're good for about 150 watts of cpu power there being conservative i'm actually running it with a single fan in this build and that's almost enough to handle the overclock 10900k that i've got in there running at about 210 watts so i guess the best way to sum up this case is that if you're not going to do this layout here which is kind of the ideal layout for a gaming focused build since it runs the gpu the coolest and the quietest and has the most performance in that regard then probably don't bother because the sandwich layout just absolutely sucks when it comes to cpu calling and then if you're going to do this layout but then flipped so kind of like an end case m1 you should probably just build in an end case m1 that case does that layout a little bit better because it has a little bit more of an air gap in the middle of the case and that does seem to benefit thermals and airflow then as for custom loops in the c4sfx which is something that i'm really really interested in trying because i think you might be able to even outperform the encase m1 you can do a 240 mil at the top in this flipped layout and then either a 240 or 280 ml at the side and there you can pretty much run absolutely anything then as for pricing and availability this case is set to launch towards the end of this year at 230 euros which is definitely pricey but nothing out of the ordinary for these premium small batch cases but in closing overall for a gaming focused build in this layout here the c4 sfx is definitely up there as one of the best itx cases gpu thermals here are better than the form t1 the encase m1 and the supt meshlicious only to be beaten out by larger cases like the nr200 and i think just in general with gpus getting so much more power hungry and hotter and just demanding a lot more cooling that makes a really strong case for the dan c4s fx as your next itx case really interested to hear what you guys have to say about this one as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
