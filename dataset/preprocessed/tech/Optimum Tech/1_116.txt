[Music] [Music] oh so we could sit here and endlessly talk about how the xbox series x offers insane value for the money but at the end of the day if you can't beat pc nerds online then what is the point games such as call of duty warzone apex legends and star wars squadrons not only support cross play allowing console players and pc gamers to play in the same lobby but they also support 120 hertz refresh rate mode for the xbox series x at least two of them do that is and to be honest with those sort of frame rates not only do we have a huge advantage of those who might be playing on previous gen consoles like the xbox one x but also a good deal of pc gamers who might only be playing on a 60hz display so let's see how the series x does when it really counts [Music] so firstly the tv or gaming monitor that you're playing on is the big factor in whether you'll be able to play at 120 hertz in the first place if you only have a 60hz display gaming it up to 120hz simply won't be an option the monitor that i'm using here is the 4k lg 27gn 950 which can run up to 160hz at 4k but that's only over displayport 1.4 this monitor actually does not have an hdmi 2.1 port which the series x requires to run at 4k 120 hertz but 1080p 120 hertz and even 1440p 120hz are still fine over hdmi 2.0 and to be honest that's what most 120hz enabled games will be running at so with the lg 27g 950 up to a 1440p 120 hertz signal is capable over hdmi 2.0 and since this monitor also supports freesync that means that we don't get any screen tearing if we drop below that 120fps target alright so here we go dropping in feeling like a little boneyard drop just to start us off here and i will say immediately it does feel quite responsive i mean we're not getting the full 120 hertz experience i would definitely have traded off some resolution to get the full 120 hertz but yeah definitely no complaints here sitting around uh 100 to 110 fps one thing that is definitely apparent though versus the kind of full pc experience is the fov that you cannot change on console which is a huge bummer in my opinion this is a cross-play game at the end of the day so the fact that there is no fov slider to get that kind of obviously wider field of view and more dynamic and faster feeling game that's in my opinion i feel like that is a huge advantage on pc and so far the mouse and keyboard are actually feeling quite good too it doesn't feel like there's you know any acceleration or smoothing or anything like that going on which is really good you can also adjust your sensitivity just like you can on pc but yeah this tiny field of view will definitely take at least a few minutes to adjust to all right this guy's going to push i think so we're going to just armor plate up all right i'm not sure how we got that that guy was pretty unhappy about that all right there's a guy in here this might be don he might be trying to beat me yeah well that's call of duty war warzone for you people just hold angles like this all day i mean it doesn't matter if you're playing 60 hertz 240 hertz or 5000 hertz you just can't beat that i guess [Applause] [Music] i just came out sprinting okay see if we get some loot here maybe oh there's a guy in here oh my god magical i did so these are some gunfights i just don't think i would have won at 60 hertz like when the game is moving so quickly and there's so much happening that high frame rate definitely does give you a bit of an advantage to say the least all right but now for some apex legend and unfortunately to my demise this game does not support keyboard and mouse so i'm gonna be stuck with a controller for this gameplay so we'll see how i do uh i haven't used a controller to kind of game with in so long so you guys are gonna see how bad my aim is with it but uh one thing this game does have which i absolutely love if i can get into the settings here is an fov slider so i complained about this so much in warzone how you're only stuck with like i think the default is like 70 degrees field of view and man that tightens things so much it really makes the game feel so much more juddery and almost as if it's playing at a lower frame rate which it's not we've got the frame rate counter in the top right here 59 to 60 fps when we bump that up to 110 which is the max for this game it almost feels as if the frame rate is higher so uh yeah i appreciate that quite a lot and another unfortunate thing here with apex legends is that it hasn't really been updated to support the more powerful hardware in the new consoles there's no 120 fps mode despite us using a high refresh rate monitor here and enabling 120hz in the display options we're still running at 60fps which is a real real shame all right first impressions straightaway i can definitely feel the difference here compared to warzone running at you know upwards of 100 fps this running at 60 i mean it's kind of alleviated because you're using the wider field of view but man it is a noticeable different i think gun fights yeah 60 hertz feels yeah that's okay it's definitely playable but yeah it's definitely nothing compared to how warzone feels one thing that is good to see though is that despite our wider field of view we're not getting any fps drops and i'm not really sure if that's a problem on like ps4 pro or an xbox xbox one x but yeah we're pretty stable here at 60fps well that's not too bad because we had that controller aim assist kind of helping us out there man looting though feels so slow ah i'm dead here for sure okay all right likely all console players still i definitely i don't think it's putting us in any pc lobbies yet my account definitely isn't ranked high enough so but we'll play another one see what else we can do point blank reloading not bad not bad pretty easy lobby much easier than pc but yeah not bad you gotta win here i don't know how many pc players are actually in that lobby though most of it just seemed like console plays i mean because we got eight kills 1800 damage that's okay all right so we're jumping into star wars squadrons here and out of all of the xbox games that i've tested this one runs the best and it's by a pretty significant margin so on a 4k 120hz tv like the lg cx this will actually run at 4k 120hz i've never seen any other game console game that is run at those specs those kind of advertise specs that microsoft kind of threw into the xbox series x it's not the full 4k like it's not true 4k the internal rendering resolution is a little bit lower overall it's just much better performance than what you'll see in other games big reason for that is that most of the game is just a giant sky box like there's not much uh geometry and model detail to render out here i guess here there is but still the majority of what you're looking at is a skybox and that's why the performance is so so good graphically as well this is a really really good looking game now in this game you actually have two different modes so you have a favorite performance mode which will shift it to 120 fps as it says here the game will reduce the internal rendering resolution to target 120fps and i can confirm that it's pretty much 120fps locked then you have favor resolution which will drop down to around 70 to 75 fps if you have a monitor that supports variable refresh rate and then you'll get the full native resolution of kind of what you're playing at so in this case we're playing at 1440p and we are getting a true 1440p image but for sure without a doubt switching to favor performance is definitely the way you want to play this game even on a controller it feels instant like the inputs feel very responsive and really apart from the maybe extensive graphics customization that you have on pc there really isn't much separating the xbox series x version of the game running here at 120fps compared to pc sure you do have those graphics customizations but i really don't think you need it the xbox series x version looks plenty good enough that's nice but yeah 120 hertz definitely feeling amazing in this game like i said we are getting the full 120 fps which is great so everything feels super super responsive to be honest the experience here doesn't differ too far from pc at all i mean i play on pc with an rtx 3090 on this exact monitor the only difference is like you know we're playing true 4k on that system and the refresh rate is a little bit higher say instead of 120fps i'm getting closer to say 150 160 but we're comparing a 500 gaming system to a few thousand dollar gaming system at least all right now this is a beautiful looking map colors the contrast so in terms of getting the full pc gaming experience where does that leave the xbox series x well i think in terms of the hardware inside here there is definitely enough compute power to provide an exceptional gaming experience we saw that with warzone and with star wars squadrons in some cases you can actually be competitive against pc players in cross-play titles but in other cases you will actually just be held back by the game developers no fov slider in warzone for example and then plainly no 120 fps mode or mouse and keyboard support in apex legends these are defining game settings that these new consoles are capable of enabling not to mention with crossplay in full force in these games it feels wrong not to even the playing field as much as possible when you're going up against pc players with these advantages as for now the gaming experience on the series x is really quite an enjoyable one especially given the context of how much you would pay for this versus a fully kitted out gaming pc however there is still quite an improvement to be made in the majority of games that you'll be playing before you're going to have the kind of advantages that a pc player would have and i would love to know your thoughts on this down below so please leave me a comment as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
