[Music] [Music] this right here is a build that i've been planning for a very very long time and all of the testing that i've been doing up until this point would suggest that this configuration is more than viable but it's not not only that but there were some serious challenges in putting this whole thing together as well as some motherboard and cpu issues that are still persisting so the dream of taking the two most powerful mainstream desktop components and liquid cooling them together in this case right here has come to an end and let me show you why [Music] firstly before we get into all of the problems and challenges with this build let's go over all of the parts for the gpu we're going with the rtx 3090 and the specific card is the pny accelerate epic x and the water block that i've got on there is the ek vector rtx reference block for the cpu we're going with the new amd ryzen 5950x 16 cores 32 threads but still just a 105 watt tdp part at stock i've got that plugged into the asus x570i rog strix which i've previously reviewed as the best x570 itx board that you can buy but my experience so far using this board with verizon 5000 has been far less than ideal more on that in just a moment but in terms of the custom loop it's the same as my previous build which used an intel 9900 ks and an rtx 2080 ti that's a slim 240mm rack from ek along with some slim 120mm noctual fans most of the fittings that i'm using are ek torque compression fittings and the matte black tubing is also from ek all of that will be listed down below that's all housed inside the formed t1 which is an incredibly optimized nine and a half liter small form factor case seriously you just won't get this level of hardware compatibility in anything this size and since i'm using a shorter gpu block this time around i was able to fit a more powerful ddc pump right in front of the gpu the specific pump that i'm using is the swiftech mcp35x this has a pwm range from 1200 rpm all the way up to 4500 rpm so down at 1200 rpm which is at now you can't hear it it's extremely silent at idle connected to the pump is a ddc pump top from bixkey then two low profile 90 degree fittings from cool lance and two male to female extender fittings from ek personally this is my favorite section of the build just really love the way it looks and how all of the parts came together also to make filling the loop up a whole lot easier this time around i added some of alpha calls quick disconnect fittings to the cpu side of the loop this way i can connect a reservoir in line with the rest of the loop and get everything nice and filled up there are still some bubbles that are collecting over time but these are quite easy to remove and they're not large enough to affect the performance of the loop other relevant parts we're using corsair's sf750 platinum power supply 2 terabytes of m.2 nvme storage and 32 gigabytes of g-skills tridency royal rgb memory that's clocked at 4 000 megahertz but this kit can't achieve those speeds on this board so i've underclocked it to 3800 megahertz and it doesn't have any issues there now let's get into the first challenge that i had with this build and that's when i was getting absolutely no display from the rtx 3090 this problem occurs when we're using a motherboard with a pcie gen 4 pcie slot then a gen 3 riser cable connected to a gen 4 gpu so in that case that's gen 4 slot gen 3 riser and then gen 4 gpu now without the gpu drivers installed the compatibility support module or csm on your motherboard should kick in to give you a chance to correct this where you can manually change the pti e-slot generation to run as gen 3 instead of gen 4. the problem that i had though was that after you install your gpu drivers and then update your motherboard's bios which will completely reset it including the pcie slot back to gen 4 the csm that booted before now won't because you have gpu drivers installed what i had to do to correct this was pretty hilarious it was to connect a gpu with pcie gen 3 to the system go into the bios force it back to pcie gen 3 from gen 4 and then i could go back to using the rtx 3090. so if you are doing a similar build maybe not even water cooled but if you are using a motherboard with pcie egen4 then a gen 3 riser cable and then a gen 4 gpu it's probably a good idea to also pick up something cheap like an nvidia gt 1030 that has pcie gen 3 just in case you end up in the same situation as i did with this build but next with a fresh windows 10 install the latest motherboard bios and chipset drivers i was really looking forward to putting the ryzen 5950x to some serious work but simply running a few rounds of cinebench i noticed that performance was way worse than expected scores here are over 10 percent lower than what i had achieved on the msi x570 creation that i used for the full review and for reference that puts it roughly in line with the previous gen 3950x specifically it was the boost clock of the processor that was significantly lower than what i had achieved previously with all 16 cores as low as 3.6 gigahertz and this isn't a thermal issue either the cpu has plenty of temperature headroom as we'll look at next but i did also try the b550i rog strokes as well as the 12 core 5900x on both boards and had the exact same issue just really poor performance when it came to all core workloads not really sure what the issue here is at all but overall it really is disappointing to see this as a consumer you just don't expect this extreme amount of variance when it comes to performance the other thing that i found strange was just when doing simple tasks like opening up file explorer or using really not demanding programs like excel or word the boost profile of the cpu was just way too aggressive sometimes i would see it spike up to as high as 85 degrees when doing something as simple as saving a document or opening spotify and that's odd because when you run something really demanding like blender cpu thermals are definitely within a safe range 80 degrees c here is absolutely fine but again this is with a completely unoptimized boost and power profile for this series of cpu but where things really start to fall apart though is of course when we look at gaming in heaven 4.0 our under vaulted rtx 3090 tops out at 71 degrees here after 30 minutes and this was with a fan speed of 1 500 rpm and a pump speed of 3000 rpm and i do acknowledge that temperatures are still slowly rising even after 30 minutes so if you were to run this for an hour or two you'd likely see this top out closer to 74 or 75c just understand that i don't have the time to run consecutive individual benchmarks for that long with the gpu getting this warm the hotter coolant temperature is pushing our ryzen 5950x to peaks of 90 degrees with sustained thermals between 80 and 85. here's an idea of what that sounded like at full load but it's when we switch over to a more demanding gaming scenario say witcher 3 at 4k that it's clear that this build is just not viable gpu thermals now increase up to 79 degrees c again that's with a gpu under volt that is already saving us quite a bit of power and temperature and our ryzen 5950x because the coolant temperature is so hot is basically not being cooled at all but just why is a game like witcher 3 so much more demanding than heaven 4.0 or a game that i've previously tested with f1 2020 well when we climb into the data we can see that despite undervolting our rtx 3090 it's still pulling a substantial amount of power upwards of 335 watts that's only 15 watts below stock so i wanted to see what would happen if i set an 80 power limit in addition to the undervolt theoretically this would stop the rtx 3090 from being too greedy when it comes to power in those more demanding titles and this worked extremely well we're back to what i would consider sensible gpu temperatures although still very warm in the context of a custom loop the rtx 3090 is now 9 degrees cooler and that is a huge improvement the drawback of enforcing a power limit of course is the potential variability when it comes to clock speed this is going to be fairly game dependent some games will have to pull back the gpu clock to stay under that power while others might sit at 1800 megahertz stable so despite reducing the temperatures by nine degrees gpu clock speed can see dips under 1700 megahertz here although the average in the last five minutes of this starter that you're seeing here is only 20 megahertz lower than before so with the gpu thermals somewhat under control i mean 70 to 71 degrees c that's not too bad uh there are still some problems with this build firstly the cpu boosting and cpu performance problems with these motherboards i have no idea what's going on there i'm going to try and roll back to different bios and maybe just hope for a bios update in the next few days but if that doesn't happen then i'll likely just try a completely different motherboard altogether i will also be dropping the 5950x to the 5900x as my editing workflow is mostly based around gpu compute anyway there's no real impact on my end between running 16 cores versus 12 cores then on the note of cpu thermals if a different motherboard doesn't help this out then i will be moving this system to the end case m1 and using the dual 240mm radiator setup that i built in a previous video i definitely expect that setup to give me the peace of mind and cooling that i'm after while only being around 3 liters larger than this build in the t1 one thing is definitely for certain though this build just needs way more radiator volume than it currently has this is definitely one of the first small form factor builds that i've done where i feel like i am unreasonably compromising on performance and system temperatures just for the sake of a slightly smaller form factor by moving up to the nk someone i'm not realistically making the system that much bigger i mean this isn't a portable system at the end of the day so i feel like that would be the smarter move but it is a real shame because this is an absolutely sick looking system but being honest with myself it just has zero thermal headroom and there are too many variables that could push this system over the edge for example what will performance look like in future games like the cyberpunk 2077 with potentially even more combined cpu and gpu load so stay tuned for the update video real soon on what ends up happening to this system as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
