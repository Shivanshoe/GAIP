around the week ago we had a look at this this is the Nook 9 extreme it's a very small and very expensive new package from Intel and we kind of came to the conclusion that yes you can build a much more powerful ITX machine yourself but there are some use cases where the Mach 9 extreme it does make sense and there is a lot to appreciate from a design standpoint here the one that we've got here is a top spec model with the I 999 a thk and although that is just technically a laptop CPU it is completely overclockable so that's what we're doing today we're gonna see how much more performance we can squeeze out of this little nook 9 extreme and I've got a feeling that some of you are going to be surprised I certainly was in some areas that we're gonna be looking at it's not your typical you know strategy for overclocking where you've raised the voltage and raised the CPU frequency and just kind of deal with the thermals it's a lot different here and you could kind of tweak this to kind of fit your own Intel laptop CPU if that's what you're running as well [Music] so why even bother doing this if the knock nine doesn't really make sense for most people to buy in the first place well it's a bit of fun for me personally if I'm honest I've never overclocked a mobile series CPU and I'm also curious to see what the limits are in terms of power for the current Nook nine design the compute unit which houses the CPU memory and storage doesn't have a whole lot in the way of cooling although surprisingly the eight core ninety nine a thk wasn't getting too hot under load still though this right here is one of the real limits of buying into the Nook 9 platform it's not like an ITX build where you can just upgrade the CPU cooler also seeing as the mobile series CPU is the biggest Hardware bottleneck of the Nok 9 it's not like you can just upgrade to a 16 core 3950 acts like you can in an ITX machine if you do end up buying a nook it's a good idea spending a few minutes tweaking things and getting your money's worth or at least some of it and do note that this overclocking walkthrough really only applies to the i9 model that we've got here the of the two models the i-5 and the i7 you're probably not going to have as much flexibility with the tools in the software that we'll take a look at in just a minute same with if you're going to be doing this on a laptop I can't really guarantee that you're gonna get the same improvements because we are using an unlocked processor here not a locked I five or I seven although I'm pretty sure that you should still have voltage and power limit adjustments on even those locked processes but feel free to correct me down below if I'm wrong now the BIOS on the Nok nine doesn't offer a whole lot in terms of customization and power tuning so this time around we'll be using Intel's XTU software instead here you've got access to the CPU voltage power and current as well as the CPU core frequency multipliers we'll get to those multipliers towards the end because for heavy loads like rendering and encoding we do end up running into both power and current limits before those multipliers even matter essentially we'll be able to overclock the Nok nine just by tweaking the power and voltage values now at stock the 99 a th K will briefly boost up to around 3.6 gigahertz under a you load with a 107 watt power limit that lasts 28 seconds at which point it will then settle down to around 3.1 gigahertz in my initial video I mistakenly said that the short duration turbo clock was 4.6 gigahertz as you can see at the start of the graph but that's only when 2 or so CPU cores are loaded in this case it's just loading the assets for the render so the first step here is to see how far we can overclock the CPU simply by under vaulting by reducing the CPU voltage and leaving the power limit the same the CPU will now be able to pull more current allowing it to boost a little bit higher under the same power of restriction I had the most success here with a negative voltage offset which we'll find in the top right and just by setting this to minus 50 millivolts we're able to increase the clock speeds by 150 megahertz that's pretty substantial but pushing it a little bit further say minus 100 millivolts the 99 ATH K is now sustaining a 300 megahertz higher boost clock than at stock under a rendering workload an important note here seeing as we're still hitting that power limit 65 watts in this case CPU thermals will be pretty much identical compared to stock in the end I was able to reduce the voltage offset to minus 135 millivolts and this gave the i9 mobile CPU an effective 400 megahertz overclock under sustained loads again that's an easy plus 400 megahertz gain at the same power consumption and thermals as at stop the power target still set at 65 watts with the I 9 CPU settling in at around 75 degrees C now if you want to overclock a bit further the next step is to start raising that 65 watt power limit that the CPU has under sustained loads for example by raising this to 75 Watts we now see another plus 200 megahertz however the CPU package temperature has now increased by around 5 to 8 degrees it's at this point that I noticed that no matter how far you raise the power and current limit the Nok 9 will still say that it's current limited as shown by the yellow alert in the bottom right the user won't be able to exceed this and that means that along with our under vault in place we're pulling around 90 watts and sitting just below 4 gigahertz for a cause the CPU is getting a bit toasty at this point but remember that this is effectively an 800 megahertz overclock compared to what we were running at stock capping the power target at 85 watts would be a pretty sensible limit for frequent sustained load and this had the I 9 CPU maintaining a little over 3,800 megahertz in blender thermals there weren't too bad either with the default fan profile although noise levels were a bit louder than compared to stock for most users I would recommend just sticking to that 65 watt power target with the under vault in place you get a decent performance boost there in multi core applications without any increase in noise power or thermals for example in Cinebench we can see an 11% increase in performance just by applying the under vault and we're now running a bit faster than both a risin 530 600 and an i7 9700 k those are both two very powerful desktop CPUs by milking the i-9 for every last drop of performance though you can exceed 2700 X performance here now a 19% improvement over stock single core performance though doesn't get an increase here for an improvement there you'll want to adjust the single core dual core and three core multipliers but don't expect to have that much Headroom along with that under vault in place the eight core multiplier on the other hand does have a fair bit of headroom it can be raised from four point to up to say four point six with the under vault and that will give you a higher clock speed under gaming loads to be honest though I didn't find that to be worth it it doesn't look like you get any noticeable increase in gaming performance compared to when the i9 is just running completely stock you're still going to be and a bit of a performance deficit compared to a full desktop chip having said that some games won't experience too much of a performance drop and this is why I think going with a laptop CPU wasn't too bad of an idea from Intel the bad side is of course the price now don't forget that you can under volt the GPU as well and significantly decrease both thermals and noise levels there too with no performance loss for the Asuza r-tx 2070 mini that were using in there now I was able to decrease the operating voltage of the GPU down to around a 175 millivolts and that was with a fairly typical boost clock of around 1850 megahertz this allows us to run about 4 degrees cooler but more importantly both of the GPU fans will be spinning around 430 rpm slower giving us much lower noise levels and here's what you can expect in terms of noise levels from a CPU render both at stock and with the raised power limit so if you do want to squeeze a bit more performance out of the knock nine extreme that is exactly how I would do it I think you know most of the performance that you can gain is in the multi core applications the sustained renders for example but then again if that's kind of what you're interested in you should probably build a 90 X machine yourself unless you really have a specific use case where the NOC nine extreme just makes total sense again in terms of the design there is a whole lot to love here about the NOC nine extreme five liters easily portable and you know just the execution of the form factor is really solid the price on the other hand doesn't make sense and the fact that we're able to overclock and reclaim some of that performance loss from the laptop CPU still doesn't make it worth it from a consumers point of view again if you are a studio maybe a gaming cafe maybe it would make sense for you because you can get a lot of these up and running but we talked about that in the initial review if you want to watch that I'll leave it linked down below as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
