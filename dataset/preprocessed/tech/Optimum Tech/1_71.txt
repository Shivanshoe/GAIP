all right let's get through all of the usual intro stuff because this video is a little bit longer than usual and you read the title today we are finding the best budget gaming monitor all of these monitors are around 200 us and as you would expect they are 1080p resolution so let's start off with quick introduction of what monitors we'll be comparing today starting with the fan favorite the aoc 24g ii this one has been heavily regarded as one of the best budget gaming monitors that you can buy due to its fast 144hz ips panel ergonomically it's okay you have all of the height adjustment that you'd need but the stand does extend a bit more than i'd like now very confusingly it's possible for the 24 g2 to arrive with one of two panels where one is clearly better than the other i asked aoc about this and their response was that it's basically a lottery with which one the customer ends up with but there is a way to make sure that you get the better panel and that's by ensuring the serial number starts with awb and not atn i actually have both here for testing today so both panels are still being produced in the current retail market so it's not like it's an old panel versus a new panel it's more like there is just two different panels being sold for this monitor then we have the acer nitro vg242 and the best way to describe this monitor is that acer spent all of their money on the 165hz ips panel and basically nothing for the stand i'm not kidding when i say that this is the worst stand on a gaming monitor that i've ever seen and buy a long shot ergonomically it gets a -1 out of 10 with no height adjustment at all with a stand that pokes out way too much and that barely supports the weight of the display luckily this locked position of the stand is still usable for me at least but it's highly recommended that you'd pair this with a cheap 30 dollar monitor arm from amazon next up we have the asus vg258 qr another 165 hertz option but this time with a tn panel and with much better ergonomics i personally think that this is the best looking monitor out of the four with the smaller stand the slimmest bezels and overall the best ergonomics although with a tn panel it'll be very interesting to see what the trade-offs here are versus the two ips and finally we have the benq xl2411k the little brother to the ever popular 2546k zowie has a huge presence in the competitive gaming scene and ergonomically this is right up there with the asus in accommodating whatever position you want to game in i'll be honest though in my initial review of this monitor i was left a bit underwhelmed by the tn panel but let's see how it compares to the other three at around the same price especially when factoring in its motion blur reduction mode also known as dayak another important note here is that the bank you is the only monitor in this lineup to not include freesync or g-sync which if you're a competitive gamer might not worry you but it definitely means it's less versatile than the other monitors in this lineup and a big consideration so let's kick things off here simply by looking at the max brightness of these displays where we do actually get some pretty interesting results in fact it's the fan favorite aoc monitor that tops out with the lowest max brightness of the four at just 238 nits but the inferior original panel can get a lot brighter at over 300 nits really anything above 300 nits is a pretty solid result here and suitable for use in a bright room but then typically in a dark or dimly lit room anything around 160 nits is probably enough now personally i did actually find the max brightness on the lowest result here the 24 g2 to actually be enough in a bright room with the shades open so brightness here really isn't a deal breaker but merely a consideration as for contrast we do get some interesting results again the original panel on the 24 g2 tops the chart here by a long shot the newer aoc panel is also quite good but then there's the benq tn which gets a pretty woeful result down at the bottom and yes this does impact game visuals quite a bit with overall a much flatter looking image anything around 1 000 to 1 for a contrast ratio is pretty good but even the acer nitro at around 800 to 1 had deep enough blacks for everyday use in my opinion and a pretty punchy image then as for color performance it's not surprising here that the two ips panels come out on top particularly the aoc which boasts almost 90 percent dci p3 coverage that makes it the most color accurate of the four here although srgb and adobe rgb coverage is pretty similar between the two ips models and look no one's going to be using these displays as production reference monitors but at least for gaming and everyday media consumption the two ips models have a noticeably visually better panel now i think it's also worth noting what happens to these monitors how they behave and react when you ramp up nvidia's digital vibrance which is a very popular option in nvidia's control panel which overall just increases the vibrancy of the image makes opponents kind of just pop out of the screen a little bit more which then should lead to better reactions and in theory better aim as well so the worst of the four here was definitely the benq xl2411k with a tn panel that falls apart pretty quickly as vibrancy exceeds 75 where colors begin blobbing together essentially there just isn't enough color information on the panel to begin with to accommodate that level of vibrancy the asus panel handled things noticeably better and in general just has a much more premium looking tn panel than the zowie but it's the two ips panels that absolutely blow this section out of the water not that you'd want to but you can ramp digital vibrance all the way up to 100 before you even start seeing a glimmer of the image breaking down in turn this made the image clarity far superior for first person shooters and the result is a super rich and engaging image for gaming it is an absolute treat but then what about response times and motion clarity which is something that i've talked a lot about when it comes to gaming monitors and this is super important if you're a competitive gamer when an opponent swings on you or if you need to flick to a target you want the display to be as clear as possible so each of these monitors has adjustable response time overdrive settings not enough pixel overdrive and you'll typically get ghosting behind a moving image but too much overdrive and you'll get what's called inverse ghosting where distracting visual artifacts start to show up the asus vg258 qr demonstrates this perfectly where the pixel overdrive is adjusted with the trace free setting in the menu and the best option here seems to be trace 340. so again not enough overdrive and we get visible ghosting but too much and the inverse ghosting is pretty noticeable then we have the acer nitro with a pretty similar story where it is possible to push the overdrive a bit too far and create worse artifacts than the ghosting itself here the best setting to use would be normal and honestly it's a pretty solid result for a budget ips panel then we have the benq excel 2411k where both overdrive settings high and premium result in some pretty serious artifacting this is with diac off but don't worry we will take a look at what the dayak results look like in just a second the best result here at least without strobing aka dayak would be with overdrive completely turned off then we have the aoc 24g2 where you've got full response time overdrive settings off weak medium and strong and believe it or not these are in fact different settings despite them looking pretty much all the same but the best results here would be the strong settings so that's what we'll use for the comparison now remember how i said that the 24 g2 can arrive with one of two different ips panels well it turns out that the newer one is the better looking one when it comes to response times and motion clarity ghosting on the trailing edge of the ufo is severely reduced with the updated panel and there's no more of that slight inverse ghosting that we see there either so when we pick out the best looking result from each of these monitors and put them side by side this is what we get honestly all four of these results look pretty good to me for a budget gaming monitor there's no severe ghosting on either one although the blacks do trail fairly heavily on both the tns but particularly the asus vg258qr the best results here i'd say surprisingly are actually the two ips panels with the 165hz acer producing a slightly cleaner image in the end so far i would say that the two ips panels are leading this entire comparison but what about the motion blur reduction modes like dayak or elmb well unfortunately the acer doesn't have a backlight strobing mode available but the other three do to save us some time here are the best looking results that you can achieve on each of them mbr setting 10 on the aoc 24g2 elnb with trace 3 set to 60 on the asus and then we have diak set to high with a custom gain set to 8 on the benq you can watch my full review of that monitor if you're interested in how to do that with the factory menu so both the aoc and the asus produce some pretty noticeable artifacts when using these strobing modes whereas the xl2411k produces an almost ideal result at 144hz the benq's image is as clear as you're going to get in this price range currently i will note though backlight strobing is not for everyone some users can notice the flickering and will get a headache from it and this will be even more apparent at 144 or 165 hertz compared to something like 240hz on the xl2546k so while i'm personally not sensitive to backlight strobing and can gain pretty much endlessly on these modes a lot of others are sensitive to them so it is important to note so factoring in benq's result into the final lineup it does lead the stack here when it comes to motion clarity so clicking on heads in competitive titles in theory at least should be easier to manage on the benq finally let's take a look at the input latency of these monitors and here i've used nvidia's ldap to measure the entire latency chain and thankfully there's no meaningful difference to note here between them all within about one to two milliseconds of each other again this is the entire chain from mouse click to a flash being displayed on screen and the results here of around 20 milliseconds are pretty good for a 144 to 165hz display now in addition to the usual color testing and ufo motion blur testing for monitor reviews i also wanted to spend a couple of hours here for each gaming monitor just to see what they were like in practice and i'm really glad i did that because the small differences between them became even more apparent so remember how i said that digital vibrance could be ramped up a lot higher on the two ips panels versus the 2t ends and also how colors just in general looked much better well that made those two monitors the aoc and the acer significantly better for gaming especially for competitive shooters sure you can get better motion clarity out of the tns especially when factoring in elemb or dayak but the lacking contrast and colors means that actually picking out targets in game is far easier on either of the two ips panels by comparison both of the tn panels especially the benq looked significantly flatter where targets would almost blend into the backgrounds that they were standing in front of at that point it really doesn't matter how clear the motion is if the contrast and vibrancy of the image isn't deep enough and of course ips is going to look significantly better in your single player story based titles as well and also just for everyday use so which of the two ips panels would i go for well i'd personally recommend the acer nitro but it is highly recommended that you eventually get a cheap monitor arm to pair it with because again that default stand is absolutely atrocious but in the end it does have a higher refresh rate than the aoc 24 g2 it gets way brighter and menu navigation is also much easier however i will say that this specific model of the acer nitro seems to be a bit hard to find in certain regions so that's when my recommendation would fall on the aoc 24 g2 again make sure that you get the one with the newer panel by ensuring that the serial number starts with awb that will be printed on the side of the box now one monitor that didn't make this lineup is the benq mobius ex2510 as much as i wanted to add this one into the comparison it is a hundred dollars aud more expensive than the other monitors here and in that territory you also have other 165 hertz and above options to consider too other reviewers also seem to place the benq mobius slightly behind the cheaper aoc there is also the new samsung odyssey g3 however that uses an absolutely woeful va panel that you should really just stay away from so that pretty much wraps everything up really hope this helped you out and i am just personally really surprised with how much gaming monitor you can get these days for the money especially the two ips options they really feel like they're kind of punching above their weight class in the kind of experience they deliver if you are interested in picking any of these monitors up i will have them listed down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
