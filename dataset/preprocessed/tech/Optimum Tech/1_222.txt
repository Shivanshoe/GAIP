the 16-core risin 3950 x plugs directly into a mainstream socket motherboard meaning that you could potentially install the CPU into a seriously tiny case but how small can you realistically go before thermals become a serious issue AMD do not include a CPU cooler for this one so it really is up to you to decide how much cooling your build requires now we've done testing with the CPU with a 240 and a 280 ml a IO and thumb performance there has been pretty good but what about something a lot smaller how about a Noctua NHL 12s which is only around 70 millimeters tall or maybe even something like in 92 mil a IO how low can you really go before thermals become a big problem and when you do reach that point what are your options in terms of reducing those thermals so consider this video a bit of a sanity check when it comes to using the risin 3950 X in small form-factor pcs where you are limited with CPU cooling [Music] so I wanted to test this for myself seeing as I had seen a few builds out there online somewhat bragging about how they had installed a 3950 act into an insanely tiny build I will say there is a bit of a weird flex seeing as the physical installation of the CPU here is just like any other rise in CPU the difficult part comes in the form of manually tuning the CPU in terms of power and voltage and that's something that some of these users and builds seem to skip altogether now if CPU cooling in your mini risin 3950 X build is truly insufficient and I mean insufficient in the sense that you're hitting you know ninety degrees C quite frequently then you're not only going to see much reduced boost clocks but you're also going to see a you know reduced lifespan of your processor overall now I don't have any statistics to back that up but when the CPU is cooling and warming up to that point as well over many cycles then that is the common result of how these processes end up dying the task of this video is to find out at what point that cooling becomes insufficient for example is it unreasonable to think that we could use a 70 mm knock to a cooler with this CPU now some of you may be wondering how AMD were able to cram 16 cores into a mainstream socket CPU in the first place and also why it runs a lot cooler than expected the primary reason is the 142 watt power target that the 3950 acts is restricted to at stock meaning that the amount of power that is lost in the form of heat is also restricted not only that but that amount of power is spread over the 16 cores so when you consider the amount of heat that each core is producing it's not a whole lot if an eight-core rise in 3700 X on the other hand was running at the same 142 what power target you now have a twice the amount of power per core and that would probably set the processor on fire that's why the 3700 X runs at an 88 watt power target which is still more power per quart than the 3950 X when you pair that with cherry-picked CPU cores that you can run at very low voltages we get some pretty decent boost clocks at that power target as well now usually CPU thermals depend heavily on which motherboard you're using seeing as CPU voltage varies greatly among different boards but seeing as the 39 50 X will pretty much be hitting that 142 watt power target on every board I would expect fairly close thermal performance all around and just to recap the current state of under vaulting the rise in 39 50 X or all third gen rise in CPUs for that matter you'll still experience the odd decreased performance despite everything looking stable and fine so if you're setting a manual voltage for the CPU but not modifying its frequency the processor will take things into its own hand and decrease performance without any monitoring tools being able to pick this up for those wanting to set manual voltages and frequencies that does work as expected technically this is just overclocking here's a look at what you can expect roughly when using a fairly solid X 517 motherboard you can also dip below 4.1 and try 4.0 and 3.9 if you really like because you will be able to obtain some pretty solid thermals there just expect a decrease in performance a couple of notes on the thermal testing here usually when testing CPU cooler performance I would also lock the processors frequency and voltage but here I've left the rising 39 50 X completely stock free to boost and regulate as much as at once the reason for that is that although we are measuring CPU temperature here we're also monitoring the CPU clock speeds and see how much that gets affected by running a low profile CPU cooler all testing was done on an open test bench and this is something that is not negotiable there is simply no case out there that I could choose that would make everyone happy and that would give a one-size-fits-all result different cases affect callers in different ways and at the end of the day here we are testing coolers not cases if you want to know how these coolers perform in cases add anywhere between 5 to 15 degrees C but Before we jump into the testing for a few different callers I wanted to explore some existing options out there for reducing the thermals of the arisin 39 50x so just so we're not confused by these three graphs here because I can understand they can be overwhelming at first on the Left we have the CPU temperature in the middle we have the CPU package power and then on the right we have the CPU frequency this result is during a 25 minute blender render you the 240 ml kraken X 53 set at 1500 rpm so in orange we have the pretty typical stock performance the 39 50x settles in at around 60 degrees C the package power is right up against that 142 watt target and the CPU frequency hovers at around 4 gigahertz flat for all cause when we enable the Eco mode found in the Verizon master software we can see that we get an absolutely huge reduction in thermals with the 39 50x sitting at around 45 degrees C the trade-off here of course though is reduced performance the power target now sits at just 87 watts and the clock frequency is a bit sporadic but for the most part it sits at around 3500 megahertz so a pretty massive thermal reduction but it will come at a cost of lower performance now in Rison master software you can actually set your own custom power target for the CPU to run at instead of the default 142 watts and here I wanted to see what would happen if I told the CPU to run at a power target of 120 watts instead here we get around a 5 degree C drop from stock we can also see that the power target is confirmed at around 120 watts and the boost clock seemed to be roughly 90 megahertz lower than stock so we do get lower performance that kind of what you expect but on the bright side this does seem to be a pretty effective way to just tell the CPU hey pull a little bit less power run a bit cooler and you do the rest the 39 50x will kind of just make up its own mind on what voltage and boost clocks it thinks are suitable at that power target but now let's jump into testing a few different ITX sized CPU coolers and we already know that a 240 ml cooler seems to get the job done quite well but what about a 120 mil cooler here we see a thermal increase of around 7 degrees C and also a clock speed reduction of 50 megahertz again add anywhere from 5 to 15 degrees C to account for what this thermal performance would be like inside a case here that will land us at around 75 to 80 degrees C but what if we go even smaller say a 92 Malay IO this is the AC tech 645 LT and if the Rison 39 50x can run on this then that means that you could potentially build a 16 core system inside the tiny DNA for SFX do note I have tested this with the Noctua slim 92 ml fan seeing as that's how this cooler is intended to be used so here we get another thermal increase this time raising the CPU temperature up to 75 point eight degrees C after 25 minutes in blender and the clock speed sees another 50 megahertz reduction positioning this liquid core inside the den a four things are pretty restrictive in terms of air flow it is mounted underneath the power supply so I'd expect film was there to be at least in the high 80s under the same load but now let's try some low profile air coolers as this would open up some slimmer case options and let's start with knock towards NHL 12s this is a surprisingly powerful low-profile cooler with the height coming in at 70 millimeters and knock to a claim that this can call CPUs with a TDP of 105 watts and above and taking a look at the thermal result I'd say that recommendation seems about right thermals here are slightly better than our 92 ml AC tech 645 LT and boost clock seem around 40 megahertz higher in blender so the NHL 12s can call this CPU but you'll again want to make sure that your case has enough airflow for example if you're planning on squeezing this CPU call it into the ghost s1 you'll probably want to add some top or bottom mounted exhaust fans but let's step things up a notch and take a look at something even smaller like the cryo rig c 7g this cooler comes in at 47 millimeters in height and has a claimed TDP rating of 125 watts that's greater than the TDP of our rise in 39 50 X at 105 watts so this little thing should be quite capable and surprisingly it actually is we are getting very warm temperatures at this point though with the processor averaging eighty-seven point two degrees C in the final two minutes and boost clocks take yet another hit we're now just at thirty eight thirty megahertz for all calls while this is technically doable on an open test bench if you're this limited in CPU calling this is the point that you'll want to start setting your own power target in rising master software I think a power target of around 105 watts or thereabouts that would work well here and finally let's see what happens when you strap on a cooler that's only 37 millimeters in total height knock towards NH l9a this is actually the smallest CPU core that I have here for testing but one thing to note is that this should technically perform better than the Intel version the l9 I as the heatsink is a bit larger and believe it or not we can actually get through a full 25-minute render with this cooler although it isn't pretty when our 200 megahertz down from our result with the 240 ml kraken X 53 and about 30 degrees warmer you would definitely need to lower the power target down to around 100 watts or so just like with the cry rig at c7 G so a couple things to note here third gen rise in CPUs are pretty incredible and how they can regulate their own power consumption and performance to manage their own thermals instead of attempting to boost all-cause to 4 gigahertz all the time you're able to run limited CPU cooling solutions with the trade-off of lower performance this is similar performance and temperature scaling to what you would expect from a GPU especially from Nvidia for the 3950 X I personally wouldn't go any lower than the AC tech 645 LT or Noctua L 12s without modifying the power target of the CPU and even then you'll need to make sure that those coolers have plenty of access to airflow still though I think it's pretty mind-blowing that you can run this 16 core CPU through a blender render with just a 37 mil cooler attached even if it is on an open test bench ideally of course I think a 240 ml liquid cooler would probably be the sweet spot for the 39 50 X as that gives you plenty of headroom for decent thermal performance and even overclocking so let me know your thoughts and comments down below certainly some surprising results and if you do currently have a rice and 3950 ax in your own system I'd love to know what cooling solution you're currently using and how your experience has been with it so far as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
