[Music] today we're building this a 1440p gaming system that takes up very minimal footprint on your desk runs incredibly quiet and yes it can in fact run cyberpunk 2077 and i completely understand that some of these parts mainly the gpu and the processor are a bit hard to get your hands on at the moment but i still think that it's totally worth taking a look at a build that i do recommend at this particular price point so let's take a look at what specific parts we're using here how to put it all together and then how it performs [Music] so when planning an itx pc build it all starts with the case because that determines what other hardware you can accommodate like your cpu cooler and the size of your graphics card and for a gaming focused build like this i think the phanteks evolve shift 2 air is perfect nice small footprint and plenty of ventilation through those mesh side panels i've actually done a full review on this case if you happen to miss it and all of the changes that have been made versus the original of all shift overall the changes have been very welcomed the cpu that we're using for this build is the 6 core 12 thread ryzen 5 5600x which i think is perfect for mainstream to high-end gaming builds today amd really knocked it out of the park with ryzen 5000 and the 6 core model is no exception as the current generation of gpus from both nvidia and amd offer so much performance it's really important that we go with a cpu here that isn't going to bottleneck our gaming performance not only now but also for future gpu upgrades the 5600x is easily a processor that i see outliving and supporting multiple gpu generations in the years to come now your best option in terms of cpu calling in the evolve shift 2 is a 120mm aio but this can also potentially cause problems for some liquid cooler models with air traveling to the top of the loop and then circulating into the pump you could end up with some irritating noises and potentially shorten the lifespan of your cooler so we're not going to take any chances here for a build guide like this so we're using be quiet's pure loop 120 and this has the pump located in the tubing portion of the cooler instead of the cpu block portion this way you don't have anything to worry about in terms of air circulating in the loop and any air towards the cpu block should be minimal enough to not affect cooling performance then for the motherboard we're going with the best performing b550 itx motherboard that i've tested and that's gigabytes b550i aorus pro ax this board has the strongest vrm out of all of the b550 rtx boards available it's a six plus two phase layout with 90 amp power stages this board doesn't have any active cooling in terms of chipset fans or vrm fans and honestly with a vrm that runs this cool an active vrm fan just wouldn't be necessary the only downside when it comes to this board is that it's the only b550 itx board to not support an onboard usb type-c header but that's not a problem for our build seeing as the evolve shift 2 doesn't have a front usb type c port anyway for the graphics card we're going with the rtx 3060 ti and the specific card that we're using here is msi's gaming x trio despite this being a two and a half slot triple fan card it does actually fit in the evolve shift too with a bit of breathing room now to be completely honest with a 200 watt tdp you just don't need this much cooling for a 30 60 ti but this will give us a significantly quieter system in the end so this is a premium card and the main thing that you'll want to look out for here is the pricing typically premium 3060 ti's should be avoided because pricing can start to creep up to base rtx 3070 pricing so definitely do consider the pricing in your region and make sure that you are not spending as much as a 30 70 for this particular card the power supply that we're using is corsair's sf600 platinum which is plenty for this build here with an 80 plus platinum efficiency and a full set of sleeved cables this is one of my top picks for a mid-range gaming build for storage it's really going to come down to your own preferences and needs i'm keeping it really simple here with a single one terabyte m.2 nvme drive from crucial then for memory a 16 gigabyte 3200 megahertz co 15 kit from corsair then for some optional extras a 140 mil intake fan is recommended here to encourage cool air towards our radiator and i've also added in a couple of rgb strips from fantax [Music] and so here it is the completed build and i think we'd all agree that it looks pretty tidy and neat and quite a bit bright and colorful as well but this build took so much longer than i had expected and i'll save you most of the you know droning on and all the problems that i had but the short of it is the b550i pro ax from gigabyte that i had in there initially for whatever reason i just could not get any boot from that motherboard at all or rather i couldn't get any posts from it everything in the system would turn on in the way of the power supply the fans and the lighting but i was just getting no display from the system at all so of course i tried a new motherboard bios for our ryzen 5000 cpu but that surprisingly didn't work at which point i used a pcie gen 3 gpu because i thought that could have been the entire issue that didn't help it i then swapped out to a ryzen 3000 cpu then swapped the memory then swapped the boot drive and really nothing could fix the issue still no display from the system so i ended up just throwing in the asus b550i strix and apart from the pcie gen 3 riser cable issue which i've mentioned previously i was able to get the system up and running quite fine also a little side rant for case manufacturers which may be watching this video even including fantax with the evolve shift 2 it is simply unacceptable to ship a case like this with a pti-e gen 3 riser when modern hardware clearly hasn't moved beyond that and it's not for performance issues or anything like that it's purely about compatibility and the user experience i've lost so many hours trying to troubleshoot display issues between gen 4 gpus and pcie gen 3 rises so please let's just all move to pcie gen 4 riser cables and make everyone's days a lot easier otherwise those problems aside i'm really happy with how this system turned out the be quiet pure loop 120 fits in there really nicely and it almost feels like it was designed specifically for this case one thing to note though is that you will have to feed the tubing and the pump in front of the radiator fan for everything to fit in there properly even then there is still a bit of excess tubing in the bottom between the power supply and the graphics card and this actually pushes the card outwards a bit at the bottom so just keep that in mind it's nothing major and the side panel still goes on fine but just something to note especially if you are planning on using a slightly thicker card than this cable management was also a bit of a challenge but that's partly due to me using two rgb strips and two rgb fans and having all of the separate wiring for that speaking of rgb strips i've hidden those behind the frame of the case to try and hide the individual leds the goal there was just to try and achieve some extra illumination on the opposite side of the case as the rgb fans and i think that turned out quite well by the way all of the rgb lighting is hooked up to the integrated lighting controller on the evolve shift 2 which is definitely appreciated it can easily be controlled by the two buttons at the top of the case to cycle through modes and colors but of course now let's talk about performance the most important thing when you're spending 1500 us on a gaming pc now some of you may remember that i outlined some issues that i was encountering in a previous build when using a ryzen 5000 cpu on either the b550i e2 strix or x570 strix and those issues don't seem to be completely resolved just yet even with the latest motherboard bios our ryzen 5600x for example is boosting to just 4.2 gigahertz on all cores in cinebench whereas typically you'd see that a little bit closer to 4.4 now i was able to overcome this by enabling the asus performance enhancement setting in the bios that brought clock speeds and performance right up to the expected levels and i will note at the same time this is not like overclocking the cpu because with this enabled the cpu was still sitting below its default socket power budget of 88 watts at just around 75 watts so definitely do make sure that you've got this enabled for ryzen 5000 cpus now when it comes to thermal performance there's really good news here after 40 minutes driving around in cyberpunk 2077 our rtx 360 ti was topping out at just 67 degrees c and that's with a fan speed of just 1200 rpm then for cpu thermals while not displayed in msi afterburner they were topping out at around 75c which is what i'd expect for a 5600x undergaming load this was with all of the fans in the system at just 1200 rpm and that was incredibly quiet so for a little under 1500 us dollars you're getting exceptional performance and that's mostly thanks to the rtx 3060 ti at just 400 we're getting gaming performance that's consistently beating the rtx 2080 before it one of the most demanding titles currently cyberpunk 2077 can be played at 1440p while using the dlss performance mode and ray trace reflections enabled this lands us with a frame rate around 70 to 90 fps depending on the area in the game and we all know this game is incredibly demanding so most other games will have absolutely no problem handling this resolution so definitely consider a high refresh rate 1440p gaming monitor to pair this with if you haven't already and if you want to get a better scope of rtx 360 ti performance as a whole i will leave my review down below so this is a build and configuration that i can highly recommend it runs incredibly quiet runs very cool and takes up barely any room on your desk which personally i'm a little bit biased towards i really love the vertical form factor of this case and just the tiny footprint that this has if you are interested in any of the parts and perhaps putting this whole thing together i will leave all the parts linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
