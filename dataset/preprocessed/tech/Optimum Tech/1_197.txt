if you want to squeeze a bit more performance out of your CPU without upgrading overclocking is definitely the way to go the only problem is you could easily spend half a day trying to get the best settings to find the best potential overclock out of your processor but what if there was another way where with the single click and a few minutes later you're done free performance a stable overclock and in record time well that's what we're testing today because there's no reason that I should have to still overclock my CPU like a caveman when we have self-driving cars and advanced deep learning algorithms that can be trained to do almost anything surely at this point it's not too much to ask my motherboard to overclock my CPU with a reasonable voltage it just so happens that a soos have written a tool that claims to do exactly that and it's appropriately called AI overclocking but just how good is it and how does it compare to manually overclocking the CPU yourself let's take a look [Music] before we dive in let's first understand the differences between a good overclock and a bad one and also why finding a good overclock requires a lot of time and testing so a good CPU overclock is one that is stable and even the most demanding workloads for example rendering and encoding programs and also one where the voltage applied isn't too far off the absolute minimum to hold that overclock completely stable bad or lazy overclocks either don't have full stability in those programs or they typically see the set voltage a bit higher than required simply because the user didn't do enough testing and validation or maybe they just don't care about those higher thermals and that higher power consumption and so trying to find the minimum voltage to stabilize a given clock frequency for a CPU is a seriously exhaustive process and those who have overclocked their processes and trying to step down the voltage to something more power efficient and thermally efficient will know exactly what I mean for example five gigahertz at 1.2 volts is going to run significantly cooler and quieter in your system as compared to five gigahertz at one point three volts so enter a susur's ai overclocking tool note that this is not an overclocking profile or preset that is simply applied to your CPU and forgotten about but instead claims to analyze your CPU and CPU cooler to predict the optimal settings keywords they're being predict and optimal the other really interesting component here is that they claim the overclock will be frequently adjusted as it's continually reevaluating your system thermals so if you upgrade or downsize your CPU cooler or maybe adjust the fan speed theoretically the overclock should regulate itself up or down accordingly but before we climb into the algorithm a bit deeper let's just see if this works at all it's not exactly a one-click process but it is pretty damn close all you'll need to do is boot into Windows 10 on a z3 90 X $2.99 or z4 90 SUSE rog motherboard after loading optimized defaults run some demanding workloads for 5 to 10 minutes climb back into the BIOS and under CPU core ratio select AI optimized hit f10 to save and exit and that's it in our case we're using a Seuss's Z 490 Maximus 12 hero paired with a 10 900k and a 360 ml all-in-one cooler and that's running on an open test bench now a stock 10 900k on this motherboard will eventually settle to around 4.2 gigahertz on all cause after a sustained period and 4.9 gigahertz if you completely unlock the power limits and to my surprise out one quick overclock actually did something productive and didn't burn or crash the entire system overclocking the 10900 k2 5.1 gigahertz on all 10 cause that's not bad at all and I definitely consider that a nice frequency bump over stock for the average user what was more impressive though is the voltage that the AI OC program decided was suitable for 5.1 gigahertz it wasn't actually too bad at all it ran at just one point to three volts in heavy non AVX workloads like Cinebench and are slightly higher but still reasonable 1.25 volts in AVX workloads like blender but it's not just the all core frequency that gets a boost here but the max frequency across three cores was lifted to a massive 5.4 gigahertz when we run a single threaded render on Cinebench those frequencies seem to be backed up we see some pretty impressive results with a score of 550 - points so things are looking pretty good here so far five minutes in and one click and we've got a nice 5.1 gigahertz all quarter before our ten nine hundred K and a three quarter bow of up to five point four which is actually really impressive but then I restarted the system and things changed dramatically now when I ran Cinebench the 10900 k was boosting to 5.2 gigahertz across all ten cores and running a fairly heavy 1.33 volts it would do that right up until the package temp exceeded 90 degrees C then it would dial back a bit and then proceed to booster 5.2 again although this is technically a safe overclock this wasn't a good experience for the user and I was personally wondering why my test bench was repeatedly ramping up and down over and over again eventually I rebooted the system a fourth time and the a IOC tool corrected this which was great to see but less understand why this did happen in the first place so there are two main variables in a sousou's a IOC program in its current form cooler score and optimism cooler score is exactly that it's a value between 30 and 250 which scores your caller based on thermal performance the better the score the higher the overclock while cooler score seems to behave as an overclock skaila optimism works as a bit of an offset values above 100 will shift the overclock higher and values lower will pull things back a bit so the reason that our all core overclock jumped from 5.1 gigahertz to 5.2 gigahertz with a more aggressive voltage is because our coolest core jumped from 170 to 180 9 note that you can actually enter this in manually and see the per core frequency change of right above it for example a cooler score of 150 would give us a 3/4 bow of 5.4 gigahertz a 5 quarter bow five point two eight core at five point one and a ten quarter bow of five gigahertz on this processor you can also tell the software to just stop training itself and adjusting the cooler score repeatedly if you're happy with how it's performing and aren't going to change your CPU cooler anytime soon also out of curiosity I removed all but one fan on our 360 ml caller and ran some tests to see how the overclock would respond and while it didn't make any changes to the frequency or voltage it did lower the cooler score to 163 the next question I had was what happens when you swap to a different CPU of the same SKU in our case a just second 10900 k because as we know we can expect different overclocking potential between multiple CPUs within the same class and honestly I expected to get the same result here seeing as the algorithm so far seems to be mostly based off of pre-trained overclocked data and mostly the effectiveness of your own CPU cooler but swapping to the second 10900 k sample which can't achieve as high a manual overclock as the first one the a IOC program barely overclocked it at all we end up at the same cooler score as before 170 but the frequencies this time aren't much different on the point nine gigahertz this time on all cause as opposed to five point one but we do see the exact same voltage I also noticed a variable called SP which a su state is a platform evaluation variable which is extremely vague it was lower with the second ten 900k almost as if SP was some kind of overclocking grade for the CPU for how far it can be pushed in clock speed almost as if it stands for silicon potential in the end we seem to get an okay performance boost by using the AI OC software it was much better on the first ten 900k that I tested and it can be unpredictable as it trains itself in the early stages the big question is how far off was it from a completely dialed in manual overclock the answer is still pretty far the first ten 900k that i tested can do 5.2 gigahertz at just one point two to five volts in AVX workloads and 5.3 at 1.3 to in non AVX workloads so 100 megahertz higher and around 30 millivolts lower than what the a IOC tool achieved the second sample can also do 5.2 at a slightly higher voltage and that's 300 megahertz over what we achieved with a IOC definitely some mixed experiences but overall I found that a manually tuned overclock if you know what you're doing can achieve both a higher and more power efficient overclock than Asus is a IOC software at least in its current stage this seems to be due to the lack of an actual CPU testing component within the tool where it could stress test the CPU at certain clock frequencies and just step down the voltage after it passes each test to approach a truly optimal overclock just like you would manually but automatic it could then compare this result to a pre train data set from the same class of CPU to see where it fits in and then assign an overclocking profile based on where it fits in the data set that implementation is a lot more advanced as it actually considers what the CPU can hear and it does test the CPU but it does require a lot more research on the motherboard vendors behalf and a lot more resources and money however I do think it is an implementation that we might see in the future because as the differences between motherboards become slimmer and slimmer I think this would be a great way for them to separate themselves from the competition I would love to know your thoughts down below in the comments as always a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
