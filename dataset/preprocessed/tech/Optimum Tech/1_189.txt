today AMD are launching three new processes in their rise in 3000 lineup the six core 3600 xt that we're going to be taking a look at today but also the eight core 3800 xt and the 12 core 3900 xt now apart from the really odd naming choice you can consider these processes a nice small refresh within the current risin 3000 lineup until fourth-generation rise in CPUs finally arrived at later this year and honestly no one was really expecting these rising 3,000 xt processors they are not within AMD's current roadmap but it is hard to complain with more performance at the same price point the big thing here with these xt cpus is the clock speed bump over regular risin 3000 cpus and probably more importantly the overclocking potential that you can get it really is a lot more impressive than what we've seen with Rison so far so let's take a look now firstly I'm not going to waste any time talking about how the naming scheme is a problem I'll just say that it is a problem and I wish that AMD would at least try to not confuse consumers with future products moving on here are the three new CPUs launching today the Rison 3600 xt 3800 XT and 3900 xt are just like their ex counterparts with a higher boost clock profile and higher overclock ceiling I'm not sure if it's right to say that this is new silicon that we've never seen before because it is still the Zen 2 architecture but it is more than just a factory overclock in AMD's words these processes contain materially better transistors than those found in Prior 3rd gen AMD Rison processors and that the overall goal of these improvements was to refine transistor characteristics resulting in reduced voltage reduced leakage and improved operating frequencies there aren't any IPC or instructions per clock improvements here running the Verizon five thirty six hundred and thirty six hundred XT at the same clock speed will give you the same performance the advantage of xt is that the silicon has been refined to have more potential allowing higher clock speeds and a given voltage new XT processors will coexist alongside the rest of the Rison 3000 lineup so it is a pretty big lineup at the moment and they'll each take on the launch pricing of the X processors before them so for the 3600 XT that we're looking at today 249 us puts it around $40 also more than the standard 3600 at the time of filming and about $50 less than Intel i5 at 10 600 K but just what kind of clock speeds can you expect for than extra money over a standard Rison 5 3600 well it will consume a bit more power in blender here we're looking at an additional 15 watts or so but we also get almost a 300 megahertz frequency boost that is seriously substantial and does yield a meaningful improvement in a lot of tasks it does run a little bit warmer as well though as you would expect you to that extra power with a 240 ml liquid cooler on an open test bench the 3600 xt ran a little over 5 c warmer than the standard 3600 in blender but let's jump straight into the benchmarks now starting with our usual production workloads and of course we've got to start with Cinebench so here we have all cores and threads enabled and we're looking at an 8% lead over the r5 3600 and a 7% lead over Intel i5 10 600 K single threaded is really where these XT processors will shine though and the 3600 XT is basically neck-and-neck with intel's fastest single threaded cpu on the market the 10 900 K of course this won't reflect in every program or game that you use but for max on cinema 4d software there is a noticeable improvement here the improvement in rendering performance continues when we look at blender and I think that we can safely say that this is the fastest six core processor that you can currently buy if you're mainly interested in CPU rendering performance that is of course if you are rendering on the CPU because rendering on a six core CPU is never really a good choice rendering on the GPU is actually what I'd recommend instead if possible v-ray shows a 10% improvement of the r5 3600 and a 6 percent improvement over the 10 600 K and when we take a look at video editing the 3600 xt is a perfectly capable cpu we save around a minute on render times but more importantly that boost in clock speed will allow for faster processing of those more likely threaded tasks within your editing software that leads nicely into our photo editing benchmark Adobe Lightroom where the 3600 XT is clearly the better choice again over the 10 600 K not only on the value because it is cheaper but on raw performance alone overall the clock speed bump of the 3600 XT will give you a nice performance boost in pretty much any multi-threaded production type tasks out there and depending on the pricing in your region is probably the better choice over the 3600 of course though if production workloads and rendering performance is your primary focus I would highly recommend just saving the extra cash for an eight-core 3700 X if possible what I was really curious to see though is what the additional clock speed meant when it comes to gaming and the results are good in most cases you'll see performance now matching there's more expensive higher clock Rison processors like the 3900 X and 3950 ax and in other cases I found it to be just slightly faster it is going to be fairly game dependant and also depending on if it's a meaningful difference for you but generally the 10 600 K is still the faster gaming CPU but to be fair it is also a more expensive processor and also requires a more expensive motherboard to be overclocked and run a high speed memory kit the 3600 xt is a much more economical choice for gamers and will get you most of the way there especially if you're not that interested in gaming at higher framerate but instead at higher resolutions with graphics and details cranked to high and ultra you're likely not going to notice a difference between a 3600 XT and a 10 600 K and honestly reading through the comments that seems to be why most of you are choosing a rising CPU over in tow but let's circle back to this discussion and now take a look at overclocking this is something that really surprised me with the 3600 XT at a load voltage of one point three six volts I was able to hit four point six gigahertz and this was stable in blender Cinebench and every game that I had the chance to test those clock speeds are far above anything that I've seen on a rise in CPU previous when we're talking about an all core overclock at this frequency we can actually beat a 10 600 K in Cinebench when that's overclocked to 5 gigahertz flat and we get a significant bump in v-ray as well however while overclocking the 10 600 K can pretty much level it with the best gaming CPU that you can buy right now overclocking the 3600 XT doesn't give us any noticeable improvement when it comes to gaming this is why for enthusiasts gamers who do game at high frame rates whether that be for competitive titles or not the 10 600 K is still a very sensible choice if you're willing to spend the extra cash in the end the 3600 XT I think we can agree is a welcome update to the horizon 3000 lineup until 4th gen arrives later this year if you were kind of interested in 39 50 X 3900 X kind of gaming performance in a 6 core product now you have that as an option personally I was really surprised to see that much higher overclocking ceiling 4.6 gigahertz on all 6 cores is not what I expected to have on technically still a rise in 3000 CPU if you are considering the 3600 XT I would also consider the quad-core 3300 X which you can get for around 130 dollars cheaper that saved cash would likely be more than enough to upgrade your GPU which would be the more sensible choice for a gaming rig do stay tuned for a video coming up between those two specifically quite soon so if you are interested in these new rise and xt processes I will leave them linked down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
