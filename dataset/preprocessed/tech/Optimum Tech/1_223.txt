today we are going to be building this this is a $1400 relatively compact ITX gaming PC that is really solid for 1080p and 1440p gaming now this is going to be pretty different from my usual build videos this is not going to be cinematic or anything like that this is going to be more focused for those beginners who don't know much about PC building basically if you've never built a PC before this would be a really great place to start the great thing is that we're going with the NZXT h1 which despite being fairly compact at just thirteen and a half liters in volume it's one of the easiest PC builds that you could probably do today so let's take a look at all of the parts we'll go over the build process and we'll finally see how this thing performs in games so at 1400 dollars you're getting a pretty compact gaming rig that takes up a barely any room on your desk and also stays relatively quiet under full load let's jump in and take a look at the parts starting with the CPU so here we're going with AMD's Rison 530 600 which I definitely consider the sweet spot as a gaming CPU option at the moment you're getting six cores and twelve threads on AMD's current generation architecture and that's going to give us a nice stable frame rate performance in games with no stuttering that's something that you might experience if you opt for a similarly priced Intel CPU instead such as the i5 9400 which only has six total threads we're going to be slotting that Rison v cpu into the assist ryx B 450 i motherboard and the great thing here is that this board supports third generation CPUs out of the box that means no messing around with BIOS updates and having to borrow a previous gen chip I've also done an in-depth video on this motherboard comparing it to the much more expensive x5 70 I version and ensure I can only recommend opting for that more expensive x5 70 variant if you're using a 16 core 39 50 X or maybe the 12 core 13 900 X for our six core processor though this be 450 I version is ideal for storage we're going with a single one terabyte MDOT to nvme drive the one that I'm using here is a fairly expensive Gen 4 drive but I'll link a much more suitable and affordable model down below installation is identical and performance for gaming for most real-world tasks will be virtually the same for memory we're going with 16 gigabytes total rated for 32 hundred megahertz and this is a Corsair Vengeance opx kit fairly straightforward 16 gigabytes is the sweet spot currently for gaming and thankfully memory prices have come down significantly over the past few months probably the most flexible part of this builder is the GPU and here I'm going with and videos are TX 2070 super now if you want to save around $100 US on this build you could go for AMD SRX 5700 XT instead which honestly performs within five to seven percent on average of the r-tx 27 new super that we're going with here if you're more confident with performance tuning and troubleshooting you might want to go for that 5700 XT the GPU drivers there are less they were based on community feedback and the thermals could be worse depending on which specific card you buy but if you want the safer option in terms of drivers and overall performance go for the 27 you super like I have here this would also be the better choice if you maybe could see yourself streaming or doing some h.265 video encoding on the side in that case you can benefit from the powerful onboard encoder on at the nvidia card and lastly we have the NZXT h1 one of the best cases that i've had the pleasure to review in terms of building and user experience and the great thing here is that the power supply and liquid cooler for the cpu are already pre-installed that means that you won't have to worry about having to source and buy these two parts or even taking the extra steps to install them so let's get started and the first step is to install our CPU into our motherboard the CPU socket is in the center of the board and can be opened by lifting and pulling back that small lunch that's attached next to it the latch should sit at 90 degrees to completely unlock the CPU socket you want to be a little careful when handling that CPU and only hold it on the sides don't touch the bottom where the pins are installation here is fairly simple you want to line up the small gold triangle on the CPU with the triangle on the CPU socket slowly place it in and don't drop it and you shouldn't need to use any force in the end you should have the rising text facing the i/o side of the board once the processor is seated you can close the latch and the CPU is now installed now we'll install our Ram this build and motherboard uses two 8 gigabyte sticks to install these we want to unlock the two slots to the right of the board by releasing the two latches at the top next you'll want to line up the small notch on the memory sticks with the notch in the slots and carefully insert them with an even amount of pressure you should hear a small click when they're installed and seated correctly with the latch now fully closed next up is our storage so grab that MDOT 2 and vme drive and we're going to install this in the primary slot on the front of the board this is accessed by removing the two screws shown here you've also got a thermal pad underneath here that you'll need to remove the protective film from I've already done that finally there's just another screw that secures the m-dot to storage drive in place so you want to remove that carefully install the drive into the slot and then secure it with that small screw reinstall the heatsink cover with those two screws that we removed earlier and believe it or not we've actually completed a good portion of this build the motherboard is now ready to be installed into the NZXT h1 case so unbox the h1 remove the front and rear panel and then you'll be able to slide the main part of the enclosure vertically off the frame the first thing that we need to do here is remove these two screws here which secure the liquid coolers 140 ml radiator to the frame this will release the radiator and allow it to hinge back and out of the way this now gives us access to the motherboard tray but before you install the motherboard you want to install the motherboard IO shield you'll find this in your motherboards box fairly straightforward installation here next to where the motherboard will sit you might have to fiddle with it and apply a bit of force but now we can finally install the motherboard I find that sliding it in through one of the sides is the easiest way here the board should line up nicely with that IO shield you'll find the motherboard screws in the accessory box for the h1 these will be labeled 6 to 32 by 5 millimeters and there's 4 screws in total at each corner of the board now that the board is in place we can start plugging everything in and let's start with the PCIe riser cable that connects our motherboard to our GPU this is already bent and in place ready to be installed thanks to NZXT this slots directly into the motherboards PCIe slot at the bottom and you want to double check just to make sure that it's fully seated next up we'll install the front panel connector the front USB connector and also the HD audio cable you'll likely find these hanging somewhere within the interior of the case not jammed up behind the power supply cover like I had here I recommend starting with that front panel connector seeing as that's the most finicky and this will plug in towards the right side of the board directly underneath the plug for the 24 pin motherboard cable next is the HD audio cable and for our board this plug is hiding between the Wi-Fi module and the m2 slot then we have the bulky front USB cable this plugs in towards the lower right side of the board the 24 pin motherboard cable is next and thankfully that right in place where it should be it just needs to be lowered and then seeded into the connector again specifically for this plug you want to double check that this one is seated properly it's a common error among beginner PC builders that this one isn't fully connected the 8 pin CPU power cable is also in place just hovering above that connector pretty easy to install there and then the last two cables that we'll need to plug in the 4 pin CPU fan cable and the three pin DC cable for the pump on a liquid cooler the CPU cable plugs into the leftmost fan header and the pump cable plugs into the middle all right I'd say we're about 85% finished at this point next we need to install some mounting hardware onto our CPU cooler so that we can actually mount it to the CPU and motherboard firstly you want to clip on that aim for mounting bracket like shown this will be in the NZXT h1 accessory box and just double check that that bracket is facing the correct way and this way as well now out of the box this liquid cooler will have thermal paste pre applied on the bottom of the cold plate and honestly you're fine to just leave that on and use that of course in as I've used this case before in builds previously that thermal paste has been cleaned off so I'll be applying my own for this build just something worth mentioning but next you'll need the retention screw and right angle clip installed like shown again these will be in the accessory box they'll screw together as one piece right through the bracket and it's important to keep it nice and loose these two brackets on either side will hook onto the little latches that are pre-installed on to our motherboard and then it's just a matter of tightening them up this will increase the mounting pressure of the liquid cooler onto the CPU once it gets fairly difficult to tighten and the block isn't going anywhere then it's tight enough lastly close that radiator hinge back to where it was initially make sure that there aren't any cables or tubing that's getting caught in the way and reinstall it with those two screws that we removed earlier now this side of the build is completely done so let's flip it around and finally install our GPU there's two screws towards the bottom of the case that line up the graphics card with the expansion slots you'll need to remove those two screws so that we can properly install our 27-inch super installation here is fairly straightforward just line up the PCIe slot with the graphics card apply a bit of force and it should seat nicely like shown then secure it with those two screws that we just removed and then finally plug in those GPU power cables for our our TX 27 in super we'll be needing an 8 pin and a 6 pin PCI II power cable which comes in the form of this cable and this is a fairly straightforward installation as again it's already so close to the connectors and in place just reinstall that power supply cable cover and you've just finished building a killer compact gaming rig we're not going to go over the windows 10 installation here you can find plenty of generic and well-made videos that show how to do that online but let's skip ahead to what you'll need to download and install once you've got Windows 10 running and updated the first thing that you'll need to do is update your motherboards BIOS although the CPU is compatible with this board and will function quite fine it's likely that the board didn't with the most updated BIOS that usually optimizes the CPUs performance this is pretty easy to do just head over to your manufacturers website I'll leave a link to that in the description download the most updated BIOS onto a USB Drive restart your computer and repeatedly hit the Delete key bringing you to the motherboard BIOS and then head over to the easy flash section selecting the updated file after that's updated you'll also want to go ahead and enable XMP to achieve the full speeds from our memory kit this is found in the AI Tweaker section by selecting the do CP standard setting next to AI overclocked tuner if you want you can also access the fan curve for the CPU cooler by pressing f6 you can make adjustments here later on once you've gotten to know your system a bit better there are also a few more drivers that you'll need to install onto your system to get it running up to spec these include the updated AMD chipset drivers the audio Ethernet Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers for your motherboard and lastly the drivers for your GPU again all links to these can be found down below in the description but now let's talk about gaming performance which is really what this system has been spec for so with an RT X 2017 super this build is very very capable at 1080p resolution and is also very suitable for 1440p more eSports focused titles will have no problem at all hitting above 240 frames per second if you don't mind dropping a couple of quality settings and the majority of titles at 1080p high settings will have you sitting at around 120 fps or there are balance again though that's pretty close to max quality and detail so it just depends on what your priorities are there's definitely plenty of room in the tank then if you want to bump the resolution up to 1440p in terms of thermal performance the r-tx 27-year super was hovering at around the 80 degree c mark with the risin v 3600 sitting at around 60 C this was after 30 minutes into a gaming session with the room temperature sitting at 24 degrees C now although those GPU temperatures herbed it on the warmer end they're still well within spec and a safe operating temperature with the 27 t super still boosting to around 1860 megahertz also the system was pretty quiet during full gaming load so there's plenty of room in the gpus fan curve if you want to reduce that temperature a little yourself here's an idea of what you can expect in terms of noise so playing the new modern warfare war zone I had an absolute blast playing on this compact rig at $1400 this is by no means the best performing rig for the money however it really is a solid deal without any problems whatsoever following the instructions in this video I'm confident that a true beginner with zero experience with computers could get this gaming rig up and running within a couple hours with everything fully installed so if you are interested in building this one or perhaps using it as a template at least I will have all the parts down below in the description as well as all of the drivers and software that you'll need - so as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
