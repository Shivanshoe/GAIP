hey what's up guys hope you're all doing well and today we have another setup review so a bunch of setups here over on twitter which we're going to go through and rate or roast or really depends on the setup to be honest uh but yeah if you're not following me on twitter already i'll definitely do that because every couple of months we do a little call out for your setups and yeah just take a step back and see what you guys have been up to so the first one here that we're gonna kick off is david so he submitted this one three hours ago so yeah these ones just really keep rolling in uh looks like he's got a dual monitor set setup here he's listed a bunch of specs like pretty much every spec of his pc which i'm not going to read out you guys can go ahead and read out there looks like an intel i9 setup he's overclocked out to 5.1 he's also got an rtx 3080 in there and then for the peripherals he has the g pro wireless with grip tape i believe that is uh ducky one two minute off to the left there and then the hyperx cloud 2 for the headset very very nice and then for the monitors he's got the asus vg259 qm that's that one on the left there and then the xl2411p on the right uh to be honest i'm not a big fan of how he's got the monitor set up the way his seating position is laid out he's kind of forced to look like you know turn his head to either one or just look where the monitors meet his kind of bezel in the middle here which is not really comfortable when it comes to gaming and the only reason i really make that comment is because you know this guy kind of looks like a bit of a sweaty fps gamer maybe a little bit like myself uh you know just judging by the peripheral choice and also the grip tape on the g pro wireless and also because this is probably like the most mouse pad space i've ever seen on this entire setup review series i mean take a look at this half of his desk is no probably like two thirds of his desk is literally just for mouse pad space which is absolutely insane this guy must have like the lowest mouse sensitivity in the world and you know he does have those two monitors mounted on a monitor arm there which you know you can kind of just reorient those a little bit which is no problem at all and then wait wait a second is that dude is that g fuel are those tubs of g fuel okay yeah this guy is definitely a sweaty fps gamer for sure i mean how many tubs of g-fuel do we have here dude like four seven uh nine tubs and i have no idea what this bottle is but i'm scared to zoom in even more yeah just be careful with that caffeine dude try not to you know just try and go a little bit easy on that and then yeah for the pc not too much to really talk about here he's only included one pick but you know pretty generic looking pc uh liquid called i9 at 5.1 gigahertz and then he's got the rtx 3080. but overall david yeah looks like a really comfortable setup another thing i'm a big fan of here is the lighting behind the monitor just taking a little bit of that strain off the eyes which you know can be a thing after your really long hours and yeah ton of mouse pad space i like the way that you've got it set up to be honest really really comfortable next one here is super super clean this one is from don't really know how to pronounce that one really sorry uh but what's really interesting here is the mzxch1 with an extra back panel replacing the glass front one so that's really really interesting uh you know i saw nzxt they came out with the h510 flow edition which is pretty much an h510 with the front glass panel replaced with a vented panel instead which you know you can say what you want about that it's kind of moving towards a more airflow focused case but i really think they probably will do the same thing for the nzxt h1 because you know thermals have not been great in that case uh but this user has taken it upon themselves to just do the same thing and i can imagine the thermals probably would improve quite a bit as for the system it's running a strix b550i motherboard ryzen 5600x and a gtx 1070 and 32 gigabytes of ram logitech peripherals and chair wait okay so that's the herman miller logitech collab uh man i've heard that's a really expensive chair so that probably forked out quite a lot for that one and then as for the monitor it's the lg 35 wn75c uh like my desk uncluttered yeah i can definitely see it's a very very clean desk as for the proof rules it looks pretty clean i think that's the g915 uh the low profile wireless one please correct me if i'm wrong but i do believe that's correct and then as for the mouse i believe that's the g502 uh light speed but yeah not a whole lot that i could suggest to you know actually improve this setup i feel like you've presented it really well overall really inviting and clean and yeah i could imagine getting some really comfortable gaming sessions in here potentially you know maybe at night it could get a little bit dark i'm not sure what your lighting situation is uh but hey you've got a lamp here maybe there's some lighting behind the monitor as well otherwise great job and yeah thank you for submitting this next one here uh looks like the complete opposite though it's not exactly you know cluttered or dirty but it's far from what i would call a minimal setup so we're going for the full productivity uh you know just a bunch of stuff on the desk here which is fine i think it's actually presented quite well but let's take a look at what mr good times here has for the setup so there's a current setup here with a 10700 kf and a 2080 ti dual 3060 aio loop wait what's going on here okay so he's actually got a 360 ml aio strapped onto the gpu so keeping that nice and cool and then as for the monitors we have three 32-inch 1440p on the bottom so boom one two three one is vertical there that's quite cool uh and then 43 inch 4k for youtube and movies up top uh switch between pwnage ultra custom viper ultimate and g pro current keyboard is a modded uh drop control and then sure mv7 for the microphone and sennheiser five eight x's for the headphones right over there honestly when i see setups like this i'm like what are you guys doing with this many screens like i have no idea like having that much information and stuff around me maybe it's one of those things that you you really have to try uh before you can kind of you know criticize it but like 43 inch 4k panel up there for movies and youtube like i don't understand i just i i can't get that when you have so many screens here but it does look like you have some more custom keyboards here one on the left there and then two up there on the right uh i'd be really interested to see those as well so maybe you should have included those uh but otherwise looks like a really comfortable setup again i've no idea why you need so many screens in your life especially at one desk hope you're enjoying it i mean a lot of people do take comfort in just a lot of stuff around them it feels really cosy to them so yeah thank you for submitting not much i can really criticize here this one here though we definitely have to take a look at here so uh pntn again really weird twitter names you guys have cables definitely have room for improvement i know but i was just making some adjustments recently just left them undone dude i wouldn't even care i personally would have wouldn't have even touched them maybe you can zip tie them to the monitor arm there but yeah when i see it set up like this it just makes me feel good i don't know what it is it's just like really satisfying to look at because i feel like it looks really inviting really clean really just straightforward and the rest is up to you you know the brush is up to you to have a good gaming session get some good work done uh ergonomically works really well you know main monitor in front of you other one on the side boom arm up here when you want to use it lots of mousepad space compact keyboard i mean we could keep going on forever this is a really really good setup and i think that's really it when it comes to you know building a good gaming setup it's not about how much money you can spend or how top tier your peripherals are i mean we haven't even really looked at his system i don't even know what monitors he's using or headphones but yeah just the way that the setup is organized and presented yeah it's done really really well but yeah speaking of the pc this too is really well put together just really clean and yeah just really satisfying to look at man you've done a really good job here uh sliger sm580 is the case so it's a case that i've reviewed really high airflow for an itx case uh rtx 360 ti rg strix that's going to be on the left there ryzen 5600x strapped to what is probably a 240 mil liquid cooler i believe or a 280 possibly it's a 280 he's got the noctua a14s and then yeah corsair sf750 for the power supply and about a one terabyte one and a half terabytes of storage so let's take a look uh he's got some really close clearance there and the way that he set this up for airflow is the correct way he set it up for both fans uh you know top and bottom exhaust so that's really going to encourage air through the side panels and help those gpu thumbs quite a lot and for a 3060 ti man with that big rog strix cooler i can imagine this thing running very cool and very quiet oh no way so this is his keyboard as well so super super clean build here this is a custom build so it's a dz 5 degree case a brass plate uh it's got some case foam in there cherry mx reds okay it's a bit of an odd choice i think i didn't really think people would go for cherry mx reds for uh you know a custom keyboard build but hey i stand corrected and then he's got the blank black keycaps which looks super super clean and then for the mice looks like he's got a g303 modded with uh klgm4s and then cable gem falls on the gpro wireless as well 80 20 20 for the microphone with uh blue compass and scarlet 2i2 overall very very clean setup thank you very much for submitting uh yeah this one was a pleasure to check out this one too very very clean right under it uh this one here from thomas uh wait at mr president okay i think this is okay i know who this is this is the guy from this is one of my uh discord mods and uh twitch active users very very clean man let's take a look at what you're using oldish pick but would not be able to get a pick of the current setup in time only real changes are the peripherals main 27-inch 27-inch main screen okay so you've upped you've upgraded the main screen and you've changed the peripherals okay oh yeah okay i would not imagine you to be using this mouse i would imagine you'd be using like a gpro wireless or something but the first thing that i noticed with the setup is the lighting or really lack of i'm not sure what lighting implementation you might have behind the monitors but that is probably one of the main things that i would recommend this light here you know maybe if you're not sitting at your desk that would be you know all right to have on but if you're sitting here gaming and you have like a really bright light in your peripheral vision uh personally i found that to be not ideal i've had setups like that in the past and my eyes they just strain over time and they they lose focus they lose that sharpness over time i don't know what it is i just find it a little bit distracting having something really bright in the peripheral vision so i'm not sure if that's how you're using it at the moment but that might be something to consider maybe swapping this or having this turned off and instead opting for say you know behind the monitor lighting instead otherwise not really much i can say here to critique it looks like you've got it set up really well you've got a microphone boom arm off to the right maybe you swing that over once it's time to game compact nr200 over there ryzen 5 3600 and rtx 2070 super overall presented pretty cleanly i do like the plants you know that's something that i'm missing in my current setup at the moment is some plants or some greenery maybe where i took my pc away maybe i'll um actually put a plant there instead just to freshen things up a bit because it does make the setup a little bit more inviting but yeah not much i can really critique here mr p i do think it is you know overall presented quite well i will say the the monitors are a little bit off-center something that you might be able to correct as well i'm not sure if you've actually done that uh but hey just another thing to consider but yeah thank you for sharing and honestly that seems to be a common trend between some of these dual monitor setups i have no idea how you guys you know are sitting so you know not centered on one monster because most of you guys are going to be gaming right and you're not going to be splitting the games across two monsters that's just going to be really really weird uh so one monster being the focus you kind of want to orient your setup around that one monitor so here exa for example it's not really working i mean both monitors are kind of one side you know something to consider might be actually putting this as a vertical monitor and then having this as your main one whichever monitor is the faster one or more premium one obviously make that one the focus but yeah ergonomically i do think that is maybe one of the main tips that i'm kind of uh consistently giving out here but yeah otherwise this is no slouch of a setup we have a custom loop in the nzxt h1 with the alphacool custom watercooling system he's probably hooked up the cpu here and the gpu with maybe quick disconnect fittings or done something that i've done previously with the lt solo pump lock but yeah as for the system ryzen 9 3900x and rtx 3070 and if you're only using the 140mm rad in the ntxt h1 like i did for my custom loop that's probably going to get pretty toasty but hey hopefully you have things configured quite well and everything is under control but speaking of setups with a bit more focus here we have one from jamie and yeah you know we're seeing this trend of dual model says triple monitors quadruple monitor setups sometimes it's just really refreshing to see a nice clean single monster setup and that's exactly what we have right here so i think the way this is organized is really really good lighting is really good as well you know i don't imagine there's any ceiling lights on or anything like that most of the lighting looks like it's coming from uh behind the desk but yeah that alone seems like it's providing the room with enough light and comfort to kind of just reduce that eyescreen so i'm actually familiar with the exact build that jamie is running here i've seen it previously so it's an nk sm1 completely liquid cooled with an rtx 3090 and a 5950x for the keyboard he has the leopold fc660c logitech g pro supply for the mouse and that's on the artisan heiyati otsu mousepad he has that in mid the microphone choice is a bit weird it's the rode videomic ntg which is typically a camera mic it has a hotshoe mount so kind of a bit weird that he's got that plugged in there but uh hey if it's doing the job that should be quite fine speaking of you know the single monitor it's the gigabyte auras fi32u so 32 inch 144 hertz 4k that's going to be you know running really nicely with the rtx 3090 there he has the lcd xc planar magnetic headphones god damn he spent a lot on his audio here but uh not so much on the microphone but yeah this is one of those setups where i really have nothing to say uh too critique really uh i think the headphone stand near the mouse pad is a bit sketchy you know i can imagine myself you know doing a massive swing and then you know possibly knocking that i think maybe a better spot for that would be over to the left here or even better you could get a headphone hanger that goes under the desk although hey maybe you don't want your expensive headphones being hidden but either way you could just reclaim that desk space a little bit better you know as someone who has recently switched to a dual monitor setup it is borderline life-changing i mean in terms of productivity and just having something else on the side there when you're gaming it is really really nice but i do really appreciate the focus and simplicity when it comes to a really clean single setup like this and just scrolling through here uh this one caught my attention because i have no idea uh what i'm looking at here is this a pc it is a pc why are there so many fans i see he's like they've like 3d printed a bracket so they've got like an intake fan here two exhausts for the gpu okay that that makes sense but you know two random intake fans here i think your pc has enough airflow my friend i think there is enough airflow in this pc ryzen 5 3600x with an nhu 12s which you know 3600x is not a hot cpu you don't need to jam uh fans into your pc case and then you know strix 3070 which the strix cooler is already huge you probably don't need you know a bunch of fans here i'll give you an a plus for creativity here because uh that pc looks absolutely mental you're obviously going for uh you know a certain aesthetic maybe like um what is it like c steampunk i i think that's the the kind of aesthetic that we're kind of going for here either way yeah looks kind of cool is it necessary no definitely not i feel like those components would run decently enough in that case uh without all of that airflow assistance to be honest seems like more of an aesthetic mod in the end anyway uh if we're gonna be honest like it looks like you've done some detailing work here or some extra 3d printing and kind of gone for you know again a certain aesthetic uh if you really wanted better thermals you know there's the nr200 there's the meshlicious there's the nksm1 all of them are slightly better than the cu-150 so if you really wanted better thermals those are three cases which would have solved your problem a whole lot easier and a whole lot faster i mean here is just another completely wacky pc build what is this this is from glass tube tech they say just finish remaking the blown glass tubing on my personal pc photo of the desk setup with the older tubing in the comments below let's take a look at this okay so there is one thing in this pc build that is really really just just grinds my gears a little bit and that's the radiators there's so much emphasis on the rgb fans and you know you've got six fans attached to each radiator but the radiators are like this thick so realistically i'm not sure how much cooling you're actually getting out of that but uh yeah you probably could have gone for a little bit more uh radiator surface area by the way of thicker radiators which you know i can't imagine that's going to be really optimal in terms of cooling but again this is going to be more of an aesthetic kind of pc you've gone for blown glass tubing which looks absolutely insane like i will say that i've honestly no idea what i'm looking at here it looks pretty cool though but yeah in terms of like the functionality of a you know high performance liquid cooled pc that's just really not doing it for me i do like the monoblock on the rog motherboard that's pretty cool you know the tubing looks really interesting as well not a big fan of the rgb unicorn vomit but hey each to their own and then i also have no idea why you're using an nv link when you only have one gpu i think maybe you're just trying to cover up the little envy link connector uh but these gpus typically uh ship with a little uh plastic sleeve or rubber sleeve that goes over that connector anyway this here looks like the previous iteration of this build which uh you know i don't want to say that the old one looks better but yeah the old one looked a little bit better in my opinion this looks it's just insanely crazy what are these like freaking dolphins you have dolphins in your pc what is even happening here man uh yeah but i do like this one has at least a color theme then we have a picture of the entire setup here we have the alienware ultrawide i believe that is definitely spent quite a bit of money on this entire setup probably mostly on the pc i do think that is the main focus but yeah seriously seriously mental work there oh and this one's really interesting this one's from han uh who submitted their setup i believe it was the last episode or the one before that uh and this was the result so you know i think my main comments were potentially downsizing that uh keyboard because you know who who really needs a keyboard that big especially if you're only using a single monitor and then one of the main comments as well is to take that massive pc case and then just you know put it under the desk and reclaim a bit of that desk space uh so he says excited to showcase the changes i made since the last feature cleaned up the desk and four moved to the pc i'll move the pc to the four uh got an ace of nitro 165 hertz monitor plus a monitor arm upgraded the keyboard to rk84 uh now i love my setup 100 times more let's take a look at the after damn it is a night and day difference look at that it almost does not look like it's even in the same spot i mean the photo taking and the the sunset or whatever's going on there it does look a lot better as well rather than just a sad overcast day but man the setup is 100 times better like you said holy crap man that is a really good transformation and to be honest there's not a whole lot done here like you said bought another monitor bought a monoteran put the pc case on the floor uh oh and uh you know keyboard as well but damn you know that's not a whole lot when you compare these two different setups you look between them and you're like man that's like really expensive you know probably spent thousands and thousands of dollars this one looks kind of average you know it's you know it's just like oh that's a pc that's a monitor that's a keyboard yeah that's the setup this one looks really really cool though then we have an fps gaming and software engineering setup here from muhammad they say ryzen 5800x and rtx 3080 ti with 32 gigs of ram uh glorious model o wireless for the mouse we have an absolutely huge mouse pad there or really a desk pad a big fan of those but not really sure i would go for a white one i feel like black would just be cleaner and you know would stay cleaner and look cleaner overall but hey if you've managed to keep the white one nice and clean over time then more power to you looks like you've got kind of gone for a bit of a white theme as well white case white keycaps and white monitor arm and they also say looking to get a 1440p 240hz monitor what's your best recommendation uh well i recently reviewed a 1440p 270hz option from acer and that seems to be like one of the better options at the moment uh and pricing is very similar to the 1440p 240hz option so definitely go back and watch that review if you haven't already otherwise not a whole lot that i can see here i do like the you know natural light and presence of the setup cable management seems pretty good do like the monitor arm and yeah 1440p 240hz would be absolutely epic on there and definitely a big upgrade from the aoc 24 g2 which is a good budget 144hz monitor but yeah jumping up to 1440p 240hz that's going to be absolutely crazy and especially if you have an rtx 3080 ti that's gonna you know power that no problem at all uh the pc kind of hanging off the desk here does make me a little bit anxious you know i would probably just move the pc under the desk if i'm honest and then potentially you know if you do upgrade to another monitor uh you can have a dual monitor setup because then pc off the desk you'll have a lot of space there just grab the aoc 24 g2 slap that on the left you know put that in portrait mode you've got a sick clean dual monitor setup now this setup though you know doesn't look like anything crazy again it's not about how much money you spend or how much you can flex with your rgb and how many monitors you can strap to one desk to be honest these setups that are really clean really presenting just really welcoming they're just they're almost asking you to come sit down and play some games uh which is how i feel when i look at the setup like this so for the pc nr200 you know nice and compact that's pushed off to the side there in there we have a ryzen 3600 and a gtx 1660 super and then for the main display we have a 144hz 1080p view sonic monitor and then a lot of the focus is on the peripherals here so we have a nice artisan zero soft mouse pad a vaxi outset ax for the mouse yeah again not a whole lot going on just not a whole lot of cash just splashed onto one setup which is you know it's kind of refreshing to see to be honest uh instead we have a focus on ergonomics and comfort which i do appreciate quite a lot man there are so many setups and in terms of you know which setups i picked to feature i just try and find ones that i have talking points about stuff that i can either recommend or maybe you know they just really wow me and i kind of want to feature them this one here from uh tassel james again there's nothing wrong with it i apologize i'm not doing like a full feature on it looks really cool maybe a little bit cluttered for my likings but yeah overall really nice setup there are just so so many submitted uh like this one here super clean as well love that orange lighting around the desk really works with that black theme like you kind of got that nice orange and black theme going on there not sure what's going on here bit of a laptop scuffed setup wait do you have three laptops what's even happening there three laptops three mice okay it's probably you probably should share a room with someone right uh this one's pretty cool uh i do recognize that wallpaper i see you i see you very nice also not too sure about how much i like the white peripherals they do get a little bit dirty over time and they just kind of show up a little bit more where but yeah so many setups here can't possibly feature them all uh but do stay tuned we will be doing this every couple of months so do make sure that you follow on twitter uh i usually do like a call out and then wait a couple of days and then film the video so again thank you all for watching hopefully you enjoyed and i'll see you all in the next one
