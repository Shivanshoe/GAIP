switching to a smaller footprint 60% mechanical keyboard was easily one of the better moves that I've done for my gaming setup by removing those somewhat redundant and less used keys you're able to gain a bit more room on your desk for more important things and so with those benefits in mind I want to compare three different levels of 60-percent keyboards that you could kind of consider today at three different price points we'll be comparing the $45 motor speed CK's 61 the ducky 1/2 mini which you can find for around $100 and then the 350 dollar custom-built that I did a couple of months ago and although these three keyboards are all 60% and half mechanical switches they all deliver a very different typing experience so let's take a look [Music] so the point here isn't to find which of these three is the best because obviously that's going to be the much more expensive at custom build instead I want to show and explain the differences between them essentially by spending more money what do you get in return firstly here's a quick overview of what we're looking at here the motor speed CK 61 represents one of the cheapest 60% mechanical keyboards that you can find on the market then we have the ducky 1/2 mini which I personally think is one of the best 60% mechanical keyboards that you can currently buy at just $100 and the one that I've got here has Cherry MX red switches then there's my custom-built 60% keyboard which I've been using for a couple of months now and absolutely love it's got an aluminium 60% case lubed Helios v2 switches and then sa Miami nights key cap set so the first thing that we should get out of the way is the difference in build quality and weight between these different keyboards with the main point being that most off-the-shelf keyboards will have a plastic case whereas with a custom build you've got the option for a metal case so both the ducky and the CK 61 have a plastic case but I'd say the ducky is just slightly more premium because it is just a little bit thicker and there is actually one big benefit of that plastic construction and that's portability if you need to bring your keyboard with you in a backpack for example the CK 61 and ducky are significantly lighter than a metal custom build which weighs over twice as much all three of these keyboards have a type-c connection and that's something that I wasn't really expecting to see on the $45 CK 61 when it comes to the key caps this is an added level of customization for a custom build and an entirely separate category in itself really this is truly a rabbit hole if I've ever seen one with tons of appealing and fun options just follow Tejo types on twitch or YouTube and you'll see exactly what I mean the ducky 1/2 mini uses double shot PB Tiki caps which feel great to type on they've got a really nice smooth finish the CK one uses double shot abs and feels a bit more textured they also have surface printed function layers which you can expect to wear out pretty quickly now let's talk about these switches and I want to start with the CK 61 because the switches on this but bored aren't too bad at all I chose the kale box white switches which I just wasn't expecting to be this good at this price point but the thing I like about them is that they don't feel too Scratchy which I personally find a lot of off-the-shelf tactile switches do tend to feel like these have what's known as a click bar so there's a physical bar which clicks inside the switch when you press the stem down do note the tactile click is pretty audible though making this a fairly loud keyboard but I do appreciate that the switches themselves are relatively smooth for this price point I went with the Cherry MX Reds on the ducky one-too-many which are just about the most popular mechanical keyboard switch in the world it's basically the vanilla ice cream of linear switches they're going to be smooth enough for most users but coming from a custom build these do feel slightly scratchy that in my opinion is easily forgiving though when we take a look at how good these stabilizers on this ducky one to me ah I was personally a bit blown away here because this is the first off-the-shelf keyboard that I've used where the stabilizers didn't feel like absolute trash I mean you do have that pretty harsh click but the stabilizers themselves aren't you know ratalie that you'd find on something quite a bit cheaper or even more expensive like from Corsair or Razer for example so the stabilizers on ducky 1/2 mini is easily what I would say makes it worth the $100 the stabilizers on my custom build are clipped and lubed so they without a doubt sound and feel a bit smoother and particularly the bottoming out isn't as harsh but again I'd be more than happy typing full-time on the ducky and that brings us to the biggest drawback of the budget CK 61 these stabilizers here are really pretty bad but you can't complain too much at this price point to access the arrow key on the CK 61 you can either press FN plus 3 to access the arrow keys at the bottom right or FN plus 4 to access the keys at the top left the ducky is quite a bit easier you just need to hold down that function key and that will give you access to your full function lair including those arrow keys with a custom build depending on what PCB you go with you can program a function lair to do the exact same thing if you want or just choose a PCB layout with the arrow keys built in like I have here now I want to come back to the discussion of switches because this is one of the biggest advantages of building something custom it's that you've now got a huge range of switch options that most would agree feel and sound quite a bit better than what you'll find on off-the-shelf keyboards you've also got the option to lubricate the switches before soldering them to the PCB or plugging them in if it using a hot swap PCB and that can make them feel a bit smoother and more buttery to type on so here's a full type in comparison between all three [Applause] [Applause] so for most of you watching this I do think the ducky one-to-many is definitely the way to go for $100 you're getting a keyboard with some really solid stabilizers switches are gonna be good enough for most people and for those wondering yes I do consider this better than the end pro to beyond this a custom build will set you back a lot more money and let's not forget that you also need the tools at hand to assemble it that's not to say that custom builds aren't worth it though I regret absolutely nothing with my build to try and get the best typing experience that I can if you are someone who uses a keyboard for a significant portion of your day a 350 to 500 dollar custom keyboard isn't actually that bad when you consider how much it gets used not to mention if it makes your work for a bit more efficient and more enjoyable and I can also appreciate customer chemical keyboards as a legitimate hobby and something to get excited about although it can look a bit pretentious from the outside at the end of the day a keyboard is a tool for you to complete whatever it is that you do and good tools make for better experiences that's pretty much universal on the other end of the spectrum a $45 ck 61 is totally viable sure these stabilizers aren't good at all but they're pretty comparable to a lot of popular keyboards that are out there on the market if I was on a super tight budget the CK 61 would be my first pick but maybe with some acquired linear switches so hopefully that helps you guys out if you are looking for a new 60 percent mechanical keyboard or maybe considering building something from the ground up on your own hopefully now you can kind of weigh up the pros and cons and maybe weigh up if the benefits of a full custom board is really going to be worth it for you over something like a premium option like a ducky one to many if you are interested the links will be down below as always here huge thanks for watching and see you all in the next one
