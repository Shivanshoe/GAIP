so when i first saw the velka pc cases my first impressions were damn these guys are pushing small form factor computing to the absolute limit almost no interior volume is spared here when building in these cases i ended up building an rtx 2070 gaming pc in the velka 3 which basically fit in the palm of my hand not kidding and the velka 5 is still the smallest case that you can build in today that can fit a 2 slot reference sized graphics card now since then there has been a revision of the velka 3 and 5 but also a new model called the velka seven and don't let the name for you it is the largest of the three cases but it's still brutally small at just six liters in total volume today we're going to take a look at how you can build an extremely compact gaming pc inside it and everything that you need to know [Music] all right so a quick brief for those of you who aren't aware of these cases plainly these are some of the smallest pc cases that you can build in today the velcro 3 is the smallest coming in at just 4 liters in volume supporting a graphics card up to 175 mils in length then we have the velcro 5 where 270 ml long cards can fit at just five liters in volume and finally the one that we're building in today the velcro 7 which has graphics card support up to 289 millimeters and cpu cooler clearance up to 47 mils the materials used are also substantially stronger than the first iterations that i reviewed a couple of years ago with much thicker panels this time around in terms of the panel quality and the strength of the case i'd easily put this up there with other high quality aluminium cases like the encase m1 and the dan a4 but one of the biggest updates since the first revision is that the i o for the velcro 5 no longer spews out the top like it did before it now exits straight out the back however to actually achieve this in the velka 5 and 7 the pcie riser cable needs to be folded in the weirdest way that i've ever seen if you're wondering this doesn't affect the signal or the performance but for the sake of the integrity of the cable try and get this right the first time thankfully once you install your graphics card that ugly fold is out of the way and we can just pretend that we didn't have to do that also unfortunately yes the pcie riser cable is just a gen 3 cable so if you're using a motherboard and gpu with pcie gen 4 which all current gen parts do you will want to additionally invest in a 4.0 riser to avoid any issues luckily i did not run into any issues with this gen 3 cable in this build but i consider myself pretty lucky after the disasters that i've experienced with similar setups then since the gpu io is at the rear but facing upwards we have to use these displayport and hdmi extension cables these need to be folded like shown and then screwed into the slots at the back of the case now there is a downgrade to using these extensions if you were planning on using the hdmi 2.1 port on an rtx 30 series or radeon 6000 series gpu that won't be possible here seeing as the port gets downgraded to hdmi 2.0 i did test this on my lg cx and while the 4k 120hz option is there it can't be successfully enabled displayport on the other hand seems to be working fine despite the extensions supposedly only being a displayport 1.2 i had no problem locking in 240hz on a 1080p display and even 160hz on my 4k panel seem to be working as normal so the velka 7 is just like the velcr5 but expands the cpu cooler height to 47 millimeters from 37 millimeters and the graphics card length to 289 mils from 270. that means in the volca 5 you're pretty much limited to just using a noctua nhl9 which i wouldn't really recommend for cpus above a ryzen 5 or intel i5 so for anything above 65 watts or above 6 cores generally i'd encourage you to go for the velcro 7. that way you can run a substantially larger cooler like the alpine phone blackridge which comes in at exactly 47 mils in height it is a lot bigger than the noctua l9 and so here we're running an 8 core ryzen 5800x motherboard compatibility is a concern for this cpu cooler though so it's fine for the asus strix b550i that we've got here but there are a lot of itx boards out there that just aren't compatible with it so just keep that in mind then for the gpu we're using an rtx 3070 founders edition which is thankfully pretty compact although airflow design of this card is not exactly ideal for this case the fan closest to the i o exhausts hot air like a blower fan directly upwards and out of the case but this ends up being blocked by the displayport and hdmi extension cables then for the flow-through fan that pushes air right through the heatsink that ends up being blocked by the power supply and power supply cables then to make matters even more challenging this case is so small that there isn't a single exhaust fan on an encouraging note the velcro series of cases are extremely well ventilated so hot air should be able to find its own way out of the case as the air pressure inside increases but in the end we've got an extremely powerful build that's smaller than the xbox series x it can fit in a backpack take up basically no room on your desk whilst pushing most 1440p gaming monitors to the absolute limit in terms of refresh rate so how does it perform well at stock without any tuning or modifying it's about what i expected the rtx 3070 is having a hard time in there for sure although thermals are acceptable at 78 degrees c the fan speed was really loud at over 2 2700 rpm as you saw luckily we can improve this quite a bit by undervolting the gpu by locking the gpus to 1850 megahertz at 860 millivolts in msi afterburner we shave off a couple of degrees but more importantly now have a much more reasonable noise level by the way if you're unfamiliar with gpu under vaulting it can be done with pretty much any gaming gpu out there and i'll leave a link to my full guide on how to do it down below as for the cpu on the other hand the ryzen 5800x probably wasn't the best pairing for this compact build after all it is the hottest of the four ryzen 5000 cpus the reason for that is that it has the highest power per die rating out of all of them sending around 125 watts here to just a single eight core die that also enables it to run the highest all core clock speed out of the series as well which with ideal cooling should sit around that 4.5 to 4.6 gigahertz mark and we're a bit below that here with our low profile cooling more like 4.2 although we can claw back some of that clock speed with a precision boost to undervolt getting us pretty close to ideal performance in any case you're looking at around 90 degrees c for the cpu at full load which amd says is perfectly fine and safe but it does outline the limit of what is possible here so i think this build configuration is definitely pushing the limit of what you can install and run in the velka seven which i'm happy that i installed it to kind of expose those limits but if you're planning on doing something similar it is doable but i would probably recommend something a little bit more sensible and manageable something like an rtx 3060 or 3060 ti for the gpu and then maybe a ryzen 5 or intel i5 for the cpu and that's assuming that you need something this small and portable in the first place which let's be honest most of us do not especially in the current state of the world but for those of you who do and you need something that you can throw in a backpack take to and from work or between multiple homes this is the answer the velka 7 full desktop graphics performance in under 6 liters and if you need something even smaller also consider the velka 3 and 5 and definitely expect some builds within those two coming up as well so of course i will leave these cases linked down below for those of you who are interested as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
