so no doubt the biggest downside of a super high refresh rate gaming monitor is that you have to compromise with just a 1080p resolution panel except these days you actually don't have to this monitor represents what i think is going to be the sweet spot resolution and refresh rate moving forward it's the aorus fi 27qx and it offers a 240 hertz refresh rate at 1440p resolution so if you play games like call of duty warzone apex legends or valerian this is definitely a monitor that you'll want to consider and actually even if you want to play slower titles at 1440p like cyberpunk 2077 or shadow of the tomb raider i'd say this monitor still makes total sense so what is it like to game on and how does it compare to other monitors that i've tested let's take a look [Music] so to start with the fi 27qx is about as gamery as a gaming monitor can get on the exterior and i really don't like starting reviews off on a negative note don't worry because the rest of this monitor is excellent but i just can't get used to this exterior that chin bezel especially is one of the thickest that i've ever seen almost making this monitor look like it has an aspect ratio of 16 by 10. in terms of ergonomics though the fi 27qx is excellent the stand does extend a fair distance from the base and usually i would find this to be an issue since i preferred a game with my keyboard and mouse quite close to the monitor but i found myself positioning it a little bit further away from me than usual because it's a bigger display compared to what i'm used to adjustments as well are nice and firm and you've got everything that you'd possibly need the two that matter the most height adjustment up to 130 millimeters and tilt from -5 up to 21 degrees then in terms of adaptive sync this is a freesync premium pro display with g-sync compatibility and you will need to use the single displayport 1.4 to achieve the 240hz refresh rate at 1440p the other two hdmi 2.0 ports will have you limited to just 144 hertz also all of the ports are positioned quite low so depending on your monitor height they may actually be visible from the front navigating the monitors menu is done via a little joystick at the bottom it's one of the most dense monitor menus that i've ever seen and i'll be honest it includes things that you'll probably never use one thing that i'd recommend doing right away though is binding one of the joystick direction clicks to brightness otherwise simply adjusting brightness which is something that i do at least a couple of times a day requires up to 11 button interactions to adjust confirm and then exit the osd now in the world of competitive first person shooters refresh rate is undoubtedly king if you're playing at 240hz or even up to 360hz you absolutely have a competitive advantage over your opponent if they're playing at lower refresh rates they're going to appear on your screen before you appear on theirs and not to mention aiming is significantly easier at higher refresh rates however depending on what game you're playing higher resolution might also give you a competitive advantage now this isn't so much the case in cs go or valrant those games i think you can pretty much get the most out of competitively at 1080p or lower if you prefer but games like warzone and apex i think higher resolutions can actually be really really valuable games where you're constantly running around and scanning the map visibility at 1440p as opposed to 1080p is significantly better on a 2560x1440p display you're getting 78 more pixels compared to 1920x1080 and that difference is extremely noticeable especially if you're someone like me who prefers to play first-person shooters with anti-aliasing off 1440p doesn't look anywhere near as shimmery or distracting as 1080p does instead it looks significantly clearer and most importantly visually more enjoyable and accurate now while i do consider this to be an advantage in warzone and somewhat in apex as well the higher resolution is not as advantageous or appreciated in games like valrant and cs go where you basically know where your opponents are going to be coming from and the general game models and assets are a lot simpler but there is another reason why you might want to opt for 1440p over 1080p and that's of course if you're going to be playing more story based adventure titles in your game library as well those types of games are dramatically more immersive and enjoyable at 1440p compared to 1080 you feel like you're getting the complete visual experience and seeing these games in their full form no you won't be getting anywhere close to 240 fps in cyberpunk 2077 but the point here is that you can then use the same monitor to then go and frag out at 240hz in competitive titles now in terms of pixel response times i use the ufo ghosting test from blowbusters.com along with a pursuit camera to analyze ghosting and pixel overshoot that way we can establish whether monsters are a smeary mess or if there are indeed pixel overdrive artifacts so the aorus fi 27qx has three response time modes from slowest to fastest they are picture quality balanced and speed and overall i'd say these look quite good for an ips display by jumping from picture quality to balanced we get a little bit less ghosting overall the dark trailing edge of the ufo is a bit cleaner with the balanced mode as is the lighter yellow section but then bumping up from balance to speed we do get a crisper image overall but at the cost of visible and distracting artifacts this is definitely noticeable in game so i'd recommend avoiding this response time mode altogether balanced is the ideal mode to be using here lastly there is an anti-motion blur mode which is called aim stabilizer but it should really be called aim destroyer this is probably the worst monitor artifacting that i've ever seen so just forget that this exists it also requires adaptive sync to be disabled and lowers the monitor brightness far too low in my opinion then when it comes to color accuracy this is a 10-bit ips panel so you'd expect great things here although that's achieved with a true 8-bit panel plus frc the white point is a little bit on the cooler side out of the box with the standard color profile at around 7000 kelvin although you can adjust the rgb values individually to shift this in terms of brightness the fi 27 qx can go as low as 40 nits or as high as 417 nits most of the time i had the brightness level set to around 70 which results in a little over 310 nits as for color accuracy i measured close to 100 coverage of the srgb and adobe rgb color space with 92.3 of dci p3 so for a 240hz gaming monitor this is absolutely great definitely suitable for content creation as well but i did notice some color deviation versus my 10 bit 4k monitor from lg which i use as my daily driver so personally i had an absolute blast gaming on the fi 27qx but i also have ample gpu power to take advantage of this display in rtx 3090. if however i was using something less powerful like an rtx 2060 or lower then i think i would prefer the experience that i would get from a 1080p to 40hz display sure you could drop the in-game resolution to 1080p to achieve that higher frame rate but stretching that resolution over a 27-inch 1440p panel does not look good at all in terms of how this monitor feels to game on there's no need to complicate things it feels like a seriously fast and responsive 240hz display with a noticeable bump in resolution compared to 1080p i've used 240hz displays for a long time so in that regard this monitor feels very familiar but what felt unfamiliar was the superior image clarity the detail of the game world and models but still at that faster refresh rate personally i think this is going to be the sweet spot resolution and frame rate moving forward for the majority of first person shooters after all modern gpus are now the point where they're kind of outpacing 1080p resolution and you do actually see really similar performance in some games at 1440p now this is not the only 1440p 240hz gaming monitor on the market far from it in fact so if you are interested in this particular resolution and frame rate definitely consider some other options from some other brands i'm also not sure what the pricing is for this particular model but other brands that have kind of been out for a few months now are typically going for around the 800 to 900 mark so for the fi 27 qx in particular it's best to just check your local retailer once this is properly released so that's pretty much all i have to say about the aorus fi 27 qx for now personally i am really excited about these really high refresh rate but also high resolution panels coming out and i think i'll check out a few more in the coming weeks and months i really think this is going to be the ideal refresh rate and resolution combo moving forward for those who kind of want the no compromise gaming experience other than that a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
