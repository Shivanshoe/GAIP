hey what's up guys hope you're doing well and today we're going to be checking out some of your gaming setups and personally this is something that i'm really interested to check out i love checking out uh different gaming setups and getting some ideas for my own setup so hopefully this will be interesting to you guys maybe you can get some ideas for your own setup as well and we do have quite a few submissions here more than i can cover in the full video so i'm just going to scroll through these and take a look at the interesting ones uh so yeah let's start here this one is from alex he submitted 16 minutes ago he said started as a budget setup then i gave up on keeping track of how much i actually spent so it's a bit of a cyberpunk inspired setup here which is pretty cool i like seeing themed setups he's got some blue he's got some yellow the keyboard is probably the smallest keyboard that okay i'm not going to say the smallest i've ever seen but man how do people use these practically i think it's a 40 keyboard ortholinear as well personally i could never imagine using that for everyday use i think it's maybe a bit too much of a compromise for me overall this setup looks pretty well thought out and put together really comfortable to use the main star of the show i think is going to be that pc that looks absolutely awesome so great job there cable management is a bit iffy i mean it's okay but you got this cable running off the wall that's probably to a light or something but i have no idea one thing i would definitely change would be the color of the wall i don't like that color it's kind of like a light pale blue i would just go neutral tone like a gray or something but again personal preference overall really clean setup and yeah it looks like it's working for you then we have a setup here from rasmus which is awesome it's kind of like a esports or first person shooter focus setup so he's got the acer predator 240hz that's mounted on a arm by the looks of it unless the camera angle is a bit deceiving cheaper wireless mouse and gpro wireless headset personally in terms of optimizing a setup for first person shooters i don't think it can get much better than this like there's just so much room to move there's no distractions super clean maybe adding a second monitor could help but again that comes down to the budget and then i love the itx pc built here which is a dan a4 using a gtx 1660 super ryzen 5 3600 with the b550 itx motherboard so there's a closer look of the pc build there nice and compact seven litre build gtx 1660 super so that's gonna be no problem at all powering those esports titles it's one of those setups that i could picture myself just sitting down and playing the games that i play and just being really really comfortable ergonomically this looks like it works really really well all right in the next up we have a really interesting setup from morgan drake they say old meets new streaming setup so 120 fps 1200 by 900 monitor 60fps vhs webcam and my dad's microphone from his radio station in 1965. uh dan case a4 in the background that's off to the right there and a mixing board from 1990. let's take a look at this all right what is going on here at first glance it kind of just looks like a display piece like it's not actually usable because you don't really know what's going on but yeah it looks like he's actually using this as a streaming setup which is absolutely nice so he's got obs running on that uh secondary display here and then he's got this old display i have no idea what it even is 1600 by 900 resolution 120 fps that's great um but yeah no doubt a really really interesting setup i think what makes it most interesting for me is that you've got i think a g pro wireless mouse or sorry that could be a g703 so you've got some really expensive good components like a dan a4 in the background that's like a 200 case but i guess that's exactly what you say right old meets new streaming setup um but yeah it's quite a clash of components i'd personally be really interested to see you know the quality of your stream like what is the video quality that you're getting here no doubt i think the audio that you're getting from that uh old microphone would still be quite good but yeah we'd love to see this stream in full force so please leave me a link to your stream down below i would love to check this out all right now scrolling down a bit we've got one from sean davin or david sorry if i pronounce that incorrectly he says my budget minimalist ghost s1 setup at least until i can snag an rtx 3070 i don't know if a budget and ghost s1 can be said in the same sentence but it looks like he's got a b450i okay so ryzen build i definitely wouldn't call this a budget setup man i think you're doing yourself a bit of a disservice you should be really proud of how well this is presented at least i mean this is super super clean i think the way that you've got this window the ultra wide and that desk is like just the perfect length so yeah really great job and i also really love how you integrated the itx pc into your setup i think this is one of those setups where a mid tower would kind of be a bit overbearing you'd kind of have to push the monitor off to the side here uh or put it on the floor but even on the floor it doesn't like there's much space there so wouldn't really call this a gaming setup it doesn't really look like it's kind of optimized for gaming i would say this looks more like a setup that's kind of optimized for productivity and minimizing distractions which i can totally get behind taking a look at the pc build here looks like he's got a gtx 1070 and the ghost s1 super clean build uh he's using the alpinphone blackridge cpu cooler which i've done a review on previously looks like he's got some custom cables hooked up to the sf600 corsair platinum power supply and he's mentioned that he's kind of waiting for an rtx 3070 to drop in at that upgrade so uh yeah really great job here man super clean setup and yeah i can imagine getting a ton of work done there on a daily basis all right and scrolling down a bit we've got another setup here with the ghost s1 and this setup is one that i can totally imagine myself uh using so he's got compact 60 keyboard big mouse pad it looks like he's got the g pro wireless i believe i believe that's the g pro wireless uh and then he's got the alienware aw 2721d so that's 1440p 240hz he's got the shure sm7b on a boom on there so you can kind of just pull that in when he's talking to his teammates or doing some voiceovers or whatever personally i think this is a really kind of well done single monster setup uh everything is just done really well and it looks really kind of inviting uh let's take a look at this pc here so it's the ghost s1 he's got a large top hat on there it looks like he's kind of going for an ocean theme and he's kind of he's even integrated that into his cables which is super super cool love that so what he's got is the evga hybrid 3080 xc3 but i'm not sure how he's using that with the top hat i think it's only a 120mm radiator but i could be wrong there okay so i was actually incorrect the hybrid card from evga the rtx 3080 xc3 hybrid actually uses a 240mm radiator so he's probably gonna get some really good thermal performance there so that's kind of taking up all of the radiator space at the top of that case overall super super cozy setup the only thing that i would recommend is kind of improving the lighting of the setup i would definitely integrate some kind of monitor backlighting or some some top lighting here i'm not sure if you actually have that and you just turned it off for the shot but that's something that i would personally recommend i don't think this little lamp on here is kind of going to be enough to reduce eye strain and be using that uh for long periods of time at night i think this is another setup here from jesus where i think just proper lighting could just really take the setup to the next level make it a lot more comfortable to use i mean i don't know how you guys are not burning your retinas inside out like if i just turn all the lights off of my setup and use a monitor like this i can't game for more than like 30 minutes but hey maybe that's just me he says first build after 10 years of xbox uh ryzen 9 5900x cooled with uh liquid cooler 32 gigabytes of corsair vengeance memory rtx 3080 looking absolutely sweet there and he's gone for a kind of red color scheme looks like he does have some lighting going on like just behind the desk here and a little lamp but really behind the monitor is where it's going to be most useful or maybe up the top here just to kind of cast some light in the room so you're not kind of gaming in a pitch black room overall though after 10 years of gaming on an xbox uh jumping to an rtx 3080 and what does he got here 1440p 144hz monitor that's going to be a huge huge difference like going from 30 to 60 fps up to 144 fps plus uh yeah that's going to be a sick sick upgrade and then next up we have a bit of a dual setup thing going on here so we've got a gaming setup on the left and then we have what looks like a bit of a workshop so he's got 3d printer over here electronic components overhead cam and a bit of a work map looks like he's working on a controller or something like that but let's go over his build so it's in the nzxt h1 and then for the screen that he's got in there he said he managed to salvage that from a vr display that has since been discontinued but that's pretty cool looks like he's kind of 3d printed his own mount there which is pretty awesome and then just going back to the entire setup here there are probably a few things that you could uh do to improve this visually and make it a little bit more inviting or maybe more productive i've had setups like this in the past with 3d printers and yeah it can get really really messy especially when you're trying to clean the prints and you know clean the plate and do all of that i get it but you could definitely clean up some of this stuff on the floor and get some storage solutions for that for example and then this curtain thing on the left it kind of reminds me of a hospital not gonna lie um but yeah overall no doubt a practical setup for you but there are ways that you could definitely improve this visually and this here is actually a really interesting setup so he says uh rocking a minimal setup desk is tiny where i'm living right now i feel like i've made the most out of this space i have and overall man i would definitely have to agree with you you've made some really good use of this space with such a tiny tiny desk i mean that's barely enough room to kind of cram your chair in but one thing that is a game changer if you are someone who has a really tiny desk like this is a monitor mount i mean if you had this monitor on its generic stand your keyboard and mouse literally wouldn't fit on that desk so just putting it on a mount there again these are pretty cheap you can get them from amazon but yeah that's an absolute game changer if you don't have a monitor mount already and you do have a really tiny desk definitely consider that another thing i'll say is that he's gone with an atx pc build here but it doesn't really matter because his pc is going to be off to the side anyway um an itx pc on the desk here would just be a total waste i would definitely prefer a lot more desk space to move around and kind of put things on on the flip side if you've got the space to play with you can do something like this he says not the newest hardware but something unique so what he's done here is really interesting so he's got the meshified s2 and he just says yeah it's modded fractal design mesh fires too man this guy modded the absolute crap out of this pc like how do you mod this case to fit a radiator at the rear they're like i'm still looking at this going how does that even work like how did you even do that i would personally love to see a lot more pictures of this build to see kind of how you did this oh the cable management is absolutely awesome super super clean at first glance i definitely did not think this was a messified s2 but yeah you've done some really really incredible work here man so great job all right and then this is my kind of setup here all right so we've got an nk71 off to the left there triple monitor setup he says if you hate mismatched monitors look away now but honestly they're not too mismatched um i think that's quite fine man uh so the nk someone off to the left there 6700k it has an rtx 3080 as well so damn you guys are actually getting your hands on rtx 30 series cards that's pretty good lighting in the room looks good overall ergonomically the kind of everything just kind of works then he's got a tko keyboard not sure what keyboard that is although it looks like a k65 or very similar uh big mouse pad that's great and yeah overall very functional and very tidy uh one thing i'll say is that your discord is absolutely blowing up my dude like how do you game when you've got this many notifications and things beeping at you constantly like god damn is this how people are using discord you've got that many friends and uh channels i have like three contacts on my discord and i'm not even kidding um but yeah overall really cool setup now let's take woody's nk1 here so okay cool so that's really interesting he's got a pretty thick rtx 3080 in there it's the for the win3 and he actually had to use uh low profile connectors to get that to fit in there but definitely a really good use of space absolutely love my nks m1 and i think you've made some really good use of it there as well and i'll just cover this setup real quick because i think it's a pretty good minimal clean setup not a whole lot going on i've always mocked small form factor pcs in the past today i can happily own one that easily fits in my backpack all thanks to you ali uh your videos guided me in every step well thank you man thanks for the kind words really glad that you were able to build in the sentry 2.0 but it's actually a clone from taobao wow that's really really interesting overall the build is super super compact that rtx 3080 just sits in there super nicely and like you said this is kind of a portable pc that he's probably transporting between a couple different setups and also as a sentry clone it looks absolutely identical to the original case so not really sure what's going on and how these kind of clone cases can get away with that but yeah overall really cool setup i love the itx pc and if you guys are interested in this wallpaper i will leave links to that down below because it's actually the exact same one that i'm using right now and it might seem like i'm kind of cherry picking itx pc setups here but honestly a lot of you guys just have itx pc builds like like this one here for example which is clearly used as a portable setup if you guys want to see the review of this monitor uh it's actually super super good i will leave that link down below so this guy might be traveling for work or to school for example and then he has a separate home setup so he's got a ryzen 5 2600 overclocked to four gigahertz rtx 3070 in the form t1 case and i will say it's quite difficult to kind of add recommendations or comments to a portable setup because i have no idea how you're using it whether it's for work or for school or if it's a separate home and you're using it for gaming which is kind of what it looks like but for your home setup i would say maybe the next thing to consider upgrading would be the monitors because they are a bit behind everything else you're using and usually i wouldn't say you know you need to upgrade this or whatever but i mean you're rocking an rtx 3070 custom keyboard build and a razer viper mouse so definitely some good peripherals and a really good pc build i think you could get a lot more enjoyment out of that if you considered upgrading to a higher refresh rate display for example scrolling down a bit here we've got a really bright and colorful setup uh damn let me just click this real quick all right so lighting here is done extremely well you can see that it's pitch black outside there doesn't seem to be any light at all but still a very vibrant colorful room no doubt he could just change this to kind of daylight 5600 kelvin or whatever but yeah for a gaming setup i think this looks really practical really inviting in terms of the pc it looks like it's using the ryzen 5 1600x and the gtx 1060 although they have upgraded to a 5900 x and an rtx 3090 so quite a beefy upgrade there and it looks like this setup is possibly used for streaming as well he's got a camera here he's got uh a stream deck i believe that's the elgato stream deck mini but i could be incorrect and then he's got the same audio interface as me so this is the audient evo4 can highly recommend that it's probably one of the best things i've added to my setup so yeah great job on the setup and again those upgrades to your system from a gtx 1060 was it yeah from a gtx 1060 to an rtx 3090 that's just like complete game changes so definitely gonna enjoy that next up we have a setup from daniel he says pretty much the max i could fit into a geek n500 light uh pc case a susp 550i 3800x ryzen cpu msi rtx 3070 so actually quite a few rtx 30 series cards maybe a bit more than i was expecting so let's take a look at the setup here okay so this is again a kind of dual purpose setup so he's got his gaming setup uh on the kind of main portion of the desk compact keyboard a big mouse pad wireless mouse absolutely love that and then he has his 3d printer and pc off to the left here so that's a kind of really nice use of space again joel wants to set up he's got his landscape primary display here portrait display off to the side i think the overall lighting and ergonomics of the setup have done quite well and his pc here is looking super super compact he's actually fit a pretty big cpu cooler in here this is the noctua c14s so quite big but yeah overall pretty tiny build really compact not really sure i would recommend this case i've worked with some acrylic geek cases in the past and in the end they just did not feel kind of well put together at all and the building experience was not that great next up we have project compromise from nines they say started in 2019 and finished in 2021 i had to cobble parts shortages 10 600k z490i motherboard and faithful gtx 1070 ti and looks like a liquid cool build there too so we'll take a look at that case is an sgpc k99v2 from aliexpress painted with plasti-dip okay that's pretty interesting keyboard setup here is really interesting too it's a happy hacking keyboard bluetooth and gpro wireless for the mouse again compact keyboard wireless mouse and big big mouse pad you just can't go wrong with that just brings me joy every time i see it because it's definitely the way to go one thing i'll mention though the way the monitors are positioned with that split directly in the middle obviously you're not gaming across both displays you're probably gaming on one and then viewing discord or spotify or browsing on the other but just to be kind of gaming you know facing either angle ergonomically i just don't see very functional personally i would rather have one display right in the middle and then have a portrait or landscape as the secondary monitor off to the side and then for the pc we have a pretty compact custom loop so like i said this is running a gtx 1070 ti and a 10 600k that's hooked up to a 240mm radiator up top so there's going to be no problems at all calling that pump that's being used here i believe is the aphical dc lt which is kind of towards the top of the build there overall though setup looks clean the lighting is good looks ergonomically quite nice i think the keyboard and mouse up is probably my favorite thing about the setup um and yeah maybe consider trying some different layouts for the monitors as well i think we've got time for a couple more so we've got this one from stumpy at stumpy media he says ryzen 3700x asus x570i motherboard 32 gigabytes of memory uh gtx 1080 ti in the nzxt h1 again there's definitely a trend here between itx pc big desk compact keyboard and big mouse pad i think that kind of setup template just works really really well and very hard to go wrong with that and then we've got a better look at that keyboard that is using there as well it's the kbd67 light with milky gadron blacks lubed with 205 g0 and also just loving the kind of vibe and theme of this setup here looks really inviting really cozy maybe a bit on the darker side for my preference there's not a whole lot of kind of lighting behind the monitors but overall really sick setup man super clean as well like there's just not a whole lot of stuff on the desk or clutter i can't really see cable management because it's kind of like from a top angle bug i'm sure it's fine given the rest of the setup is super clean and then lastly we've got to give the budget setups a bit of love as well so this one's from gaspar he says currently rocking a pretty crappy budget setup when it comes to my pc i don't game on my pc much because i've got only a ryzen 2200g damn well you can still get some decent gaming done with that uh apu he says my case is just some random workstation case my dad found and i do most of my gaming on the ps4 the fake plan adds maybe three fps to most of the games i play so yeah not gonna lie it's a pretty budget scrappy setup but i mean you gotta work with what you've got you've got the ssds just hanging outside of the case which i wouldn't really recommend it's very possible that you could accidentally knock that and disconnect an ssd and that's not going to end up really nicely i'm not really sure about the stands for the tv and how that's working for you it also might just be my eyes but they look like a slightly different height which is not ideal and the thing is you can get actual budget pc cases out there for 30 or 40 dollars which will kind of just clean this area up a little bit yeah other than that super interesting and you said the fake plan adds 3 fps to the games that you play so maybe consider adding a bit more and just beefing up that ps4 a little bit other than that guys i think that's gonna do us there are a lot more uh pc build and setups that we could kind of look at here we do get a lot of just pc builds which i wasn't really uh interested in requesting i was more interested in seeing just the entire setups this one here for example is absolutely sick but maybe just a little bit too cluttered i will leave the link to the twitter thread down below as well so if you guys want to see that and see all the setups that were submitted but yeah big thanks to everyone who submitted it's really interesting to see the different mix of setups that we've got going here uh lots of itx setups as well which is really cool to see but if you're interested in this kind of setup where i kind of rate or react to kind of what you guys have got going on definitely leave a comment down below we might do a few more in the future as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
