so this is the cooler master mm-731 a 59 gram wireless gaming mouse with a solid ergonomic shell and optical switches all of the features and specs that would make this one of the best gaming mice that you could buy today and it's under 100 but the reality is this is easily one of the worst gaming mice on the market right now so what actually got me interested in testing this thing out in the first place was after seeing the reports from customers people who had bought the mm731 and who had reported that there was noticeable delay when moving the mouse so sensor input delay and since i had recently built a machine to accurately test this i was interested to see what the honest truth and the result would be so strapping it into the device and putting it through the testing the result is pretty mediocre but honestly not that bad in wide mode the result does improve quite a bit but still we're not that much slower than a lot of the other gaming mice on this list when it comes to sensor input lag however those reports from customers of terrible sensor responsiveness are entirely correct i have absolutely no idea what cooler master have done here but if i had to guess i'd say that they've purposely implemented some sensor averaging and interpolation into the firmware and the result is that the mm731 feels terrible to game with i mean honestly it feels like cooler master you know didn't even turn this thing on and play a few games with it it is that noticeable and the effect here is you know it's not initially slow to respond as our input lag testing would suggest but you get this constant like floating and averaging effect where you're not getting much feedback from the sensor at all and it's kind of trying to guess where the sensor should be rather than giving you an accurate input one way that i can show you this is with kovacs aim trainer especially in scenarios which require very fast mouse input like tile frenzy now my high score here with the g pro supply is around 130 and most of the time i'm able to get at least around 115 with the mm731 scores were significantly lower and you can even see the slower input on screen visually you're just not getting much feedback from the sensor at all again it feels like it's maybe reading 30 percent of the actual sensor information and just averaging out or guessing the rest it's also very noticeable when it comes to fast tracking scenarios now i'm not that great at this scenario to begin with but the buggy firmware on the mm731 means that i can't change direction as fast or do any micro adjustments on the fly and the difference is very noticeable between this and really any other mouse here's what the same scenario looks like on the g pro super light and yeah i'm able to stay on target a lot more often especially when there's a fast change in direction plugging in the mm731 well that fixes everything and honestly my scores then become very close with the g pro super light so the firmware for the mm731 is 100 different here between the wide and wireless mode this is also the first time that i've seen a physical switch on the bottom of a gaming mouse to switch between the wide and wireless mode typically there's just an on off switch or a 2.4 gigahertz and bluetooth switch and you plug the mouse in when you need to charge it here though they are completely separate modes and i believe this might be the switch that's in fact engaging the two different firmwares now what is really tilting about this mouse is that the sensor averaging or interpolation or whatever is going on with the firmware in that wireless mode that stuff needs to be programmed tested and implemented it's not just some mistake that cooler master you know did that for the mm731 they actually knowingly programmed that stuff into the firmware again probably in an effort to compete with razer and logitech when it comes to battery saving and stuff like that i'm not sure how they thought they'd get away with this because honestly it is a night and day difference between other gaming mice let alone just between plugging the mm731 in and using it wirelessly as for the rest of the mouse it's okay actually not that bad the sensor is placed pretty far forward though which does take a little bit of adjusting too similar to the razer arochi v2 the glides are ptfe but a little bit rough out of the box and the buttons feel nice and light cooler master are using optical switches here so as we'd expect input lag should be fairly good due to not having to use any d-bounce delay as you would with mechanical switches and yeah performance is good oddly still outperformed by the super light somehow not sure how it's slow than some mechanical switches realistically though it should be on par with razer's optical switches but instead it's about three to four milliseconds slower and yeah shape wise honestly a pretty comfortable mouse about the same size as the g pro super light the main difference being it feels noticeably wider especially at the base and of course it's ergonomic and so it does fill out the hand a little bit more all of those positive points though are completely irrelevant because the fact is that when it comes time to use this in-game uh it just feels like absolute garbage you really can't aim properly with this thing at all uh and you know i'm not sure if i could ever recommend this or really any other cooler master mouse especially when it comes to wireless because at worst this is cooler master trying to deceive their customer base and you know lie their way to the top if you will compete with the razer viper ultimate and the g pro super light and at best you know cooler master doesn't really know what makes a good gaming mouse maybe they've just tried to implement some battery saving firmware and you know they unknowingly made the center and aiming really really bad either way definitely not a mouse that i can recommend and please share this with anyone who might have it and i will not be linking it down below in the description as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
