so this is my current audio setup i've got the shua sm7b mounted on a boom arm here and that's plugged into the audient evo4 interface with an sedm1 for some extra gain then for the headphones i'm using the sennheiser i-300s which are really premium iems pretty overkill setup i'll admit but for what i use it for which is streaming gaming and editing the quality that this delivers is really insane how different is all of that though compared to one of the best gaming headsets on the market this is something that i've always wanted to test out i mean as good as all of this is it's not something that i can just recommend to every single one of you it's expensive first of all and second of all not everyone wants you know all of these moving parts this is a much simpler and cleaner all-in-one solution so what i did was i grabbed two of the most popular raved about gaming headsets at the moment the hyperx cloud twos as a bit of a budget option and the sennheiser and drop pc38x's which is what most people will say is about as premium as you'd want to go for gaming audio all right so i want to start off here with the hyperx cloud 2s now right off the bat these are actually a very comfortable pair of headphones or headset rather which i was not expecting giving the price point but in terms of clamping force and the way the headband sits on my head it's just overall really really comfortable uh in terms of microphone quality definitely a big step back from what i'm used to definitely sounds quite compressed but at the same time for a headset that you can get for like 60 dollars i don't think many of us are complaining and i think maybe that's why this is a pretty popular option i'll also say that the dynamic range of the microphone is actually not too bad so if i talk really loud like this and if i'm talking really quiet like this the actual volume of the microphone isn't too different so that at least is pretty good to see at this price point i mean if you need to kind of yell in game things getting pretty heated you at least know that your microphone is not going to clip so comfort's good microphone quality is okay i mean it's possible for the price point uh but the audio quality is just like super super high frequency driven put it that way um it sounds kind of bad if you were just listening to it from a normal headphone perspective i think the reason they've done this is because typically good gaming audio and hearing footsteps and stuff like that is a bit more of those mid to high frequency ranges and that's what they've really tried to boost in this uh headset but it really really does come at the cost of enjoyment and fun uh it's just almost fatiguing i would say because i mean you should have gone like an r99 in apex and it sounds really flat uh really just tinny and rattly almost but uh let's see how this thing performs in game damn that helps heaps hello yeah man i've just uh hello can you hear me nice to be here yeah what's up man nice oh ttv you're a streamer i'm just learning how to use pathfinder they're probably so weirded out like wait this guy's talking way too much i'm probably muted at this point let's see how the wingman sounds like this whoa it's like um clapping two pieces of wood together that's kind of how it sounds through these yeah the sound signature of these definitely a big change from what i'm used to but uh kind of getting used to them overall just very very flat not very involving uh not very engaging do you really need that in a competitive sort of head headset i don't know i do feel like i'm missing some audio queues a gg next up though we have a gaming headset which a lot of people are calling you know one of the greatest options that you can currently buy at the moment are these are the drop and sennheiser pc38xs they are yellow on the side here and on the capsule but you can actually buy a blackout version as well and i think we can all agree that the microphone quality is so much better on this pair i mean this is what going from say around the 60 mark up to the 200 mark will get you the increase in quality from the hyperx cloud twos up to these it really is like a really steep increase like it might be like a 140 difference but you are definitely getting your money's worth in terms of microphone quality and then when it comes to the audio quality that too is just insanely superior like we're now getting that full body of audio like you can now actually hear some bass and quite a lot of mids and you're also not losing too much of that detail and those high frequencies as well i mean if i really had to nitpick i would say that the mids and maybe brought a little bit too forward maybe they're kind of cladding that detail but again that's really being nitpicky and i guess just coming off the cloud twos it's like really noticeable to have that bass response back and just have that full depth and full body of audio like when you shoot these targets you can really hear that like rotate and flip noise like obviously that's not going to be an essential part of like competitive fps but like what if that was a grenade hitting the floor or like what if that was an ultimate landing next to you like that kind of audio frequency is still important in my opinion it really is like a night and day difference here between the cloud twos and the three eight x's i know they're not exactly in the same price category sixty dollars versus two hundred it's quite different for a lot of people but man you are definitely getting your money's worth one thing that i will say about the microphone which i am not a big fan of is that it does seem to pick up quite a lot of breathing noise which is really really unfortunate i don't think that they've you know shielded the capsule good enough in terms of like preventing wind noise and whatnot what i've done here is just to like angle it outwards a little bit which means that as a result it does pick up less like i guess lower quality audio from your voice something that i would actually highly recommend setting up for the pc38x is is a noise gate just to prevent a lot of that breathing noise and whatnot this microphone as good as the quality is compared to the cloud twos uh it's not that good when it comes to noise rejection i'll also note that you know these being open back headphones they do produce a slightly wider sound stage compared to closed back headphones so most gaming headsets these days are closed back the sound is just going to feel like it's coming from a smaller bubble around your head compared to open back which kind of creates this sense of audio space around you which is slightly larger does that make a difference when it comes to like competitive gaming stuff like that maybe it can help a little bit when it comes to like immersion i don't think it's going to dramatically affect how you can like pinpoint footsteps and stuff like that which is like how soundstage is marketed these days but it definitely does help at least feeling a little bit more immersed in the game i feel like what uh sennheiser has been able to package here in a 200 audio product it's really really quite good for gaming i really don't think you need more than this reloaded all right we win those and then of course to finish this up we have the thousand dollar audio set up here's an idea of how much better this microphone sounds compared to the tiny little capsule microphones that you'll find on gaming headsets and i think we'd agree it is a world of difference this isn't necessarily something that you'd buy purely for gaming i think it's quite overkill in that regard especially when you consider the fact that you know in-game audio and team speak is quite compressed anyway and this audio is just going to get crunched down quite a bit if using something like teamspeak or discord that's going to be a different story you'll get a much fuller sound there this is really a microphone that you'd use for streaming recording that sort of stuff and then in terms of the sennheiser i 300 iems uh these are the best iems i've tried full stop uh best headphones i've tried actually even when you compare to hd58x's i've tried the hd 600 650s uh i much prefer the sound that i'm getting from these iems just sounds a lot more full a lot more impactful and when it comes to gaming it also sounds a little bit more realistic as well like you're getting the full spectrum of color and not just say boosted mid boosted highs for example maybe a bit boosted when it comes to the bass but it's still at the point where it sounds uh like a realistic and the bass is not so much a sound it's more of a feel with these iems you can really feel when your bullets are connecting that sort of stuff you can really feel uh when an ultimate goes off when a grenade goes enemy off yeah these iems they have a particular quality where you just you just feel the bullets you just feel when it's connecting more and that uh especially on the cloud twos i just did not have that kind of feedback like these grenades that are going off in front of me for example with the iems you can just really feel the space changing you know just as if like in real life you would you would feel that air pressure changing so for gaming audio i think it's clear here that spending more money does buy you a more premium experience and it scales like most product markets out there there's typically a sweet spot in this case around the 200 mark which gets you about 80 percent of the way there then the more you spend sure things get a little bit better but at the cost of diminishing returns and actually what i was really surprised to see here was how much better the sennheiser pc38x's were compared to the hyperx cloud twos i understand that they are in completely different kind of product tiers 60 versus about two hundred dollars but for that 140 dollar difference you are getting an insanely different product here so for example if you are in a position where you can just save up a little bit more and get the three eight x's instead of the cloud twos that is what i would recommend if it doesn't put too much of a dent in your budget i also really like that the pc38xs have a built-in mute switch for the microphone just by rotating it upwards that's really nice as well as a built-in volume knob on the right-hand side definitely features that i'd see myself and others using now if you are looking to take things a step further streaming and recording for example that's where additional money invested is money well spent although there's definitely diminishing returns the sound quality that you can get out of a sure sm7b compared to the tiny capsule microphones on gaming headsets is in also a completely different league now whether the better headphones will allow you to hear better in game that's really up for debate in my opinion most of that comes down to the actual game audio implementation as much as i love my ie300s and the impact and feedback that i get from them and honestly these just sound so good i don't think that it makes me a competitively better player than the pc38x is although i do think the 38xs do have a much more fuller and accurate sound compared to the cloud twos with the cloud twos i do feel like i am actually missing out on some sound frequencies so hopefully you found this video helpful or at least interesting to watch as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
