the zowie xl 2546 is by far the most popular gaming monitor when we're looking at competitive esports and second place is not even close in valorem cs go and apex this series of monitor makes up over half of the monitor choice by top players if you thought the g pro wireless and g pro superlite were popular not even those can come close to that level of top esports market share at the same time this series of monitor the 2546 series is almost five years old now now just let that sink in for a second almost five years the monitor market during that time has grown leaps and bounds i mean we have 1440p 360hz panels right around the corner while over here we have zowie still on tn 6-bit plus frc panels with honestly no kind of hint or announcement of doing anything else so it kind of begs the question honestly are zoe monitors still worth buying are they still good is the xl 2546k for example worth picking up today if you have one should you be looking for an upgrade now to understand why i'm even asking this question in the first place let's take a look at this so zowie's first version of this 1080p 240hz tn panel came out in late 2016 and it's called the xl2540 they then created the xl2546 which added in their motion blur reduction technology which we know as dayak and then refreshed that model with the 2546s where they added in better dayak tuning and an updated panel then comes the current model a few months later the xl2546k which uses the same panel as the s but adds some ergonomic and exterior improvements you also have the xl2540k which is a refresh of the original 2540 slightly faster panel better ergonomics with the main difference versus the 2546k being no motion blur reduction so even when looking at the most premium recent model has it really come that far from its origins personally i don't really think so it's still a 1080p 240hz tn panel with 6 bit plus frc color and during that time as i said the rest of the monitor market has made some really big strides we have some extremely good 1440p 270hz options at the moment and plenty of good ips 240hz options with refresh rates right up to 390 hertz now if these newer monitors are so much better than the zowies then why are the top players you know still using this it's kind of you know from a consumer's perspective maybe a little bit confusing well on one side some of these top players probably don't really care that much for the newest and latest gear they're probably just really happy to you know keep using what they're really comfortable with but i do think there is a little bit more to it than that as well and the next part of this is mind share zowie is a big household name in competitive esports and people know that when zowie makes a monitor or 100 of it is going to be focused on being the best tool for competitive gaming that it can be there's no emphasis on things like color accuracy or hdr peak brightness things that other monitor companies might kind of add as features for zoe it's all about speed motion clarity and how this will best serve competitive gamers no offense to brands like viewsonic asus msi they also make very good gaming monitors but they just don't have the mind share of being the fastest and most competitive and evidently that is pretty important when it comes to you know holding on to your customers so people know that if you want to get really sweaty and q ranked for multiple hours per day and be just like those top players then you know zowie kind of design and market their monitors for exactly that the second part of this is that you know just as competitive gamers will turn down all of their graphic settings and kind of strip their game down to the absolute minimum you know zombie gaming monitors on the exterior kind of emanate exactly that they are a very plain and simple design there's no rgb there's no logos there's no heavy metal stands it's all about just being a tool for you to kind of game the best that you possibly can and the third part of this is because their monitors are actually pretty good aside from marketing mind share and also that this is what is typically used at esports events for a long time zowie has been the best choice if you want the fastest display for competitive games for a long time tn panels have been decently faster than ips zowie's backlight strobing is also some of the best tuned on the market and adjustability and the ergonomics of zowing monitors are simply unreal however if you are looking for the best competitive gaming display today in 2022 then there are some other and in my opinion better options that you should be looking at the first alternative is the viewsonic xg2431 so 1080p 240hz just like the zowie but this time with an ips panel and one which believe it or not actually beats the xavi in terms of motion clarity versus the 2546k the viewsonic has no inverse ghosting artifacts at all and even compared to the acer nitro 390 hertz it does have much less ghosting on the falling edge the most interesting part though is when we turn on backlight strobing which is you know historically zowie's strong point but if it wasn't beating the zauye before then it definitely is now the double image effect from the backlight strobing is extremely minimal on the viewsonic and the moving image is the clearest result that i've seen apart from an oled display the only downside of the viewsonic in my opinion is the brightness which you know if you have it in the backlight strobing mode it is a bit dim but if you typically game at night and only with a few lights on then i honestly don't think it'll be a problem you also do have extremely good performance with the backlight strobing mode disabled too so we're almost 200 cheaper than the xl2546k it's not only the more affordable option but i do think it is the higher performing option as well now is a bit of a tide recommendation with the viewsonic 240hz it's what i'm currently using at the moment and that's the acer nitro 390 hertz the motion clarity isn't as good there is a little bit more ghosting but the backlight strobing mode coupled with that monster 390hz refresh rate it does make this one of my top recommendations at the moment that combination makes this panel feel a bit more lifelike and fluid compared to 240 hertz although there is still definitely room for improvement for these ultra high refresh panels i'm definitely looking forward to better response times and better tuning for these backlight strobing modes and then i think we'll all pretty much arrive at the perfect competitive gaming display now aside from these monitors the next bump up in performance would be kind of jumping up to 1440p resolution and while the competitive scene has yet to transition to 1440p i think higher resolutions in general are starting to become a lot more widely adopted there are currently two 1440p options in fact that can be cranked right up to a whopping 270 hertz one from acer and one from asus i have actually reviewed the acer predator and found that both input lag was super low and the motion clarity was extremely competitive to the point where i would actually recommend using it without backlight strobing the only catch with these 1440p displays is that you will need a beefy and i mean really beefy system to render all of those frames even with an rtx 3090 i noticed way deeper frame drops compared to what i'm typically getting at 1080p while playing a game like apex although easier to run games like valerian and cs should be no problem so then with all of these new super fast panel options out there on the market any of which zowie could just join and then build it into a new monitor why haven't they done exactly that well zowie have repeatedly said online that they're not really satisfied with some of the current panels out there but they are supposedly working on something that they think is better i personally do think it is time to leave tn in the dust it is time to start embracing ips these newer panels with faster response times and maybe even higher resolution as well 1440p 360hz and 1080p 480 hertz panels are right around the corner and i'd like to think that's when we can finally see a bit of an update from zowie so i myself have been using the acer nitro 390 hertz uh pretty much ever since i reviewed it which is quite a few months now but today i decided to go back to the xl2546k just to kind of re-experience what that kind of feeling was and what my first impressions were and the first thing that i noticed was how much flatter that tn panel was compared to ips with an ips panel you typically get a bit more latitude when it comes to the colors so if you're someone who likes to play with a decent amount of color vibrance or even tweak the gamma settings for particular games you simply have a bit more color information to work with here think of it as taking a highly compressed image which would be the tn panel and then trying to tweak the colors and the contrast the colors will eventually start to blob together and give you this crunchy looking mess not to mention the contrast ratio on this panel is not the best to put it lightly so although speed is everything i understand that i generally do feel like i hit cleaner shots and have better visibility with a deeper looking more vibrant ips panel then when it came to re-experiencing 240hz with dayak it was pretty much everything that i remember and it felt really reassuring that this is a monitor that i've recommended over and over again for competitive games the image is just super super clear and even high refresh panels like the asa 390 hertz with backlight strobing they don't feel like a big jump in overall performance so zelda gaming monitors they're still good if you have a 2546 series of monitor in particular i would definitely recommend holding on to it even by today's standards it is a really good display for competitive gaming even though i can recommend the viewsonic 240hz and the acer nitro 390hz for people who are looking for a new display i wouldn't recommend it as an upgrade from azawi 2546. so i will leave those recommendations linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
