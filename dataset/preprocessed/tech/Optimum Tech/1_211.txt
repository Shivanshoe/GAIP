[Music] [Applause] [Music] this case here is one that I've been waiting to take a look at for quite some time because as far as I know this is the smallest case on the market that can fit a 360 ml radiator in fact it's the only ITX case that I know of to fit on her radiator that large and that's a pretty impressive spec because some of the more compact mid-tower cases out there like the NZXT h 510 they can't even fit 3 60 ml rods and here we have it in a case that's just 18 liters in volume now I won't spoil too much but if you do need a small form-factor case with some of the best CPU thermal performance that you can get this should definitely be one to consider but despite those very impressive thermals and radiator compatibility there are quite a few things that you should know before you build in this case so here it is the slugger SV 590 in enthusiast approach on the vertical small form-factor PC case and before we dive in I'll just say that I'm a big fan of this vertical orientation it means that your PC barely takes up any room on your desk or on the floor while still allowing for a ton of hardware on the inside having said that at 18 litres the SV 590 is one of the larger vertical cases that I've built in its four and a half litres larger than the NZXT h1 and it's also 12 millimeters taller than the NZXT h5 10 mid tower we'll talk more about that height in just a minute because it does raise some issues just know that this is a fairly tall case now so this is one of the more creative and cleaner designs that we've seen from Slugger who also makes the highly optimized servers and SM series cases this is the first time that I've seen these softly brushed and thinner panels from them I definitely do prefer it there are still some spots that do look a bit rough around the edges but for the most part this is the highest quality case that I've seen them produce one thing that does look a bit out of place here though is that chief power button which you could probably buy for around 50 cents at your local electronic shop I personally would have liked to see something a bit more premium to suit the rest of the design another part that looks a bit out of place is the platform or stand that the SV 590 is intended to be screwed onto and the reason for this is that the bottom panel is not completely flat so this is a problem with the design and manufacturing tolerances but it's a pretty lazy solution if I'm honest I guess they're also afraid of users just tipping over the case without it because it's so tall one way to fix this though is to use the adhesive feet that I believe are intended for the platform stand but just put these directly on the bottom of the case instead again this isn't the intended way to use this case but if you do it this way you do keep that nice small footprint and it's also completely stable as well in terms of ventilation the side panels are actually pretty blocked off in terms of cutout percentage most of the panel is metal but this does allow for a decent enough amount of air to pass through the case and get to the radiator the cutout pattern itself is a bit random but it's a nice change from the usual hole punch and personally I do think it suits the vertical design the rear panel on the other hand is extremely well ventilated though and that's exactly what we want to see for that big 360 ml radiator and that's one of the obvious reasons that the SV 590 is so tall but also the fact that you've got a fair bit of wiggle room here to play with for the tallest of 360 ml radiators to fit so if you're planning on using a 360 mil rag with a bit of extra height at the bottom and top it should still fit fine in the SV 590 in terms of thickness clearance you've got 60 millimeters in total to work with which basically means your standard a IO with a 30 mil thick radiator and 25 mil thick fans plus a bit of wiggle room for the test build I used the NZXT kraken X 73 and I did find that the pump leads were almost too short to reach and that they actually do push on the side panel a bit more than I'd like if you are looking for the best compatibility for this case I'd instead recommend going with the unbranded ASA tech 360 mm nao that you can find it directly on Sluggers website and of course don't bother with air cooling unless you're using something really low power and liquid cooling the GPU instead because cooler higher clearance here only tops out at 55 millimetres now apart from the massive 360 ml radiator compatibility you can also install three slot graphics cards up to 390 millimeters in length and 160 miles in height so basically the biggest graphics cards in existence will fit in this case no problem now although I did say I'm a big fan of this vertical layout there are a few things that bug me here on the sv 590 so for starters you've got this two and a half inch drive bracket which is included so you can store up to three two and a half inch drives no problem by default it is installed right between the motherboard and the power supply so right here but once you actually install a liquid caller and cables that is completely blocked and this is pretty much impossible to get in there you can't fit it because the you know the cables are blocking there so I think this could have been thought out a bit better I would have liked to see the power supply you know shifted up closer to the motherboard and then you know use that bottom area for something maybe you know a location for a d5 or DDC pump or maybe some additional storage also I would have loved to see the case completely flipped vertically to allow your power and IO cables to connect at the bottom like the NZXT h1 instead they have to be passed all the way up to the top of the case which I'm not a fan of at all obviously I'm exaggerating here a bit with this cable mess but with the ports after that high you will need to pay more attention to cable management preferably this is a case that is better suited under your desk on a side note seeing as this case has no top or rear i/o ports I'd also highly recommend using an external USB hub for much easier access otherwise you'd need to remove that top panel every single time you need to plug something in and the last consequence or oversight of this design is that if your motherboard uses a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antenna like the ones shown well you're going to have your wireless connection completely cut since the top panel completely blocks it yes you won't have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth with that top panel with that external antenna so for wireless connections in the SV 590 you'll need to use leads that go outside of the case all right so the ideal airflow strategy for the SV 590 is to have the radio defense pushing air onto the radiator and pulling it through the case like shown this mostly concerns GPU thermals and both helping to exhaust the hot air but also encouraging air to pass through those side panels but now let's go to the thermals and starting with the CPU they're really really good a 360 ml a IO is easily the strongest cooling solution in this chart and when paired with a decently ventilated case we get the best results so far the SV 590 can beat the N case m1 while using a fewer total fans in the system and at a lower fan rpm but of course is around five to six liters larger while the N case m1 is kind of portable at 12 and a half liters the SV 590 isn't portable at all but still this thermal result is very impressive on the note of GPU thermals seeing as that side panel ventilation is relatively blocked off it does lead to a warmer result than we'd like this also means that the GPU thermals benefit quite a lot by an increase in radiator fan speed we point we can tie the NZXT ch1 however do take note that the SV 590 can accommodate much larger graphics cards with more effective coolers not to mention a 360 ml custom lip if that's what you're into so while GPU thermals are on the warmer and here you can effectively counter that with a larger card with more effective cooling the card that we've used here for testing is just a 2 slot dual fan at UT X 1080 Ti so overall if you are really pushing the components that you're trying to squeeze into an ITX build this is definitely one to consider but it's not cheap this is sluggers most premium case yet at 279 dollars with free shipping in the US making it one of the most expensive cases that I've reviewed however one way to think of it is if you need a 360 ml radiator to cool your CPU and a 3 slot graphics card then you're probably using very high-end components this isn't a case for arisin 5 and an r/t X 2060 this is a case for a 39 50 X and a 20 80 TI so while the case is expensive it kind of lines up with the market of people who would be using this case and on the bright side although the pricing is quite steep the availability from Slugger has been known to be pretty good you know relative to other small form-factor case manufacturers so you can count on these being in stock pretty much most of the year personally I think the SV 590 is one of the better for sure SFF cases that I've reviewed and I know it's 18 liters is not technically it has small as it get but if you're after a desktop machine or you know something to put it under your desk with a small footprint this is a really really good option if you're pushing those really high-end components and calling it one of the better small form-factor cases that i've tested it's saying a lot because this case has a lot to improve on I think a v2 with some of the changes that I mentioned maybe some better ventilation for the side panels maybe you know shift that power supply up closer to the motherboard and use that space down the bottom for something else I think this could be a real killer case it definitely doesn't feel as refined or optimized to something like the n case m1 but I think in its current State is still a really good option for compact enthusiasts builds so if you are interested I will leave a link down below as always a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
