so when it comes to fans for your pc this one right here the noctua nfa 12 by 25 is the best 120 mil fan that i've tested other fans have come close like the arctic p12 and the gentle typhoon but this has stood to be the default option for uncompromising performance so what happens then when thermaltake roll up with the tough fan 12 which is essentially a reverse engineered nfa 12 with neutral colors and at a lower price so let's cut to the chase people have been waiting for a black version of the noctua nf a12 fan so thermaltake just went ahead and made one but i guess the question is is it any good and if it is good should we actually buy this like should we support a copycat product let's take a look [Music] now i'm not kidding when i say that these two fans are almost identical it's as if thermaltake just took a 3d scan or mold of the noctua nf a12s created a mould for their own fan and boom there's the design process of the tough fan 12. everything from the number of fan blades to the sweep of the blades themselves they're about as close as you could imagine and believe it or not thermaltake seem to have even used a similar polymer material to noctua's in-house sterox for the fan blades sterox is a liquid crystal polymer developed by noctua to have ideal characteristics for fan blade design allowing them to close the distance between the fan blades and the frame closer than any other fan and looking at thermaltake's own products page they're probably using something extremely similar at least they say they are it has the exact same textured look as noctua's sterox only it's a clean matte black as opposed to the iconic knock to a brown which a lot of people hate the only real difference here is that the thermaltake tough fan 12 doesn't have those three airflow grooves on each of the fan blades like the nfa 12 does but that is a pretty minor difference now before we take a look at the thermal performance and the differences in the amount of cooling that these fans can provide let's first just take a look at the amount of noise that each of them creates at certain speeds so here we're measuring noise 25 centimeters and 45 degrees from an open test bench and a pair of fans mounted to a 240mm liquid all-in-one cooler so let's plot the noctua nfa 12x25 first in orange and it's the same noise verse fan speed profile that we're pretty familiar with ramping the fan speed on the nfa 12s up to 1000 rpm doesn't generate much more noise than 500 rpm in a normal room setup even up to 1250 or 1500 rpm these fans will be incredibly quiet once inside a pc then there's diminishing returns at 1750 and 2000 rpm with much larger gains in noise versus rpm but now let's plot the tough then 12 and funnily enough they're pretty much identical it's really surprising because this is the closest noise performance that i've seen any fan get to the noctua nfa12s but at the same time it's not really that surprising given that they're almost identical in design the tough fan 12s that i have max out at rpm so there's no comparison here at 2000 rpm the only real difference between the two is at around 1000 rpm here i found the tough fan 12 to have a bit more motor noise and vibration compared to the nf a12 here's an idea of what that sounds like and then here's a comparison between the two at 1000 rpm and 1500 rpm where at a normal distance they pretty much sound identical so as for noise the airflow noise and pitch that these fans create is about as close as it gets but the noctua nfe 12x25 does have a slightly quieter motor and also less vibration this can actually be felt just by holding the fan frame and spinning the blades the noctuas have absolutely zero vibration and you can't feel anything in the frame at all but you can at least feel it on the top fan 12s but now let's take a look at the cooling difference between them so at 1750 rpm our 10 900k which we've got overclocked to 5.1 gigahertz at 1.28 volts averages out to 71.9 c when we're using the noctuas but a slightly warmer 73.8 when we're using the thermaltake tough n12s dropping the fan speed to just 1000 rpm and it's about the same difference between them this time just two and a half degrees c separates them towards the end of the render as the radiator and liquid temperature really starts to heat up to be honest i'm not really sure what the difference would be coming from here since the fan blade design is pretty much identical but regardless everything has been extremely closely monitored here and this was the difference that was measured so with all of that in mind the thermaltake tough n12 is actually a pretty damn good fan especially when you consider that it's going to be quite a bit cheaper than the noctuas but i just can't get past the fact that this is just an exact copy of the noctua nfa 12s with no real creativity or innovation beyond that so from a reviewer's perspective i really despise that about thermaltake and i understand that there are only so many ways that you can design a fan but take a look at what arctic have done with the p12 super different design but also about even with noctures apart from the slightly louder motor but then from a consumer's perspective i can also see how some people wouldn't really care they're just pc fans at the end of the day and the fact that they exist gives you another high performance option especially another option which isn't brown but in saying that and to be totally fair to knock to it these are still the best 120mm fan that i've tested the motor noise and the low vibration at lower rpms is what still gives these the edge in my opinion not to mention that cooling performance was a couple of degrees better in my testing at least but i would really love to know what you think about this whole situation and whether you might pick up the thermal take tough fan 12 simply because they're a black version of these or a cheaper version let me know down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
