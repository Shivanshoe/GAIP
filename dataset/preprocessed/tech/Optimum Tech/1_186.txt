last year cooler master released the h 100 and straight up it was one of the worst cases that I have ever reviewed it was an incredibly lazy ITX design with terrible thermals and hardware compatibility this on the other hand is the NR 200 another cooler master ITX case but significantly better than the 8 100 that we saw last year finally we're seeing more of the big case manufacturers take a step into actually space optimized cases there is a lot to talk about here for the NR 200 and I think it's going to surprise a lot of you so let's take a look [Music] usually the price is the last thing that I mentioned for reviews but here I think it's an appropriate Kickstarter for the NR 200 which starts at just $60 us they're also offering a variant which includes a tempered glass side panel a short riser cable for vertical GPUs and also an extra 120mm fan for a $30 premium that place is the NR 200 as clearly a budget small form-factor case and it's around one hundred and fifty dollars cheaper than the N case M one and I think it's clear that the NR 200 was kind of born out of that exact frustration from those wanting to build in cases like the N K someone August s one but maybe couldn't because of the premium price tag or just plain lack of availability that frustration opens up an opportunity for a case like this and the NZXT h1 to exist and be very successful and Coolermaster have actually been working on this case for quite some time I know it looks like this quick design that just came out of nowhere but they did actually send me a prototype towards the end of late last year just to get some feedback on kind of their direction and whether I thought this was a good move from them and my only feedback to them at that point was yes just yes you should definitely make this case and when you see the thermal performance in just a few minutes you will see exactly why so I have been keeping my lips are fairly sealed half until this point really the only feedback that I gave them was look I think the main feedback that the community is going to give you is that it's a bit big you know it is a bit bigger than the N case M 118 litres versus you know twelve and a half to 13 liters on the end case but it does make sense when you see the hardware compatibility and extra stuff that you can put in the NR 200 so this leads me into the exterior design of the NR 200 which is clearly inspired by those premium small form-factor cases from the front the NR 200 does look like a scaled up ghost s1 and then from the other side and also on the interior it looks like an Excel version of the N case m1 overall I think the NR 200 looks pretty clean and honestly I think it's what a lot of users have been asking for a reasonably priced case with soul hardware compatibility under 20 leaders that also has a clean design the top panel is easily one of the design highlights of the NR 200 in my opinion with the entire surface consisting of a super breathable fine mesh you can actually mount to 120 more fans directly underneath here and with the NR 200 P those will be included these have a nice Poulos installation here as well which I thought was pretty neat the two side panels are ventilated too by default but like I said you do have the option for that tempered glass if you opt for the NR 200 P the quality of the TG panel is actually not bad it has a light tint with blacked-out borders and a completely toolless installation the side panels also use the same push pin mechanism to attach just like the N case m1 but with a hinge at the bottom of course tempered glass is not the ideal option at all if you're looking to maximize thermal and noise performance but if you're looking to do an air cold build in this case or even a custom loop I can see that tempered glass panel being fairly popular now at 18 meters in volume the NR 200 is getting close to the limit of what we define as a small form-factor case which would typically say is under 20 liters this makes it around 40 percent larger than the N case m1 and even slightly larger than the streak um da - so portability in my opinion is realistically out of the question for this one I'd definitely reserved the NR 200 for a desktop only build that extra volume though does start to make sense when we take a look at hardware compatibility and starting with the side mounted radiator you can install up to a 280 mm a i/o here the one that I've got installed in there is the NZXT crack in egg 62 something to note is that the crack and X 62 here is really pushing the limits of what you can squeeze in here by no means was it a tight fit but I do bet that there are 218 more rats out there that won't fit in the NR 200 so just make sure you do your research if you are looking to install a 280 ml area in this case if you're looking to air-cool fairly large CPU coolers up to 158 millimeters in height are compatible here that means that the Noctua NHD 15 is just 2 millimeter - at all the be quiet dark rock four is one millimeter too tall and the Noctua Nhu 12-8 just fits three slot graphics cards up to 330 millimeters in length and 156 mils in height including the power connectors will fit in the NR 200 so pretty much the biggest graphics cards on the market now if you're interested in buying this to do a custom loop although it is a budget case it does make sense somewhat here because you can mount either a DD C or D 5 pump on the power supply cover or at the very front of the case both of those locations do have the correct mounting for either of those pumps so for the NR 200 the optimal configuration for calling would look something like this - 120mm fans underneath the graphics card a 280 ml a IO for the CPU and two fans mounted at the very top of the case you can also mount a 92 mph an at the rear of the case they do include one but at that point you have seven total fans in the system so honestly I don't think that fan is necessary for a liquid-cooled setup like this now if you do go with the NR 200 P there is a different way to use this case and that's with a vertical GPU and a bottom mounted radiator in my opinion though this configuration should be avoided if you're considering performance hardware compatibility does take quite the hit and the graphics card and radiator exhaust air flow will be opposing each other when it comes to building in the NR 200 it just feels like a hit bigger roomier and case m1 and what that means is that it's fairly easy and intuitive the hardest part though is cable management the test book that I have here has six fans in total which required three fan splitters so you'll want to spend a bit of extra time wrapping things up with a few zip ties now for thermal and noise testing I have completely revamped the testing methodology for this review and have begun retesting most of the cases that you've probably seen in previous videos so there aren't a ton of cases in the following charts but I've tried to include the couple that matter most in comparison to the NR 200 so for the new testing I had the time to test the N case m1 the street comm da - the NZXT h1 and of course the cool master NR 200 this chart shows CPU thermals in blender after 25 minutes with Intel's 10 core 10 900k at 5 gigahertz in our previous CPU thermal benchmarks the NK someone held the lead for quite a long time but with more realistic fan speeds this time around that leaves some room for the NR 200 to take the lead with its bigger cooler after all the NR 200 is around 40% larger in volume has a 280 ml rad over the m12 240 and probably most importantly an additional two 120mm fans at the top of the case to exhaust the hot air from the interior it can beat the NK sm1 by around 3 degrees C here whilst operating a bit quieter as well but maybe a better comparison is against Street comms da - which is a very similar volume and when using the same cooler at 1,100 rpm there's around a 6 degrees C difference I'll also note that this was running the NR 200 with the top and bottom fans set to just 900 rpm which was fairly quiet now I also measured the motherboard of erm thermals here during the same test and here we can see another benefit of those top mounted fans in the NR 200 just to provide some context here the gigabyte z4 90 ultra even at 70 C you're not going to see any issues but cooler is better especially if you plan on running a fairly aggressive overclock for the new GPU thermal testing the graphics card fan speed has been locked so that way we can see the true thermal difference between each case with zero influence from the ambient room temperature that means that if the card starts approaching harder than usual temperatures it doesn't have the chance to order regulate itself ramp the fans up and appear cooler than it actually is for testing this means we get to see a much larger thermal difference between these cases than before so this is with the RT X 2070 super founders Edition running in each case for a 25 minute 100% load loop and again the NR 200 shows us a very impressive result although it is mildly louder than the end case m1 43.2 DBA versus 42.2 it does run 5 C cooler result by comparison the da two runs six degrees C warmer than the N K someone with a mildly quieter operation and as a consequence of having no fans in the GPU chamber and also glass the NZXT th one gets pretty hot to get reasonable thermals out of the N th th one you will need to run a faster GPU fan speed leaving you with a slightly louder gaming experience so on the surface the coolermaster NR 200 looks like an Excel version of the N case M one especially when you take a look at the hardware layout on the interior the thermal performance also reflects this does beat the M one by a decent margin as well just as it should with a larger cooler and more fans except it's not an n case on one excel because it's $60 us which makes it a really easy recommendation for anyone looking for a flexible relatively space optimized ITX case under 20 liters for a desktop gaming system or workstation I would definitely consider this a case that your future systems can grow into with support for big graphics cards and plenty of CPU calling so definitely an easy recommendation from me and I think this is definitely going to be one of those ITX cases that stays at the top of the thermal charts for quite some time if you are interested you can find it linked down below and hopefully it's in stock by the time this video goes up and of course we will be doing some more content on this case we'll be testing different CPU coolers will test the alternate layout and of course the tempered glass side panel as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one
