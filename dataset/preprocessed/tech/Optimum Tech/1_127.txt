first off welcome to 2021 hope you all had a great new year and i want to kick things off here with current look at my gaming and editing setup and all the gear that i'm currently using moving into the new year although we are still at the same desk and studio setup almost all of the gear and peripherals i'm using have changed different monitors different pc and the audio setup has changed completely as well so before we jump into more pc builds and reviews i wanted to make a single video talking about all the stuff that i'm currently using so let's take a look [Applause] so let's start off with the parts of this setup that haven't changed since my last update about a year ago but we'll still go over those things for those of you who haven't seen the setup before so the desk is the ikea darsen in black and it's a great desk built really well in fact there are no scratches or marks on this even after a year's use i really love the industrial look of this desk it almost looks like it should be in a workshop with those big heavy duty metal struts and it also comes in an electric sit-stand model if you prefer that you've also got a very useful cable management net underneath the desk which as you can see i've got fully packed next to that is the ikea alex draw unit which is pretty much essential for stashing away even more clutter that i've got it's pretty straightforward and the gray matches the desk quite nicely also matching is the chair which is the ikea aleph gel which is suitably black and grey i've been using this one for around two years now and personally find it really comfortable however this chair doesn't have lower back support or a headrest so if those are things that you're after you might want to give this one a pass i try and sit fairly upright though and i find that this chair accommodates that posture quite well now for the keyboard i for the most part have shared this in a previous video it's a custom 60 build using the tofu aluminium case from kbd fans a dz60 pcb and the telios linear switches but one thing i have recently changed are the keycaps these are the blank black keycaps from enjoypbt and i first did this as a bit of an experiment right not really expecting to actually like the blank keycaps but more just for the aesthetic and the design however the more i use these blank keycaps the more i actually began to really like them firstly i just love the look that this gives the keyboard overall it's super clean and the feel of the keycaps themselves is a really nice texture that doesn't get greasy or that shine over time that you see from extended use this also means that you don't have to worry about crooked legends or text on the keycaps which is a pretty common thing and i'll just say that as someone who did use an off-the-shelf a gaming keyboard for quite a long time the corsair k65 specifically moving to a fully custom build like this with you know clip stabilizers and lube switches it really does make your gaming and typing experience so much better personally i don't think it makes you better at gaming or even a faster typer necessarily but the experience the interaction with gaming and your day-to-day use is just so much more pleasant so i'm not in a rush to replace this build at all but i'm definitely looking forward to doing at least a couple more fully custom mechanical keyboard builds this year now of course lighting is a big part of any desk setup especially a gaming setup where you're spending a lot of time looking at a very bright screen for hours on end these led light tubes are ones i get asked about all the time i did in fact steal these from dave 2d so big shout out to him these are from ikea they're called the ikea spans and of course i will leave these linked down below but these i can highly highly recommend they're usb powered they give off a nice soft warm glow and i just have them off the side to my desk to add a bit more ambient light to my setup highly recommend these and pretty affordable as well just a bit hard to find then behind the monitor i have a lifx smart led bulb most of you are pretty familiar with what this is and there are many different brands and variations of this most of the time i just have it set to a color temperature of around 6000 kelvin but you can also do pretty much any color that you can imagine if you really want to switch things up a bit if you don't currently have any monitor backlighting for your own setup it is probably one of the first things that i'd recommend it makes staring at a screen all day a lot more comfortable now my audio setup is something that i have made some big upgrades to last year and honestly it all starts with this this is the new audio interface that i've been using it's called the evo 4 from a company called audient now i have done a full video breaking this down and how it works but it's a pretty basic and minimal audio interface two xlr mic ports at the rear a headphone jack at the front as well as a nice big single dial at the top that controls your microphone gain your headphone volume and also the balance of your microphone and system audio that you hear through your headphones i personally find that last one very useful when gaming is that way i can monitor my own voice in real time alongside the game audio speaking of which the microphone that i'm using is totally overkill for what i mostly use it for which is gaming but it's also really useful for if i want to do voiceovers or any kind of recording stuff at my desk now it's four hundred dollars it's the shure sm7b so fairly expensive microphone for what i use it for but it's very excellent when it comes to noise rejection this is not a noise treated room it can get quite echoey in here and the sm7b does a really good job at rejecting all of that noise i've also got this attached to the rode psa1 boom arm which has worked quite well for what i needed to do which is basically just hiding it behind my monitor when i'm not using it then for the headphones i'm still using the mastdrop and sennheiser hd58x's picked these up mid last year and i've been super happy with them don't plan on replacing these anytime soon nice lightweight open design can highly recommend these for both gaming and editing these also have what i'd call a fairly neutral sound profile but without a doubt my favorite part of this entire desk setup is this build right here it's a full custom loop inside the very compact encase m1 using the 12 core ryzen 5900x and an rtx 3090 and alongside the two 240mm radiators packed in there i'm getting some really good thermal and noise performance considering the form factor not only that but the outright performance of this system is just insane with a 5900x and a 3090 this is pretty much the fastest gaming configuration that you can build today really appreciate the small footprint of this build as well as most of you know that's kind of what i lean towards for my own builds and this means that it can also double as a gaming machine for my living room as it easily fits behind my tv so i will leave a couple of videos linked down below outlining how i got all this set up and the thermal performance that you can expect but simply put this has just been an absolute joy to use on a daily basis and it's definitely what i plan on using moving forward in this year now i'm currently switching between two different monitors but the one that spends the most time on my desk is this one right here it's the lg 27 gn 950 4k 27 inches ips with a beautifully color accurate panel and a recent firmware update actually pushed this thing up to 160 hertz and i think i've raved about this display in enough previous videos so we'll skip all of that here but the bottom line is that this is an absolute pleasure to work with i use it for both editing and 4k gaming because with specs like that it really is the best of both worlds just keep in mind that gaming at 4k will require a fairly beefy gpu video and photo editing though on a native 4k panel has been great as well plenty of pixel real estate available and i do prefer this over ultrawide monitors that i've used in the past for that as well as many of you know though i still really enjoy competitive first-person shooters games like valerian and apex and for those games i do prefer to play on the 1080p asus pg259qn which has a refresh rate of up to 360 hertz i've done a full review on both of these monitors and i've talked about them quite a bit in previous videos so if you'd like to know more about them i will leave those videos linked down below current laptop of choice is the 2019 16 inch macbook pro configured with a 6 core cpu and a radeon 5300m honestly i've barely done any on-the-go video editing this past year with this device which is a bit of a shame and something that i'm really hoping to change in 2021 most of the use that this ends up seeing is scripting and planning for videos and then occasionally photoshop and lightroom the gaming mouse that i'm using is one that i recently reviewed and have been having an absolute blast with over the new year break and that's the logitech g pro x super light 60 grams wireless over a week's worth of battery on a single charge reasonably fast glide and excellent build quality since testing this out honestly i just want to play first person shooters all the time this gets me really excited to game i find it super comfortable and can highly recommend it if you haven't seen the full review where i compare this to the glorious model o wireless and the razer viper ultimate i will leave that linked down below now mouse pads are not something that i usually talk about or review but the more i try different ones the more i can appreciate how they can impact your gameplay movement and accuracy so at the moment i'm using the glorious elements fire pad which has a medium glide with some decent control and stopping power and i found that to be pretty much perfect for me alongside the g pro x super light i've also found that this pad stays super clean and doesn't collect anywhere near as much dust or skin cells as other cloth pads that i've used previously now storage and backup is something that i've always been admittedly pretty lazy with but for now i've been kind of backing up everything on this which is simply a 40 terabyte external hard drive b which sits under my desk it's completely local so not a nas or a server or anything like that but for me that's all i really need right now and i will mention that i don't back up and save absolutely everything because i shoot my videos in 6k raw so a typical video project ends up being around 300 to 400 gigabytes at the moment i'm basically just saving the final video export which is what you guys watch online and then a handful of b-roll clips that i might find useful for future video projects so there it is all of the tech and the peripherals i'm using moving into the new year and hopefully this gave you some inspiration for your own desk setup or at least answer some questions that you might have had of course we never know what new tech will come out this year so some of this stuff is bound to change but for now i'm feeling really comfortable and productive with this setup so as always i'll try and link what i can down below in the description a huge thanks for watching and i'll see you all in the next one
