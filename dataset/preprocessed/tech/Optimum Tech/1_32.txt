so 2021 was actually a pretty good year for gaming mice all things considered i mean we had a ton of new releases lots of really interesting options but today i want to outline what i think are currently the top five and we're specifically going to be talking about mice which are going to allow you to aim in first person shooters the best seeing as that's where gaming mouse choice is really important and stuff like the shape the weight the wireless implementation how good the cable is and the input lag that's where that stuff really matters the most so let's just dive right in uh number five is one which i deliberated on for quite a while because there are just so many good options out there today but i'm actually giving this one to an old favorite the endgame gear xm1 this specific model here i did actually main for quite a while this is the original xm one which i've modded with a paracord cable and some core pads on the bottom but they have since brought out a more updated model called the xm1r this is actually the only mouse in this entire top five list with a cable and i think that's saying a lot shape wise this is still one of the best gaming mice out there in my opinion specifically for claw grip it's just a very exaggerated and well-formed shape that fits really nice in the hand all of the tapers and the grooves for example they just feel like they're in the perfect spots and the really low main mouse buttons they just give you a really direct pointing and aiming experience the input lag results are also pretty respectable here when we take a look at both the main clicks and the sensor not topping the charts here but a couple of milliseconds off the top performers that's not bad at all especially from a much smaller company the weight here comes in at about 70 grams the updated model comes with a bmw 3370 sensor and klgm 8.0 switches it's currently going for about 70 dollars on amazon and i think that's a really solid deal for one of the best shaped mice in existence the number four spot goes to a mouse which i have not done a full review on yet but i have been using it in the background here and there and testing it out and that is the pwnage ultra custom sim 2. uh really big fan of this mouse you can kind of think of it as a viper mini wireless because it is pretty much one to one to that mouse shape now i did raise concerns when it came to the original larger pwnage sim wireless mainly when it came to the click input lag and also the software which was kind of busted but both of those issues have been fixed on the sim 2. click input lag is now where it should be and there's now a completely new software which actually works you have the option here of a few different colors too which is pretty cool but more importantly a honeycomb shell or a completely solid shell personally speaking i do prefer the completely solid shell look and feel compared to having a bunch of holes in the mouse just to save a few grams if you do prefer honeycomb though i would at least recommend getting the sides completely solid and not honeycomb it just makes the mouse a lot nicer to grip the main switches here are the klgm 8.0 which feel pretty good the scroll wheel is very light and very chunky perfect for tap strafing and bunny hopping and overall it is actually a very well built mouse but yeah overall the feel of the mouse the performance in game this feels every bit like a top gaming mouse just like it should be just coming from a smaller lesser known brand i'm personally a big fan of the viper mini shape and hey if you like the viper mini as well but you'd rather something that's wireless and you don't mind paying a bit more the sim 2 is what i would recommend so pony ultra custom sim 2 that's going to be our number 4 spot but its days are fairly numbered i would say as soon as razer comes out with a viper mini wireless that is probably what i'm gonna recommend instead they are the original creators of the shape after all so it feels more sensible to recommend that instead and i think performance wise that might be the better offering but until that mouse exists the pony ultra custom sim 2 is definitely number four really really solid offering and like i said i almost made this but it is a little bit too small for my hands at the number three spot i'm kind of cheating on putting two mice in the one spot but they are pretty much the same thing just slightly different sizes and that is the glorious model d and d minus wireless so when it comes to an ergonomic lightweight wireless mouse i really don't think you can go wrong with either of these two options so yeah at the moment these are what i would consider the top ergonomic gaming mice are both coming in at around the 70 gram mark both feel super comfy in the hands great buttons great scroll wheel and the pricing is pretty solid as well here at about 80 now ergonomic mice are not something that i'm usually a big fan of they usually feel very oversized heavy and generally just like you're holding an oversized brick these two though feel really nice to use even coming from the best of the best they're lightweight they're balanced they're wireless if i was after an ergonomic gaming mouse there's probably not much more that i'd be after at the number two spot we have the newest mouse on this list which is the logitech and shroud g303 which i am a big big fan of i've been using this as my main ever since i reviewed it a couple of weeks ago and although the shape at first was a bit uncomfortable for me this is what i would happily call my main moving forward in fact the shape here is so good i would say that if you have medium to large hands and you use a claw grip this is just the mouse to get i mean it might feel weird at first like it did for me but give it a couple weeks and it'll make it going to anything else incredibly hard because with the g303 you just feel so anchored and just well locked in you don't get that from any other mouse on this list maybe the xm1 which kind of does feel fairly similar in terms of like the contact points and the reference points but the shroud g303 it is just really something else completely and it really just gets better from there i mean even input lag wise it is right at the top of the chart with the g pro super light making it the fastest mechanical switch mouse that i've tested battery life is also just insane the buttons feel absolutely incredible too super light and crispy will not be swapping these out and generally just really growing to like this mouse the more that i use it every single day now if the shape wasn't so polarizing then this would easily be rank 1 but at the same time that's what makes the new g303 so good it's that it has that intention behind grip style and shape and you know kind of optimizing for a certain group of users when it comes to grip style and hand size and hey if that's you so medium to large hands claw grip definitely give this thing a shot the top gaming mouse on this list though is probably a surprise to no one and that is the logitech g pro x super light now this is the most used mouse when it comes to you know competitive gamers and what they're using for games like valor and apex etc and it is really crazy that even a year after its release no other company has managed to you know match logitech and what they've done here that is a completely you know medium sized 60 gram solid shell no cutouts at all that is perfectly balanced combine that with a neutral you know medium-sized shape that like 90 percent of people can get comfortable with that pretty much sums up why the logitech g pro super light is rank one on this list and why so many people love it the only thing that i'll note is that the scroll wheel on both of my copies did start to show a bit of age over time and gradually just ended up not sounding that great functionally they are fine but hopefully this is something that logitech can fix in the future so that concludes my top 5 list but i also want to give some honorable mentions here firstly i want to give a shout out to razer and what they're doing and overall just how much they've improved their mouse game recently experimenting with an 8 000 hertz polling rate for example and implementing optical switches that stuff does actually make a measurable difference and technically speaking i think razer's mice are right up there at the top shape-wise though i'm not really a fan of the viper shape i just find it really flat and not giving much support especially when it comes to claw grip in terms of the button feel and the build quality as well i do think logitech are a bit further ahead in that department i'm a big fan of the optical switches when it comes to performance but for now i don't feel that they're as light and crispy as a lot of the other mechanical switches that are out there also if you are after a small budget gaming mouse for like 30 dollars i don't think the razer viper mini is beatable it really is king there and it's 100 worth an honorable mention if you're looking for something small and cheap next honorable mention goes to the extra fight mz1 which is a collaboration between extra fire and rocket jump ninja the highlight for me here are the super contoured and low buttons which just feel so so nice to use with those dialed in klgm 8.0 switches the reason it's not in the top five list is one the shape is a little bit polarizing some people don't really like this shape and my first copy had a really stiff scroll wheel so that was a bit unfortunate i think the quality control could be improved here and i do personally find the cable as well to be pretty noticeable otherwise it's still a really epic mouse and i do think especially the aim enthusiast crowd will really love playing with this thing and i'm personally really looking forward to the possibility of a wireless version as well i'll also give a quick mention to the g305 as well given how good the super light and the new g303 are it would be a bit of a crime not to mention this as well seeing as it is under 50 and shares a lot in common it's not as premium as those newer offerings the coding is not as grippy the glides are pretty rough out of the box but performance wise it is still really really solid the arochi v2 is a really nice option as well but you know looking back at it i do think it might be a bit too small for most people the final mention goes to the final mouse starlight 12. i did manage to secure a pre-order for the starlight 12 phantom but i'm yet to receive it and test it out in terms of the specs though and you know what people have to say about it it does look like a very competitive top tier mouse just a real shame that they can't make enough of them so those are the top five aimbot gaming mice of 2021 and honestly a pretty hard list to put together there are a ton of really good options out there at the moment but i really don't think you can go wrong with any of the mice on this list and also consider those honorable mentions they are quite good too uh if you are interested i will have these linked down below as always a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
