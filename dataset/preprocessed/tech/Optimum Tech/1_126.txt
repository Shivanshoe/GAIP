so one of the most exciting parts about a new generation of gpu is not only the outright performance or the performance per dollar that you might see but it's the performance per watt that i find as equally exciting and that's what allows gpus like this to exist at just 202 mils in length and 111 mils in height the evga xc3060 ti is the smallest 30 series card that you can currently buy and that does actually unlock some new build opportunities for some small form factor cases so that's exactly what we're going to be talking about today and what kind of opportunities this opens up as well as what kind of cooling and performance you can expect from a compact cooler design like this so first off why would you even want a graphics card this small in the first place well to be honest most of you probably shouldn't the most sensible approach is to buy a graphics card with the most effective cooler design that fits both your budget and the case that you're putting it in and with most itx cases coming out now and in the future supporting larger cards cooler designs like this are becoming a lot less relevant however there are still a handful of supremely small cases that don't fit those larger cards for example this is now the fastest graphics card to fit in the legendary skyreach 4 mini a case that is just 5 liters in total volume so if you needed an excuse to build a console sized gaming beast this is it and i'm actually planning a full build with this case and graphics card coming out soon so do hit that subscribe button if you haven't already this is also now the fastest gpu option to fit in intel's noc9 extreme which also comes in at around 5 liters in volume and can easily fit in a backpack that's a system that was previously limited to an rtx 2070 which the 3060 ti is a noticeable step up from in fact when it comes to gaming the 3060 ti is around 20 to 25 faster on average than the 2070 depending on the title and the resolution now driving comfortable frame rates at 1440p and possibly even 4k if you don't mind optimizing your settings around medium not to mention that the 360 ti is 100 cheaper at launch than the 2070 and the performance gained in 3d apps such as blender is life-changing to say the least so let's see if this thing is actually any good small cars like this are often associated with being the budget tier but we're still getting a reasonable cooler design here with a big copper coil plate for the gpu along with four heat pipes there's also a metal back plate here to serve as some additional heat dissipation although there's only one thermal pad here and that's for the gpu something that's interesting here is that there are in fact cutouts in the pcb to allow for a partially flow through airflow design similar to the founder's edition but not to the same extent most of the exhaust airflow and hot air from the heatsink is going to be sent towards the front of the card near the logo and then back towards the pcie slot as for power there's just a single 8-pin power connector which should be fine for the 200 watt tdp but they did actually make enough room in the heatsink for two 8-pin power connectors meaning that we might actually see this cooler design make its way to future gpus also if you're interested in de-shrouding this card and implementing your own cooling solution for example a pair of 92 mil fans from noctua this card is very easy to do that with basically there's just four screws that hold the shroud onto the heatsink then the screws for the fans there are the usual metal tabs here for cable management which might interfere so just be aware of those now in terms of performance it's about what you'd expect for a card this size actually it did a bit better than i expected personally given the 200 watt tdp cooler designs of this size are usually around the 175 watt range against the founders edition which is larger and has a more exposed heatsink the evga xc ran 5 degrees cooler but with a noticeably faster fan speed normalizing the fan speed between the two i'd say you'd get very similar thermal performance although i'd say that the fans on the founders edition are a fair bit quieter of course though the advantage of the more compact xc card is that it can fit into some systems where the fe cannot as for clock speeds this mostly comes down to how the v bios has been configured by the card vendor and being a typically bottom tier card as these compact cooler designs are the xc runs at a boost of around 1850 megahertz it is power limited out of the box at a 200 watt tdp which it consistently hits so there's a bit of room in the tank there if you really do want to push things a little bit faster just by raising that power limit a little bit more so it's really great to see the epic performance of the 30 series gpus you know make it down to a more compact form factor for those who need it you know up until now we've just been seeing huge dual fan and triple fan designs which you know don't exactly fit in cases like that so for most of you i do recommend going for the biggest graphics card and gpu that will fit into your budget and the case that you're putting it in but for some people this is that some users do require or just prefer extreme portability when it comes to their own pc and this card gives those users a potentially big upgrade exceeding rtx 2080 performance in this form factor that's pretty insane and as i mentioned i am planning a pretty exciting build using this card in the skyreach 4 mini so do stay tuned for that as always i will have these linked down below for those interested a huge thanks for watching and i will see you all in the next one
