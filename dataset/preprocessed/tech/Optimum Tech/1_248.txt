[Music] today we're building our own all-in-one liquid caller a completely modular cooling system that can be changed depending on your preferences and cooling requirements now off-the-shelf all-in-one coolers have changed the way that we build custom pcs with premium cooling performance while also being quite easy to install but what if the one that you wanted doesn't actually exist like one with a massive 420 ml radiator or bomb with longer tubing for a bigger case for example doesn't make sense to build something yourself from a financial standpoint or a performance standpoint well that's what we're looking at today surprisingly building your own liquid air i/o cooler like this is a lot easier than you probably think and it could make sense depending on your build the majority of all-in-one liquid coolers come with radiators in the 120 240 280 or 360 ml sizes and are between 27 and 30 mils in thickness most of them are made from aluminium which is not the best conductor of heat but it is a cost-effective solution for most users these lengths thickness and material constraints are absolutely fine still offering some respect for performance but what if you have a mid tower case with a lot more radiator clearance than your typical all-in-one cooler can fill and on the flipside what if somehow you don't have enough clearance and what you need is a radiator that's a lot thinner these are some use cases where building your own liquid AIO setup like this is an easy solution but you will pay quite a bit for it more on that in just a second first let's take a look at some of the hardware that you don't need to know about if you're planning on building something like this and let's start with Alfa calls LT solar pump lock this is the main piece of hardware that makes this entire project possible and contrary to the pump locks that you'll find on normal a iOS this one uses common G 1/4 ports and also has a convenient fill port it can also be opened up easily if you ever feel the need to clean it but if you use the correct coolant that's not really going to be an issue I'm actually using this same pump block to power the 240 ml custom loop in my gaming and editing machine so it's more than fine for a custom loop if you ever need to expand your cooling down the road and that's another benefit of using an expandable solution like this if you want to add a GPU block to the lip eventually that's something that'll be quite easy to do and not something that you can do with an off-the-shelf aio another reason you might want to build your own all-in-one liquid cooler comes down to the tube length or maybe tube style with khamenei iOS you're limited to black tubing usually sleeved around 40 centimeters in length there are some cases though where this just isn't long enough and lastly there is the benefit that if you do upsize or downsize your case you won't have to buy an entirely new cooler just swap to a new radiator that's compatible with that case now one reason you might not want to do this is because it's not cost-effective at all unless you're going with an enthusiast calling setup or you require an odd sized radiator that you can't get off the shelf or the longer tubing or the potential expandability benefits of building something like this you really should just stick to regular all-in-one coolers for example a decent 360 mm AIO will set you back around 150 dollars u.s. but building an enthusiast DIY version with Noctua fans a thicker radiator and custom tubing do you expect to spend around double that even choosing more conservative parts let's say a slimmer 360 ml radiator and let's say cheaper fans as well that will bring the cost down quite a bit but it'll still be significantly more expensive than an off-the-shelf 360 ml a i/o so a more conservative a DIY setup is just not going to be worth it from a value standpoint unless you can somehow leverage the expandability benefits down the road so the cooler that we're building today is a bit more of a premium solution it uses a full copper 360 radiator that 40 mils thick three knock to our nfa twelve by twenty five fans premium compression fittings from Alfa call some white soft tubing from primo chill alpha calls LT solar pump block and some distilled water mixed with a clear concentrate : so starting off the first step is to cut the tubing the correct length mine here are 40 centimetres which is a good standard but again this is completely up to you and your case size next up are the fittings for soft tubing and want to go for compression fittings I've used two standard compression fittings on the radiator and then to 90 degree rotary fittings for the CPU pump block now for the coolant you'll generally want to avoid opaque solutions if your goal is reliability and longevity last thing that you want is your CPU pump block clogging up with solid additives so distilled water mixed with a clear coolant premix is going to be your best fit and to save you a ton of time filling the liquid color at the end we're going to start by filling up the radiator pretty much right to the brim next go ahead and install your tubing double checking that the fittings are tightened right up both on the radiator side and the pump lock now comes the more difficult part but still pretty straightforward and that's filling up the rest of the loop and getting all of the area to do this you'll want to open the fill port on the pump lock while it's elevated and switch between pouring the water in and getting the trapped air out removing the air is the trickiest part but it just requires a bit of patience you can pinch the tubing to force the air bubbles out and you can also move the pump lock up and down both work quite well [Music] once you can no longer remove any air from the loop you'll want to actually turn the pump on with the port open as there's definitely still some air trapped in there it's a good idea to use some fan extensions so that you can create some distance to whatever you're plugging it into definitely don't want to spill excess coolant on a new build I would allow at least ten minutes for this part pouring small amounts of coolant in to replace the air and turning the pump on and off to release any air that might be trapped after that close the port and your custom liquid AIO is complete again this project is completely modular except for the pump lock and that's the funnest part in my opinion especially when you start to consider the possibilities for huge high performance radiators that you just can't get in the form of an off-the-shelf liquid all-in-one cooler I did some quick thermal testing on a ninety nine hundred K overclock to five gigahertz at one point to eight volts and thermals there seemed to be right where we expect for a high-performance 360 ml radiator the modularity is the real king here though seeing as you can customize this to however much cooling performance you require so although this project does not make sense for your regular gaming build and especially those constrained within a tight budget I do see this making sense for workstation builds especially those running higher-end processes and those requiring a bit more thermal Headroom although it is technically a custom loop there's no need for a discreet pump and reservoir and the setup is a lot cleaner simpler and quicker so if you are interested in potentially building something like this I will leave all the links down below to everything that you'll need as always guys a huge thanks for watching and I will see you all in the next one
