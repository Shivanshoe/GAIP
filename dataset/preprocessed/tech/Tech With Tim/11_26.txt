[Music] so i know a lot of you that watch this channel are students maybe you're considering going into a program like computer science and you've probably had the thought to yourself you know do i want to do a computer science degree maybe you're in one you're considering dropping out and from my experience here i did drop out of a computer science degree about a year and a half ago and i wanted to share with you now that it's been that long if i regret that decision kind of how i came to that point and give you a little bit of a story of what was going on in my life at that point when i did decide to drop out of school so for a bit of context i completed two and a half years of a computer science degree uh this would have been five full semesters i was in my third year and had i continued my degree it was a four year degree i would have finished right about now so i would have you know had my degree probably in the next two weeks assuming i passed my final exams so what i want to do is bring you all the way back to high school to start kind of work our way up to when i decided to make that decision and talk to you about the different factors that led to that and why i did decide to drop out as well as if i regret that so going back to high school in grade 11 12 is kind of when i figured out that i did want to do computer science i knew a little bit before that but i had officially made the decision yes i want to go to school for computer science before that i was contemplating between something like computer engineering or like um what do you call this aerospace engineering or all those other kind of interesting fields to me at least at the time so i did go to school for computer science and back then the general perspective and kind of consensus in my community and among my friends and parents and all of that was that the only real path to go was university right there wasn't really that much success at least being portrayed to me from people that didn't go to university and it was kind of ingrained into my brain at a pretty early age that your path is to go to university right if you go to college or you go to and by the way in canada college is kind of like a slightly lower tier program than university i don't like saying it that way because college can be great but that's at least the way it was considered anyways back then everyone was saying you know go to university go get your degree it's the only way you're going to be successful everyone that didn't go to university was kind of looked down upon a little bit and obviously that was a very wrong perspective that i'll get to but that's what was in my head so i did go into a computer science degree no regrets going into that initially um you know i was learning a lot in the program and this is right about when my youtube channel started to kind of grow so this is first year of university and i'm in computer science i have a youtube channel with probably about 5 000 subscribers and i'm starting to kind of grow this channel and build everything up so i'm not really making much money from it maybe a few hundred dollars a month and at that point in time there's no doubt in my mind you know i'm finishing this degree i'm getting the computer science degree i had no idea that i would be here today filming what i'm gonna be filming that was never at all in my brain so you know about a year goes by i continue growing this youtube channel while i'm in my computer science degree it's definitely a significant amount of work i'm waking up really early to film youtube videos before it's too loud in my restroom i'm getting all my schoolwork done i'm doing quite well but i'm working a lot i'm probably working eight ten hours a day every day including the weekends know occasionally taking some time off and now we get into kind of second year university now as i get into second year university the channel is really starting to take off i probably have about 40 000 subscribers 50 000 subscribers heading in there and throughout that second year of university i grew the channel to over 200 000 subscribers so now i'm at a point where i can actually seriously see you know real income coming from this channel i can see the potential of it and this is also when i get a job at microsoft as a software engineering intern so now i'm kind of at the point where i'm starting to achieve a lot of the stuff that i only really had thought would be possible by having a degree i'm you know see i'm seen as decently qualified when it comes to computing i have this resume online which is my youtube channel i'm able to secure the job at microsoft and i'm starting to have you know kind of i guess some career success you would say i'm doing this so anyways we continue i now go into third year of university at this point in time i'm making to put it frankly boatloads of money compared to what i would make as a regular software engineer i have all these opportunities i start working at algo experts start building out programming expert best platform to learn how to code check that out from the link in the description programming expert dot io and i'm seriously doing a lot of work now on kind of my business and my youtube channel all these other freelance stuff that i'm doing and it's becoming really difficult to balance school and all of this stuff and uh i'm starting to realize that i just cannot sustainably work the way that i'm working and i can't continue to grow this channel and this business to the point i want to bring it if i'm going to be in school and this youtube channel this point is like pretty much my life right this is what i've been working for for multiple years this is making money it's you know pretty much my job that i'm doing full time while i'm in school and i've been doing this for so long and it's just really starting i'm really starting to get tired of doing both of these things when school isn't really providing any value back to me for the youtube channel on the other side is providing a ton so it comes to the middle of the year right i'm you know 2.5 semesters and and that's kind of when i started hitting my breaking point and start seriously contemplating uh dropping out of school now as i was saying at the beginning of the video the two perspectives that i kind of have here is that one why would i drop out when i've already done two and a half years i only have a year and a half left to finish it just kind of seems like a lot of wasted time and money and it's always nice to have a degree right it's a really good safety net you can't really go wrong by having one it does provide some opportunity but at the same time i'm looking at this other perspective i'm saying anything that a degree would have given me i kind of already have right now i don't need the money from a degree i don't need to get a job i have that kind of handled i've already gotten a job without having a degree in the tech space for a large tech company i've been offered a return position all that kind of stuff and any value that i can really attach to a degree i'm it's becoming difficult to say that the degree is what provides that right because i'm able to kind of find that without having the degree so i end up making the decision to drop out again it is a tough one it's a wasted two and a half years and five thousand dollars but at the same time i can always go back and complete the degree if i want to and that's kind of what really pushed me to make the decision is that if i ever really do need this i can go back and complete it yeah it's gonna suck yeah i'm probably gonna have to redo some courses but in a world where i do need this i can go back and complete it so anyways at that point i do decide to drop out and just to continue here with the next year and a half and kind of give you the rest of the story here up until present day at this point in time the pandemics like full-fledged i've actually moved out of my university house which i'm still paying a lease on unfortunately at that point in time into my parents house i set up my office in my parents basement as i'm sure many of you have seen kind of that wood l desk setup and i continue kind of working out of my parents basement for a fair amount of time i work on all these projects and at this point what i actually start doing is saving up to invest in a house so what i really wanted to do um was actually move into my own place i've been saving money for a very long time i didn't really spend any money at all for the first two and a half ish years when i was doing the youtube channel other than on like equipment and like reinvesting back into the business so at that point i had a fair amount of cash and i wanted to buy a house so i ended up doing that in 2021 january 2021 that's where i am currently where i have this nice office setup uh and i continue working at algo expert finishing the algo expert contract we work on programming expert as you guys know best course to learn how to code check it out from the link in the description and i continue scaling up the youtube channel and now we're almost at a million subscribers so needless to say here i definitely do not regret this decision and one more point i kind of forgot to mention here was that i do not regret going into computer science for two and a half years even though i've said it's kind of you know wasted time i did learn a lot i made some good connections i made a bunch of friends and it did enable me to you know teach a bunch more stuff on my youtube channel and it was a ton of benefits from doing the degree even though i didn't complete it so i still you know got a lot of value out of that i'm not complaining about doing that or kind of regretting the initial decision to go to university things just kind of changed no halfway through and i had to adjust and make a decision not based on kind of the sunk cost and the time i had already spent and again that was the major factor was only a year and a half i could complete this it provides some benefit but the time cost just wasn't worth it to me and hence why i decided to drop out obviously i'm doing just fine now and yeah i wanted to share that video with you guys now i don't know if this was kind of all over the place or not it is difficult to recite all of these events especially a year and a half later but i thought this was an interesting story i'm sure this probably did not really help you make a decision on if you want to drop out or not my situation was extremely unique but i just wanted to get on here and kind of give you guys an update on what's going on and i also at this point want to thank all of you for subscribing to this channel and making what i just described a reality right there wasn't you guys watching these videos commenting liking subscribing i would not be in the position i was in today and i've said this many times but i never never never dreamed or even imagined that i would be sitting here today talking into a camera to you know hundreds of thousands of people even millions of people sometimes uh on a youtube channel and making my living from that it's really unbelievable it's uh you know i feel super fortunate to be able to do it and thank you to all of you guys so with that said i am going to wrap up the video here if you guys like these type of kind of talking head style videos uh more just you know stories i guess generally that's kind of what this was it was really a story uh then let me know in the comments down below because they are pretty easy to film and i wouldn't mind posting some more on the channel if you liked the video leave a like subscribe and i will see you in the next one [Music] you
