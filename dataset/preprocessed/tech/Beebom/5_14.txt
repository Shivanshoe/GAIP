motorola has been making the most value for money smartphones lately just look at the last three phones h30 g52 h30 pro all of these phones are something that i actually recommend to people so when this arrived the brand new moto g82 5g i obviously had my hopes up so is this worth it let's take a look so this is the new moto g82 and before we go ahead do you remember the moto g71 that launched back in january then was another good motorola phone that launched what 18 triple nine now the g82 brings some interesting improvements to the g71 first of the moto g82 comes in these two color variants but i like the wide variant more because i think this whole pattern is more visible here and i think it just looks more classy than this grey one to be honest this is not the most striking design but it is functional this is another motor phone that's very sleek and lightweight and i love that and i don't know why this is a very underrated point but just check out this comparison of the g82 to a realme phone or a redmi 4 in the same price range the g82 slimmer lighter and it's more compact and this makes a difference the g82 is lovely to hold in the hand it's great in the pocket lightweight i mean in a world where phones are getting bulkier and heavier this is just so good if you're wondering about the build the g82 has the pmma thermoplastic aka acrylic glass back in frame the fingerprint scanner is in the power button on the right frame and it's fast the whole design is also ip52 rated for splash resistance and the good thing is the phone has the dedicated micro sd slot and it has the headphone jack and this phone comes with two speakers unlike the g71 and what's interesting is that the stereo speaker setup is actually good it's loud and the quality is fairly good and there is dolby atmos support so along with the improved stereo speakers from the g71 the display is also a big bump the g82 has a 120 hertz p oled display with 700 minutes of brightness in high brightness mode and thousand nits of peak brightness one specification that's interesting here is that this is a 10 bit display so if you don't know 10 bit is basically 1 billion colors and 8 bit is around 16 million colors now as far as i know almost all the phones in this price segment be the redmi note 11 pro plus or real me 9 5g speed edition all of them come with 8 bit displays so it's good that motorola has included a high-end 10-bit oled panel in the g82 also since it's pre-ordered the bezel is unified and there's no big chin which is something i always like anyway it's not just this the display is actually vibrant and good it's basically a good oled panel it gets quite bright so bright is not a problem here the blacks are obviously inky and i like the colors although sometimes the colors do look a bit saturated but that's something you can fix in the display settings there is also the white wine and one license so no issues with full hd playback in apps like netflix but there's no hdr support moving on the one area with the g82 is similar to the g71 is the chipset the g82 comes with the same snapdragon 695 chipset with up to 8gb lpddf 4x ram and 128gb of umcp storage now i know the 695 isn't exactly a 6 series chipset as you can see from this comparison and a 2021k it is still better than the likes of 750g or exynos 1280. so 695 is good but yeah an upgrade to the chipset would have been nicer what do you guys think anyway the performance of the g82 is actually good these are the benchmark scores and these are the scores of the cpu throttling test that we did yeah these apart the phone is responsive and fast i did not notice any major lag anywhere and the day-to-day performance actually seems on point on the gaming front pubg news state supports 90 fps gaming on the 695 the new apex legends mobile supports ultra hd graphics with high fps and bgmi supports hd and high graphics or smooth and ultra graphics now we tested all these games on the g82 and the gaming performance is consistent without any problems the software experience is clean motor like the phone has android 12 and motorola has promised an update to android 13 and three years of security updates see personally i would have wanted a promise of two major android updates on the g82 but i think motorola is taking the whole we will promise what we can deliver approach with the td2 now the android 12 experience here is once again very pixel-like it looks almost the same and once again there's no bloatware or ads anywhere in the ui this is great the cameras have gotten a good upgrade to the 50 megapixel main camera now has ois which is great because at 20k there aren't any phones with ois here's the real me nine pro plus has a voice but that's 2425k the ois on the g82 works with both photos and videos and i did feel that the g82 captures slightly sharper shots in low light just check these out the videos are also more stable with ois here's a comparison video between the g82 and the g71 yeah the stability is good but there's no 4k video recording support here only 1080p at 30 or 60 fps the one thing i did note is that the camera app is also the new one that we saw in the h30 now i also took some daytime shots from the main camera and the photos are good there's good level of details and i like that the colors are natural not boosted or anything the dynamic range seems on point too we also tested the ultrawide camera and it is kind of oakish i mean the photos are sharp and good but we noticed it to take darker shots than usual which is a bit strange the front camera is a 16 megapixel camera and the selfies from this camera are decent the colors remain natural and there's good sharpness but the details could have been better so this is a video from the front camera of the moto g82 and we are in the natural habitat here there's no studio lights turned on the very noisy ac at the top is turned on so what do you think about the camera quality and the dual mics quality comment down below the battery in the g82 is a 5000 image battery and it comes with this 33 watt turbo power charger now i haven't had the time to test the battery yet but i think the 5000 mah battery should be fairly good the 33 watt charge is something we have tested though and it takes the phone from 10 to 100 percent in one hour eight minutes coming to connectivity the g82 has dual band wi-fi five bluetooth 5.1 3ca carrier aggregation which we checked and it's there there's also 4x4 memo nfc and 13 5g bands so it's all pretty much covered the price of the g82 starts to rupees 21 499 and that becomes 19 triple nine if you consider the sbi bank offer now the big question is does the g82 make sense at this price see there's nothing flashy about the moto g82 but i like that it just seems like a good all-around smartphone that people can actually buy the slim and light design is great even though it is pmma plastic the software experience remains the cleanest you can get in this price segment you get the high end 10 bit 120 hertz amoled ois in the main camera which is again not something you get in the segment and a fairly big battery it's not perfect there's no 4k recording in the front or rear camera the chipset is the same as the g71 so there are some quarks in this phone but i want to know from you guys what do you
