[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bbm.com and oneplus not arrived recently and there's a lot of hype around it but there are also a lot of questions how is the snapdragon 765 g compared to the snapdragon 855 or 855 plus how are the cameras which one should you go for the redmi k20 pro the real me x3 or the oneplus not well this is a oneplus not review in ar not near just kidding this is a oneplus note review and i'm gonna answer every single one of those questions so let's get started so first up uh let me give you a brief guys i've used oneplus not as my daily driver in two stages once for four days before the redmi note 9 came along and second after the redmi note 9 review went live and well ever since i put in my sim cards in this phone i've been using it extensively and i've realized that i don't really dislike anything a lot when it comes to the design of the oneplus knot i mean you already have all the details from a first impressions video so like i had said this is a very premium design for this price range and i also like the fact that this isn't an overly huge or bulky phone here's a size and weight comparison of the nord k20 pro and the real me x3 as you can see the knot is the sleekest and the lightest phone of the lot the k20 pro is good too but the x3 is a big and slightly hefty phone now one thing that might bother people is the fact that the knot does not have a headphone jack especially because the k20 pro and deal may actually come with that it did not bother me much because i've been using the bullets while asia is my primary earphones but yeah it's important to note now another thing important to note is that the phone has dual sim support but no micro sd support which is not okay especially because the base radian that's coming soon has only 64 gigs of storage also a lot of people were confused about the fact that this phone is glass metal or glass plastic well let me clear it once again the back here is glass while the sides the frame is plastic as for the haptic feedback on the phone it's kind of usual and similar to what you get with other mid ranges and yeah not as good as supreme smartphones apart from all that i like the design of the oneplus note the fingerprint scanner is really fast there's super fast face unlock the buttons are very tactile and when it comes to the speaker the bottom firing speaker at the bottom it's not the loudest but it's very clear and the quality is pretty good plus i like the fact that it does not distort at max volumes as for the display this is another thing in the knot that's got me sold it just looks really good i kind of always love amarette panel especially on mid-range phones i like it on the redmi k20 pro and i like it here plus it has the 90 hertz refresh rate which clearly complements oxygen os i know rene x3 which is in the same price range comes with a 120 hertz ips lcd and it's a nice smooth display but i'll take amoled over ips lcd any day now if you remember from our first impressions video i said something about the brightness looking a little low well to be honest the notch display is not the brightest display out there but it's good enough here's the phone next to the k20 pro at max brightness outdoors and as you can see both of them are on par when it comes to the visibility and i think both of them are visible so brightness isn't an issue on the nozzle display now the big question has been around the chipset and the performance of the oneplus not the snapdragon 765 g and how does it compare to the competition because the competition has the snapdragon 855 so you know what let's compare the snapdragon 765 g on the nod versus the snapdragon 855 plus the flagship chipset of last year well both of these are seven nanometer octa-core chipsets although the 765g has been manufactured on the newer seven nanometer euv process when it comes to the cpu the 855 is obviously the more powerful chipset because it has the faster cryo 485 cores that can go up to 2.84 gigahertz the cryo475 in the 765g is not too far behind though when it comes to gpu the 855 again is slightly better with the adreno 640 compared to the adreno 620. now do note here that the adreno 620 on the 765g is overclocked and can go up to 750 megahertz compared to the 700 megahertz clock speed of the adreno 640 gpu on the 855 plus so the 765g should offer good gaming performance but the 640 is 640 and it's obviously the more powerful gpu now it's clear that the 855 is the most powerful chipset but the 765g is definitely more future proof since it has an integrated 5g modem so that's something to note as well coming to the benchmark scores the snapdragon 855 on the redmi k20 pro is just ahead of the 765g on the knot here are the geekbench 5 scores and it's a fairly big difference i even ran a gpu centric test 3d mark and again the 855 is just ahead by a pretty big margin benchmark scores aside the oneplus not has been a really consistent and smooth performer for me i mean a lot of you guys have asked me how is the oxygen os performance with the snapdragon 765 g and trust me i was literally looking for any issues because i want to make sure that i don't miss out on anything important any big problem with the performance of the phone and well i got nothing well there has been no lag and i've used the oneplus 8 too and the specs aside i wouldn't say there's a lot of difference in day to day performance the gaming performance has been top notch too the not defaults to hd and high graphics and pubg mobile and i've had a number of gaming sessions at this setting without coming across any issues i also played the game at smooth and ultra just to check it out and the experience was top notch so i wouldn't really worry about the pubg performance now one thing's weird though the vivo x50 pro with the same 765g chipset supports hdr and ultra and smooth and extreme on pubg mobile and even on these settings the chipset handles the game easily so i'm not sure why these graphic settings are logged in the not as for other games i played asphalt 9 2 on the nod and the game ran very well so i don't think there's a problem on the gaming performance having said that i also did a game bench test to see the fps and the consistency at hd and high pubg mobile on the nord was consistently around 30 fps mark without a lot of drops so that's good at smooth and ultra the fps was around 40 most of the time with a dip to 35 38 at times of action compared to this the redmi k20 pro has support for hdr and extreme where the fps hovers around 55 to 60 fps mark so that's the difference the snapdragon 855 brings so at the end of the day the snapdragon 765 g on the nord is fairly reliable and it can handle intensive games like pubg mobile with a lot of ease but yes if you compare it against the 855 or the a55 plus yes the 855 or the 855 plus is more powerful anyway let's move on to another important aspect of the north the cameras as you can see the oneplus note has the same camera specs as the oneplus 8 so i had good expectations from it and well let's sort of deliver in the daytime the photos from the phone look really good the colors are very nice as you can see in this photo the photos are sharp and i like the dynamic range as well sometimes the photos don't have the most accurate color something i noticed during evening but i don't think it's a big deal in light to the oneplus not performs very well at least for a phone in this price segment some photos are a bit off in terms of sharpness but i mostly noticed the phone taking fairly sharp and welded shots now i also took a few comparison shots of the redmi k20 pro and the knot does very well against it in daytime i think it's a very very close call with both phones doing very well in terms of dynamic range and overall exposure sometimes the knot takes better photos with better lich shadows but sometimes the k20 pro takes the more punchy shot like in this one but like i said in most of the other occasions i found them to be equally good in low light though the oneplus not is better in almost every single photo you can notice the north photo has captured more light and the details too are much better so overall the nord is the better camera phone to me to be honest i also wanted to compare the node versus the real me x3 and the x3 super zoom but we don't have those phones so yeah as for the rest of the lenses the oneplus nords ultra wide sensor does a good job with the colors and the dynamic range but it's not the best especially in terms of detail i know most ultra wide angle cameras have this problem but in some shots from the knot it was more apparent that the details are too low there's also the obligatory 2 megapixel macro lens on the nord which is honestly average i mean i wasn't expecting anything better but i tried taking some macro shots but they had noise and they weren't good enough so yeah let's keep it when it comes to videos there's no 4k 60 fps support so here's a 4k 30fps video from the phone and i like the quality the video looks sharp with really nice colors although the contrast on the trees look a bit too much but overall i like it and since the phone does have ois the stability is also on point i also shot a comparison video so here it is versus the k20 pro and here you can see that the k20 pro has captured a slightly warmer video i'm not sure why but the oneplus not video looks a bit more stable as well look the k20 pro video is good too but i take the knot so the rear cameras are pretty good in my opinion but the selfies aren't far behind too there are dual selfie cameras here and i like the selfies from the main as well as the wide angle camera as you can see the colors remain mostly the same from both these sensors and the details are pretty good when it comes to the videos from the front camera this 4k 60 fp support but this is a 4k 30 fps video and you can shoot videos from both the main camera as well as the ultra wide angle camera this is a video from the main camera and i like the quality now let's switch to the ultrawide camera this is a video from the ultrawide camera and i like the fact that the quality more or less remains the same from the main camera the colors also remain the same and that is a good thing so i like the video shot from the front cameras of the oneplus not lastly there's the battery the nord's battery size is pretty similar to what you get in the x3 or the k20 pro and in my usage the battery performance was decent enough the phone only lasted me for a day but keep in mind i'm at home and i use my phone a lot these days as for the screen on time with the display set to 90 hertz i usually got an sot of around 6 hours 6 hours 10 minutes which isn't extraordinary but if you take a look at my screenshot there's a lot of pubg so it's fairly good also i set the screen to 60 hertz and the battery performance was slightly better because i got a screen on time of around 6 hours 15 minutes seven hours so yeah that's slightly better as for the charging the 30 watt warp charger is very very good it takes the phone from 10 to 50 in just 22 minutes and it fully charges the phone in exactly an hour so that's pretty speedy time for the conclusion so the oneplus knot starts at 24 triple nine uh no scratch that it's 27 triple nine because the 25k when it is coming in september it only has 64gb storage so should you buy the oneplus not at 28 000 rupees well the answer is pretty simple the main usp of the oneplus note is the whole oneplus experience with oxygen os which is ad-free bloat-free and just very good and if i had to choose i'd buy the oneplus not because of this plus it helps that the rest of the phone is also very well rounded 90hz amoled great design reliable performance good cameras both in the front of the back decent battery and very fast charging however there are phones like the redmi k20 pro with the snapdragon 855 in this price range and i like the k20 pro it's got amulet cameras are fairly good the design is nice and let's face it the 855 is more powerful than the 765g so it's clear if you want a more premium gaming performance go for the k20 pro or also take a look at the real me x3 but in every other aspect i think the oneplus not is the better option to go with so what are you going to go ahead with buy the oneplus not or buy the redmi k20 pro or even the real me x3 or x3 superzoom tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if
