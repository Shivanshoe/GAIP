[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is rupees from v1.com and off late every time we post a photo or video basically anywhere all we get are comments like hashtag boycottchina stop reviewing chinese phones boycott chinese products tell us alternatives to chinese phones and you know what honestly i get it everyone's angry there's a lot of emotions and everyone has a lot of questions so you know what we went ahead did a lot of research read a lot and i think in this video i'm gonna answer all of your questions yeah watch this video till the very end because after this video i think you guys will have a lot more clarity on where we stand in this whole boycott china saga first of all let's start with something really simple let's take a look at all the smartphone makers that are active in the indian smartphone market right now okay so there's apple xiaomi samsung oppo vivo realme oneplus asus lg huawei motorola ak lenovo hmd global ak nokia and htc now all of these companies the chinese makers are obviously super popular they sell the most phones but which of these are non-chinese smartphone makers this samsung asus lg nokia apple and htc now let's say you wanted to buy a budget smartphone in india that's from a non-chinese brand but the only option you have is samsung see asus was making some great budget smartphones till last year and it has a great opportunity now but i have no idea what's up with it same with hmd global there has been no new nokia phones since quite some time in india there's also lg which launches phones once in a while but again not something to consider really htc well htc is kind of dead in india so like i said the only option is samsung now forget budget smartphone say you wanted to buy a brand new snapdragon 865 flagship right here in india which non-chinese option do you have anything comes to mind no because there's none that's right i mean samsung only launches exynos flagships in india so yup if you want to buy a flagship snapdragon smartphone in india you don't really have a non-chinese choice and again this is a huge opportunity for makers like asus nokia and you know any other non-chinese brand because right now if say i want to buy a new snapdragon 865 flagship that's non-chinese i basically don't have an option so chinese smartphones are popular in india because of two things great specs and aggressive pricing i know there are some concerns around privacy and these phones have ads but there's no doubt that phones from makers like real me and xiaomi or even oneplus are immense value for money so ultimately the question is how can we reduce our dependency on chinese smartphones well let me explain this by dividing the indian smartphone segment into four categories number one made in china two assembled in india three non-chinese phones made in china and four made in india's smartphones okay so let me explain first made in china phones now these are phones that are completely made in china from using components that are mostly made in china to being assembled totally in china for example the nubia red magic phones now these phones don't really benefit us yes some shopkeepers sell them and make a little profit but apart from that they don't really provide any employment opinions coming to the second segment assembled in india which is comparatively less dependent on china now there are phones from chinese smartphone makers like oppo vivo realme xiaomi that have this made in india tag as you can see now they aren't exactly made in india but they are assembled in factories and plants in india and they also use a lot of locally sourced components not the major ones but they do use them so this is great for employment in india because these companies have a lot of factories and plants here in india they also have their offices r d centers and they also employ a lot of indians so it's a win-win third are non-chinese phones made in china now here take the iphones for example i know some of the older iphones are assembled in india at the vistron plant but most of the newer iphones they are still assembled in china i mean the brand new iphone se has the assembled in china tag as you can see so yeah see foxconn has 12 factories in china and most of apple's iphones are produced in the largest foxconn factory which is located in langhwa town shenzhen where more than four lakh people are employed now this brings me to the fact that foxconn in 2015 had announced that it would be setting up 12 factories in india as well and that would create 1 million jobs for indians but it's 2020 and we still only have two foxconn plans where xiaomi nokia and some iphones are assembled now foxconn's plans to open a plan in maharashtra might have been cancelled but according to latest reports they are still planning to invest in india so yeah more and more of these assembly plants will definitely boost india i mean apple could do something like samsung samsung assembles almost all of its phones in either this chennai plant or its plan in noida up where it has the largest mobile factory and it's not just assembly samsung makes the pcbs right here in india along with more components and also plans to set up india's first display plant now that is great see we've been hearing about apple plan to mass produce its iphones in india since 2015 and it's 20 20 now obviously it's going to take a lot of time honestly if you want more and more companies like say lg asus or even appliance makers like whirlpool to make the competence products here in india it's going to take a few years but it'll create jobs in india and it'll further reduce our dependency in china anyway coming to the fourth point the real made in india phones like micromax okay i'm just kidding micromax phones are basically chinese phones see as of now we don't really have phones that are truly made in india phones that are not only assembled here in india but also made of components made in india so you know what this is exactly what we need to focus on what we really need to do is get the companies that make the raw materials like the components like the lithium-ion batteries the camera sensors the usual other sensors etc required for a smartphone to make these in india only then we can have a true made in india smartphone i know to be honest this might take years or even a whole decade but this is something we need to focus on so this is something we can achieve i know a lot of it seems a bit far-fetched but slowly and steadily we can win this race not overnight i know phones are something that we all use a lot and that's the reason it's kind of become the highlight of this whole boycott trend but if you think about it look at things more broadly you will understand that china is the biggest factory in the world let me explain things a little better see we as a country rely on china for a whole lot of different things air conditioners pharmaceuticals toys automobile components bicycles solar power equipment and a lot of other things it's clear that china has a big part of the market in india plus it's not just that i mean most of the indian startups popular companies we know of are funded by chinese investors as you can see here ultimately if we indians truly want to become self-reliant we need a long-term plan with better government policies to bring more and more companies in india more investment in startups more focus on research and innovation and indian companies wanting to create alternatives yes like i said it's going to take a lot of time but like i said slowly and steadily we can win this race so the aim of this video was to see all sides of the story and you know just be more practical with this whole situation to be honest this whole boycott campaign is more of a social campaign more on the social media front but it's important we look at things more practically so you know what share this video with your friends on social media platforms and your family groups and whatsapp so that everyone sees the practical side of things also i want to know what you guys think on this matter so rather than just commenting bike or chinese phones let's have a quality discussion in the comments yes i will be replying in the comments so let's talk and yeah give this video a thumbs up if you liked it and
