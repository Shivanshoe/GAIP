[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is patimbio.com and pubg mobile i mean battlegrounds mobile india is finally here now i know this is the same game as pubg mobile there are a few minor differences that i'll talk about but first let me tell you how you can install battlegrounds mobile india on any android smartphone right now because i know a lot of you guys are facing issues with it so let me show you how to do it in very simple steps let's begin so first off the link to joining the beta testing is available right away but the beta testing slots are full so you get this when you head to the link so yeah this is not the way but there is another method and it's very simple just follow along first up make sure you have telegram installed and set up because you'll need it to download the files now once you've set telegram up just join our telegram channel via this link that you'll also find in the description now in our channel you'll find the zip file that you can just download just hit the three dot menu button and tap on save to downloads after this the download will begin and don't be confused with loading it's simply downloading the files now once the files are downloaded just use a file manager app that supports zip files to you know extract it i'm using solid explorer here and once the zip files are extracted you'll get these two files first just install the battlegrounds apk now one very important thing to note here is just install it don't launch the game right away it's very important now along with the apk you must have also noticed this obb file well what you need to do is just copy this file then go to internal storage android and then go to this obb folder now here create a folder with the name com.pubg.imobile and paste the obb file that you copied right here next up before launching the game just go to app info battlegrounds mobile india and give it the storage permission before you launch the game and that's it now just launch the game and as you can see here it works there's no 10 cent or pub g corporation now it's just craft on at the start now once the game is set up you will get this option to log in via your facebook or twitter or play games account so you can do that and it's not a problem now once you've logged in you'll get this option to transfer all of your old pubg mobile account database skins uc's emotes and yeah you can just follow these steps and all your account data will be back although i can't see my old friends list or my clan just yet anyway so this is the new pubg and it's basically the same pubg mobile that we used to play the maps are the same as you can see you even get the new karakin map that arrived in pubg mobile after the ban there also the different modes beat arena evo ground arcade all are basically identical to what we are used to all the guns are the same even the cars are the same the bikes are the same and the weird chole bike still flips over like crazy so it's basically the same game all the settings are also the same as you can see and the graphics settings also support a 90 hertz mode on a few phones so that's pretty nice now like i said at the start there are a few minor changes in the gameplay so let me just show you first up you now cannot kill your opponents in the game you can only finish them which sounds really weird but okay there's also no bloodshed you get this green animation when you shoot someone and when they die i mean finished they disintegrate like you know the announcer voldemort apart from that when you start the game you get a disclaimer that this is a simulation and not real world you also get this inter virtual world text while jumping from the plane lastly there's only one india server which you just cannot change in the game well that's pretty much all the changes in battlegrounds mobile and i know battlegrounds mobile does not bring a lot of new compared to pubg mobile in fact there's a lot of mention of pubg mobile in this game as you can see in this screenshot now battlegrounds mobile india being the same as pubg mobile is not a bad thing because we all love pubg mobile and i like that there are no weird changes to it the gameplay remains the same and i just hope that this does not get banned so yeah what are you waiting for go ahead and install battlegrounds mobile on your phones right away by following the steps and make sure to check out all the links in the description also make sure to share this video with your friends so they can also you know install battlegrounds mobile on the android smartphone also give this video a like make sure to share it i already said that subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos that's me signing off thanks for watching and i will see you in the battleground probably dying i mean finishing [Music] you
