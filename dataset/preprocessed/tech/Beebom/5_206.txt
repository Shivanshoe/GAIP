[Applause] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and 2020 is almost over but don't be too glad because there's still more than 40 days left and nothing can happen [Music] anyway when it comes to smartphones well all of the major launches are done and dusted so the big question is which phone should you buy right now well i'll be telling you the best phones to buy in the budget segment the mid-range segment the high-end the flagship segment the segment where you don't get charges and earphone segments so yeah let's start with the budget segment first so 10 to 15 000 rupees now this is a price segment that's filled with a lot of smartphones a lot of good phones so i'm going to divide this into two sections close to 15k and close to 10k so starting off with close to 15k there are a lot of good phones like the redmi note 9 pro and the poco m2 pro basically the same phones and there's also the real me seven and the real me naza 20 pro again very similar phones but i think the phone to buy in this segment is the real me seven okay so the real me seven starts at rupees 14 triple nine and i have used this phone in the past as my daily driver and i feel it's definitely the most well-rounded phone at this price 90hz display g95 chipset imx 682 sensor 5000 image battery 30 watt charger you can see that these specs here are very good and we did a comparison video of the dlv7 and the other popular smartphone in this segment the note 9 pro where the real me phone won so it's my choice easily now i know there's also the nazo 20 pro a very similar phone a thousand rupees less with faster 65 watt charging but a 48 megapixel main camera and i think the 64 megapixel camera on the redmi 7 is actually a little better so i prefer the redmi 7. now say if your budget is around under 10k or at 10k you still have a lot of good options like the redmi 9 prime the real me c15 the moto g9 but i think you should go for the redmi nine prime because of two major reasons so the first reason is the fact that the redmi 9 prime has a full hd display and the second is that it has the mediatek g80 chipset now i know this is not a phone for hardcore gaming or extensive usage but it's good value for money especially with features like the ultra wide-angle lens so yeah my choice now the specs of the redmi nine prime are good but i think at this price the miui experience is kind of okay so you can also wait for the micromax in note one at 11k unlike what you guys think i'm actually waiting to get hands on the micromax a note because that seems like a phone that has a very good price to specs ratio and yeah but i want to test it before making a judgment so 15 to 20 000 rupees now there are a lot of phones here as well but i think there are two phones that kind of stand out the poco x3 and the real me seven pro now both the pro x3 and the redmi 7 pro have their advantages but if you've seen a redmi 7 pro review you would know that i prefer the real me 7 pro see there are multiple reasons for that it's more compact and handy which is a big big reason it has an amoled display now both of these things are actually why i prefer the redmi 7 pro plus the rest of the phone is good too as you can see from the specs here so i honestly don't have any doubts on the redmi 7 pro at 20k moving on to 20 to 30 000 rupees i think this is a segment that i have very clear thoughts on see there are a lot of good phones in this segment phones with snapdragon 855 like the redmi k20 pro the real me x3 but as i've said in the last video it's not the specs or the processor that matters it's the overall experience see if your budget is around say 25000 rupees the phone i think you should buy is the galaxy m51 which is exactly at 25k now the crazy insane 7000mah battery is great but i think this is a very good all-around smartphone the performance is good thanks to the snapdragon 730 g plus one ui combo and the camera performance is very good in this price now the build could have been more premium but the phone is decently handy even with that massive massive battery so that's a feat and i like the galaxy 51. now if you're looking for a phone in the 25 to 30 000 price segment there's the obvious choice the oneplus not which i think is also a great choice so the oneplus knot is a phone that i've recommended to a lot of people because it's a great all-around package it looks modern has an amoled 90 hertz display the performance is solid and the battery life is decent enough with very fast charging the cameras well not extraordinary are decent enough so you cannot really go wrong with the oneplus not in this price range now 30 000 to 40 000 rupees now again this is a segment that where you get a lot of phones but i think there are two contrasting phones that you can go for the first phone here is the pixel 4a which does not have the most powerful chipset but brings a very good all-around experience it is absolutely fantastic when it comes to camera performance it is an amazingly compact phone the performance is good with the pixel experience so i'm showing you the specs here but yeah this is a phone that's all about the experience and this is the phone that i'm recommending to basically everybody but let's face it it stays out of stock a lot and if you're someone who needs better battery life or bigger screen and a little more performance the meat and tea or the meat and deep pro 2 make a lot of sense they both have the latest snapdragon 865 chipsets they have crazy 144hz displays very good camera performance and big batteries now i know amoled is an important point to note but other than that the meat nt at 35k is a very good deal for everything it brings now apart from these phones there's also the iphone sc in case you want an iphone and a couple of older oneplus phones in this price range that still kind of makes sense to me the oneplus 7t at 37 triple nine and the oneplus 8 at 39.99 okay so 40 to 50 000 rupees so here i have two choices actually three let me clear things up so choice number one the oneplus 8t starts at rupees 42 000 great performance with the latest snapdragon 865 chipset 120 hertz amoled crazy 65 or charging good all-round phone second choice the galaxy s20 fe starts at the ps4 triple nine it has 120 hertz amoled better cameras than the 80 including a telephoto lens and it has things like the ip68 rating and wireless charging all flagship features but and that's the big doubt exynos 990 so it's a very tricky position where you have to choose between more performance or more flagship features i'd personally go with more performance but i'd love to know your opinion anyway there's also a third option so the iphone 11 is usually at more than 50k but during most sales it gets to below 50k making it a great iphone to buy in the 40 to 50 price segment i mean yes it's last year's iphone but i still think it makes a lot of sense because still very powerful it has the modern iphone design and it has the ultrawide camera and things like the ip68 rating and wireless charging support oh and by the way if you get it now you might get that elusive charging adapter and earphones win-win so the last segment in this video is the above 50k price segment the premium flagship segment and you have the oneplus 8 pro here the galaxy s20 series the note 20 and the note 20 ultra and the brand new iphones but honestly if you're spending above 50k i think the iphones the new iphone 12 mini the iphone 12 the iphone 12 pro or the iphone 12 pro max whichever fits your budget are the way to go i've tried out the iphone 12 mini which by the way we're also giving away so make sure to check out that video and that's just a phone that's brilliant all around it looks fantastic it's fast and smooth it has great camera capabilities plus let's face it android flagships can't match iphone's longevity so if you're spending that much honestly just go for the new iphones well that was a lot of phones and yeah that was our list of the best phones to buy right now and if you think there's a phone that we kind of missed out on and you think that's great for a particular price segment just comment down below and make sure to let others know also give this video a like and make sure to share it around so that everyone knows the best phones to buy
