windows 11 has been getting a lot of cool new features in the last few updates in fact i'm pretty sure that most of you guys don't know about the cool new windows 11 features i'll be talking about so i'll start with the big features first up and then i'll go down to the really cool tricks in the latest windows 11 updates now before we start i want to give a huge shout out to our sponsors for this

the first new windows 11 feature i want to talk about is tabs in file explorer we've been wanting it it's finally here sort of see tabs in file explorer is not actually enabled by default but once you've turned it on you will see the plus button in the file explorer to open a new tab i can also right click on a folder and open it in a new tab like this it just works now this is a feature that's working progress because you can't rearrange the tabs you can't drag and drop files between tabs but this is a hidden feature in windows 11 so it's clearly coming to the stable windows 11 build soon now the file explorer also has another new feature that i find interesting so the quick access page now has a pinned file section i can just right click on a file or folder and pin it to quick access and have it handy here it's useful now one of the most underrated new windows 11 features is voice typing let me show you so say i'm in notepad here i can just use the keyboard shortcut windows plus h and this pop-up ui comes up with the mic button everything i can just start speaking and look how flawlessly turns my voice into text it actually works really well i mean you can also notice the punctuation here and that's because i have the auto punctuation option enabled plus there's also this option called voice typing launcher so that the voice typing overlay appears whenever you click on a text field anywhere so snap is one of my favorite windows features and windows 11 made it better and the last few updates have made it even more seamless i mean i can still move into the sides or the corners to snap it i can also pause at the maximize button to get these snapping options but now i can just start moving a window and there's this bar at the top which shows you all the possible snapping layouts i can use it's seamless and i love how smooth this is to use so you guys probably know all about the windows 11 gestures but did you guys know that you can customize the three finger and the three finger gesture in windows 11 to whatever you want to so here's the touch pad settings page and here you get this advanced gestures option where i can configure each of three finger and four finger gestures be tab swipes anything i also like that you can set these gestures to one of these options or you know use a custom shortcut i've set three finger tab to minimize all the windows which i think is very handy windows 11 also has a cool new live captions feature which captions whatever is playing on your screen so here i am playing one of our videos and i can just use the shortcut windows plus control plus l and this brings this bar at the top with the live captions yeah this is cool right and it's not very accurate with my accent because this works best only in us right now but it's a good feature to have i also like that you can change the position of this captions bar include mic audio and also change the caption style let's face it the notepad app is something we have all used on windows and microsoft recently updated the notepad app to make it look modern and nice so here's the new notepad app and you can see that it looks modern there are rounded corners translucent effects new context menus all in line with the new windows 11 ui plus it supports the dark mode and here's how it looks with the dark theme yeah i think it looks very cool there are also a couple of new features like multi-level undo and redo so you can go back to any mistakes and you know come back the good old task manager app has also been revamped in the latest windows updates and here's what it looks like now yes this is the new task manager and all the tabs go in this menu here on the left beat processes performance app hd startup apps etc there's also a new settings button here which lets you change the default start page change real-time update speed and more i also like that the new task manager supports the dark theme and here's how it looks in the dark mode plus there are a couple of new features one there's a run new task which brings up the command bar to launch processors quickly second there's efficiency mode which basically lets you select an app or process and limit its system usage for better battery performance the windows 11 start menu has been subject to a lot of love hate and hate because it's not very customizable but that's been changing in the last few updates so with the new windows 11 preview start menu now has support for folders that look like this and creating folders is easy i can just drag and drop an app onto another and it's done now i can rearrange the apps in a folder by moving them around although there's no option to name a folder that's something microsoft has promised is coming later the windows taskbar has also gotten better with the new windows 11 updates first of all the taskbar is now better optimized for tablets and you can finally drag apps from the start menu to the taskbar like this another feature everyone has been wanting is clock on secondary monitors and the new windows builds show a clock on multi monitor setups the new windows 11 versions also have a taskbar with the weather icon in the left end it shows you the temperature and clicking on it opens up the widgets page i told you about a number of cool new nifty new features in windows 11 where let me talk about them really quickly first up the bluetooth menu in the quick settings now shows you the battery percentage of your earphones which is pretty handy now one cool new trick is the ability to change the volume level by just going to the volume icon and just scrolling up and down only works with the mouse but yeah this is nice windows 11's emoji picker is normal streamlined with tabs for emojis kamojis symbols and even gifs there's also a clipboard button at the end next up there's an option called title bar window shake which lets you shake a window to minimize everything else like this see
