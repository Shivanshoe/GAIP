check this out yep now take a look at an app closing in slow motion yeah this is nice and yeah these animations remind me a little of iOS but I like it no problem anyway there are better animations all across as you can see be to uninstall apps finishing a task in the Notes app just moving across things opening up an event in the calendar taking the battery stats or even the screen rotation animation which looks really small yep I can't wait to feel these animations in person on a phone especially on a higher refresh rate dislike on the maintain or the poor x2 [Music] now one thing I did not really like about Muir gestures is the fact I did not support androids native gesture of switching between apps well that changes with me you are 12 as you can see in new UI 11 full screen gestures have this refined animation and there's a lengthy bar at the bottom second so I'll go to go homes so I'm up an older series since app screen and flick left or right to switch between apps now I'm not sure if Xiaomi has kept the swipe and hold back gestures since between apps but I hope they have I've been complaining about phones getting bigger and bigger and and where global free window is one me where twelve feature that kind of makes use of that with me you are 12 you can run every app in small freeform windows the different gestures for this tool you can just swipe up and hold it an app and bring it to this icon on the top to run that app in a small window like this you can even snap and minimize a window to the side like this open up a notification in a free-form window like this close an app and open it up in full-screen yeah there is a lot of gestures and they're really cool does it even works when you're using the phone in landscape mode yeah this should be handled [Music] me wise dark mode looks great with all the colors splashed over the black UI and me y12 is making dark mode even better first for Dogma 2.0 in me a 12 works with almost every single app out there secondly it's improved me a 12 is said to improve readability and reduce eyestrain while using the dark mode you notice automatic food weight and contrast adjustments that takes will appear brighter and the wallpaper dimming feature will dynamically adjust the color temperature of your wallpaper yeah nice mere 12 brings three new privacy features on board there's played barbed wire and mass system so taking it one by one flair we keep track of the behavior of all apps present in the phone and bring your list of apps that may be you know out of line relating a privacy or building permissions Barbara improves on androids permissions manager and this will make sure that an app won't show the always allow button for the location of camera permission if the app does not specify what it requires the permission for third ma system is a feature similar to real me you eyes and color or sevens personal information protection feature so the math system will basically mask your person and for you know bring a blank in for in an app requires it to share with them yeah it's pretty handy so Swami's knew me health app is officially live with me you are 12 with me health app all you need is your phone with you to track your steps workouts and more so the app will send you sedentary reminders and will be able to monitor your sleep yes it works without a fitness tracker all you need to do is place your phone on your pillow while sleeping and yeah it will try to sleep I mean it sounds a little inconvenient but we'll see how it works [Music] Mirel also brings a whole lot of other changes like this really cool dynamic weather app which shows this really cool animations based on the weather is also an AI calling feature that is probably for China only a video toolbox feature that probably will be handy for some and several other optimizations well those are some really exciting new new a tour features and yeah if you want to know if your Xiaomi device supports a Mew it'll update take a look at our article from the link in the description down below also tell us which is your favorite new it will feature in the comments down below give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share with your friends who are Xiaomi uses lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos well that's me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one
