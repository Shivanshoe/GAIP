hey guys this is the page from youtube.com and vivo has just launched this new x70 series of smartphones in india and i'm actually really excited about this because offline phones have kind of become boring iphone but you know what if the vivo x60 series was any indication the vivo x70 series would be anything but boring i mean vivo sent us this really interesting looking box for the vivo x70 pro plus so let's unbox this [Music] [Music] so this is the new vivo x70 pro plus and the vivo x70 pro side by side now i'll be focusing on the vivo x70 pro plus because this is vivo's ultimate flagship phone and there's a lot of hype around it so what's new what are the upgrades well there's actually a lot of them first off the vivo x70 pro plus looks like a flagship phone it has a frosted glass back yes this is glass and it has this satin like matte finish that's just brilliant to touch and it does not attract any fingerprints if you ask me you will love touching this phone sounds a little weird i know but you will love it now this whole matte black look is kind of understated but what's not understated is this big camera module and this new decorative ceramic piece on the side of it now when i first saw this i thought it'd be a display but that's just to add to the style factor now this is slightly heavier than the x60 pro plus at 2 and 13 grams but unlike the x60 pro plus the x70 pro plus has everything you want in a flagship ip68 water and dust resistance wireless charging support large volume x apps mode of haptic feedback dual stereo speakers with a separate hi-fi chip yup this phone is packed the screen is also a big big upgrade compared to the x60 pro plus now this is a curved 6.7 inch panel and this is samsung's new ltpu e5 120hz ambulance screen which means this is a screen that can arrive from one hertz to 120hz dynamically now that's not the only upgrade it's a qhd plus aka 2k resolution screen it also has 10 bit colors hdr 10 plus support and a crazy peak brightness of 1500 nits yeah this display is as high end as it gets i mean it looks absolutely stunning it's super smooth and watching movies on this is a fantastic experience the phone has upgraded specs too it has the latest snapdragon flagship chipset the snapdragon triple eight plus which can hit the 3.0 gigahertz mark compared to 2.8 gigahertz on the regular snapdragon triple eight it also has 256 gigs of fast ufs 3.1 storage and 12 gigs of lpddr5 ram again those are just top of the line specs in the android world now if you want to know the benchmark scores here the android and geekbench scores which obviously are very good benchmarks apart i've only had the phone for a day so i can't judge the performance yet but i have been playing some bgmi on this phone and this thing just seems flagship great there's no lag or anything super smooth so no doubt so far the x70 pro plus also has a bigger 4500 image battery and it comes with the very fast 55 watt flash charger it also supports 50 watt fast wireless charging and it can also wirelessly charge other devices at 10 watts which is all pretty awesome now let's talk about the cameras which has been the big usp of the vivo x series of spawns and is the same here with the x70 pro plus now on paper the x70 pro plus his camera setup hasn't changed much and that's not a bad thing you still get the 48 megapixel ultra wide camera with vivo signature gimbal oia system there's also the 50 megapixel samsung gn1 main sensor the 12 megapixel telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom and the 8 megapixel periscope telephoto lens that supports 5x optical zoom now all of these lenses have ois and they all have zeiss optics the zeiss t-star lens coating along with the new high transmittance glass lens to reduce chromatic aberration and all of this is powered by vivo's new professional imaging v1 chip which is said to enhance clarity and blur in moving shots and also reduce noise and enhance brightness in low light so the hardware is packed but so is the software first of all there's a zeiss mode that you can enable for more natural looking shots i took some shots with the zeiss mode off and on and i did not notice a big difference because i think the x70 pro plus now takes more natural looking shots by default there's also different zeiss portrait modes that are supposed to mimic classic zeiss lenses and as you can see there are some new additions which is cool another cool feature is real time extreme night vision powered by the v1 chip that shows you a more accurate and brighter preview when shooting in extreme low light i mean there are times they're taking a photo an extreme low light and you can't really frame things properly because the viewfinder is all dark now this fixes this because the preview is just much better there's also 360 degree horizon level stabilization mode which is awesome it uses the gimbal in the ultrawide sensor to make sure that no matter what you do the video maintains horizontal level i mean just look at the viewfinder see how it remains stable no matter what i do yeah this looks insane right apart from this there's also the pro cinematic mode that has video log spot lens switching focus distance mark adjustable audio etc now these features are cool but what about usual photos well i have been taking shots on the main camera and the ultra wide angle lens and most photos from both of these cameras look sharp detailed and have excellent dynamic range just check out this shot the dynamic range is just brilliant even in the ultra wide angle shot now the phone also does well in complex lighting scenarios with the t-star lens scoring and the high transmittance glass i shot this with the sun shining bright right on the camera and the photos don't have any glare or weird reflections even in low light the x70 pro plus camera does really well especially when there's lights and it just handles lights a lot better than most phones out there there's also 2x optical zoom and 5x optical zoom support and here's a 1x zoom shot and a 2x zoom shot next to it and the 2x zoom shot looks very good quality wise now here's a 5x zoom shot with the periscope lens and yeah it looks good here's another example now to be honest i will have to compare the x70 pro plus this camera to other flagships to truly see how good this is but in my brief testing these do seem like very good flagship great cameras lastly there's a software that i haven't talked about so let me tell you about that so the phone has fun touch os 12 with android 11 and if you're wondering about the pre-installed apps there are a few of them amazon phone page spotify share chat buy juice netflix facebook now these apps can be uninstalled but it's weird seeing them on such a premium phone especially the hot apps and hot games folder apart from this i noticed this new widget section which is probably part of origin os we was always in china anyway some of the videos look nice so i've been using them apart from all this along with the x70 series we will also introduce vivo x care which means anyone who buys any of the vivo x70 variants will get a dedicated expert for assistance a fast 24x7 dedicated calling line for support doorstep repair service and exclusive counter at vivo service centers where an assigned engineer and a standby device will be available anyway to sum things up the vivo x70 pro plus is a proper flagship smartphone and an exciting smartphone i mean no matter which aspect of this phone you look at you will find top of the line specs and some really exciting features so the design is super premium it's got all the flagship specs and features like fast wireless charging ip68 rating ltpu 120hz amoled it's got the best specs you can get on android phones and the cameras remain a big highlight with so many advanced features and tech so yeah if you ask me i think all this hype around the vivo x70 pro plus is justified this is actually an exciting android flagship in a day when we don't get a lot of exciting flagships anymore anyway that's the x70 pro plus but viva has also launched the x70 pro which brings the dimension to 1200 chipset and fhd plus curved amd display quad cameras with zeiss optics and more so i want to know what you guys think of the x70 pro plus and the vivo x70 pro so let me know in the comment section
