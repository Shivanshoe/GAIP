below let's be honest when you see home screen setups like this or this you want to set up your home screen the exact same way right enter palette home screen setups see this app is basically desktop for people who want a beautiful home screen you can swipe through all the cool home screen setups here you can sort them by latest oldest or most viewed and you can also see setups based on different categories like amoled minimal etc now i like this minimum home screen setup so i can just tap on it and i can see all the information below i need nova launcher the minimal new icon pack and the kwgt base pack now what's cool is that you can tap on these to go to the play store directly and just get downloading plus there's also the nova launcher backup file for easy setup and i can just tap on wallpaper to download it right away yeah this is pretty easy and yeah this is something you like physical notification leds are kind of dead right now but notification light is an app that brings a notification led sort of to your modern day smartphone see this puts a notification led to the punch hole camera on your phone yeah this is how it looks like when your phone gets a notification pretty cool right plus i love how customizable this is you can change the color of the slide in fact you can set specific colors for specific contacts and apps you can change the animation you can choose between pulse rotate or gravity in the free version there are a lot more options and i like the fact that this works with the always on display feature almost every smartphone so it's not draining too much battery don't worry there is a separate app for phones with no aod that i will be linking below to check it out so sometimes you want to take a before and after photo of maybe your fitness transformation or maybe a house innovation or maybe you want to take a photo in the exact same pose as one of your previous photos detoured is an app that is to do exactly that in this app you can select a photo from the gallery and detoured will put it as an overlay in the camera viewfinder like this you can increase or decrease the opacity of the overlay and then you can align things and take the exact same photo once again this is handy right now the cool thing is the app also has some interesting templates to put as an overlay and then take a photo just like the template a lot of android uis have this sidebar feature which lets you access the apps really quickly from the home screen well edge card launcher is that but on steroids the h card launcher can be accessed by swiping up on the left edge or the right edge and this brings a number of quick options in one go there's obviously the apps but there's also music controls here the battery percentage the volume panel and there are these shortcuts to the notification shade auto rotate etc you also get the second page with contacts on it plus i like that you can pick and choose the apps you want to see here and even the contacts now most of the features here are free but if you want things like unlimited apps gestures from both the sides you will have to get the pro version widget share is the next cool new app on the list and this lets you have the exact same widget on your phone your friend's phone and your family member's phone basically anyone and it's pretty cool let me show you so here i have set this photo as a widget on my home screen as well as the home screen on another phone now i can change the photo in this widget and the photo on the other phone will also change like this this is awesome right i mean it does not happen instantaneously as the developers claim but it's still pretty good anyway you can select a photo from the gallery or take a photo from the app and you can even doodle or write things on the photo to make a nice sweet widget that is maybe shared across your family so airpods don't really play well with android smartphones but if for some reason you have an android phone and you have airpods you need the ca pod app so this is a pretty simple app but it brings a lot of airpods features on android first it shows you the battery details of both the earbuds and the case it also detects if an earbud is in the ear or not plus there are these super handy options you can turn on autoplay and auto pause to make sure the audio playback is controlled automatically there's also auto connect in case you're having issues connecting the airpods to your android smartphone lastly the app brings a pop-up similar to iphones to show you the battery status of the airpods now this did not work for me but it's smart as experimental so maybe it'll work in the future anyway you do get this notification to see the battery details of your airpods so we've all seen a lot of cool weather apps in the past but let me tell you the dina or dina is the coolest weather app ever so dina shows you the weather details like any other weather app but what's cool about this app is that it tells you what you should wear depending on the weather forecast it also tells you if you need to take an umbrella or sunscreen once you head out you just need to add these details here like skin type your height weight and it will show you what you should wear like this plus as you can see it's also telling me to get a sunscreen because i will experience sunburn obviously delhi i can tap here to see more details and yeah this is kind of useful right so those are some of the coolest new android apps and comment below your favorite app on the list comment below if there's any other new
