[Applause] hey guys i'm akshay from bomb.com and vivo has just launched the brand new vivo v20 now this is an interesting phone all around but i think there are two things that make it really exciting number one the design and number two the eye tracking autofocus now i'll be talking about the rest of the phone as well but first let's check out the new design and the camera features okay so this is the new vivo v20 and this is the striking form i mean the new gradient color on the back is a little flashy but it's also quite nice because of the matte finish this is a matte gorilla glass 5 pack and thanks to this soft matte finish it just feels great in the hand there's an anti-fingerprint coating here as well so the fingerprint sponges are quite minimal it's also really sleek and lightweight i mean this phone is just 7.38 mm thin i mean look at this so these are five two rupee coins and here's the vivo v20 next to that yeah it's that anyway that's nice and all but i'm really excited to check out the eye tracking autofocus on this phone i mean i've never used io to focus on a smartphone so yeah i wanted to check it out i autofocus is available in the 44 megapixel selfie camera here and as the name suggests eye tracking autofocus will track your eyes and focus on them that's cool because normally phones use face detect autofocus which tracks your face so let's check it out and see how it's better than face autofocus let me just enable it in the camera settings and as you can see you can choose which eye to focus on which is cool now that it's enabled the phone is tracking my eyes as you can see here this is the video i'm shooting on the vivo v20s front camera in 4k because yeah it can do that and with high autofocus enabled and as you can see the focus seems to be pretty much on point here in fact it's quite effective even if i look away from the camera and i'm not directly looking at it so yeah vlogging should be quite easy with this new feature plus focusing shouldn't be an issue either so that's great now let's compare eye autofocus and face autofocus as well in this video as you can see i'm going in and out of the frame and moving around a lot now i don't think you will be able to tell this in the video because of youtube's compression but the eye tracking is performing slightly better than face autofocus so yeah that was videos but you can also use eye tracking autofocus to click pictures as well here are some selfies i shot with eye tracking autofocus and face autofocus and once again i autofocus does look slightly better it also usually gets better pictures with clear focus so that's a plus point too that's nice and since this is a software feature it should get better with time as well i even tried using the eye autofocus feature at night and yeah it works pretty well even in really low light conditions which is definitely nice to have so the vivo v20 focuses a lot on the selfie camera and there are a ton of selfie features here like this steady face selfie video that you can quickly enable as you can see this feature can let you shoot some stable selfie videos when you're walking around yeah it's quite stable you can also shoot slow-mo selfies at 240 fps here so you can get cool looking footage like this that's really nice also if you're a night owl and you want to click some selfies out after dark well the vivo v20s new super night selfie 2.0 feature will let you click pictures with natural skin tones and great color temperature thanks to the aura screen light yeah these pictures look quite good don't they now eye tracking autofocus is obviously the standout feature out of all that but it's only in the front camera so what about the rear cameras well the vivo v20 comes with a 64 megapixel primary camera on the back alongside an 8 megapixel ultra wide lens and a 2 megapixel mono camera if you're wondering about the phone's camera performance well here are some pictures i shot with the vivo v20 and as you can see the camera takes some decent pictures in most lighting conditions the ultra wide shots look nice with good colors as well and you can take some nice looking macro shots too so yeah it seems to be a nice camera setup but one of its features that i really wanted to check out was this dual view video mode that lets you shoot videos from the front and rear camera at the same time i wanted to check this out because the phone uses a 720 g with 8 gigs of ram so i wanted to see how the feature holds up with those specs you know whether it lags or not it doesn't lag which is nice plus i also really want to check out the battery drain here because using both cameras together will definitely put more pressure on the 4000 mah battery that's in this phone now the dual video mode doesn't support 4k video recording which i mean i expected that anyway because the snapdragon 720 g probably can't handle two 4k streams at the same time so that's fine it also gobbles up battery by the way it used up around two percent battery in just one minute of shooting 1080p so yeah that's about 50 minutes of shooting so that was your first look at the new vivo v20 and its eye tracking autofocus in action and yeah it's a promising feature i'm happy to see companies innovate in new camera technologies instead of just increasing megapixel count in their cameras honestly it's nice to see vivo innovating in smartphone cameras after all it launched the first phone with a pop-up selfie camera it has phones with dual pop-up selfie cameras and it launched the gimbal camera with the x50 pro so yeah it's nice to see vivo add more and more new camera features to its smartphones anyway what do you think about this new feature do you think more and more phones will get the eye tracking auto focus tech let us know in the comments also give this video a like and share with your friends lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos that's me signing off thanks for
