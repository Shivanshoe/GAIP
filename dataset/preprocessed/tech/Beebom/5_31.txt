[Music] but it doesn't work i try to say something this is one of the coolest laptops we have ever received this is the msi cross f15 rainbow six extraction edition and obviously there are some special things about it so first it came in the special bundle box where you get the r6 extraction themed mouse and mousepad the laptop with the same design theme and you also get a copy of the game all of this is just super cool because everything here has been designed keeping in mind rainbow six extractions team the box has the same theme and i like that it features this whole map design from the game the extraction themed mouse is super cool it has the same yellow green theme the logo of the react organization from the game lights on the bottom as well as on the scroll wheel there are these custom buttons on the side as well and there are these buttons to change the color of the lights and switch to high dpi settings now complementing this mouse is this r6 extraction themed mouse pad which is smooth enough now let's check out the laptop which honestly something you'd really like if you're a fan of r6 extraction or even siege the lid has this crest in the middle with the react logo which even lights up like this there are these cuts inspired by the lab door gate in the game you can also see some yellow here behind the lid and that's because the top of the inner body has this yellow and green gradient which spreads to the keyboard i also like that the keyboard has a custom color profile which by the way is not customizable but i like that the keys have different backlit colors in line with the game's overall gradient of blue yellow and green you must have also noticed the wsad keys which have this translucent yellow design the trackpad also has these decks and there's this react logo and crest in the corner i also like the bottom of the laptop which has this hive design and the vents are big and there's high ground clearance which makes sure that there's ample ventilation see all of this is super cool and i know this yellow might be a little too much for some people but i think it makes sense in a special edition laptop apart from this looking theme this is a gaming laptop so it is kind of big and hefty at 2.47 kgs that is fine but i noticed a little bit of this see the flex in the display i also noticed a little bit of flex in the keyboard other than that the overall build seems good and one thing i do like is that the hinge is solid and you can lift up the lid with one hand anyway let's talk about the specs now first these are the display specs of 165 high resolution qhd panel which i think makes sense here considering this is a proper gaming laptop i mean the fast refresh rate does make fps games a lot more responsive and fun as for the display quality the color accuracy is pretty good with 100 dc ip3 coverage the display is also sharp and i like the blacks too the brightness is kind of oakish it's not the brightest display but i like that it's a matte display so it's not very reflective or anything when it comes to chipset msi already has a complete 12-gen lineup in india and this is no different the msi crosshair extraction edition is powered by the 12th gen core i7 processor with 14 cores including 6 high performance cores 8 efficiency cores and 20 threads when it comes to gpu there's rts 3070 and i like that it can go to 140 watts which means msi hasn't compromised the gps performance then there's 16 gb ddr4 ram which is a bit strange because with the 12g cpu i was kind of expecting faster ddr5 ram here anyway there's one tv pci agent for ssd and both the ram and storage are upgradable now we did run some benchmarks on this laptop and it consistently performed well so i think msi has optimized the performance pretty well i mean the laptop performs really well in day to day usage and multitasking and it handles games pretty well we obviously played rainbow six extraction because that comes bundled with the laptop and well the game performance was good at 2k resolution and ultra graphics the max fps was around 70 and the average fps was around 64. in 1080p resolution the max fps reached 105 and the average was around 84. we also played some far cry 6 and at 2k ultra the average fps were around 63 and at 1080p resolution the max fps was 94 with an average of 78. overall the game performance of this laptop is solid in all the aaa titles that we played on this laptop the cpu and gp performance was really good as for the thermals there are two fans with six heat pipes and the laptop has the msi cooler booster 5 deck now in our tests we found the thermal forms impressive with the fans hitting as high as 5 900 rpm yes the fans can get quite loud but i'm okay with that because we did not notice any throttling or weird overheating in this laptop performance apart the rest of the basics of this laptop are on point the keyboard is a full sized one with 1.7 millimeter key travel the trackpad isn't the largest but it's responsive when it comes to audio there are two speakers on the bottom which are decent in terms of quality but other than that nothing special the webcam is a usual 720p camera and as for the ports on the right there's lan hdmi a usbc port a usb a port and the headphone mic combo on the left there are two usb a ports the battery is a 90 watt battery and you get this 240 watt adapter in the box coming to the pricing msi is not the usual crosshair 15 with rtx 30 60 rupees one lakh fifty six thousand nine ninety and the cross f15 rainbow six extraction edition we have has been launched at piece one lakh ninety 90 990 so yeah the price is on the higher side but this is a special edition laptop and i like it because unlike a lot of other special edition laptops msi went all out here with the whole r6 extraction team and created a laptop that's definitely going to grab eyeballs and the whole bundle with the box and the accessories is a great touch the design with the rainbow six extraction theme is very very cool so yeah if you are a rainbow six fan you should check out this laptop and share this with other rainbow six gamers this will be available online as well as brand stores so make sure to check it out also you saw the intro it deserves a like hit like right now also comment below about which special
