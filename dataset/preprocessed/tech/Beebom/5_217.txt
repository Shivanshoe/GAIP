[Music] [Music] [Applause] okay samsung recently announced the new galaxy f41 the first smartphone in the new galaxy f series and well this is it right here now i know we're a bit late covering this because we got the phone late and we were doing a lot of other videos but hey better late than never so when samsung announced the galaxy f41 i had two questions in my mind first up what's new with the galaxy f41 and second what's this new f series all about how is it different than the m series or the a series well i'm going to answer both of these questions so let's start with the first one so this here is the new galaxy f41 and design wise it has a very typical samsung design this here is a polycarbonate back and it's a little bit of a fingerprint magnet but other than that it looks fine everything else is fairly standard too you get the usbc port a dedicated micro sd plus dual sim slot and a headphone jack too round things off there's also the fingerprint scanner on the back here which is decently fast and you also get face unlock which is also decently fast so no problems now you can't ignore the display especially on a samsung phone the galaxy f41 comes with a 6.4 inch full hd plus super amoled display with gorilla glass 3 and this is a display that's nice with vibrant colors and it seems good all around like most samsung displays plus the phone has no issues with hd streaming in apps like netflix so i was watching a few shows on this phone and they do look crisp on this display now one thing that you must have noticed is the teardrop notch up top and i honestly would have liked the infinity o style display but hey this amoled so i'm not gonna get into this much on the back the galaxy f41 comes with a triple camera setup with a 64 megapixel primary sensor an eight megapixel ultra wide angle lens and a five megapixel depth sensor so no two megapixel lens is something i always appreciate anyway the 64 megapixel sensor has been good in the few photos that i've taken i mean the 64 megapixel sensor on phones like the m31s m51 they've all been good and it's the same on the f41 so far as you can see the photos in good light are sharp and detailed and i like the overall colors too in low light things are kind of decent dish but mostly things are well exposed as for the ultra wide angle sensor it has a 123 degree field of view like most samsung phones and the quality is good too especially the colors now frankly it's too early to judge the camera performance here but so far the cameras here seem very solid for the price plus they have all the features you expect from samsung phones like single take night hyperlapse and more so yeah you're pretty much covered on that front as for the videos i like that there's 4k support for both the rear cameras and the front camera which by the way is a 32 megapixel sensor now coming to the specs i think you probably already know that the galaxy f41 packs in the exynos 9611 chipset with up to 6gb ram and 128gb storage now this is the same exynos 9611 that was in the m31 the m21s and a lot of other samsung phones and yeah i'll be honest with you a newer chipset would have been nice but if i go by my past experience the f41 should be fine with day-to-day tasks and casual gaming as well now on the software front you get one ui 2.1 here based on android 10 with all the one you have features we know of and yeah there are some pre-installed apps like phone pay daily hunt snapchat and also these microsoft apps that are pre-installed but they can be uninstalled so it's not really an issue anyway the battery capacity of the f41 is up there it's a six thousand image battery and that means this is a phone that should last pretty long i mean i've used the galaxy m31 and the m31s in the past and both of those phones have 6000 image batteries and obviously the battery performance on those phones is exceptional especially with the amoled displays so yeah i'm expecting the same from the f41 when it comes to charging the phone comes with a 15 watt fast charger and yeah a 25 watt fast charger would have been nice now coming to the second question what's this new f series all about so basically samsung's new f series is in partnership with flipkart so the galaxy f41 is only available on flipkart but what's really interesting about this partnership are some really cool offers okay so first up it's going on sale on october 16th at rupees 16 triple nine but like i said the flipkart partnership means some really interesting offers see during the big billion days sale it will be available at rupees 15 499 which is a nice discount of almost 1500 rupees but there's more the galaxy f41 is applicable with flipkart smart upgrade plan in which you just have to pay 70 of the full price upfront and you get to keep the device for a year at that price now if you want to keep the device after a year you can pay the remaining 30 amount or you know return the device now that's a nice offer plus there's 10 cashback on sbi cards so with the big billion days deal the flipkart smart upgrade offer where you only have to pay 70 price and the 10 percent sbi card discount you can effectively get the galaxy f41 for rupees 974 i mean that's a great deal because the f41 seems like a solid offering at this price you get the fhd plus super amoled 64 megapixel triple cameras a massive battery and the good one ui experience but yeah the chipset is still the same exodus 96 11. anyway what do you guys think of the new galaxy f41 and the flipkart smart upgrade plan tell us your
