[Music] let's face it the biggest doubter on snapdragon 8 gen 1 has been the throttling so we decided to put all the 8 gen 1 phones we have to an ultimate throttling test and you know what the results are really surprising especially the winner i also checked for any heating issues in these phones because i recently read about one of these phones hitting 75 degrees yeah that's crazy so we have six agent one phones the xiaomi 12 pro the oppo find x5 pro the galaxy s22 ultra the galaxy s 22 the icon 9 pro and the motorola edge 30 pro all of these phones come with agent 1 lpddr5 ram ufs 3.1 storage so yeah they're pretty mashed in terms of specs now to make things fair all of these phones are on the same standard i have reset these phones they are on the same google account and apart from the stock pre-installed apps i've only installed cpu throttling test app antutu and 3dmark the phones are also on the same wifi network bluetooth is turned off screens are set to max brightness with auto brightness turned off resolution set to fhd plus and the refresh rate set to auto or 120hz the default in these phones also there are no apps running in the background as you can see and i checked and these phones are on the latest software update also all of these phones are over 90 when it comes to battery and i'm gonna start with the cpu throttling test and i'm going to do three tests a 20 threads 15 minutes test of 50 threats 30 minutes test and a super intensive hundred threads one hour test yeah it's gonna be stressful so here's the first test in action and you will notice that the iq9 pro is the first one to taste blood quite literally the graph goes red orange pretty quickly and this is just the first test the xiaomi 12 pro is the second and it directly goes to red i mean i was expecting this from the 12 pro because i've seen how big the throttling is on this phone and yeah you can just see it going red red red i also noticed that the s22 ultra and s22 have lowered the brightest maybe to cool things down anyway after a while the moto h30 pro also starts to throttle a bit and so does the galaxy s 22 the find x5 pro and the s22 is just solid with no brightness lowering or throttling also the iq9 pro lowers the brightness after a while too now here are the final scores of the first test xiaomi 12 pro throttle to 57 yeah that is bad the oppo flagship is good at 70 and the s22 ultra was closed too at 69 percent nice it thrown a bit at the end but it was good the s22 throttled to 62 percent the ip9 pro was the worst at 53 percent and the h30 pro was pretty good at 70 plus the h30 pro had the best max performance next up we did the 53 30 minutes test and this time the xiaomi 12 pro just goes red very quickly and you'll notice its graph remain red all the time the ico 9 pro starts to throttle too so does the h30 pro and also the galaxy s2 but what's interesting is that the xiaomi 12 pro's graph is consistently red and now even the icon 9 pro it's deep red i mean i remember people from a team going by patega tony now the s2 ultra and the s28 also start to throttle a bit but it's not as bad the h30 pro also goes red after a while and here are the end results of the test the ico 9 pro is the absolute worst throttling to 41 percent xiaomi 12 pro is also bad quite expectedly at 53 percent and the h30 pro also throttled quite a bit to 60 percent the oppo and samsung flagships were pretty good with all of them around 70 yeah that is good after this we moved to the ultimate hundred threads one r test here we go now once again the xiaomi 12 pro goes red yeah like always the s32 also starts to throttle a lot but it picks up later on moving to yellow which is good and after a while the ico 9 pro joins the xiaomi 12 pro and goes red yes rodney on these phones is pretty bad the h2a2 ultra and the fine x5 pro also start to throttle but the moto h30 pro is surprisingly impressive with the graph being green for a long time now this was a long intensive test so it's not surprising that the s22 ultra and even the fine xy pro also start going orange at around 28 29 minutes the s22 and the h30 pro on the other hand are very impressive anyway after the full 1r these are the scores the s282 was the best it only throttled to 83 which is mighty impressive the moto x30 pro is also good at 78 percent now all the other phones did throttle with the find x5 pro and s2 ultra in the 60s but like always the xiaomi 12 pro and the iq 9 pro are real bad i mean 49 and 42 also i did check the temperatures after this test and the phones that throttled due to the heat were the lowest the xiaomi 12 pro was at 41 degrees the 5x5 pro was hot at 47 degrees the s22 ultra was fine at 41 42 degrees same with the s22 the icon 9 pro was also the same the moto h30 pro was higher at around 45 degrees now so far we've got an idea but i did a couple of more throttling tests now before we get to that this video took a lot of time these tests took a lot of time so it'll be real nice if you hit the like button so the next test i did is the antutu throttling test i ran out to do consecutively on these phones because andrew is a test of cpu gpu ram storage everything now i had planned to run 9 to 10 times but some phones just gave up so here's added the version 9.3.3 on all the phones in the first test and these were the scores of the phone the scores are good especially if the iq 9 pro hitting the million mark the 5x5 pro and the s2a2 have strangely scored in the 800k region now i was running these tests and i noticed that the screen practice a lot of phones have lowered probably to cut down on the heat the xiaomi 12 pro and the ico 9 pro are the dimmest followed by s282 ultra and the s22 one interesting thing i never saw the fine x5 pro or the motorola s30 pro dial down the brightness or anything in any test basically anyway so in the third test and do just crashed on the xiaomi 12 pro with multiple prompts of device overheating that's basically become unusable so i removed it after the third test after the fourth test these are the scores and you can see that almost every phone has throttled except for ico 9 pro surprise surprise maybe it's designed to not throttle in this benchmark because in the fifth and final test the iq9 pro started overheating it got this prompt and when we checked the temperature on the screen was hitting 53 degrees that is hot now here are the final scores of the fifth antutu run and every phone has lowered the score but the best is the motorola h30 pro last but not the least i did a 3d mark wildlife extreme test to check for any gpu throttling i know what the results were actually quite the opposite from cpus rotli so here are all the phones running 3dmark and this is the first score from this benchmark all these agent one phones are kind of in the same range in terms of the score and the fps but here are the phones in their 10th consecutive wildlife extreme run test and you can see how some screens have kind of dimmed i also check the temperature mid test because i think that gives us a better idea and the xiaomi 12 pro is at 45 degrees fine x5 pro is at 44.45 s22 ultra is at 42 degrees s22 is at 40 iq 9 pro hitting 50 once again and the moto at 43 degrees now here are the final scores of the test and see how the xiaomi 12 pro and iq 9 pro actually done the best it's super surprising the 5x5 pro is decent too but the s2 ultra and the s30 pro have throttled and the s42 is pretty bad here so those are all the throttling tests that we did and it's clear that all of these eight in one phones throttle in some tests or the other i know these throttling issues might not affect your day-to-day performance but when you buy a flagship smartphone you want flagship performance all the time anyway overall if you ask me the oppo find x5 pro was the best overall phone in this throttling test it was fairly good balance with the cpu throttling tests and it was good decent with the gpu throttling test i think it got a little hot at times but the brightness never dipped and there were no crashes or anything the second best in my opinion would be the motorola h30 pro yes it did throttle pretty hard in the gpu test but it was a very good performer in the cpu throttling test the s28 ultra and the s22 also did decently in the cpu throttling test but they did throttle like the s30 pro in the gpu test lastly the xiaomi 12 pro and iq9 pro the unlikely winners in the gpu throttling test but the problem is their cpu throttle so much they also get quite hot so can't really say they have been good anyway this was interesting right comment below if you want us to do more throttling tests on you know mid-range phones snapdragon 870 phones you get the idea also give the video a like because yeah it was stressful and we need some likes also share this video and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos that's me signing off thanks
