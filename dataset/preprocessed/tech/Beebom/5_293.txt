[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a page from vivo calm and this here is the brand new redmi note 9 probe and well as the title gives away I have kind of mixed feelings around this new smartphone well I'm sure you excited about this new redmi note 9th row so what are you waiting for let's check it out okay so like I said I have mixed feelings for the redmi note 9 probe because there are some things I like and some things I don't anyway if you're wondering what's exactly new with the redmi note 9 Pro well this is the phone that brings a new design a new chipset new new cameras and a bigger battery so let's start off with the design first oh so this is the Aurora blue variant of the note time pro and it looks striking it's got it a glass fight back and well this new color looks really nice you can also notice this new rectangular sort of camera module and I'm not sure I like it much especially because it's protruding quite a bit anyway the phone also has a metallic frame which adds to the premium feed and on the front you now have a center punch hole which looks nice there's also the side mounted fingerprint scanner just like the poco x2 and also the readme six phones and it's pretty fast so yeah the redmi note i pro brings a slightly more premium design into and i like it no doubt but it's another big phone I mean it's not as hefty as say the poco X 2 or 3 may 6th row but nevertheless it's a big phone okay message time dear smartphone makers especially xiaomi and real me please stop making these big hefty phones we need phones that are compact and that fit in the hands anyway that message aside the phone has the triple slot for two SIM cards and a micro SD slot the usual button is the headphone jack the single speaker and the USB C port on the bottom now the design is something that i fairly liked but I said mixed feelings and that's probably due to this display the redmi note 9 pro comes with a six point six seven inch full HD plus IPS LCD display and it's a nice display but it's your regular 60 Hertz display now I would have been ok with this but the problem is we now have the real miss six with the 90s display the poco x2 with 120 Hertz display well to be honest the companies are giving us these high refresh rate LCDs while I would happily take a 60 Hertz AMOLED panel anyway coming to the note bro yeah the display is well it feels kind of short-handed nobody wanted the specs the redmi note I'm Pro does bring in a new chipset but it isn't exactly an upgrade the phone comes with the new Snapdragon 7 to anyg chipset with up to 6 gb ram 128 gb storage now snapdragon 720 G is a fairly powerful chipset but it isn't exactly an upgrade over the g9 TT I mean just check out the benchmark scores here are the end of the scores of the note time pro versus the readme 6 and you can notice that the g9 TT is just a tad bit high it's not a big difference so yeah the 720 G is good but not exactly an update having said that the real world performance is what actually matters and that's an area where I'm fairly positive about the note I'm Pro I've been using this phone and when the performance has been smooth plus the 720 G handles games just fine I mean as you can see babji mobile runs smooth so yeah I'm positive but yes I have put in my sim card and this for to use it as my daily driver so I will get a better idea soon now the cameras are where things have been upgraded with Sora I mean on paper it does not look like it but I'm hoping it isn't update so the redmi note 9 pro comes with a forty eight megapixel f 1.7 primary camera and I know the noted pro had a 64 megapixel camera but this is the new Samsung ISO self gm2 sensor and let's face it megapixels don't really matter so we'll see how it goes anyway the rest of the specs remains the same an ultra wide-angle camera a macro lens which hasn't upgraded to 5 megapixels and has autofocus now and there's the usual depth sensor now the specs look fine and their features like improved night mode which is available for selfies to a pro color mode feature to boost colors and photos Pro Mode and video recording kind of the scope in short video which looks pretty fun and more when it comes to selfie camera well it's a 16 megapixel F 2.2 camera now I know the noted pro had a 20 megapixel selfie camera but yeah I will be testing it out now if you're wondering why no camera samples well we aren't allowed to show you the camera samples just yet but don't worry we'll be doing an extensive camera test of the redmi note 9 pro in our next video so stay tuned next up is the battery which is actually an upgrade but it's still a little mixed back I mean the note I Pro packs in a massive five thousand to a mah battery and honestly I love big batteries I'm all in for great battery life but you know what else I love fast charging and well-read me has bundled an 18 watt fast charger in the box it's kind of okay honestly the Polk was 27 watt charger real means 30 watt charge I have just raised my expectations so a faster charge up would have been nice to charge this big 5000 mAh battery but yeah I will be testing out the 18 watt charger that comes in the box and see how long it takes to charge this battery apart from that the redmi note I'm Pro has the me UI 11 based on Android 10 and it's got all the features we all love if you're wondering about the bloatware you do get these apps pre-installed and not just ease apps is even this games folder where you can uninstall these and that's something I'm going to do right away anyway there's one thing I don't like and that's the fact that like the noted pro and the real mistakes the redmi note 9 pro does have the wide one and one license as you can see here but the problem is there's no support for HD in Netflix and prime video as you can see Netflix is playback specification page this shows the wide one l-3 license and maximum playback resolution as SD so yeah this is kind of weird and I really hope let me fix is this pretty soon so rad was the redmi note time pro and at the time of shooting this video we do not know the price of the phone now if you think about it the readme six pro also has a Snapdragon 720 G and it surprised that 17 K but I just really hope that the redmi note I'm Pro surprised less than 15 K because otherwise it just wouldn't make sense I mean there's a poco x2 which is odd with more feature pack the more powerful phone at just 16 K so yeah look the point is the redmi note 9 pro is a phone that brings some good changes there's the new design the center punch hole on the front is nice the bigger battery is pretty awesome the 720 G chipset is fine and the cameras are something I am yet to test out having said that a high any fresh rate or even AMOLED would have made things way better just imagine this phone with an amulet is clear then there's the fact that a faster say 2700 charger would have been nicer also know HD on Netflix and prime video is kind of a big issue so yeah the NotI pro is a nice phone but it isn't going to blow your mind and I know the question is should you buy the redmi note 9 pro or three mistakes that's something they are going to answer soon so stay tuned and drop down any questions you might have in the comments down below but ad was our first impressions of the redmi note 9 pro and if you enjoyed it give this video
