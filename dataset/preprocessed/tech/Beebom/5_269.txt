[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is patient boom calm and everyone out there is talking about is for teens new features like the home screen widgets the app library and whatnot most of which is and are inspired by the way but I'm going to talk about something different I'm going to talk about is what is new exciting privacy features which by the way blow away Android completely destroy androids privacy features so this is the iPhone 11 Pro running iOS 14 beta so let's talk about the new privacy features let's compare to Android let's get started okay so is has always been the more privacy friendly OS we all know that and is for teens privacy features are pretty amazing I mean I've been using a 1 plus a trying the Android 11 beta and coming from that to the iPhone now it's just a big difference in terms of privacy features CIOs 14 has completely changed or I think revamped is the current word so it has completely revamped all of the permissions that we use every single day first of all it has this local network permission that I wasn't even aware of I mean when I was just kind of setting up the iPhone for use I installed Facebook and open it up and I got this prompt Facebook would like to connect to other devices on my network now that's insane and yeah like I said I did not even know this existed it's basically means Facebook communicates and it's kind of spying on other devices that are on my network now it's not just Facebook I also installed pubsey mobile on the iPhone I mean obviously I need a little break and surprise surprise I got the same local network permission prompt from pop G mobile as well now the interesting fact is I hate Donal on both the apps and the world like normal so they don't really need it but they want it which makes me wonder if they're taking this permission by default on Android also as you can see even YouTube wants this permission now coming back to the user permissions that we use every single day on August 14 you know every time an app is using the camera or the microphone see when you allow an app like say Instagram to use the camera you get this green dot on the top just around the right of the not see this yeah it's a very subtle dot but this lets you know that your camera is in use save with a microphone when the mic is active you get the orange dot that looks like this so you know how we all have this conspiracy theory that apps are listening to us beat Facebook you you bought Instagram and they show us these ads based on what we talked about well with these green and orange dots on the top we at least know when an app is using the camera or the mic and that's definitely good to know even the control center now shows you the app that recently took the camera or the mic permission and again it's very handy and it obviously does not have a similar feature but me you why does I remember using me you are 12 and it also has these icons for when Mike location or cameras being used it's great but most probably we will see it in Android next year maybe and if it's not just the camera or the mic permission I use 40 make sure that no app has access to all of the photos or media in your phone see generally when I install a photo rating app to say I did one photo or two I have to give it permission to access all of the media stored on the phone and shouldn't the app be getting access to only that one or two photo that I want to edit well I did not think of this ever but iOS 14 brings the exact same feature okay so let me give you an example so when I try editing a photo on one of the photo editing apps on the iPhone there are three options select photos allow access to all photos don't allow now when I select photos I select the photos I want to edit and the photo editing app only gets access to that one photo or the photos I've selected it works in every single app so I don't have to give complete access to my photo library or even the videos to any of the apps out there how awesome is this it's crazy good next up in location permission has more control in iOS 14 see on the iPhone I don't have to give every single app my exact location basically where I live or where I'm going and that's super useful I mean I want to check into Facebook from time to time but I don't want it to know exactly where I am and that's where I use for teens new approximate location comes in so when Facebook asks you for the location permission like Android and iOS you get these three options allow once a law while using the app and don't allow this is fine but what's actually interesting is this precise button here see so I can turn this off and you can see the blue dot turning into a big circle which means the app isn't getting my pinpoint location it's getting an approximation which is fine because it's still listing you all the popular places nearby to check in now I know some apps like say uber will my precise location so you can give them that permission from the settings either way this is a super cool privacy feature because this way abs don't know where I live the places I go to and any other personal detail and it's great now on with more control and more functionality in the camera and mic permission the location permission is what it also makes it tough for companies and apps to track users I mean we know that certain apps trackers right but can we do anything about it now we can on iOS see the apps attract you they will have to ask you guys specifically if you want to be tracked yep that's right in the privacy settings there is a new tracking option where you can allow apps to request you to track yeah I'm gonna deny that request every single time even the Wi-Fi settings there's a new option use private address which prevents network operators from tracking you iPhone by basically using a random MAC address now this is the feature that's present in Android but super useful another interesting thing I came across on Twitter is that is 14 now notifies you when an app of widget accesses the clipboard without even asking for permission so I can just copy something from notes and now when I open Chrome it says on the top chrome pasted from notes which means it acts as the clipboard well another thing I did not know and this is useful because sometimes you have things like bag account details copy Safari to has new privacy features now I honestly don't use Safari on my macbook air or on the iPhones when I'm using an iPhone but it has got more secure and private how do you think it has this tracking report feature which lists down all the cross side trackers that are being blocked by the tracking prevention feature in Safari now you can see that Safari even blocks Google Analytics tractus is basically blocking Google from getting info now let's compare it to Chrome but wait why should we I mean chrome is meant for tracking right with I use 14 you'll also be able to sign into more apps using sign-in with Apple because you'll be able to upgrade your usual Google or Facebook accounts to sign in with Apple accounts so you will be able to sign in with Apple in different apps with ease because it does not require to remember passwords it only gives over your name and know the details so it's a lot more private and very easy apart on that with the future iOS squating update app store listings will have a separate privacy information section where you'll see all the permissions our app is taking and this is a feature that Android has add for quite some years so yeah it's definitely good to see it on iOS so that was a lot of great privacy features in iOS 14 and I'm pretty sure all of you guys know that I've always been an Android fan and I still honestly like Android more but when it comes to privacy features iOS 14 on the iPhone is just way more impressive look I understand now why people have this perception of iPhones being more private and secure it's actually not a perception it's true coming from Android level let me just say that the latest Android version feels it's kind of basic in terms of privacy and security features now that I've used I was 14 on the iPhone if you ask me Android is just not there see a lot of iris 14 features are inspired from Android I know that so I hope Android 12 brings privacy features inspired by iOS 40 well iris 14 has a long list of new features and Apple did not talk about them as stage but we have a detailed article on the same so check it out from the link down below and you have to tell us your favorite privacy feature in iOS 4
