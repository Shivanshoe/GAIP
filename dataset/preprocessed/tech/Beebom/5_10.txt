yes it's actually happening oneplus is in the same we all know that coincidence not oneplus completely changed ever since carl pay left the company in 2020 and if you look at it there are three major things that happened after he left the company oneplus merged with oppo oxygen os changed into color os the iconic alert slide died almost basically oneplus phones lost their identity they just became rebranded open phones now while all this was happening on the other side of the world there has been a new oneplus in the making no not iko as a lot of people would make you believe i'm talking about nothing nothing is the new oneplus why do i say this well oneplus nothing shared a lot of similarities starting with the most prominent one remember carl pay yeah it's the same mind behind both oneplus and nothing and it shows heavily in nothing's new marketing strategies in the past one plus phones are always hyped up by the company slowly dropping info on the new phones look closely and you'll find nothing using the same slowly build hype model of publicity nothing first is that it's making a phone then they made the nothing phone one official the nothing phone one they also gave a sneak peek of the design and announced that the phone one will be part by the snapdragon chipset then they confirm the transparent back design features like wireless charging they've even announced that the nothing phone ones sold in india will be manufactured in india and now they've also revealed the design of the phone this is the back of the nothing phone one in white and you can also see the lights here which might act as a notification led flash for the camera wireless charging coil marker yeah it is interesting it's clear that kalpa is using his oneplus experience to feel the hype train of nothing another similarity between oneplus and nothing is the experience the one thing that we always loved about oneplus in the past was oxygen os and nothing wants us to feel the same about the new nothing os we've already seen that nothing launcher follows the whole nothing design language with its dot matrix like fonts it's retro sort of widgets but that's not important what's important is that like oxygen os in the past nothing claims that nothing os will bring a clean pure android like experience with nothing but the essentials nothing in its blog post says nothing os is designed to deliver a fast smooth and personal experience this does ring a bell right i mean one plus in the past has time and again used the whole fast and smooth tagline for its phones and its os everything the third big similarity is the whole value for money factor which we all indians absolutely love oneplus was a huge success because it brought a fairly premium experience and value for money price points yeah that changed but nothing is also focusing on real value for money just take the nothing ear one it looks premium and unique it is fairly value for money and it's a successful product nothing phone one should also be kind of the same look we don't know the price yet but i am expecting it to undercut the competition to really capture that market share see overall in the past oneplus always brought something new to its products and nothing is kind of moving in the same direction in fact carl pays vision nothing is far bigger than oneplus in three key areas ecosystem privacy and design nothing has made it clear that they want to create an ecosystem like apple and with the nothing phone one they will now have a device at the center of that ecosystem that's not going to be easy with nothing using a third-party os like android but the difference was is apple is unlike apple's walled garden nothing wants to create an open garden where different third-party devices work with nothing devices like they would in an ecosystem we already seen a demo of nothing voice's integration with devices like the airpods or even with tesla cars and they want this integration with all kinds of third-party devices in fact in the interview with wired carpet revealed that they want to help third parties create devices and add support for them in nothing devices the ecosystem is something that will take time to build it's clear but it's nice to see a startup like nothing focus on that right from the start nothing also wants to focus on privacy carpe was right when he said that companies have become evil in our minds thanks to privacy issues and this is true and nothing wants to be the catalyst of change when it comes to privacy nothing has also put a special emphasis on the design nothing has made it clear that it wants to emulate dyson's clean and premium designs and in fact dyson's former design head adam bates recently joined nothing to serve as its design director this is interesting because transparent designs look really great when done right and nothing will be using this design language across its products i mean this does look unique in a sea of phones that look the same apart from all this one big advantage that nothing has over oneplus is that it is not a bpk company it is an independent company with independent investors the investors in nothing are high profile creative investors and not a big multinational like bbk so innovation is something that will be a big focus at nothing unlike oneplus which has now become more of a mainstream smartphone brand which isn't any different than any other brand that bbk owns nothing should be a more creative tech company that focuses on people like you and me that they geeks and tech enthusiasts kalpa has already said that nothing wants to be the culture makers like apple was in its early days see ultimately if you look at phones in 2022 which is that one phone that has created excitement it has to be nothing the nothing phone one which we almost know nothing about has to be one of the most hyped phones of 2022 and honestly i'm genuinely excited for this phone i'm something new is coming after a long long time and i'm just hoping that it's good and if nothing manages to replicate the sucks the oneplus it'll be great news for all the tech fans around the world
