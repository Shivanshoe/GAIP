[Applause] [Music] so me aware has to be one of the most popular Android platforms out there and especially in India where Xiaomi is the leading smartphone brand it's crazy popular now we all know that me UI speech backpacks and a lot of cool tricks but when I was using the poco x2 for a full review I found that there are a number of key settings that you should change right away to enhance your experience now I will be telling you 7 me UI setting you should change but at the end I'll be reading down quickly a lot of other settings so make sure to watch this video till the very end now let's get started ok I know papa launcher has an app drawer but phones like the redmi note 8 pro let me ate a lot of other deadly foods come with the usual me why launcher that does not have an app drawer so probably wondering how do you enable it when it's not exactly there well the good news is me when launches alpha build has an app drawer built in so what you can do is just install this build on your phone the link is down below and when you have installed it you can enable the app drawer just go to home screen settings like this here you should find this new home screen option and as you can see features are setting to enable the abroad but I can just turn it on and it's here the ad-rock I know it's a lot like the poco launches app drawer but I'm just glad it's here on me when launched a goodbye message the home screens or there's one more feature in the home screen settings that you should probably enable this blur app previews this basically browse on the app in the multitasking page so you can maybe blur out the Galilee so that when you hand over the phone to that creepy someone they don't see anything from the recent screen it's pretty handy look we all know about ads and me why and the fact that you can disable it but recently a tweet was going around that showed really weird ads in me wise browser when I checked it out in the poco x2 and indeed look at this this is bad really I mean how could Xiaomi be okay with this so if you use the me eyebrows and hate seeing these you can turn it off just go to the browser settings here and you can see this option called content feed right well just turn it off and that's it all the weird recommendation content it's gone the browser is clean and nice and you can start using it having to go through any of these cringe-worthy content also while you're at it you can check out her article to remove all the ads in me UI from the link below so I remember when I first tried out me UI 11 the latest update I was really impressed with the whole new refreshed you why the revamp AB the animations but one thing that really stood out for me was the new font so as you can see here from our older me UI 11 video me 11 had a brand new font which looks very cool but this was the Chinese norm of me or 11 the me UI 11 updated in India does not bring this fun you get the same point you had with the older me who I versions well the good news is the me UI 11 font is available in the team store so you would just go to themes app on your from device now here go to the phones page and search for Milan pro yeah that's the name of for now just apply this forth which will require a reboot but trust me the me UI 11 native font just makes the UI look way more modern and just really nice I liked it now on privacy issue I have noticed in Android is the fact that anyone can access that quick settings from the lock screen and yeah think about it anyone can go ahead and put your phone into a pin more or you know turn of GPS even if you phone is locked this could be bad if your phone is told but thankfully there's an option in me you are 11 that fixes this so just go to the settings you go to the notifications and tap on the first option here lock screen notifications well here you can see this option open notification shade or lockscreen I'll just turn it off and well no one can access the notification shade if your phone is locked now now this is an important option enable so go ahead do it so emergency SOS is an important setting in me you wider you've changed right away I mean this is a feature that's going to be super useful in emergency situations so check it out so this basically lets you send an SOS text message with your location and call history to your chosen emergency contact by just rapidly pressing the power button it's very you so you should enable it now you'll find the emergency SOS option in settings passwords and security here just turn it on after which it will ask you to at least add one emergency contact to note that you can add multiple emergency contacts anyway once you've added a contact it will be enabled there's also this send call history option that you should enable lesson case honestly you never know when you land up in an emergency so yeah enable this right away so this is a super handy me UI option that has been right in front of me but I've missed out see I'm talking about the ability to set a countdown for DND and silent so here's how it works so in the volume panel you just press the three-dot button which lets you control volume for ringer and alarm along with an option to turn on do not disturb or put your phone on silent mode now the interesting thing here is if you turn on d ND or silent from this panel you get this countdown button so say I wanted to put my phone on silent for just around an hour I can set this countdown to 1 R and after this countdown runs out the silent mode will be turned off how awesome is that that is super handy so this me you are sitting is exclusively for Ed McKay twin E and K to any pro uses and I'm talking about fingerprint shortcuts so what this feature does is it lets you access some shortcuts by the fingerprint scanner like this yeah I can just hold the fingerprint scanner and access the queue of called scanner the browser search or I didn't even do the calendar so here's how it turns on just go to settings you go to password security and here tap on fingerprint lock now in this page you can see this shortcuts option right well this is it just go ahead turn it on now just choose the press and hold option or the quick swipe option I prefer press and hold so now I think just press hold on the scanner and get these shortcuts yeah it's handy but it'd be even better if you could add your own customized shortcuts on it say a me or a 12-8 not now pardon these settings that I just talked about there are a number of other cool and who's with me you are settings that you should check out right now now let me just quickly run them down for you first up in the phone app settings and here the incoming call settings I really like this option of quite ringer when lifted well turn it on and the next time you get a call and you lift your phone the phone will go silent I wasn't aware of the speech it's straight oh and by the way here you can also set the calls to answer automatically when a Bluetooth headset is connected yeah this used to come in super handy during my pulse' days next up in the Notes app just go to the tasks tab and here go to settings where you'll find this task toolbox feature just enable this and it will activate this cool tasks page that is accessible from any page any app you can see on your tasks add a new one you can even add a voice task yes it's pretty awesome lastly you can download this me--why hidden Settings app to access some well hidden settings from EUI there are a lot of cool things to play with here and you can see here that this app lets you access the notification law which I'm sure some people will find handy now part of these are a lot of other meow settings that you should check out and we have a detailed article on the same so go ahead and check it out but those were some EU are settings that you should be changing right now to really enhance yumi UI experience it is there any other setting that I kind of missed out on
