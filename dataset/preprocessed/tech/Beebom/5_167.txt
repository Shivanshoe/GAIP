[Music] [Applause] so [Music] hey guys this is patimbio.com and samsung phones are super popular in india and that means a lot of you guys use one ui as a daily driver now i know that you all know about one of your features tips and tricks and whatnot but i think there are some really cool some hidden one ui settings that you should be changing right away now before i talk about one ui settings i want to give a huge shout out to our sponsors for this video wondershare mobile trans which solves a big problem well mobile translates to transfer whatsapp data be chats media links from an android

right now and you can also get 20 off on wondershare mobile transfer with this coupon code so check out mobile trans and the 5g phone giveaway from the link in the description down below [Music] see i'm someone who has been guilty of putting my phone on silent and then forgetting to put it back on ringer and vibrate and as a result missing a lot of important calls now we generally just use the volume button to mute calls or put it on vibrate and one ui even has a quick setting toggle for this but there's another very interesting option i'm talking about temporary mute so a lot of people don't know that in quick settings you can just press the text in the toggles to get more options then and there so i can expand the sound toggle and when i set the phone on mute i get this temporary mute option right below i can turn it on and then tap on details to set the mute time i can set it to an hour two hours or even set a custom time so this way the phone will automatically go back to ringer after an hour or whatever time you have set super handy if you want to put your phone to silent for a meeting or a class maybe [Music] so i've been using the s21 as my daily driver and there are times in the day when i'm just using the phone casually and i don't want the phone's battery to drain a lot so i just turn on the power saving mode which limits cpu speed turns off aod etc but this also changes the screen refresh rate to standard from adaptive now i don't like that but the good news is there is a way to use the 120 hertz adaptive refresh rate with the power saving mode turned on here are the steps now all you need to do is go to the motion smoothness settings in display and here select adaptive but don't hit apply just yet then press hold on the power saving mode toggle in quick settings here just choose the battery saving options and turn on the power saving mode now open the recent screen and go back to the motion smoothness page now as you can see here adaptive is not supported it's grayed out but it is in fact selected now i can hit apply and well i am using the 120 hertz mode with power saving mode turned on awesome trick right [Music] so the power button in samsung phones can be used to activate bixby but the truth is nobody absolutely nobody uses bixby but one ui has a side key option in the settings that lets you open up any app or open the camera instead of bixby but there's no way to set it to google assistant at least natively well what you can do is you can install this app by xda called bixby button remapper i'll leave a link to the apk below now just install it and then go to sidekick settings here select open up and here select bixby button assistant remapper app now whenever you double click on the power button it will open up google assistant [Music] well if you're samsung user i'm pretty sure you've got these spammy notifications aka ads i mean when i was using the galaxy s21 ultra i got a notification to buy the s21 ultra so yeah that's not cool but you know what there is a way to you know disable these spammy notifications in one ui so all you need to do is head to settings privacy and turn off receive marketing information if it's on now this is it but there are a few other things you need to set right while setting up the phone first up when you get this page you can only agree to the first two things here and you'll be fine and this also disables the promotional notifications by default another hidden setting while setup is in this page you can see how at the very end it says by tapping done you agree to the policies of glance the promotion lock screen feature my galaxy galaxy store search within apps and discover now in the past i've always tapped done and when i got these weird notifications from these apps i used to wonder i haven't even opened this app once how is it sending me notifications anyway samsung has very cleverly hidden the option to not agree to these apps policies you can just tap here and as you can see you get all of these options to untick each app one by one so the usual share panel in one ui is filled with all the apps but the cool thing is you can actually choose what apps you want to see in span all you need to do is install good lock from the galaxy store then install the home up module now in home up there is this share manager option where you can select apps you want to see in the share panel to give an idea i can just select these four apps and now when i share something say in the gallery app i only get these four apps in the share panel this is actually great now it's not just a share panel the home up module in good lock is actually very useful i love this folder title suggestion feature which is basically ai suggesting folder names i also like that i can back up the home screen and restore it when i switch to another samsung phone now that's not all i can also change the look and feel of the multitasking screen i mean good lock is something every single one ui user should install and try i mean the modules are awesome so try it out [Music] fingerprint scanners especially the on-screen ones on samsung phones aren't necessarily the fastest we all know that and there are some tips and tricks to speed things up but there is one option in one ui that you should be checking out so just go to settings here search for optimized battery usage and then go to it now this page shows you all the apps whose battery usage is being optimized anyway here tap on this and select all to show all the apps now here just search for com.samsung.android.biometrics and as you can see battery optimization is turned on for this which is strange but yeah you can just disable this and you should get slightly faster response when it comes to the fingerprint scanner [Music] now one ui comes with a call recorder built in which is great i mean in a call you can just tap on this menu button and hit record call to just start the recorder so this is handy but there's another one ui setting that you should enable i'm talking about auto record calls in the call settings there is this record calls option which has the auto call records option which you can just turn on like this now what's interesting is that you can customize which calls you want to record just tap here and you get these options i can set the phone to record all the calls or record calls from unknown numbers or record calls from only specific numbers or contacts [Music] because i was talking about the issues while set up in samsung phones and there is one more thing that i think you must have noticed while setting things up i'm talking about this unused absolutely put to sleep to extend battery life now i get it but this hampers the performance because this kills apps in the background now this feature is enabled by default and while you can disable it then and there you can also disable it in the settings in the battery settings there is an option called app power management now here you can just disable the put unused apps to sleep option now another thing you can do here is you can manually select apps that you don't use that much and add it to sleeping apps or even deep sleeping apps you can even select the apps that you don't want to sleep ever so yeah there's a lot of control and this way you can make sure that one ui does not kill the apps you use a lot in the background [Music] see lower end or budget samsung phones don't really offer the best performance or the best ram management and this is where the device care widget comes in really handy so not many people know this but in the widget space there is the device care widget and the four by one widget here shows you the storage used as well as the ram used it also has this optimize button on the right which lets you clear cache and clear ram in a single click i mean i know a lot of budget phone users who use third-party optimizer apps so this native feature is something that they should be using on their phones well those are all the cool one ui settings that you should be changing right away and i've tried these out on the galaxy s21 as well as the galaxy m31s so yeah go ahead change them right now also tell us in the comments which one ui setting did you like the most also give this video like make sure to share it with your samsung
