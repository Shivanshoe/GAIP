[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and today i'm here to talk about the new iphones the iphone 12 so the next iphone launch is still a couple of months away with the whole delay due to go with 19 but you know what i actually have the brand new iphone 12 yeah i know this is fake but last year too we received a fake iphone 11 and it turned out to be very close to the real thing and these fake iphone 12s are actually close to what the rumored iphone 12 is supposed to look like so you know what this video is going to tell you all about the upcoming iphones and what to expect from it well let me start by telling you that according to fairly reliable rumors we're getting four new iphones this year an iphone 12 and iphone 12 max and iphone 12 pro and an iphone 12 pro max now if you're wondering shouldn't the new iphones be called iphone 11s so according to reports this year we'll see a major design revamp in the iphones and does the iphone 12 moniker not the iphone 11s now i have three pairs of these mock-up iphones with this probably being the iphone 12 max since the iphone 12 is rumored to be smaller and more compact then this should be the iphone 12 pro because the pro version is always compact and then this should be the iphone 12 pro max because obviously max now as you can see i have these fake iphones in black as well as white but the finish is what really interests me i mean one thing you can probably notice in the probable iphone 12 pro and the iphone 12 pro max is that both have the matte finish be it on the black variant or the white variant and when the matte finish especially on the black one looks and feels really cool i hope the actual iphone 12 pro comes in matte black too although leaks such as the new iphone 12 pro and pro max will come in a new navy blue color which in these images looks really cool as for the iphone 12 its mockup has the glossy finish which i think will actually be the case with the 12 and the 12 max having said that all of them be the iphone 12 max iphone 12 pro or pro max they all have the metal rim design on the frame something that we recently saw in the latest ipad well this has been rumored to come with the new iphones and yet this is very similar to the iphone 4 4s 5 5s etc which had the same squared edges design and you know what i've always been a huge fan of that design so if this is true i'm glad apple is going back to that design anyway you can also see that all three of them have triple cameras very similar to what we saw on the iphone 11 pro last year now the iphone 12 pro and the pro max should come with triple cameras but the iphone 12 and 12 max are said to have dual cameras same as the iphone 11 so these mock-ups aren't right on that front as for the front i can't make up if the notch is smaller in these mock-ups or not which is rumored and apart from that we did not get a charger with these fake iphone 12s and you know what we might actually not get one with the new iphones yep there are a lot of rumors suggesting that the new iphones won't come with a charging brick as well as earpods the headphones apple bundles in the box and i know it sounds crazy but with apple you never know i mean i really hope this rumor remains a rumor because if this happens android manufacturers will start following this trend and we android users will actually suffer so yeah i hope this rumor does not come true anyway data part what about the specs of the new iphones so for the first time ever all the new iphones are said to be coming with oled panels a 5.4 inch oled on the iphone 12 6.1 inch on it on the 12 max 5.8 inch oled on the iphone 12 pro and a 6.7 inch on a display on the iphone 12 pro max not only that all of the new iphones are also said to be coming with pro motion 120 hertz displays and yeah that would be awesome right i mean iphones feel so fluid already 120 hertz would definitely be something plus the face id module including the different sensors the cameras basically the whole shebang will be put in a smaller notch while also bringing faster face identification and other enhancements so yeah fingers crossed when it comes to chipset the new iphone should be powered by the a14 bionic which is said to be the first five nanometer smartphone chipset so it should be more power efficient and obviously very powerful plus it'll be paired with qualcomm's x55 modem for 5g support so that's great for anyone who wants a future-proof iphone as for the memory 4 gb is on the regular iphone 12 and 6 gb on the pro variants with bass variants featuring 128 gb storage on the camera front there are rumors that apple will go with the 64 megapixel main camera on all of these new iphones so let's see now with the usual cameras the pro and the pro max variants will also come with lidar sensors for better ar capabilities again this is something we've seen in the ipad pro 2020 refresh so that's pretty much everything to expect from the new iphones and now coming to the pricing well the new iphones always have heartbreaking band-breaking prices and well the new iphones coming this year are also said to come with a big price bump due to multiple reasons like 5g manufacturing issues with oled and obviously the pandemic so things are going to get more pricey having said that there is a possibility that the iphone 12 which will probably be the cheapest new iphone of the lot will be made in india so with the big price bump i'm not expecting it to be very affordable instead i'm expecting it to be around the same price as the iphone 11. now the pricing aside all of these fake iphone 12s with their design changes all the rumored specs and features point to one thing it's that the iphone 12 all four of them will be a major refresh see if you ask me i'm excited about the new iphones because let's face it we don't get a lot of flagships these days especially in india yup there's samsung and oneplus but if you think about it that's pretty much it so yeah i'm waiting for the new iphone 12 which is probably coming in october anyway what do you guys think are you excited for the iphone 12 do you like the metal rim design that the
