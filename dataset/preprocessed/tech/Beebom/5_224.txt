hey guys this is the oppo f17 pro running the latest color os 11 update so what's new what are the new features well if you ask me i think color os 11 is all about the new customization features but let's start with a few visual changes there also if you're wondering why the color os 11 update after color over 7 well that's because android 11 so converse 11. also make sure to stick till the end to know all the features and to know if your oppo phone will be getting this brand new update [Music] okay so here's the oppo f17 pro running color os 11 next to the oppo a52 running color os 7 and there are a few visual changes to note first off the notification shade as you can see the color os 11 notification shade is way more modern looking especially with that gaussian blur which looks really cool i also noticed that in color rose 11 certain quick setting styles are expandable like wi-fi bluetooth so you don't have to go to their particular setting page there are also two new tiles that are noticed a tile to quickly enable or disable app lock and a toggle to enable black screen mode which reduces screen brightness and restricts the touch screen to save battery now another visual change i noticed is in the settings page i know it looks the same but the options all around are rearranged as you can see the software update and about phone option are at the bottom like it should be and a lot of important features that were kind of spread out now have been added to convenience tools so it's definitely more streamlined now [Music] so the colorized launcher is something that i've always kind of liked especially because it has features like multiple app select and well it's gotten better with the color os 11 update so the biggest change in the launcher is this new toolbar as you can see there's a new modern looking toolbar here which brings more options for quick customizations there's the icons option which lets you well customize the icons and as you can see there's also support for third-party icons which is honestly awesome and something that people have been wanting you can also change the layout right here so you can set the number of apps you want to see in rows and columns now apart from this toolbar i also noticed that you can combine two folders into one very easily just like this you can also quickly bring all the apps in a folder outside the folder using this dismiss button now these are neat little features the approach has a nice little feature too as you can see there's a new manage button in the app drawer which lets you sort apps based on name install time or usage and also lets you select multiple apps to uninstall or add on the home screen [Music] so like i said at the start color os 11 is all about customizations theming and the biggest feature new feature is the new personalizations page in the settings that lets you customize a whole lot of stuff now there's obviously the theme store the fingerprint animations the iphone styles i already showed you and a lot more so i'm going to talk about the real interesting features in this page so in the wallpaper section there's this really cool feature so i can just select a photo i've clicked or i've saved on my phone and i can just use this button this button right here to create wallpapers based on the photo i selected as you can see there are multiple iterations and it's pretty cool there's also the always on display customization page which is actually fun there's the option to create custom patterns and trust me it's just a lot of fun doing this and they're also different textile aod's image options where you can set your own image and different clock styles as well so yeah aod is very customizable in color os level now that's all you can also select a color action for your device and you can have multiple colors or a single colors it's your choice there's also the option to customize the icons in the notification shade choose the font as well as the font weight size and more and you can create your very own cool ringtone yup you can just select the sound type from the library choose from one of the moods choose low or fast and just generate ringtone the results are actually pretty cool just try it out [Music] the dark mode in color os 11 has been improved too see i personally like a true black dark mode on my phone but for people who maybe want a slightly grayish dark mode there are options in color reverse level so in the dark mod settings you can see that there are three new styles enhanced the true black dark mode medium a slightly grayish dark mode gentle which is more like grey mode plus as you can see below there are also options to adjust wallpapers and icons for the dark mode and also reduce contrast in low light [Music] conditions canadores 11 also includes some cool floating window features so i like how easy it is to put an app into a floating window you can just swipe up from an app and hold them to see two options here there's a floating window option and there's a mini drop option so floating window puts the app in this floating window and you can move it around put the app into an even smaller window via mini drop but what's interesting is that you can now drag and drop text from the floating windows to the main windows like this how cool is this [Music] so oppo has been kind of on the front with the whole fast charging bandwagon bringing us crazy fast charging speeds but a lot of people have been asking what about the battery health well the color os 11 update brings a feature aimed at exactly that so there's this new optimized night charging feature that makes sure to optimize the charging speed when you're charging the phone at night so as to not over charge your phone and retain the battery here another new feature on the battery front is super power saving mode which is something we've seen in other platforms but it's definitely a nice feature to [Music] have well colorvoice11 also has a few security and privacy features first you can now hide all your personal apps and access them with a code that only you know so yup that is pretty useful now another useful feature is payment protection that basically makes sure that your sensitive data is secure while you're making payments on apps like google pay or paytm as you can see it checks for things like system integrity and usb data transfer so yeah it's a good feature [Music] apart from those features color os 11 update also brings a few minor tweaks changes and whatnot so let me just quickly run that now first up let me just tell you this that the update does feel very smooth and nice especially with the animations looking more fluid and seamless so that's definitely a change and now coming to other minor features all of the photo editing options in the photos app have improved as you can see there are more filters and they're better named and better looking there are more editing options in the adjust page like exposure highlight shadows the markup tools are also better pronounced with more color and size options gamespace has been improved too with a better ui and options like quick startup and network priority there are new camera features as well there's a new inertial zoom feature which lets you zoom in more smoothly like this while shooting a video there's also a new lens stain detection feature so yeah nice there are also a few audio related features there's the new oppo relax 2.0 app which brings a brand new ui and as you can see side by side it looks a lot better than the older app and there's a lot of different sounds music and colored noise to choose from to help you sleep or relax there are also some stress buster games in the unwind section and a new explore page which lets you listen to white noise from a few cities in the world another cool audio feature is don't use to make sure that when you get consecutive notifications the notification tone is not the same ding it's a melody yeah that's pretty cool lastly you can now share your personal hotspot via qr code and there's a cool three finger translate feature so basically when you take a partial screenshot using the three finger gesture you get this translate button right here so you can translate text in the screenshot with ease quickie so all in all color os 11 does bring quite a few new
