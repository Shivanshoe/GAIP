[Music] this is the new galaxy tab 8 and this is the successor to the very very popular galaxy tab a7 and when samsung launched this i had this question what's new now i'm sure a lot of you guys have the same question so let me answer that today so this is the brand new galaxy tab a8 and the first new thing about this are the subtle design changes first of all the design is slightly more boxy when compared to the tab a7 and that gives the 8 a slightly more premium feel i mean here's the tab 8 and the a7 side by side and you can see that the a8 has more squared off edges moving onto the back the camera module is now circular the samsung logo is now aligned to what i think is the antenna band apart from that it's still a metal back and the silver i think looks good and as for the weight and thickness the galaxy tab 8 is 0.1 inches thicker than the galaxy tab a7 and when it comes to weight it's 34 grams heavier on the front the galaxy tab 8 brings a slightly bigger display emphasis on the slightly because it's only 0.1 inches bigger than the a7 now the rest of the display specs remain kind of similar as you can see it's still a tft display and if you saw best tablets under 20k video you'd know that the tab a7 had a pretty decent display now the tab 8's display is mostly the same with no stylus support and it has similar colors but i did feel the age display was slightly brighter and the viewing angles were definitely better than the a7 as for screen protection samsung did confirm that there's gorilla glass on the galaxy tab 8 which is good however they did not specify which gorilla glass so i'm still waiting on that the tab 8 like the tab a7 has the white 1 license which means there are no issues with netflix playback or any other streaming app there are also quad speakers here with dolby atmos and i really like the speakers on the a7 and it's the same loud and crisp speakers here on the a8 apart from that there's the micro sd and the sim slot for lte variants and there's dual mics ones here and the other ones here moving on from the design the one big change in the galaxy tab 8 is the chipset the galaxy tab a8 comes with the uni soc t618 chipset which is a slightly better version of the d610 that we have seen on the nokia t20 tablet there's also a new memory variant with four gigs of ram anyway talking about the uni soc t618 chipset it is an upgrade over the snapdragon 662 and it shows in the benchmarks and it's not a huge upgrade but the unisoc chipset scores higher in both antutu and geekbench as you can see compared to helio g80 on the real me pad the t618 on the tab 8 is kind of comparable as you can see it's on par in both antutu as well as geekbench so yeah this is good now day-to-day performance i can't really make a judgment right now i've only played with the tablet for a day or so and so far the performance seems good when it comes to gaming the unisd chipset like most chipsets in tablets in this segment is not for hardcore gaming but i played a few casual games and it handled them well as of the software the tab 8 is running one ui 3.1 core on top of android 11 and it comes with samsung knox support yeah there's no android 12 out of the box which is a little sad as for update samsung did not confirm the long term plan of the galaxy tab 8 but they did confirm that this will get the new android 12 update which is good because the real me pad which is not so old isn't getting that anyway coming to software features first of all talking about third party apps the tab 8 comes with netflix spotify and by juice along with microsoft apps and most of them can be uninstalled the tab 8 also comes with samsung tv plus pre-installed and it brings over 160 free channels and i like that it just works without even logging in the tab 8 is also said to be coming with a picture-in-picture screen recorder for students so that you can record your face along with the lecture you're attending the feature isn't available on our units so i think it will be arriving in a future update apart from that they're all the cool multitasking features that you get in one ui on tablets for example i can use the edge panel to drop apps in split screen mode like this yeah this is very handy and it works pretty well i also like that i can open up two instances of the same app so i can open up two chrome tabs side by side like this in fact in the samsung internet browser i can press hold on a link and move it to the left or right and open it in a new tab in split screen yeah this is very very useful this feature also works in other apps like samsung's files app notes app messages etc and apart from urls you can also move text phone numbers email ids etc there's also samsung kids built in and there are all the connected galaxy experience features like clipboard sharing between the a8 and a samsung phone the ability to continue apps on other devices auto switch earphones and more now the rest of the galaxy tab 8 is kind of the same as the galaxy tab a7 there's the same 5 megapixel camera on the front for video calls and send fees and there's an 8 megapixel autofocus camera on the back the battery is same to 7040 image with support for 15 watt charging although like the a7 there's only a 7 watt charger in the box now compared to the pricing of the galaxy tab 8 the wi-fi variant of this tablet starts to be 17 triple nine and the wi-fi plus lte when it starts rupees 21 triple nine now i'll be honest samsung has followed this whole if it ain't broke why fix it motto with the galaxy tab 8. i mean there are a few upgrades the chipset is the big upgrade and competes well against the likes of the readme pad the design has subtle changes but i think it looks better overall the display is a little better although the specs are mostly the same apart from that they're all the cool tablet specific features you get in one ui see overall i have to check the long term performance of the uni soc chipset but my initial impressions of the tab 8 is that it's not a very big upgrade to the very popular tab a7 but it does bring good refinements anyway i want to know what you guys think of the galaxy tab 8 is this a good upgrade to the tab a7 comment below your thoughts in the comment section below also give this video like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing
