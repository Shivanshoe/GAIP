[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from vm.com and we recently did a video on the new oppo renault 4 pro but a lot of you guys asked us to also check out the new oppo watch well we heard you this is the new oppo watch and this is a smartwatch that i've been using for a couple of days now and the experience has been pretty interesting well i'm gonna tell you all about it also we did a really cool unboxing video of this watch on our instagram page we've got a lot of questions so i'm gonna answer them as well so let's begin because first up the oppo watch is available in two variants a 41 millimeter one and a 46 millimeter one well if you want to know the differences between the two we have an article down below so check that out but let me tell you that the 46 millimeter open watch is the more premium one of the two and that's the one we have right here now i know let's face it this looks like the apple watch be the dial or the strap or some of the watch faces so it's clear that this is very much inspired by the apple watch but there's more to this what's up let's talk about that see it's been some time since i used a vero smartwatch but to remember correctly i think there are three most important factors when it comes to smartwatch number one the overall experience because i've used a lot of various smart watches in the past that have turned out laggy and slow number two the communication features like notification handling the calling uh the connectivity etc and number three the battery i mean it's a smart watch so you need at least decent battery life so talking about the experience first the oppo watch brings a very high end experience and there are a lot of factors involved one of them is this beautiful display this is a 1.91 inch dual curved amoled display and it's honestly right up there is one of the great smartwatch displays i've ever used it's bright the black's amazing it's punchy and the high pixel count means it's sharp all around it's just a beautiful display and the curves make it look even better i also like the fact that it's very responsive which is a problem with some of the smartwatch displays as for the settings there's the brightness setting which you can set to auto but there's one thing that i miss and that's an always on display feature that would have made things perfect anyway there is the lift to wake until tweak gestures that are fast apart from the display the rest of the design is premium too the frame here is aluminium alloy and on the left you have these speakers and on the right you get these buttons the one with the green accent works is the power button as well as a shortcut key that you can customize for anything the key on the top brings up the app drawer and also takes you home when you need it the bottom is plastic with a nice finish and the doom where the heart rate sensor is is ceramic now this whole design is 580m water resistant so you can take it for a swim workouts basically anything else and it should be fine as for these bands these are oppo whatever calls plural rubber which i think is a fancy term for just silicon bands but these feel high quality and nice so that's nice now when it comes to the comfort i have been wearing this watch for the past two days continuously and i haven't come across any issues the band is soft enough and the watch is fairly lightweight around 40 grams so yeah it's pretty comfortable to use now come to the software experience the oppo watch has vros obviously but there are a few oppo optimizations that make the overall experience really good i mean first of all this is the first time i'm using a square ware os watch but i think the experience is much better because there is a lot more screen state anyway the wear os experience is nice there are the gestures which feel great on the curved display i can press hold to see the different watch faces i can swipe down to get the quick toggles swipe up to see the notifications swipe right for the google assistant and swipe left to go through the different tiles with important details there's daily activity which shows me my steps workout time and more there's also the heart rate details my sleep details weather and more obviously i can customize these styles so that's good there's also the app drawer here and it looks pretty nice also there are some interesting apps there's a workouts app that requires fitness runs fat burn run auto walk cycling and swimming there's also a interesting five minute workout app which is interesting for people like me because five minutes seems the average amount of time for my workouts there's also an app for guided breathing exercises which should be pretty handy for people now apart from these there are the other usual apps like google fit play store reminders alarms time or stopwatch you get the idea now like i said one of the issues i've generally come across when it comes to wear os smart watches is the fact that the performance gets pretty laggy even at the beginning now i already told you that the oppo watch display is very responsive and fast so that's one barrier crossed but the overall performance is also very smooth neo watch is powered by the snapdragon 3100 where chipset and there's also an ambig micro apollo 3 wireless chipset for the low power os which i'll get to there's also 1gb ram and 8gb storage now these are pretty good specs for aware of a smart watch and i don't know if it's the optimizations from oppo but the experience here is very fluid and smooth i haven't had any problems so the experience of the oppo watch is all around nice and that brings me to the second important factor the communication features now this is where os so i get all the notifications on the watch right here and all of the notifications are actionable so say i receive a whatsapp message like this i can just use one of these quick replies or you know send an emoji or use tab to speak or use this tiny keyboard which supports swipe typing and suggestions and it works surprisingly well also the op watch does not have easy support but there is a speaker here so i can make calls directly from the watch and also receive calls let me just give you a little something let me just call the window as you can see it's ringing hello what's up early morning these days it's all about that anyway can you hear me properly and yeah you are also audible i'm using uh i'm just calling you from the oppo [Music] watch okay so as you can see the sound of the speaker is not very loud so you have to you know get in but he was able to hear me pretty clearly so that's pretty okay apart from that the is pretty sorted on the connectivity front as well it has bluetooth 4.2 which is a little strange because it's been some time since bluetooth 5.05 but yeah i haven't come across any connection drops or anything so that's okay i guess there's also nfc at 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi support also the watch has built-in gps and all of these sensors so the location info and physical stats are pretty precise as for the app when pairing the watch with your phone you only need the veros app and the pairing was fast and easy but if you want to see all your health tracking details you have to install oppo's head tap health app which shows you all the details in a fairly clean ui so it's all good now the third big factor is batteries so the open watch has a 430 mah battery and with various it said to last around 36 hours and in my usage it did last me for a day and a little more which is decent-ish i think but the interesting thing here is that oppo watch has a low power os which only works when you enable the power saver now this mode shows the time because the step count and heart rate and it even shows you the notifications so it's not bad for a low power mode and in this mode the watch can last for almost 20 days on a single charge so that's pretty awesome when it comes to charging this is the magnetic charge you get with your watch and oppo is calling it watch flash charging because hey why not anyway this charges the watch to around 45 in just 15 minutes and 100 in 75 minutes so that's fairly fast look all in all i have kind of become skeptical when it comes to wear away smart watches especially the ones available in india but if you ask me the oppo watch has to be one of the more refined smart watches that i've ever used i mean yeah there's still a lot of testing to do like the battery the accuracy etc but so far it does seem pretty interesting i mean the opel watch brings almost all the features you need the few refinements to wear os really enhance the experience and unlike a lot of smart watches the experience so far is very smooth and nice plus the big usb i think is that beautiful curved display it's just amazing now i know oppo maybe could have gone with a slightly unique design but apart from that this is a premium smartwatch now when it comes to pricing the oppo watch 41mm costs around 15k and this 46mm premium version costs around 19k so what do you think of the price tell us in the comments section below also give this video a thumbs up if
