this is the new hp omen 16 that hp recently launched in india and this aims to be the all-rounder gaming laptop that people actually buy so is it a good gaming laptop let's find out so i know you want to know the specs the game performance but let me get the design and display out of the way so like a lot of omen laptops this two has an understated design it has a metal build and chassis with the matte black finish which i think gives it a very classy and premium look i know it's not very gamery but i like it there's also the gradient omen logo on the lid and the hinge here is what hp calls the floating hinge design and that's because of the space between the hinge and the bottom bezel anyway this is a 125 degree hinge and i like that the lid can be opened with one hand now hp says this is a 16 inch laptop in the frame of a 15 inch laptop and that's because the side and the top bezels are very narrow giving the laptop a very modern look and also obviously helping it cut down on the space as for the display these are the specs a 16.1 inch ips display with the 1080p resolution 144hz fast refresh rate 7 milliseconds of response time and it's also a 16-9 display and there's also 100 srgb coverage for good color accuracy now the high refresh rate and the fast response time of factors that come in super handy while gaming the screen is very responsive especially when playing first person shooters by talking about the display quality it's fairly good the colors are fairly good and more on the natural side the blacks are generally well displayed so watching movies and shows is a good experience and viewing angles are also decent i also like that this is a mad display so it's not reflective now the brightness is fine mostly but i would have liked the display to be brighter than 300 nits anyway i will talk about the other design elements but let's talk about the specs and the performance the hp 116 comes with the 12 gen intel core i7 12 700 edge chipset with intel's turbo max technology 3.0 that can go up to 4.7 gigahertz the processor has 14 cores with six high performance scores that take care of intensive apps and games and also maximize fps and there's eight efficiency cores for multitasking and background tasks on the gp front there's the nvidia geforce rtx 3060 gpu with 6gb vlan and a good 115 watts tdp the ram is a fast 16 gb ddr5 module and the storage is a new fast gen 4 ssd and both these are expandable so the specs are pretty good and first of all i ran the crystal diskmark storage test and yeah you can see the gen4 speed there i also run cinebench and these are the single core and multicore scores now here's the crossmark score where i think the hp omen 16 does well and lastly these are the 3d mark scores which i think is high and fairly impressive benchmarks apart it's the gaming that matters and if you ask me the omen 16 is a solid choice for gaming we tried esports titles triple a titles and the laptop performed consistently without any lag or stutter rainbow six season ultra settings got an average fps of around 200 i know this is only a esports title but this is good anyway assassin's creed valhalla is a more intensive game and a 1080p ultra the game got an average fps of around 100 110 which is actually very good we also tested elden ring on the laptop and at 1080p ultra settings the fps was around 120 at most times which is again very good i mean obviously you can get way better frame rates with high settings but the laptop handles stupid titles well even on ultra which is saying something i mean what's important here is that there was no lag in any of these games i think the 115 watt gpu is doing a good job here plus the combo of one two seven zero zero h the gen four ssd and ddr5 ram means there's no bottleneck here the thermals are also impressive here the hp omen 16 comes with the omen tempest cooling system with the ir thermopile sensor also we opened up the laptop and you can see the two big fans the three heat pipes here along with the ssd and the ram plus they have vents on three sides with airflow from five ways for better heat dissipation anyway we played the games on the performance profile which adjusts the fans according to the temperatures of the laptop and in what the dual fans which can go to 5500 rpm easily cool down the laptop this also means that the fans do get loud but that's not a big issue and i also noticed no thermal throttling or overheating on the omen 16. the laptop also has the omen gaming hub which has a lot of features aimed at game streamers but i like the control it offers and performance you can switch between the performance mode and balance mode control the thermals and fans and there's also the mux switch settings here to switch graphics from integrated to dedicated and vice versa there's also the light studio which lets you customize the lighting effects of the four zone rgb keyboard in norman 16. talking about keyboard i feel the keys are kind of small which leads to typing errors and it took me some time to get used to it but other than that there's good feedback and the texture of the keys is good plus like i said there's the four zone rgb lighting which adds to the whole gaming laptop wipe and as with the trackpad it's big and responsive and all the windows gestures work well if you're wondering the laptop comes with windows 11 pre-installed and there's also office pre-installed in the next ipad is the zero one six logo and there's also these stoppers next to the keyboard to stop the display from touching the keys now the build quality is generally solid i did not notice any major flex anywhere although the display does shake a bit when you open it the whole design is also not the most portable it's 2.3 kg in weight and this big and heavy 240 watt adapter takes it close to three kgs as of the battery there's an 83 watt six cell battery and this is gaming laptop so you'll probably use it with the charger plugged in but in our usage on the battery it lasts for three four hours at best when it comes to speakers there's two speakers here on the bottom and they're actually nice they get fairly loud which is not something you see on most laptop speakers now the quality is decent-ish and there's obviously no base but these are good for laptop speakers the webcam is a usual 720p camera moving to the pods the left side is packed with a thunderbolt 4 usb c port that supports usb pd charging display port and hp sleep and charge features there's also a fast usb a port and a hdmi 2.1 mini displayport rj45 mic headphone jack and an sd card reader on the right you get two fast usb a ports and apart from this the omen 16 has wi-fi 60 support and bluetooth 5.2 coming to the pricing the hp omen 16 has launched india rupees one lakh forty five thousand nine nine nine and at this price there are other gaming laptops with rtx 3060 but we still don't have gaming laptops with the latest two engine cpu the gen four ssd the fast lpg tier 5 ram and that's where the hp omen 16 comes into play the new hp 16 brings the latest gen specs but more importantly it brings solid game performance and very good thermal performance which is also a big point now the screen could have been brighter and the design a little less bulky but overall i think this is a pretty solid gaming laptop anyway i wanna know your thoughts on the hp omen 16 do you think you'll buy this gaming laptop at its price comment down below also give this video a like make sure to share it and subscribe to
