[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from vm.com and when it comes to premium work laptops the whole segment is filled with 13-inch 14-inch 15-inch laptops but i know for a fact that a lot of people are looking for a work laptop with a bigger screen and that's where this comes in this is the lg gram 16 and this is a laptop that's looking to shake things up when it comes to work laptops because this brings a 16 inch screen in a really portable and sleek design so is this like the ultimate laptop for you know people looking for work laptops a bigger screen let's find out so starting off i'm going to divide this video into three segments the design and build the big display and the performance because these are the big highlights of the lg gram 16. so first up the design this is how the lg gram 16 looks with its matte black lacquered magnesium alloy finish and one thing has been clear to me from the start this is a high quality premium laptop i mean this is a no-nonsense very clean design and i love that it does not look like another macbook inspired laptop this is a really classy looking laptop if you ask me plus the whole build quality here seems pretty durable this laptop is mil std 10g certified which means it has passed a number of these stress tests and that means it should be more sturdy than your usual laptop apart from the certification the hinge is pretty sturdy as you can see and the display does not wobble there are no gaps or sharp edges on the drum 16 when i'm holding it in my hand the weight distribution of the device is also pretty great and you can open the lid with one hand like this so yeah it's good now overall the device does seem sturdy but i did notice a little bit of flex on the edge of the display as well as the palm rest and a little bit on the keyboard now the big usp of this laptop is that this is a 16 inch laptop that's only 16.8 millimeters thick and it only weighs 1.19 kgs which is really impressive i mean i remember picking the laptop for the first time and being surprised at how lightweight this is now this is actually a big usb because this is easy to move around and super easy to carry while traveling in fact to give an idea the box it comes in weighs more than the actual device now the weight apart let's talk about that big display this is a 16 inch to 10 16 inch ips lcd panel running at wq xga plus resolution at 60hz and it has super color accuracy with the typical 99 dc ip3 coverage now lg is known for high-end tvs and gaming monitors with great displays and they don't really disappoint him this display is a joy to use it's a sharp display with very good viewing angles and contrast and like i said the colors look great i've been watching anything on this display it's just a great experience and this bigger screen is also great if you want to multitask a lot or you want to do things like photo editing now there is one thing the brightness could have been better especially because this is a reflective screen anyway i also like that there are slim bezels all around even on the bottom where mostly manufacturers use a thick bezel for their logo and whatnot now if you're wondering about the webcam the 720p camera is right here and i feel it's clear enough in good lighting and oakish in not so good lighting here's a video from the webcam hey guys this is a video from the 720p camera of the lg gram and right now there's no artificial lighting on here it's all natural lighting so let us know thoughts on the cameras quality in the comments down below as well as the mic quality yeah common number so the lg drum does live up to its promise of bringing a big nice display with a lightweight design but let's talk about the performance now because let's face it the performance is what makes or breaks a laptop here the specs the lg gram packs an 11 gen intel core i7 165 g7 chipset it is a four core eight thread cpu with the base clock of 2.80 gigahertz and a boost of up to 4.70 gigahertz now for the gpu there's the intel iris xc graphics it also packs in 16gb dual channel 4266 megahertz lpddr4x memory which is soldered and there's a 512gb of nvme ssd with an additional ssd slot in case you want to expand things anyway the combination of the 11 gen i7 and 16 gb of ram makes day-to-day usage of this device very smooth and without any hiccups word processing browsing or even photo editing on photoshop is no issue for this device now i know it's a bigger screen so there's obviously a question of gaming now to be clear this is not a gaming laptop but esports titles like valor and cs go and dota 2 can be played csgo at lower settings with native resolution than at an average of 66 fps which is decent anyway to give you guys a better idea on the performance of this laptop we ran a number of benchmarks on this now here all the benchmark scores one by one and i notice that the scores here are mostly good and in line with what you get in competing laptops in this price range i also checked the thermals while running these benchmarks and i did notice that the lg gram 16 did throttle a little bit especially during the cinebench r20 and budget bench premium pro benchmarks see the lg gram has one fan and one heat pipe to cool things down and i did notice this whole function keys area of the keyboard get a little hot moving on the battery life is also an important factor when it comes to work laptops now i personally was worried about the lg gram 16 because this looks like a very slim and lightweight laptop so i was expecting a smaller battery but that's not the case so the laptop has an 80 watt battery which is fairly big and it's rated to last up to 18.5 hours now in my testing i mostly got around 9 to 10 hours out of it so it's not 18 hours but it's still pretty impressive when it comes to charging i like that ng has bundled the usbc charger in the box and that takes around 2 hours 15 minutes to fully charge the laptop and we talk about the other aspects of the lg gram 16 the port selection on this laptop is super on the left it has an hdmi port two thunderbolt for usb ports with pd support and headphone mic combo on the right you get the micro sd slot two usb a ports and a kensington lock slot plus it comes with this rj45 to usb c adapter in the box and on the connectivity front there's wi-fi six and bluetooth 5.1 and the wi-fi bluetooth performance is good enough as for the speakers the laptop comes with two 2w speakers and as you can see they are bottom firing and that means the sound does seem a bit distant sounding but as for the quality goes i think it's kind of decent dish now there's also dts x ultra support and there's an app to customize the audio experience for external speakers and headphones and there are a number of different modes with modes aimed at gaming too the keyboard is a full size backlit chiclet keyboard with two brightness levels and the typing experience on this keyboard is pretty good the key travel feels good and very responsive and when the whole layout took me some time getting used to i did get the hang of it the trackpad is a 16-10 trackpad to match the screen aspect ratio and yeah as you can see this is a seriously big trackpad anyway this is a windows precision trackpad and it's very responsive and the large size of it makes it great for gestures now the placement is such that i did have a few accidental touches but that's not a big deal the buttons at the bottom two are very nice and premium sounding so yeah pretty good now apart from all these they are two points note first up lg has promised to bring the windows 11 update for the lg drum laptops very soon in fact the newer units of the lg gram come with windows 11 pre-installed now the other point is that ng's offering three years of warranty on these lg drum laptops which is pretty good so i think i've covered pretty much everything there is to know about the lg gram laptop now coming to the pricing the lg gram 16 is available on amazon for rupees 92 990 and there are 14 inch versions as well as 17 inch versions of this laptop available so there are options now if you ask me my opinion on the lg drum 16 i'd say it's overall pretty positive see i've only used this laptop for a couple of days but i love this minimal design the big screen plus portability combo the performance is good the battery life is excellent and brings a very responsive track pad and keyboard yes there are a few quirks here and there the thermals and speakers could have been better but like i said my overall view of this laptop is fairly positive anyway those are sort of my initial impressions of the lg gram 16 but i want to know what you guys think of this laptop so comment down below comment down below also give this video a like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos that's me signing off thanks for watching
