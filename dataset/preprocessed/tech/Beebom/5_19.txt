we've just launched this new x80 series of flagship phones in india and this is the top end vivo x80 pro now this is the phone that's packed with a lot of cool camera tech camera features but is this a good flash phone let's find out so this is the new vivo x80 pro and this is how the phone looks this has an aluminium frame and a matte glass back with the whole satin finish and looks and feels premium no doubt the attention grabber though is the big and bold camera setup which i will get to in a bit on the front you get the same beautiful amoled panel as the x70 pro plus so it's a 6.7 inch e5 amoled display with the high wq hd plus resolution now there is one change though the x80 pro is probably the first phone to come with the latest ltpo 3 deck which is said to improve battery life even further while still dynamically changing the refresh rate quickly from 1 hertz to 120 hertz now i'm yet to test that but the display does feel very very smooth and it's obviously high in display so everything looks nice also it is an hdr10 display and it's supported in apps like netflix the front also has a big and fast 3d ultrasonic fingerprint scanner i mean it has a larger zone and i love how quick it is to add a fingerprint it's also very fast as you can see coming back to the design the x80 pro is a fairly big and hefty phone although it does have a premium feel to it as for the features it has steel speakers which sound pretty good for haptics it has the x axis linear motor which actually brings very nice feedback in places like zooming in the camera app and even works well in games with the vibration effects feature in game space apart from this the phone does not have a headphone jack or micro sd slot but it has flagship features like the ip68 rating for water and dust resistance and support for 50 watt fast wireless charging the x80 pro also has the flagship specs snapdragon 8gen 1 lpddr5 ram and ufs 3.1 storage so yeah thought the line specs really and if you're wondering the phone has a liquid cooling vapor chamber now the phone performs like a flagship in the benchmarks here the scores in antutu geekbench 3d mark and yeah these are good scores the phone also feels like a very smooth and fast phone in real world usage the performance beat while using popular apps or even gaming is good now do note that the phone has the vivo v1 plus chip which brings enhancements to the camera as well as gaming so basically the v1 plus ship can push games to 90 fps using memc aka frame interpolation while also lowering power usage while gaming now enabling the game frame interpolation option did make the game feel a little more smoother but i'll have to check if it actually makes a difference in the fps anyway apart from this i did run a couple of cpu throttling tests and it actually did fairly well as far as agent one is concerned so yeah good now these pixel features are good but it's clear where the focus is with the x80 pro this the x80 pro has the latest samsung gnb 50 megapixel primary camera with ois the imx 598 48 megapixel ultrawide camera with horizon level stabilization a 12 megapixel imx660 portrait camera with the gimbal ois system and an 8 megapixel periscope camera with 5x optical zoom and ois yeah this thing has stopped the line cameras for every camera feature plus the cameras are covered with the zeiss t-star coating which is a high transmission optical glass clearer shots and less flares now all of these cameras are high-end and they take some very cool shots but this is more of a videography focused phone so let me talk about the video features first so first up there is a new zeiss cinematic mode in video this shoots videos in 1080p 24 fps and an aspect ratio of 2.39 is to 1 and unlike the usual portrait video mode this has a more unique bokeh effect and i like how it turns lights into oval flares now this works with the main camera the portrait camera and the front camera now the cinematic mode is cool but there's also a natural mode which shoots the 16 9 and has a more natural bokeh effect if you prefer that apart from this the video mode also has different cinematic color tools to choose from there's nostalgia retro classic mute autumn and more the x80 pro and x8 also come with full-fledged pro video mode which lets you control everything with shutter speed iso white balance and i like that you can even shoot in log there also features like focus peaking for more precise focus exposure feedback which is very useful the x80 pro also comes with ois auto reset which works with standard and ultra stabilization and this makes sure that the camera takes full use of ois in every single shot the phone also comes with improved time lapse and you have all these different modes to make sure you choose the perfect speed for your time-lapse video apart from this the very cool 360 degree horizon level stabilization is still here and it's still very cool and kind of mind-bending now i already told about the vivo v1 plus chip and that brings ai video enhancement to the cameras see this icon in the video mode this is it in daytime it enables video hdr and in low light it enables super night video mode here's a video in daytime with ai video enhancement off and on and you can see the difference in the background now here's a video with super night video off and on and you can see the difference it makes with the overall exposure so the video features are very cool but the vivo x80 pro is also very capable smartphone in terms of photos i mean the new gnv sensor has been customized by samsung exclusively for vivo and this reduces noise and shots while having a wider f 1.57 aperture for capturing more light in low light surroundings i have been taking photos with this camera and the results are actually very good as you can see the x80 pro also takes very good portrait shots and the portrait camera has a gimbal which results in better night portraits at 2x here are some nighttime portraits i have taken in while it's not perfect these shots do look pretty sharp and nice i also like that there are different size styles in portrait mode there's cinematic distacon planner and more the periscope camera with 5x optical zoom is also pretty good in the few shots i've taken and the ultra wide shots also look pretty crisp and nice plus they're all the different photography features there's a new ai group portrait which uses multiple phase detection and raw hdr algorithms to make sure all the faces in a group photo look sharp and good there's also nice natural color 2.0 and ai perception in there for more accurate exposure white balance in complicated scenes improved night mode and xdr photos for harsh backlight scenes yeah this is a feature packed camera phone moving to the battery the x80 pro has a 4700 mah battery and it comes with this 80 watt flash charger in the box on the soft front the phone has fun touch os 12 on top of android 12 with a promise of three major android updates and four years of security patches as for the pre-installed apps there are a lot of them which is kind of weird in a premium phone like this but they can be uninstalled now before i conclude things i just want to mention that along with the vivo x80 pro v was also not the x80 which is also very interesting flagship phone i mean here's the specs of the phone and there are two things that stand out this is the first phone in india with the dimension 9000 chipset and this is also the first phone with the imx 866 primary camera yeah that is interesting right do you want us to make a separate video on the demonstry 9000 nx80 or the imx 866 comment down below so to conclude things the vivo x80 pro is a proper flagship phone but it's also a camera beast see the vivo x80 pro is packed with some of the coolest camera taken smartphones and i liked it the rest of the phone also has proper flagship features there's no cost cuttings now i don't know the price of the x80 pro or the x80 so i will reserve my judgment but yeah these are definitely exciting new smartphones anyway i will pin the price of the vivo x80 pro as well as the vivo x80 in the
