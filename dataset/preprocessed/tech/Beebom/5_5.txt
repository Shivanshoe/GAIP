this is the new dell inspiron 16 7620 and this 16 inch laptop is actually a two in one now i know you have questions is it too big to be used as a tablet how's the performance what's the price how is the stylus well i'll tell you everything but the focus is obviously on this design and the form factor so let's start with that this is the laptop and it has a very premium design i mean it has a metal build all around with the laid out the chassis and this just feels like a well-built laptop there's no flex beat on the keyboard or the lid the hinge feels solid and there is no creaks or sounds when you flip over the screen to go into tablet mode i also like that the integer metal finish has a very smooth touch surface that feels well smooth now this is a big laptop and a 2.1 kgs this isn't exactly what i had in mind when it comes to two-in-one laptops i mean you'll probably use it in tablet mode but i think you'll prefer using this on a table you can also use it in the different modes you get with a two-in-one form factor stand mode while playing games or tent mode while watching movies and shows the 10 mode is actually great because first it has a killer display and second it has great speakers this variant comes with a 4k oled display with the usual 60hz refresh rate but there's 400 nits of brightness and 100 dci p3 coverage now this is a 4k all-in panel so blacks look absolutely stunning here the colors are obviously vibrant and nice and it's a sharp display i mean it looks really good when watching movies and shows and i like that it gets fairly bright too there's even hdr and dolby vision support and it shows in shows like our planet or netflix now i told you about the great speakers right with this actually a quad speaker setup in this laptop there are two front-firing speakers next to the keyboard and there are two bottom fighting speakers right here now this whole setup just gets amazingly loud and i also like how detailed and crisp the sound is that's all there's even some bass in the sound to put it better this is one of the more fantastic laptop speaker setups i've heard and the laptop comes with the max audio pro app which lets you tune the sound according to you apart from the multimedia angle of the screen the touch here is responsive and it just felt like using a good touch screen this also has 100 dc ip3 coverage and it looks very color accurate so you can use it to edit photos or even videos i also like the 16 to 10 aspect ratio which makes sense in the tablet mode beat while reading or while drawing with the pen now this stylus aka the dell active pen comes in the box with this laptop and these are the specs of the pen now this is a pen that can be used by creators or even students the drawing and noting experience with this pen is actually good i did not notice any lag or latency while using it and the palm rejection is good too this is a pressure sensitive pen and that too works without any problems i also like the design of this pen because this fits in the hand perfectly and then also these two buttons one of them can be used for selecting something the second one can be used to switch between drawing and erasing and you can also customize the functions of these buttons in the dell peripheral manager app let's talk about the specs now the inspiron 16 7620 is an intel evo certified laptop and it comes in two variants an intel core i5 variant with an integrated gpu and a core i7 variant with a dedicated discrete gpu and we have the latter this has the 12 gen core i7 1260 b series chipset which has 12 cores including four performance scores and eight efficiency cores which means the cpu can free up the performance scores when using intensive apps or games while the background apps keep running in the efficiency cost there's also 16 threads with intel thread director which makes sure the right app goes to the right core apart from that there's 12 mb of cash and the max clock speed is 4.7 gigahertz the gpu is the entry level nvidia mx 550 with 15 to 25 watt of tgp and 2gb vita the ram is a dual channel 16 gbg4 unit while the storage is a 1tb pci gen3 ssd now i would have honestly liked a faster ddr5 ram and gen 4 ssd especially since they are soldered here but it is what it is anyway these are the ssd speeds of the laptop and we also ran some benchmark tests and these are the cinebench scores both single core and multi-core these are the geekbench scores and yeah these scores are good and they kind of show that this laptop should handle most of the regular tasks you throw at it i mean i showed you photoshop on the laptop and photoshop on this is a very smooth experience even with multiple layers the laptop works flawlessly even when using daily usage apps here is chrome with 15 tabs open three 4k videos playing apps like paint.net and geekbench open in the background and when i choose the cpu usage it's very low the ram usage is a bit higher but it's not a problem at all because everything is smooth and nice if you ask me this should do well even with intensive apps now mx550 isn't exactly a gaming gpu but it can handle some casual games this is go at high settings at 1080p resolution and the fps is generally around 120 which is very good for what is not exactly a game laptop i mean this will not handle heavy games but yeah some casual gaming should be fine as a thermal there is a silent fan which remains quite most of the time and there are six small air intake beds beneath the hinge and there are some more vents at the bottom moving on one cool thing about this laptop is that it has a full hd 1080p webcam and not a 720p one like most laptops plus there's a physical webcam shutter here and this is also a windows hello camera so you can use it to unlock the laptop it's a 1080p camera in action and along with the high resolution and fairly good video quality i like that the field of view is fairly wide as well apart from that about the my quality let us know what you think in the comments down below the keyboard is a chiclet one and it is a backlit keyboard with two brightness levels now i like the keyboard layout the additional shortcuts for volume brightness and i like how the keys feel the key travel is satisfying and there's very good feedback however since the palm test area is big i felt the keyboard is a bit on the upper side which does result in some errors the trackpad is huge though and it's smooth and great to use there's also a fingerprint scanner here which is fast and consistent when comes supports the left has the hdmi 1.4 port which is capped at 1080p 60hz there's a usb a 3.2 gen1 port and a couple of thunderbolt 4 ports with one of them supporting displayport and pd charging on the right there's a 3.5 mm combo jack and a usb port and also an sd card reader which is a nice touch the battery is an 87 wattage unit with a 65 mod usbc charger bundled nutella cleans up to 9 hours of battery life from this weighted and in our usage the battery lasted for around seven to eight hours which is still very good coming to the pricing now the core i5 variant of this laptop costs rs 90 0490 and the core i7 variant we have cost rupees 1 lakh 27490 now at this price the inspiron 16 76 280 brings a lot of big highlights the big 16 inch 4k on it is obviously a key factor and it looks absolutely stunning the quad speakers are also a big differentiator i also like the design looks premium and feels solid the performance also seems to be on point and i like the delve went with a 1080p camera plus del bundles this pen in the box which makes it a good package for students as well as creative professionals now there are obviously a couple of quarks of weight is obviously one and the second is a faster ram would have been nicer but overall this is obviously a premium two-in-one and it just feels that way what do you guys think about this do you think it makes sense at its price comment
