[Applause] hey guys this is paige from vmware.com and it is deal season there are so many great deals on so many gadgets all around but i know what you guys like smartphone deals so i'm gonna tell you that today and i'm gonna tell you my favorite smartphone deals so yeah let's begin so i'm gonna start with the pixel 4a which i think is on a great deal right now see the pixel 4a is a phone that was launched at 31 triple nine and i've seen it go to 29 triple nine on some sales previously but right now the phone is available for just rupees 25 triple nine which i think is a very good price for this phone also if you get the pixel 40 right now on flipkart you will be able to get the pixel buds at 5000 rupees and the google nest mini at one rupee yes one rupee i'm not kidding plus there are bank offers to get the price of the phone even lower so yeah the pixel 4a deal makes sense because even though this is not the most powerful phone at this price it brings the whole great google experience now my second favorite deal is on this phone the real me gt master edition now if you ask me the real me gt me is a very underrated smartphone because it looks really cool it has some really good specs including a super amoled display snapdragon 778 etc so this is a phone i like and i think it's based where it is priced really well at 25 triple nine but you know what it's available on a price right now that you just can't guess see the real me gtme is getting a discount of 6 000 rupees on flipkart bringing the price down to 19 triple nine yes 20k basically for the gt master edition now this is a prepaid offer which basically means you will get this deal if you pay online via any of the banks anyway i think this is a crazy good deal and hit like if you like this deal because this is a great phone for 20k plus you can get the price even lower with a lot of bank office so there's that also one thing to note is that you can get the real me gta me on flipkart and get six thousand rupees off or you can get the real me gta me on readme.com and get the readme buds a pro for free with the device along with the bank office so yeah even that is a pretty good thing the third thing i really like the sales season is on the iphone 12 and the iphone 12 mini now let me make it clear that the deal on these phones was even better when the sale started right now a lot of these iphone variants are not available and they're up the price by 1k but i think the prices are still very good so the iphone 12 which has an official price tag now rupees 65 900 after the iphone 30 notch obviously is available for rupees 49 triple nine that's a discount of more than 15k the iphone 12 mini which has a price tag of 5900 officially is available for rupees 37 triple nine and that's a discount more than 28 000 rupees so yeah these these are awesome now the iphone 12 and 12 minutes are on flipkart but you can even get the iphone 11 and the iphone 10r at rupees 38 triple nine and rupees 32 triple nine respectively on amazon again great deals now moving on to the next deal this is another deal that i really like it's on the real me gt5 g which as you guys know is a proper flagship phone i mean the regular gt5g has specs like the 120 hertz amoled the top of the line snapdragon triple a chipset stereo speakers etc in this whole leather design that is just so cool now the gt is already quite value for money at 37 triple nine but it's available at a discount of two thousand rupees on redmi.com flipkart and even offline so you can get it for rupees 35 triple night plus there are these bank offers that you can get and these will effectively bring the price of the real me gt5 g to around 34k now 34k for a snapdragon triple eight phone is just awesome it's an awesome d my next favorite deal is on this the galaxy s20 fe 5g now this is a deal that i've already showed you i mean the usual price of the galaxy s20 fe 5g is 50 triple nine but you can get it for rupees 36 triple nine on amazon now 36.9 for the s20 f5g along with the bank offers is great because this is a high-end samsung phone with a snapdragon chipset next up another deal i really like is on the moto h20 fusion so this is a phone that brings amoled diamond city 800u and 108 megapixel main camera along with the motorola stock android experience now usually you can get it six 128 gb variant rupees 21499 but right now on flipkart you can get rupees 19 triple nine which i think is a very good price for the h20 fusion anyway another good deal is on the real me x7 max 5g which is another good phone from really the x7 max has features like 120hz amoled the powerful dimension 1200 processor things like 65 watt charging now there is no price cut here this one is available for rupees 26.99 for the 8128 gb weighted however you can basically use these bank offers on realme.com to get the price to 25k and 25k for the x7 max with the mncd 1200 is a good deal anyway next is the me11 xd now this is another deal that i've already showed you guys but i'm talking about my favorite deal so i'm gonna mention it so usually the me 11x starts at 29 2999 but you can get it for 26 triple nine i think this is an awesome deal especially if you use the 3000 rupees off offer with hdfc on amazon and get the price to 23 triple nine basically sounds good right lastly is the iphone se deal now let me make clear that this is a deal i like now the official price of the iphone se rupees 32 triple nine but it's available right now on flipkart for rupees 26 triple nine yeah they're up the price by 1000 rupees anyway i think this deal is good but hey plot twist the phone is not see it's 2021 and i just cannot recommend this phone to anybody especially with this design and these bezels yeah it's
