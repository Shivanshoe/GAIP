[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and this right here is the brand new oppo renault 4 pro that has just launched in india and it's quite an interesting phone with some really cool new features so yes i'm going to talk about the oppo renault 4 pro but before we begin i suggest you to hit the bell icon to get notified not that actually i want to talk about this yeah the opponent 4 pro came in this huge box so i'm going to show you what's in this okay so this massive box also includes the oppo watch as you can see which by the way looks good and these cool coasters which can be placed in the soil to raise a plant that is cool and obviously this had the renault 4 pro box which includes the usual transparent silicon case this 65 watt charging adapter the usb 8 usbc cable and of course this the new oppo renault 4 pro okay so when you hear about the render series what comes to your mind well there are obviously two things the premium design and some really unique super cool camera features that you probably haven't seen anywhere before well the same is true for the renault 4 pro and honestly the camera features here really got me excited so i'm going to talk about the design first and then move on to the super cool super unique camera features so stick till the end so the very first thing you notice when you take out the renault 4 pro out of the box is how lightweight and sleek this phone is and the fact that the glass back feels very different in the hand and let me elaborate so the phone weighs just 161 grams and it's just 7.7 millimeters thick even the cameras aren't that protruded so yeah this is a very sleek phone and it's lovely to hold because not a lot of companies make lightweight phones anymore coming to the gorilla glass 6 pack this has a very cool matte finish that feels great in the hands and i like that it's fingerprint resistant too on the front the oppo no4 pro has a 6.5 inch 90 hertz full hd plus super amoled display and oppo calls this a 3d borderless sense screen because it's curved 55 degrees around the edges anyway the curved display looks very good so far especially because it's very bright and the contrast and colors are great it also looks very modern thanks to the minimal bezels and i think the multimedia experience is great here i mean hd playback and apps like netflix and prime video is supported so shows look awesome on the screen and on the sound front there's dolby atmos support for earphones with its different profiles now all that is good but there are two things in the design of the renault 4 pro that have really surprised me okay so the fact that a premium sleek phone like the renault 4 pro has the good old headphone jack and the fact that there's a dual sim plus micro sd dedicated triple slot and that's pretty awesome right i mean most companies skip these because they want to keep their phones sleek and well look at this anyway so the design of the renault 4 pro is premium and it's also functional now let's talk about the cameras of the render 4 pro so this is the quad camera setup that you get and on paper it's kind of usual with the 48 megapixel sony imx 586 sensor 8 megapixel ultra wide angle camera 2 megapixel depth and 2 megapixel macro lens but the camera experience here is interesting first let me get this out of the way the renault 4 pro does take some really good shots being in daytime and even in low light i mean i haven't got into the pros and cons of the camera yet but some of the shots here are really good and it's not just the main camera even the ultra wide angle lens captures some nice and sharp photos however what i found more interesting are the cool new camera features firstly there's ai color portrait which mutes the background into black and white while keeping the person in the frame in the focus in color and i think it works really well here are some cool ai ported shots and these look really cool and the separation between the background and me is almost perfect the feature is also present in the 32 megapixel front camera and it even works well in the night as you can see here but it's not just photos you can even use it in videos and well look at the accuracy and how cool the footage looks it's a lot of fun really to use this and it's even more impressive in videos because i'm constantly moving there are a few more cool new effects when it comes to videos there are three filters crimson forest green and sky blue and these enable you to capture a video with only red blue or green objects highlighted while the rest is black and white here's a video with the forest green filter and it's so awesome it can detect the colors while shooting a video and hey the video looks really cool right now here's a video with the sky blue filter and look at this video it looks so dramatic and honestly crazy cool i love it another new feature is night flare portrait which aims to capture portrait shots like say this one at night with blurred light spots in the background while enhancing the color on the face now the example i showed you is from a dslr probably but i tried out the renault 4 pro's night flip portrait and here's what i captured well this looks interesting right i mean it's not a perfect photo but the light spots look cool in the background and it's not the only photo i took here are a couple of more shots with the feature and well these look really cool i mean i'm sure with better lighting in the foreground and background i could have captured a better shot but yeah this is interesting and fun to use apart from that there's also the ultra dark mode here and it does make a major difference here's a photo without the night mode and look at the same shot with the night mode yeah that's a huge difference here's another example and yeah the ultra dark mode actually makes a pretty good difference in the renault 4 pro okay so the new camera features are cool but what's also exciting is this the 65 watt super charger so the render 4 pro has a 4000mah battery which is decent enough and the battery life should be fairly good but what's truly insane is that the 65 watt charger here should be able to fully charge the phone in around half an hour yes half an hour to fully charge your phone i still can't get over it i know we've seen 65 watt chargers in the past as well but it's still very very exciting anyway let's talk about what's under the hood of the renault 4 pro so the 904 pro in india is surprisingly not the renault 4 pro 5g because it comes with the snapdragon 720 g chipset and not the 765 g chipset to be honest 765g would have made more sense here but it is the 720 g and it is a good chipset as i know from the phones in the past and the 104 pro also has been smooth and nice in my brief time so we'll see i also played some pubg mobile on the phone and the experience and hd graphics and high frame rate was good enough as you can see as for the software the no4 pro comes with color os 7.2 on top of android 10 and if you're wondering about the pre-installed apps there's facebook amazon netflix and wps office yeah that's pretty much it well the phone did come with a few band apps initially but after a software update and a reset all of the band apps were gone and oppo has confirmed that the retail units of the renault 4 pro will not have any of the banned apps so that's good news coming to color over 7.2 it has got a couple of really interesting features there's a new icon pull down gesture so you can just swipe upwards from the left or right edge to bring all of the icons on the screen down to your finger for easy access another feature is quick return bubble which works in games like pubg and it lets you switch between the game and other apps with a bubble icon and i did not really get it to work but it sounds cool but that was a good look at the new renault 4 pro and at the time of shooting this video we don't know the price of the phone but for me the renault 4 pro has four major highlights a design that's very premium and very sleek a display that looks really nice new camera features that are a lot of fun and interesting and 65 watt fast charger that's well very very fast so yes using the render 4 pro has been a lot of fun but at the end of it all it all depends on the price really i mean the snapdragon 720 g's performance should be good if experience from past phones is anything to go by but this feels like a more high-end phone and i just hope oppo prices this right well those are my first thoughts first impressions on the new oppo no4 pro but what do you think tell us in the comments down below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it around lastly subscribe to our channel for more
