[Applause] hey guys i'm akshay from vbomb.com and this right here is the msi gp66 leopard yeah it's a new high-end gaming laptop from msi and the one thing i'm really excited about in this laptop is the new 2nd gen rtx 3017 gpu so what's it like what improvements does it bring well i've been using this laptop for quite some time so let's take a look at the laptop and the new rtx 3070 gpu first things first let's take a look at the design here so the msi gp66 leopard looks pretty much like a regular msi gaming laptop it has an all black chassis which i really like and the msi dragon logo is present on the lid here as well it's not the lightest gaming laptop i've seen but it's still light for a gaming machine at 2.38 kg so yeah design wise the msi gp66 leopard is a pretty solid looking laptop it also brings plenty of ports so you get two usb a ports one usb c port an rj45 lan port and an hdmi port as well as another usb a port and a combo headphone mic jack moving on the msi gp66 leopard comes with the 15.6 inch full hd ips display with a 144hz refresh rate and it's a nice display overall the colors look really nice on here and the viewing angles are solid as well in fact if you look at the screen off angle it doesn't seem to drop brightness as much as most other laptop screens have used which is impressive the 144hz refresh rate is pretty nice to have as well it makes everything look really smooth and fluid whether it's for gaming or just general usage of the laptop i'm quite happy with the screen on this laptop also bonus points to msi for not putting the webcam on the bottom bezel speaking of the webcam it's actually a pretty decent camera so i'm recording this using the msi gp66 webcam and mic and yeah the video quality looks decent to me but let me know what you guys think in the comments down below so the design and the display of the msi gp66 leopard are all great but what about the performance well the msi gp66 comes with a 10 gen core i7 processor 16 gigs of 3200 megahertz ram a one terabyte m.2 ssd rtx 3070 gpu and wi-fi six as well as bluetooth 5.1 now i know what you're thinking the processor here is quite old but msi will be coming out with 11 gen processors soon as well plus this laptop does perform really well and the new rtx card definitely helps here there are five major things that the 2nd gen rtx gpu offers here first there's improved rate racing which means supported gains look just oh so good second the rtx 3070 comes with dlss 2.0 which helps get better frame rates in games also something good then there's the dynamic boost 2.0 which helps balance the power between the cpu and gpu for better performance the 2nd gen rtx gpu also brings nvidia reflex which reduces latency between when you click your mouse and when your display responds to the click lastly rtx 30 series gpus support resizable bar technology which allows the cpu here to have complete access to the gpu memory which helps in accelerating performance so the rtx 3070 definitely brings a lot of improvements to the table test things out i ran a couple of benchmarks on the msi gp66 leopard here are the benchmark scores in 3dmark and pc mark as well as cinebench for the laptop and yeah these are definitely nice quotes i also tested out a couple of games here so i played hitman 3 because it's just an amazing game and i also played assassin's creed valhalla on this laptop in hitman 3 as you'd expect the laptop handles everything pretty easily the game runs on high settings with ease and i was getting frame rates over 100 fps almost all the time in assassin's creed valhalla which is way more intensive than hitman 3 the gp66 leopard performs really well too the game runs smoothly and i got frame rates around 100 fps plus i didn't notice any lagging anywhere during my gameplay which is great now these were games that don't even support dlss 2.0 but now let's take a look at the improvements that the dlss feature brings so this is fortnite running with dlss and ray tracing on and this is fortnite running with dlss off and as you can see there's a pretty significant difference in the frame rates here so yeah dlss 2.0 is definitely a great feature to have on your gpu and this rtx 3070 performs really well thanks to dlss and other technologies of the 2nd gen rtx cards even in regular everyday tasks the laptop works really well i've been using this as my daily driver for work over the past week and it has been really good even with multiple tabs open photoshop running and some music playing either through spotify or youtube the laptop doesn't ever break a sweat which is great once more i even tested out some cad software in this laptop and it can easily handle that workload as well i mean i'm not a cad user but i did try out archicad and blender etc to see how the laptop handles them and in my usage they did work really well without any hiccups now i tried out the software because a lot of engineering students look for laptops that can handle games as well as things like cad software so yeah this is great for those students basically this looks like a laptop for people who want high end performance inside the stealthy subtle board speaking of regular use i also want to talk about the keyboard and the track pattern so this laptop comes with a steel cds keyboard with per key rgb lighting now i personally kept the backlight at just one color but if you want to go overboard with rgb you can do that easily i don't have any complaints with the keyboard to be honest in fact it's a really nice and comfortable keyboard however the trackpad here has some quirks it's a windows precision trackpad which means you get all the gestures and all the bells and whistles here however this trackpad just feels substandard and isn't any fun to use obviously you'll be using a mouse most of the time for gaming but still whenever i use this trackpad it just annoys me one thing to note here is that the speakers are definitely good the laptop comes with the stereo speakers set up on the side and they do get fairly loud so the laptop can be used for watching movies and even casual music listening if you want lastly let's talk about the battery the msi gp66 leopard comes with a 65 watt battery which isn't the biggest battery for the laptop as powerful as this in my usage the laptop runs for around three hours on a single charge with normal use at around 50 to 60 percent brightness you might be able to push this to maybe fourish hours but that's not really realistic anyway battery life isn't much of a concern since you'll be using the laptop with the power adapter connected anyway but yeah if you want to use this for work you will have to carry the charging brick with you the msi gp66 leopard is priced at one lakh 95 990 rupees and yeah that's a pretty steep price plus it comes with a 10 gen processor that feels especially outdated because this isn't a budget gaming laptop that said the performance here is definitely good and the laptop does pack high-end specs overall with the new rtx 3070 gpu which makes games run really well in my time with this laptop so far it does look like a decent gaming laptop but i will be testing things out thoroughly so let me know if you want a review of this laptop on our website well those are my thoughts about the msi gp66 leopard and yeah i think this is a decent gaming laptop but what do you think will you be buying this laptop for your gaming needs let us know in the comments also give this video a like and share it with your friends
