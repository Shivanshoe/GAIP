this is a new gaming laptop from asus that looks good has some good specs and costs 90k so is this like the value for money gaming laptop for people looking for an option under one lakh rupees what are the upgrades from the last gen let's find out [Music] this is the new asus stuff dash f15 and i know it looks pretty good but let's check out the specs right away the tough dash f15 comes with the latest 12th gen core i5 2l 450 hcd cpu with four performance scores and for efficiency cores so the cpu switches between these cores depending on your use case for example if you're gaming the processor frees up the performance scores for it while the lighter apps and the background apps use the efficiency cores the chipset also has 12 threads with support for intel thread director which basically makes sure that each application thread is assigned to the right core beat the performance score or the efficiency code as for the clock speed it can go up to 4.4 gigahertz the gpu is nvidia's rtx 3050 with 4gb of ddr6 vram and 75 watts of graphics power which is kind of low compared to other 30 50 laptops in the same price range which have 90 watt of tgp the ssd is a 512gb pci gen3 module and here the ssd speeds to give you an idea i also like that there are two additional slots to upgrade the ssd and they are both gen 4 compatible slots the ram is an 8gb ddr5 module and this too is upgradeable talking about the performance let me show you the benchmarks which i think are pretty good this is the cerebellar single core score and this is the multi-core score and now here's the geekbench score and we also run 3d mark and this is the score as for the game performance the 75 watt rtx 3050 isn't the most powerful gpu out there but you can play aaa titles on this laptop here is forza horizon 5 in action at medium graphics and 1080p settings and the performance is actually great we got an average fps of around 105 and the fps even hit 138 times which is great we also played sniper elite 5 on the same settings and this is an intensive game but the fps is decent at around 70 and above with the max fp is going around 100 more importantly there's no lag or stutter in the game now if you're wondering about esport titles rainbow six siege on the ultra settings runs beautifully on this laptop with fps around 120 and even touching 150 sometimes now this is great especially because this is a 15.6 inch 144hz fhd panel which is great for shooting games now these are the specs of the display and i like the narrow bezels and the refresh rate but i have some mixed feelings i mean i like that the display is sharp and crisp and although the color accuracy could have been better the colors look good enough when watching movies and shows the blacks also look black not gray the problem i have with this display is the brightness 250 nits is kind of low it's not a big issue indoors where you'll be gaming a lot but yeah this could have been better now do note that this is the base variant and there are other ways with brighter displays as well as 100 srgb coverage so there are options anyway look this is a mid-range gaming laptop but the forms here is good this can run aaa titles at medium to high settings without difficulty and what helps is the thermal performance which is very impressive the laptop has dual fans with five copper heat pipes and there are a lot of vents all around for better heat dissipation there's vents on the back there's vents on the right above the keyboard at the bottom where there's also these rubber feet i said impressive because surface of the laptop does not get warm enough to be a concern even during long hours of gaming and i also noticed that the fan noise is fairly acceptable here's the fan noise at 5700 rpm 5800 5700 again so the fan noise is fairly acceptable this means you can game for a longer period without being worried and the thermal system also has an anti-dust channel design that should help keep it clean in the long run laptop also comes with armory crates so you can choose between multiple performance profiles with silent performance turbo or manual there's also a mux switch here which is handy for people who don't know by default a laptop dedicated gpu renders the frame then it is rotted through the cpu's integrated gpu and then sent to the display now this is great for battery life but there's one problem since everything has to pass by the cpu the gpu isn't able to give 100 off its power even during intensive games with mac switch you can take the integrated graphics out of the equation and only use the dedicated gpu which reduces latency and boost frame rates as for the pods there's the power input rj45 hdmi 2.0 port to connect 4k displays a thunderbolt 4 port to connect multiple 4k and even 8k displays a usbc port that also supports displayport so you can use this too to connect this laptop to a monitor or tv and this port also supports pd charging the left also has a usb a port and a combo headphone jack the ride also has a couple of pods there's kensington lock slot if you want to lock your laptop somewhere and there's also the usb a port when it comes to connectivity there's dual band wi-fi 6 and bluetooth 5.2 so that's covered now coming to the design this is a premium looking laptop there's no rgb anywhere but this lid which is actually an aluminium panel has this wide finish that looks and feels premium i mean this has a very sandstone like feel to it and it just feels very different this white finish actually extends from the back to some part of the bottom giving a nice dual tone wipe now there is one problem with this white finish and that is it can get dirty fairly quickly now if you're worried about that there's also a gray variant but yeah this looks more premium if you ask me the interiors of the laptop are more understated with the plastic chassis but i like the subtle elements like the hexagon power button this x-like four-way indicator the transparent wsd keys and the tough logo on the track back the speakers are dual bottom fighting speakers and these get loud enough for multiple people to watch a show or a movie the details are also pretty good and i also noticed some good bass and depth in the sound the speakers also have dolby atmos support so you can cue things in the dolby access app the new tough dash f15 comes with a full sized keyboard this time i also like these hotkeys for volume mic and more but one thing to note there's no rgb here it's a single color white backlit keyboard as for the typing experience this is a chiclet keyboard with good spacing between the keys and the keys do offer good travel and feedback this is a keyboard that's satisfying to type on although at the start i did feel the keys are a bit smaller in size which results in errors until you really get used to it having said that the keys are probably a little smaller because there's a full-blown numpad here which people have been wanting anyway the touchpad here is fairly big and nice with its smooth surface and it has dedicated left and right keys which are fine the webcam is a usual 720p webcam the battery is a 76 watt battery with this 180 watt adapter and the battery life is kind of decent dish in our usage the battery lasted for around four or five hours which is decent for a gaming laptop there's also fast charging supported with the charger taking the laptop from zero to 47 percent in about 30 minutes also this laptop comes with windows 11 and there's the asus apps pre-installed and there's also my cafe internet secured look to conclude things the asus stuff dash f15 at 90k brings all of the specs you expect in this price segment but what's more important is that this gets the important factors of a gaming laptop right i mean it's a premium looking laptop if you ask me and it brings good gaming performance with impressive thermals plus the speakers are good the port selection is on point and things like the keyboard and trackpad are good enough yes i would have wanted more ram in this variant and the display could have been brighter although like i said there are more display options in the higher price variants other than that this looks like a well-balanced gaming laptop for the price i want to know from you what do you guys think of the tough dash f-15 at 90k comment down below
