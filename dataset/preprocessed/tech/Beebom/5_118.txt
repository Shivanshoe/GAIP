[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from vm.com and a couple of months back we made a video on this the rog flow x13 two in one convertible laptop now if you remember this is a laptop that's pretty much good at everything to give you an idea here are the specs real quick well first of all the rog flow is super compact at just 1.3 kgs of weight and 15 millimeters thickness it has a convertible design with a 13.4 inch 16 is to 10 touchscreen with 4k resolution 116 srgb gorilla glass etc now it's powered by the 8 core ryzen 9 5900 hs processor with the nvidia g4 1650 max qgp there's also 16 gb of ram 1tb of pci agent 4 ssd now these are all good specs especially because the laptops are the basics are pretty solid too however there's one cool feature of the rog flow that we did not talk about back then because it wasn't launched in india and a lot of you guys complained about that well i'm talking about the fact that this is the only laptop that supports the powerful rog xg mobile egpu well you guys wanted us to talk about the xg mobile egpu so here we are this is the hd mobile egpu and this turns the rg flow x13 from a decently powerful ultra portable laptop to a full blown gaming and performance laptop just look at the specs of this egpu so the xg mobile has nvidia geforce rtx 3080 laptop gpu clocked at 18 10 megahertz at 150 watts with rog boost the 16 gb of vdam vapor chamber cooling system built right in and it uses asus proprietary connector which has eight pcie lanes which means 63 gb per second of bandwidth and that eliminates one of the bottlenecks you get with the egps that connect via the thunderbolt 4 port for people who don't know the thunderbolt 3 and 4 ports support four lanes and their peak bandwidth support is 40 gb per second now apart from that the xg mobile is also a full blown io hub or dock there are four usb a ports sd card reader hdmi 2.0 b and display port 1.4 for external displays and lastly there's an ethernet port now all of this is powered by a 280 watt adapter that's built right into the xg mobile and this adapter can power both the xg mobile and the rg flow now this means when the xg mobile is connected to the rg flow the laptop is in power it's charging so those are all the specs of the hd mobile and what's interesting is that this egpu is actually fairly compact and fairly lightweight it's 29 millimeters thick and it's around one kg in weight and yeah i mean this is the egb in my hand and this is something you can easily carry around toss in a bag you get the idea plus i think it looks fairly cool especially with the red led the lights up when the jeep is in action now coming to actually using this egpu first of all do note that the ng mobile adapter here requires the 16 ampere plug similar to the flagship gaming laptops now connecting the egpu to rog flow is fairly simple just plug in the hd mobile to the xgm interface of the rog flow like this by squeezing the two buttons on the side then lock in the switch to make sure the egpu does not accidentally disconnect after this you'll get a prompt on the screen asking if you want to connect to xg mobile and once you hit okay it'll take a few seconds and you'll get a notification that the rog flow is now using the xg mobile agp yes the 1650 gpu in the laptop will go to sleep when this is connected and to disconnect the xg mobile you just need to click on this icon in the system tray and yeah it'll be disconnected so with the xg mobile you get the rtx 3080 gpu combined with the ryzen 9 and that brings a big difference in performance i mean the 3080 here is the laptop version of the gpu so it's not as powerful as the desktop version but it still brings the full power of the mobile gpu like a lot of other laptops with 3080 and there's also 16 gb of vram which is pretty good now to give you an idea here's the 3d mark score of the rog flow without hd mobile and this is the 3d mark score of the laptop with xg mobile see the difference we are looking at a big performance boost and not just for gaming but for other tasks as well so if you ask me i think the hd mobile brings a lot of power to the rog flow and yeah as expected it smoothes through all the aaa gaming titles out there so i played assassin's creed valhalla which is a fairly demanding game and this is a game i did not even try with the 1650 gpu on the rg flow but with the 3080 on board now the game runs beautifully with good frame rates even in ultra graphics settings as you can see there's no latency or lag it's pretty good i played hitman 3 as well on ultra graphics which if you remember from our original rog flow video i did play without hd mobile as well but now with xg mobile the frame rates are way better on ultra graphics and yeah it's a much better experience apart from this i also played a few other games and most high-end games run smooth all thanks to this eg view as for any heating issues while the xg mobile seems to have a pretty good thermal setup and you do get a bit of fan noise but it's not crazy loud or anything so no issues look i focus majorly on games but if you're wondering about things like 3d rendering or video editing i think the hd mobile with 3080 should make an even bigger difference also one thing to note is that my experience with the xg mobile has been exclusively through rog flow's display but its performance is said to be even better when you connect it to an external monitor see overall the point is the xg mobile egpu really transforms the performance of the rog flow x13 laptop i mean the rgg flow x13 is already a capable laptop with specs like the ryzen 9 chipset but the nvidia 3080 laptop gpu makes a huge difference when it comes to gaming performance as well as other tasks see it turns the rg flow into a full-blown high-end gaming laptop without actually making any compromises as for pricing the xg mobile is available in an rtx 3070 version which costs rpg 6990 and this is the rtx 3080 version that cost repeats one lakh 39990 so to tell you the truth this is not for everyone especially because this is only compatible with the rog flow x13 which itself cost rupees one lakh nineteen thousand nine ninety so the rog flow x13 plus the rtx 3080 xg mobile will easily go north of two lakh rupees so like i said the xg mobile is a niche device but i personally look at it this way i think the xg mobile is a good start when it comes to simple no compromised egps it shows the way and with ease is planning to support this interface on more laptops in the future i'm definitely excited to see more of the xg mobile anyway i want to know your opinion on the hd mobile a gpu so make sure to comment down below also give this video like make sure to share it and subscribe to our
