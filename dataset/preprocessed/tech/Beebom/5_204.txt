[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and if you've used fun touch os vivo's android skin you'd know that one of its biggest problems is with z1 it's just not modern enough too ios like and just inconsistent all right so when we would recently unveil its brand new android screen called origin os i was actually interested in checking out because i want to know what's new with it what exactly does origin always bring see first of all let me make it clear that origin os isn't exactly a brand new android skin or a brand new os or something it's an upgrade to fun touch os but a major revamp upgrade especially on the ui front so this is the new origin os with its brand new home screen and yep this is different to the regular android home screens we're used to now i'm not sure about you guys but the moment i saw this i was reminded of the new ios home screen with widgets as well as windows phone with its style ui anyway vivo says this grid like design is based on the klotsky grid a japanese puzzle game and as you can see it has the usual icons and these new widgets that are dynamic and not like the live tiles on windows let me show you so this is the animating weather widget which shows you more details and you can even interact with this widget as you can see you'll be able to see more info from this widget itself here's another example of an interactive widget this is the voice assistant widget that can be used within this widget itself there's no need to open an app so that's nice this is the calendar widget which notifies you of the flight details very similar to how you got things on windows phone anyway that's wrong even the icons are more interactive and more functional so here's the music widget which lets you choose from the different music players and then play the music there's this lens widget which aptly lets you use different lenses on the camera like the ultra wide angle lens or the telephoto lens directly so overall it's pretty clear that ios 14 has made widgets popular again and vivo with its origin os and this whole grid like ui is focusing on exactly that and to be honest some of the widgets or nano cards as we would like to call them are actually pretty cool and interesting i mean as you can see in this hands-on video some of them have these really nice animations that look smooth and nice and all these cards bring real-time info and more controls there's also the fact that you can take any icon and resize it to make it bigger and get the widget functionality then and there and yeah this is again very similar to windows phone now this does make me wonder if third-party apps will automatically support this feature since every android app has a widget of course anyway there's more to this whole gridlike ui there are a lot of customization options so you can customize the icons from the home screen itself using this button and you can customize any wallpaper on this home screen you can turn a wallpaper to grayscale add the blur effect and even add really cool weather effects to wallpaper so this is actually something i find really cool so you can just use this button to get a wallpaper that changes dynamically to the weather as you can see it brings clouds some rain when it's raining and i think this is awesome there's also a live wallpaper that mimics the time of the day along with cool shadow effects so when it's afternoon the wallpaper will be bright and nice and when it's night the wallpaper will automatically be dark apart from this origin os also brings these cool blooming flower wallpapers which are different flowers blooming over time and yeah i like it now another big change in origin os is the new navigation gestures so the navigation gestures in this new android screen are totally customizable totally i mean it and it's great because i've used apps like fluid navigation gestures in the past that brings something similar to this and it's actually useful so knowledge and noise you cannot pick exactly what happens when you swipe up from the left right and center it's great for example you can use this to divide the edge into two so the top is for the back gesture the usual back gesture and the bottom is to access this supercards anyway vivo says you can create up to 26 navigation combinations so there's obviously a lot of control and i like this ui to customize the gestures from all of the sites it's i think really unique anyway i was also talking about supercard which is a new feature in origin os now this is something that's available anywhere we eat an app or even when the phone is locked so you can just bring it up and it is all the different payment options to make a payment quickly using qr code or anything else using the fingerprint scanner now this can be handy if vivo manages to integrate different payment platforms in india now coming back to the home screen and the new ui this is kind of the big revamp in order to noise obviously but if you want the usual android experience there is this toggle to switch between the grid design and the usual android experience honestly i was hoping this would let us switch to stock android because that's what ryuma suggested and got me all hyped up but turns out it just takes you to the usual funta choice launcher overall if you ask me my opinion about origin os i obviously haven't used it on a phone but from the looks of it it seems like it's ios 14 plus windows phone plus a bunch of other ideas it's like a mix of just different unoriginal things and some of it does seem cool but some of it does not i mean let's face it origin os is definitely better than fun touch os which just looks like outdated ios and yeah even the name origin noise is better than fun touch os but is it as good as some of the other skins i'm not really sure honestly ui is a big factor for people when buying a phone these days so i really think vivo should focus on making its ui more cleaner and simpler but you know what i actually want to get hands-on with the phone running this new origin os to get a better idea because they're also said to be performance improvements smooth animations and other changes anyway what do you guys think of this new origin os and this new ui tell us in the comment section below also give this video a like if you enjoyed it and make sure to
