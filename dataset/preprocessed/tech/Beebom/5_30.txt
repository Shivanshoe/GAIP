windows 11 laptops at 25 000 rupees what's the first word that comes to your mind slow well asus launched this new br 1100 series of budget laptops and these laptops aim to fix the windows 11 experience in the whole budget laptop segment the two laptops the br 1100c which is priced into piece 24 triple nine and this is what i'll be focusing on but there's also the br 1100f which is a two in one touchscreen laptop at 29.99 so let's get started so this is the asus br 1100c and i know it looks kind of boxy and functional with the whole plastic design but don't go by its looks this is a proper rugged design first of all this is military grade certified laptop so it has gone through a number of tests and this design just feels solid you can see the rubber bumpers around the device the lid and the bottom have a texture that's scratch resistant there are these rubber feet on the bottom for better grip basically this is not the best looking laptop out there but the flip side is it should be fine with drops and bumps i mean i noticed a little bit of flex here and there but other than that this feels well built and i like that this whole design is modular and it can be easily opened for repairs and upgrades moreover this is very portable it's compact and it's very lightweight at 1.26 kgs and you also get this led indicator on the lid which by the way does not open with one hand now this is all fine but let's get to the important factor it's the performance that matters in this price range so let's check out the specs right away this has the intel celeron n4500 chipset which is a 10 animated chipset dual cores and two threads it can go up to 2.8 gigahertz now this is fine but what's interesting is that there's a gb gen 3 ssd here along with 4gb ddr4 ram now this is interesting because even in 2022 a lot of laptops in the 25k segment come with either hdd storage or emc storage or slower ram and they kind of become bottlenecks in the performance so it's good that asus has used an ssd along with fast ram and as for the ssd's performance here's the crystal dismount benchmark score from the laptop which shows that this is a standard gen3 ssd also one thing to note the ssd here is user upgradable to up to 2 tb now here the benchmark scores from the laptop but other than that the user experience on budget windows laptops is the biggest problem and that's where the br 1100 laptops are surprising i mean this is a laptop that won't handle heavyweight intensive apps and games but day-to-day usage should be good first for the boot time of windows 11 in this laptop is 10 seconds to the login screen and 25 seconds to the desktop which is pretty good apart from that my usage generally includes chrome slack some minor photo editing and this laptop handles that pretty easily here's chrome with 10 tabs open and one of them is playing a video on 1080p and there's also notepad and paint.net open in the background and you can see that the performance is good there's no stutter lag while using the laptop switching between tabs the cpu usage is fine to around 25 to 35 percent and the ram usage is in the 80 now if i play a 4k video some lag comes up and you can see the cpu and ram usage increase in fact the cpu usage goes to 100 but even then the laptop is usable we even tried some photoshop on it and doing some basic photo editing with the single layer was kind of fine on this laptop although it won't handle heavy editing no doubts about that if you're wondering the laptop comes with windows 11 home and the windows experience is also good all around as for the thermals this is a fanless design so the laptop is always silent but there is a vapor chamber cooling system in this laptop the point is most windows laptops in this price range are unusable and this is actually something you can use it's not the fastest windows laptop out there but at this price this brings a good windows 11 experience anyway performance is important but so are the other basics of a budget laptop when it comes to display the asus br 1100 has an 11.6 inch led hd display and i'm not a big fan of the big chunky bezels all around which makes it look like an old laptop but asus says that they kept this bezel to accommodate a full keyboard and give the screen better protection in case of drops as for display it's a matte display which looks decent when you look at it from the front from a side angle it does look a bit washed out due to the average viewing angles and apart from that the colors are fine and it's not the brightest but it gets the job done also display here can be tilted to 180 degrees like this the port selection is good on the left you get a usbc port which also supports charging a usb a port hdmi kensington lock slot and the power input the right has another usb a port ethernet i head for my combo jack the power button and a physical volume rocker now there's no fingerprint scanner or windows zillow support but there is a 720p webcam here which has a 3d noise reducing feature and there's also webcams that are built right into the design now this is the keyboard that you get and i like that it has a dedicated key to mute the mic which students will find handy anyway this is a chicklet keyboard and the travel is low but the typing feels smooth and nice thanks for the good tactile feedback the trackpad is decently sized and it is smooth and it supports windows 11 gesture apart from this there are two speakers which like most speakers in this price range are kind of average the battery is a 42 watt 3 cell battery and there is a 45 watt charger in the box now asus claims battery life up to 10 hours but practically this should last for 5-6 hours as for connectivity the laptop has wi-fi five with dual band support and this bluetooth 4.2 a lot of people have doubts on the warranty of budget laptops this comes with one ear one now the other br 1100 laptop is a two in one laptop and has the same specs as the usual one but it has a flip design with a glossy touch screen so you can use it as a windows tablet and i like that this laptop has a stylus that's built right into the design in fact this slot also charges the stylus as for the styluses performance is good and i noticed good palm rejection too so you can easily draw and write on the screen plus this has an additional 13 megapixel camera that you can use in tablet mode to conclude things the asus br 1100 series of laptops is definitely interesting especially the br 1100c which is price repeats 24 triple nine i mean 25k there are only a few options of windows laptops with ssds and that's what this makes sense i mean you saw it in action this actually brings a good usable windows 11 experience for this price it's not a perfect laptop i think asus could have cut down the bezels and the design could have been a little more appealing but i like the rugged features and the portability of the design i also liked the other basics you expect in a laptop seem fairly on point be the keyboard the ports or the trackpad so this seems like a good value for money laptop right so what do you think about these new br
