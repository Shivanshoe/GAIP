[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is bassrmion.com and this right here is the brand new real me eight pro redmi has been teasing this hyping it up and it's finally here so what's new in the realme 8 pro what are the upgrades it brings over the redmi 7 pro how does it compare to the redmi note 10 pro the pro max well i'm going to talk about all of that so let's begin so this is the new readme 8 pro and the moment i took this out of the box the one thing that i really liked was how light and compact this phone is i mean offlane really has been making some really sleek phones and this is another very sleek phone it's just 8.1 millimeters thin and it only weighs 176 grams which is pretty good compared to say a redmi note 10 pro max which weighs in the 190s anyway the in-hand feel apart another thing i noticed is this the back here there's this big bold day-to-day branding and i think this is a very divisive design language some people will like it some people will not i don't think there's a middle ground here now i'm not a big fan of this design but it's a very subjective thing so i want to know if you like this design or not just comment down below now another thing to note here is that the phone has a plastic body when the redmi note 10 pro and the pro max come with glass backs anyway we have the infinite blue variant which i think looks cool and it has this sans stony sort of finish now moving to the front the m8 pro comes with a super amoled display it's a 6.4 inch panel with fhd plus resolution 1000 nits of max brightness dc dimming support and a usual 60 hertz refresh rate now to be perfectly honest a higher refresher amoled would have been better since the competition now brings that but i'm glad that it's not ips lcd anyway the amoled panel here seems pretty good so far it's bright and nice it's vibrant and in typical amulet fashion the blacks look great also thanks to amulet there's an in-display fingerprint scanner which is very fast as you can see and i certainly prefer this than a side mounted fingerprint scanner now apart from that there are a few things that you guys always ask us about the designs so yeah talking about that there's the dual sim plus micro is the dedicated slot here there's a headphone jack at the bottom and as for the speakers there's only one single speaker right at the bottom there's no stereo speakers now moving on from the design the big upgrade in the m8 pro is obviously on the camera front let me just talk about the camera specs now the phone comes with the 108 megapixel samsung hm2 sensor with the f 1.8 aperture smart isotec and 91 pixel binning now this is obviously the big highlight but there's also the 8 megapixel ultra wide angle lens and a couple of 2 megapixel cameras so i've been taking photos from the 108 megapixel sensor and the photos look very good so far i mean i haven't compared it to the redmi note 10 pro max which also has the same sensor but so far individually the photos from real me 8 pro look great the details are fantastic which is something i expected and these photos also have a rich color tone and the dynamic range in the photos with the sky look very good in low light i did notice some shots getting a bit noisy but that was in super low light situations and mostly the photos were bright and sharp so it's good and like i said it'll be interesting to see how it compares to the note 10 pro max i think it's going to be a tough call anyway there's also the ultra wide angle lens which kind of skims on the details but manages to get the colors decently so it's fine there's also the ported mode which in my testing so far seems to work pretty well and yeah there are also different portrait modes we have seen in oppo phones there's dynamic bokeh neon portrait and ai color portrait so all that is good but what's interesting about the realme 8 pro is that it brings a number of cool camera features first up there's 3x in sensor zoom which uses the 108 megapixel sensor to capture zoomed 12 megapixel images and here's a 1x and 3a zoom shot side by side and i think 3x zoom shot is pretty good there's an improved starting mode along with the new starry time lapse video mode for the very first time now i tested this from my balcony and his result now we don't get to see a lot of stars here in delhi hence here but this could be pretty cool right there's also a new tilt shift mode that we recently saw in the oneplus phones and you can take photos like this from this mode on the video front there's the dual video mode which lets you shoot from the rear and the selfie camera at the same time there's ai highlight mode which bumps up hdr in day time and turns on ultra night mode in low light scenarios so the camera is feature packed but let's talk about the performance now so the realme 8 pro does not bring an upgrade on the specs front here there's a snapdragon 720 g with up to 8 gb of ram and 128 gb of storage now 720 g is not an upgrade but it's not a bad thing too because the 720g is a good performer and it's close to what you get with the 732 on the note 10 pro max here are the benchmark scores of the redmi 8 pro compared to the redmi note 10 pro max and as you can see the scores are so close same with android the real m8 pro is actually a little better here but it's not a big difference at all anyways for the real world performance the redmi 8 pro has been speedy and nice so far even while gaming and i'm positive about the performance here but yeah i've only used the phone briefly so no word it's as of now now the good thing about the real me 8 pro is that it brings the latest software on board i mean unlike the nozzle 30 pro or the real me x7 it has real me ui 2.0 on top of android 11 so get all the latest features as for the pre-installed apps along with the real me apps you get facebook flipkart amazon and snapchat and that's pretty much it so yeah not a lot and they can be uninstalled when it comes to the battery the real m8 pro has the same 4500 image battery which i'm yet to test but with amulet and 720g i think it should be good as for the charging you must have noticed that the phone supports 50 watt super dart charging which is kind of a downgrade because the redmi 7 pro supported 65 watt superdome charging so strangely the remaining pro actually comes with a 65 watt charger in the box but it only charges at a max 50 watts anyway it's still faster than the competition because it charges the eight pro to 100 in around 46 minutes so yeah that's fast lastly the connectivity so carrier aggregation is an important thing and the good thing is i checked the readm8 pro and it does support carrier aggregation which is great because readme x7 like this well it's time to conclude things so at the time of shooting this video i don't know the price of the real me 8 pro and you know what i think a lot depends on the price here see from the looks of it the redmi 8 pro seems like a good all-round smartphone it has an amoled display 108 megapixel main camera with lots of cool camera features a sleek and light design and i'm positive about the performance and the battery and charging speeds however it's not perfect the back is plastic the display is 60 hertz there's no stereo speakers and these are important factors because there is some tough competition in the form of the redmi note 10 pro and the pro max so like i said a lot depends on the price here and if priced correctly the real me 8 pro could very well be good value for money so i'm gonna wait for the price before i give my final verdict anyway what do you think about the redmi 8 pro just comment down your thoughts below also give this video like if you enjoyed it make sure to share it and subscribe to
