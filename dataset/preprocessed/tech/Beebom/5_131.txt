[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from vm.com and like every other year a new version of me ui is coming very soon i'm talking about the upcoming miui 13 update so what are the new features will bring what do we know about it so far well i'm gonna tell you all about the miui 13 update and i'm also gonna tell you why i think this might be the most important update for xiaomi okay so first up miui 13 is said to be coming in august with the me mix four yes xiaomi is launching a meme x phone this year with an under display camera tech and it'll be the first phone to come with the brand new me y13 update as for what the miui 13 is rumored to bring we saw a leaked video of the new power menu which showed a new animation and we also saw the new file manager that said to be part of miui 13 and as you can see it brings a new home page new cool animations and a redesigned me drive page well apart from these minor leagues there's actually a whole list of rumored me ui 13 features let me show you so according to rumors miui 13 should bring improved ui and animations better touch sensitivity improvements to scrolling screenshots improvements to screen recorder and i hope there's support for high fps it's also said to bring in new themes new cool super wallpapers new gestures better always on display a scheduling option for airplane mode which sounds handy a better notification shade that will manage old and newer notifications better while also letting you respond to text faster it's also said to be fast charging improvements probably for battery health and a new power mode for better battery performance now these are obviously rumored features but yeah they sound good now what's really important is that xiaomi recently set up a new division for miui so this new division is called the miui pioneer group and its main task is to gather info and feedback from users and the miui community for both the chinese rom and the global rom so that they can quickly fix all of the miui issues before rolling out the new miui 13 update in fact there's also a new survey from this team in the me community that asks the users for feedback and issues nami community is banned in india so we can't access that but yeah overall this miui pioneer group is a good step look overall the miui 13 update should add some really cool new features to miui and that's great that's really a good thing but let's take a look at the other side of me why the inconsistencies and the bugs i mean the biggest problem with miui right now is the bugs it's crazy let me give you a couple of examples so recently there was news all around the internet of poco x2 users not able to use the camera app after the update that's big i mean xiaomi did give out steps to fix it on twitter but how can that reach every single user i mean a lot of people already went ahead and paid money in the service center to get this fixed it's crazy another example is the redmi note 9 and other budget phones facing performance issues with the miui 12 update so xiaomi just going ahead and releasing another update that removes features like floating windows the new control center and more now there are a lot more examples and even the me community forums are filled with hundreds of complaints for almost every single xiaomi device i mean i know a lot of you guys have faced bugs in me why so make sure to comment that below and you know what xiaomi is actually aware of all of these issues i mean me wise rnd had recently apologized for all of these issues here's what he said translated from chinese so yeah he's actually right xiaomi just did not do enough to make sure that updates are stable and you can clearly see that the miui bugs are actually device specific so one device has one kind of bug another device is another it's not the same on every device look it's clearly a matter of me why not being properly optimized for each and every device i mean do you guys remember the me a3 breaking saga with the android 11 update i mean that was insane i know that was not me ui but it was an update that came directly from xiaomi and they're clearly not tested because how could a well-tested supposedly stable update break a phone now i understand xiaomi launches a lot of phones poco phones redmi phones me phones but quality control is a big issue i mean nobody likes their phones going crazy worse with an update that's actually supposed to make things better it's a big issue so you know what if someone from xiaomi is watching this there are actually only three simple things we want from miui first up the cool features the animations the ui it's all nice it's great but with me ui 13 you guys should focus on the experience xiaomi phones deserve a bug free experience that gets better with updates not worse second point it's high time xiaomi fixes the whole miui setup process in its phones see right now be the flagship me 11 ultra the budget redmi note 10 you get the same setup experience on miui that sneakily wants users to install recommended apps use the glass lock screen feature which basically is adware so it's high time xiaomi let's go over this cluttered shady setup experience third point and we've said this time and again there's got to be better ram management in miui i mean this has been a problem with xiaomi phones since forever but without budget phones coming with six and eight gigs of ram there's actually no need for miui to kill apps in the background and yeah xiaomi should fix this now there's actually one more thing maybe more timely updates with miui and maybe three years of major android updates for all of his phones but yeah maybe i'm asking a bit too much see ultimately the point is and we've said this in the past as well great hardware deserves a great software experience i mean you all know how good xiaomi phones are when it comes to design the specs and the hardware just think about it the redmi note 10 pro max the me 11x the mi 11x pro the me11 ultra all these phones are mostly unmatched but at the end the decision comes down to whether you can accept me ui or you can't and this is what xiaomi needs to fix with me y30 to be honest the miui pioneer group is actually a very good step because xiaomi needs a big push when it comes to software experience if you ask me a cleaner more optimized better miui experience will take xiaomi to just another level so yeah i really wish xiaomi fixes me ui because the next miui updates is what will break or make xiaomi well what are you guys expecting from me y13 and what are the bugs that you've been facing that you want xiaomi to fix once and for all comment down below also this is very important share this video so that it reaches the
