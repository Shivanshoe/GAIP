hey guys this is from vm.com and today i'm going to talk about the absolute best google phone of all time now i'm sure some of you are wondering if i'm talking about the pixel 4a because that's the latest pixel phone yeah that's not it now probably some of you are wondering if i'm talking about the first google pixel because that's the phone that started the whole pixel lineup yeah i'm not talking about that either well enough suspense let me just show you well i'm talking about this remember this phone this is the google nexus 5 which in my opinion is the best google phone of all time the absolute code anyway there are multiple reasons why i think this is the best google phone so let's talk about that okay so again this is the nexus 5 and this is a phone that i've been a big fan of and this is probably the best selling google phone ever now to be honest i think google can take a lot of inspiration from this phone right now but i'll get to that later in this video so stick till the end now i call this the best google phone of all time due to two things the first is the experience and specs see the nexus 5 in 2013 had cutting-edge flagship specs 5-inch 1080p display snapdragon 800 the flagship chipset back then 2gb ram 1632 gb storage 2300 mah battery but more interestingly it had wireless charging and ois which wasn't even part of the galaxy s4 or the iphone 5s the other flagships out here now along with this great specs there was obviously the clean and nice google software experience and there was just amazing community support for this phone so the whole experience was a big reason for the fan following of the nexus 5 but the second reason is why the phone was very popular in countries like india the price so take a look the nexus 5 was probably 350 dollars in the us and rupees 28 triple nine in india now you're probably thinking it was 2013 maybe this was the price of flagship back then well not really the galaxy s4 launched in india at rupees 41 500 rupees while the iphone 5s arrived in india at rs 41 900. so 40k was kind of the flagship price range and the nexus 5 at 29k was amazing value for money and a lot of people bought this back in the day i remember i wanted to buy it but instead i settled for some moto g which was in my budget yeah it's a sad story anyway so the big question is if the nexus 5 was so popular in india why did google fail in india with all of its later phones well if you look closely all of the nexus phones and the pixel phones that followed after the nexus 5 did not do well in india because of one major reason the pricing let me show you so the nexus 5 launched at 28 triple 9 which i've already told you after which the nexus 6 arrived and that was priced at rupees 44 000 so kind of a big bump anyway after that the nexus 5 extra ride which is kind of a nexus 5 successor but instead of flagship specs it came with mid-range specs and a price tag of 32 000 rupees there was also the last nexus alongside the nexus 6p which cost 40 000 rupees then the pixel lineup started the first google pixel launched in india at a starting price of rupees 57 000. yep quite a big price bump the pixel 2 started at 61 000 rupees again a big bump then the pixel 3 arrived at a starting price of rupees 71 000 yeah i'm not saying anything yeah that pricing sounds insane when you consider where you began with the nexus 5. lastly there's the pixel 3a which was supposed to be a budget friendly pixel but it was priced at an insane 39 triple nine so you can clearly see after the nexus 5 the pricing of google phones increased exponentially this is the reason why every single phone after the nexus 5 has paid i mean let's face it all of us want to buy google devices because even with the loopholes and flaws they bring a software experience that's unmatched with the promise of timely updates in fact people have been asking google to promise five years of updates to its phones which if it happens will be awesome plus along with the software experience the pixel phones have the absolute world-class camera performance so these are the two reasons i really want to buy pixel phones but there's only one thing that's stopping me the price this is where i think the nexus 5 was perfect it was very balanced now i know it's 20 20 and google can't really bring flagship specs at 29 30 000 rupees but the least it can do is be competitive i mean the pixel 4 is the latest affordable pixel is a phone that's pretty interesting and i know at 350 dollars it seems great for the us it makes a lot of sense but in india it'll probably be priced at around 35 40k and at that price the snapdragon 730 just won't cut it so google really wants to come back in india and let's face it the indian smartphone market is full of competition the need and affordable pixel that's actually value for money so how about maybe a pixel 5 light at around 25 30k with all of the pixel features like the great camera the great software experience amoled and a chipset that's actually competitive like say the snapdragon 765 g now this would be a killer phone ads price right i mean trust me people want to buy phones made by google and if google does launch a phone like this the pixel phones will regain popularity and we'll finally have a google smartphone as popular as this iconic smartphone the nexus 5 but what do
