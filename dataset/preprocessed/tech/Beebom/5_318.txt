up is this power bank I know it looks like your usual power bank so how is this cool you ask well let me explain so this power bank has two exciting features that make it stand out so it's a 10,000 mah power bank which is all the necessary features that you expect from a modern-day power bank 18 what fast charging that works both ways all the port's that you need including USB a micro USB and type-c but you know what for cell phones you won't even need any of these ports because this power bank also offers 10 watt wireless charging so in case you forget your charging cable don't worry just slap your phone on top of this power bank and it will start charging easy now the second and the most crucial feature is the extension that comes out of this power bank what it does is this yeah this X has a kickstand to any smartphone so it's a boon for people like me who like to watch their favorite videos while having dinner or you know during flights it's very handy to sum it up this power bank is definitely feature packed at rupees 2500 and I'm glad I found it anyway if you found this gadget interesting keep watching this video till the end because these gadgets keep getting better moving on the second gadget on our list is this mouse pad again it looks like your usual mouse pad but again it's much more than that what's special about this mouse pad is that it can also wirelessly charge your smartphone yep pretty cool so one side of the mousepad can be used as an ordinary pad and the other side where you see this qi wireless charging marking is where you place your phone to let it charge when you work it's a pretty decent way to keep your phone juiced up as it's quite effortless it's not fast wireless charging as it only charges your phone at five BOTS but at thirteen hundred rupees I think it's a decent gadget that you can check out next in our list is my personal favorite it's this this is a wireless mouse that looks like the Iron Man helmet it even lights up in the dark and as you can see it looks really cool when I saw it online I rushed to buy it because it was so damn cool plus I've been using it and I like a few things about it for example the buttons on the mouse are very tactile and they are silent so you won't get that clicky sound if you don't like it the pointing is precise and this effect that you can change the DPI of the mouse on the mouse itself so yeah this is a fully functional Mouse that's definitely going to make the aesthetics of your desk look cooler it's priced at 1,200 to pcs on Amazon and you can use it with two triple A batteries now I know you can get a much better Mouse or maybe a keyboard mouse combo a trapeze 1,300 but look at this guy's just look at this for all you Iron Man fans out there this is something that you should definitely get hobby 3000 number four on our list is this lazy mobile neck Bank because why not I got this for 200 rupees yep just 200 rupees and I wasn't really expecting it to look premium and it certainly is not looks aside it functions exactly like it's shown in the product images you just hang it around your neck put on your phone in the holder and let go it doesn't strain your neck like you would expect it to which is great secondly it helps a lot if you're trying to watch your favorite TV show on your bed and your hand starts hurting because of the phone so yeah it's a great gadget but on a more serious note I wouldn't recommend you to use your phone all the time using this segment because smartphone addiction is bad so please keep that in mind oh by the way this is rapacious favorite gadget and he is definitely taking it home once we are done with the show yeah for the fifth spot this actually a tie between three gadgets and one of them is not even a gadget but hey who's keeping account sup guys so I'm not asking you what's up sup is actually the name of the gadget it's a handheld gaming console that lets you play games like Mario contra etc and it's so much fun once you take it out of the box you will be disappointed by the bad build quality but once you turn it on it puts a smile on your face because it brings back all the memories of your childhood it certainly reminds me of this yeah this gaming console with 9 lakh 99999 games in one anyway the sub gaming console has a three inch color display a 600 mAh battery that should last for three to four hours and it includes 400 classic games hils me playing Super Mario on the sub console and it's a lot of fun especially because I caught it for 700 rupees on Amazon and at that price it's quite good especially for kids see according to a new study the average age when kids get their first smartphones is 10 years old which is way too young for them and I've seen kids getting addicted to smartphones watch YouTube all the time and it's not at all safe for them so instead of giving smartphones to your kids you can just give them one of these gadgets so that they can play these fun little games and don't get addicted to smart phones next up this right here is a keychain with a purpose it's a tie pressure gouge which quite obviously lets you measure tire pressure when you are in doubt it works well for both cars and two wheelers and for 500 rupees it's a handy gadget last but not the least is this the mighty Thanos bottle opener it's not a gadget guys but it's
