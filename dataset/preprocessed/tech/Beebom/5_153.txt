[Applause] [Music] hey guys i'm akshay from rebound.com and as you all probably know i'm an iphone user and i'm sure a lot of you guys are as well well in all my time using an iphone i've come across some really cool settings that even i wasn't actually aware of so i thought why not share them with you guys well in this video i'll be telling you about 10 iphone settings you should change right away so what are we waiting for let's get started [Music] opening links in safari is a pain because it automatically switches over to the new tab if you dislike this behavior as well here's how you can fix it so within the settings app you can just go to safari here scroll down and tap on open links and set it to in background now whenever you open a new link in safari you won't be automatically switched away to the new tab instead the link will open in a new tab in the background and you can continue browsing without any problems [Music] by default iphones allow access to the control center and the notification center even when they are not if you want better security on your iphone you should disable this right with just go into settings and tap on face id and passcode once you've entered your passcode just scroll down and disable the toggles next to control center and notifications now your iphone will not let anyone access the notification center or the control center until it is unlocked so random people won't be able to change your iphone settings most of the time i like to use my phone on low brightness however with apps like youtube or call of duty mobile i really like to use high brightness and changing the brightness every time i open the app is just a pain so i made an automation to help you with that simply open the shortcuts app and tap on automation create a new automation and select app as the trigger choose call of duty as the app and tap on done now within the automation select add action and search for set brightness that's it just make sure you disable the ask before running toggle here before tapping on done you can create similar automations for other apps with any settings you like it's pretty cool moving on there's a hidden album in iphones to hide your sensitive photos but if someone opens your photos app the hidden album is literally there with the name hidden which is just stupid and counterintuitive fortunately you can hide this album just head into settings and go to photo settings here simply disable the toggle for hidden album this will hide the hidden album from the photos app so at least it won't be staring you right in the face all the time [Music] if you like to take a lot of selfies this is one setting you should definitely change to get better selfies from your iphone just go to settings tap on camera and enable the toggle next to mirror front camera now whenever you take a selfie the final image will appear exactly the same as it appears in the viewfinder instead of getting flipped one really irritating thing about the iphone is that you can't lock apps however if you really want to lock your apps there is a workaround hack or a jugaad basically that you can use just go to screen time settings inside the settings app and tap on app limits add a new limit for the app you want to lock for example i'll set the photos app set this timer to one minute which is the shortest time available and then tap on add now check this out the photos app is greyed out if someone tries to open it they will have to enter your screen time passcode unfortunately this is the only way to lock apps on iphone so far but yeah if you really need to lock your apps you can use this method for sure [Music] iphones these days take photos in the new heif format which is a pain if you want to share these photos because most devices still don't support hti format heck even some macs older than mac os high sierra can't open these photos basically you should just disable these simply go to settings and then to camera settings here just head into formats and select most compatible to capture photos in regular jpeg format which will work in almost every device out there next up if you are annoyed having to take off your mask to unlock your iphone every time you can actually use your voice to unlock your iphone as well in settings go to accessibility here go to voice control and enable it now go to customize command and tap on create new command enter the phrase you want to use and under action select run custom gesture now just tap on the places where your passcode keys will be and save the gesture that's it the next time i want to unlock my iphone with the mask on i can just say kaput reconnaisse and much like the gryffindor common room in year one my iphone just opens up that's pretty cool right you can also create similar commands for other things such as taking pictures if you're trying to take a group photo and your iphone is far away [Music] this setting is for people who take a lot of photos on their iphone if you want to up your photography game you really need to work on your framing and this setting can help you with that simply go to settings and scroll to the camera options here you can enable the grid toggle what this does is basically it enables this nice 3x3 grid within your viewfinder so you can align photos better plus a lot of people don't know this but if you take top down photos a lot you also get this handy level that can help ensure your phone is completely horizontal to the ground for better photos neat right [Music] lastly there are a lot of system services running on your iphone that you can disable to have a better experience here go to settings privacy location services scroll down and tap on system services now no one uses apple maps in india so you can just go to significant locations and disable it you can also disable home kit if you don't use that as well as apple pay which isn't even available in india i would also recommend that you disable iphone analytics that was a lot of system services be disabled but there's more go back to privacy and tap on analytics and improvements here disable the toggle next to share iphone and watch analytics to send even lesser data to apple so those were 10 iphone settings you should change right away there were a lot of settings here for better photography better privacy and even some fun ones for unlocking your phone with your voice or automating settings based on apps hopefully you guys found some settings useful for your day-to-day usage of your iphone and
