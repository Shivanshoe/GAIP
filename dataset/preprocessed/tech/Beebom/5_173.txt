[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is paige from bjorn.com and media tech has been kind of upping its game lately i mean the diminished 3000 plus chipset was pretty impressive on the oppo in the fight pro and now the divinity 800u chipset on the redmi x7 has been pretty good now the divinity 800 youtube set is something that we'll probably see in a lot more mid-range smartphones this year so like we promised we did some really extreme tests on it yes this is mediatek dimension 800u extreme performance test okay first up let's get the specs of the dimension 800u out of the way i mean i know you guys are aware of the specs but how does it compete with the snapdragon 750g on paper oh so the density 800u has its advantages it should be more power efficient because it's a 7 nanometer chipset compared to the 8 nanometer 750g it also has the higher clock speed on its two primary cores at 2.4 gigahertz however the 750g has the newer cortex a77 based cryo 570 cpu compared to the cortex a76 on the 800u now apart from that they both have different gpus with the dimension 800u featuring the mali g57 gpu and the 750g packing the adreno 619 gpu they both have 5g support although the 800u supports dual sim 5g with dual standby now i already talked about the benchmark scores of the 800u in rx7 review but let me just revisit them really quickly so when it comes to antutu a cpu plus gpu benchmark the dimension 800u goes ahead of the 750g especially because of its better gpu score in fact i even ran a gaming benchmark on the realme x7 and the mi 10i and the 800u again beats the 750g here so the benchmarks do give us a good idea of how capable the dementia 800 youtube set is but how does it perform when it comes to thermals the battery drain etc well i tested things out first up i did a pretty simple gaming test i played cody mobile on the x7 for two hours on the trot with the display set to max brightness and you know i want to check the temperature and the battery drain and the results were pretty good see after an hour of cod mobile on the phone what i found impressive on the x7 is that the phone only got slightly warm and nowhere close to overheating i checked the temperature and it was around 37 38 degrees which is pretty comfortable i also checked the battery drain and it was 16 which is good anyway after two hours of intensive code mobile on the phone i did notice the phone got slightly more warmer but trust me when i say that i did not find the phone to be overheating it was just warm and the temperature was around 40 142 degrees and the battery drain after two hours was a total of 33 which again is good now those numbers apart i have been using the real me x7 as my daily driver i mean i have put in my sim card in this phone and i played a lot of games on this phone but there's just no heating whatsoever anyway one thing i have noticed in a lot of phones is that they start overheating when they're charging but that's not the case with the xm here i am checking the temperature on the phone while charging and the phone has been charging for around 30 minutes and as you can see the temperature is in a very normal range so that's good but how about playing games on the phone while charging well i did that too and yes the phone does get warm after say 25-30 minutes of gaming but it's not overheating the temperature when i checked was at 4243 degrees which is not a problem now another area where i wanted to check the temperature of the phone is while using android auto see i drive to a studio every single day and it's a 45-50 minute ride and i use android auto to keep a tab on the traffic and also control music now i have noticed that in this duration a lot of phones heat up but the dementia 800u does well on that front too i have been using android auto with the real me x7 for the past 10 15 days and the phone has never even gotten warm and i think that's how it should be on our phones so there are no heating issues or any weird battery drain on the x7 with the demand city 800d chipset now if you've seen our full review of the x7 you'd know that the battery performance of this phone is very good and that's in a day to day usage now i did not tell you the battery idle drain but to tell you now the idle drain is somewhere around five percent on some days and three to four percent on other days which is perfectly fine number one i wanted to check if the demand city 800u throttles the performance when put under pressure so the first thing i did is i installed the cpu throttling test app and ran the test for 15 minutes see this is an app that loads up the cpu with up to 100 threads and then sees if the cpu starts throttling the performance so the green in the graph basically means no throttling the yellow means there's some throttling which is kind of expected on most phones and it's fine and the red means there's a lot of cpu throttling going on now here's the end result of the dimension 800u after 15 minutes of the test and as you can see it did a very good job here the cpu only throttled to 90 percent of its max performance which is very good i mean i also did this test on the meat ni and well it was good to a throttle to 85 of its max performance so yeah the 800 u is slightly better now i did another test to check cpu throttling i charged the phone two hundred percent and ran the answer to benchmark five times consecutively without any breaks now a lot of phones start to heat up in this test which results in cpu throttling and thus a drop in scores where the real me x7 did heat up a limb which is something i expected but here are the scores from the phone and as you can see they all remain mostly consistent i also noted the cpu temperature in the end and as you can see it's around 50 degrees but this is fine really because i've seen phones go up to even 70 degrees in this test well those are all the tests i did on the readme x7 with the mediatek demensity 800u chipset and you know after all of that it's pretty clear that the diminishing 800u is a very solid smartphone chipset see it's consistent and fast when it comes to day-to-day performance and gaming and even when i put it to extreme tests it did really well when it comes to thermals cpu throttling and the battery drain overall it's nice to see the mediatek device 800u competing and even beating snapdragon chipsets in the same segment and honestly i want to see more phones with the dimension 800 u in the future anyway i hope i've cleared all of your doubts on the dimension 800 you but if you still have
