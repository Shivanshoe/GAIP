[Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bjorn.com and today i'm going to say something that i never thought i'd ever say it's this whatsapp's new secret plan is just a win yes to give you a better idea let's just take a flashback so yesterday i opened whatsapp and i got this prompt about this new whatsapp privacy policy so i obviously went ahead checked it out at all the details and i was like what whatsapp is trying to force this new privacy policy on every single one of its users and for people who do not know about this new privacy policy you can check out a video on the same last video i'll leave a link in the description down below anyway so this new privacy policy was supposed to come into effect on february 8th but there was a lot of backlash a lot of people actually started making an effort to switch to telegram or signal i mean a survey showed that the new privacy policy has resulted in indians losing their trust in whatsapp plus the ministry of electronics and information technology in india had written to whatsapp ceo stating that the new whatsapp policy changes are not fair and acceptable so with all this backlash whatsapp aka facebook had to take a few steps back but the company was forced to delay the rollout of the new privacy policy to 15th may 2021 but that was it nothing else has changed now 15th may is almost here so will your whatsapp account be deleted will whatsapp force you to accept this new privacy policy well let me tell you all about whatsapp's new kind of evil plan first up whatsapp has now kind of scrapped the may 15 deadline here's a statement whatsapp spokesperson gave to android central and this statement makes you believe that whatsapp will not be deleting your accounts and you won't lose the features in the app on may 15. for an end user it'll feel like everything's fine and not accepting the privacy policy won't create any issues but you know what there is a twist see whatsapp's faq page makes it pretty clear that whatsapp has this whole plan set up to force users to accept this new privacy policy and that's kind of where the evil lies let me show you so here's what whatsapp plans to do see if you don't accept the privacy policy by may 15 whatsapp will gradually start to remind you to accept the policy and if you don't accept it you will get an annoying persistent reminder to accept it now if you still don't accept it whatsapp will start limiting the functionality on your whatsapp account you'll be able to accept audio and video calls and you'll be able to respond to messages from the notification center only but you won't be able to access the whole chat list in the app so basically you won't be able to access any of your chats or group chats after a few weeks of this limited functionality if you still don't accept the policy you won't be able to receive incoming calls or notifications and whatsapp will stop sending messages and calls to your phone so basically whatsapp will become a useless app on your phone if you don't accept this privacy policy basically whatsapp's plan is to slowly gradually push you out of its app until and unless you accept this new privacy policy now i know there are a few questions on everyone's mind regarding this privacy policy so let me just answer them first up is whatsapp rolling back this new privacy policy well the answer is no clearly you'll have to accept this privacy policy if you want to keep using whatsapp now second question it's a very important question can someone who has agreed to the privacy policy go ahead and change the decision basically disagree to it well the answer is no right now there's no way you can go ahead and disagree to this policy if you've already accepted it [Music] so it's clear that whatsapp users which include a majority of us only have two options right now the first option is accept the new privacy policy keep using whatsapp and the second choice is don't accept the new privacy policy and switch to a secure messaging app like signal look i know it's tough i've been personally trying to switch over to the signal messenger but the fact remains that most of my friends and family are still using whatsapp but you know what it's now or never i think this is the time to switch to a different messaging app because trust me it's facebook and the privacy issues are only going to get worse so this is important share this video with your friends and family ask them to switch to signal messenger export your chats your whatsapp chats while you still can move your groups from whatsapp to signal just do it make the switch the signal [Music]
