[Applause] [Music] you guys this is patient v1 comm and I'm here in beautiful San Francisco for Galaxy unpacked 2020 and along with you galaxy Estonia Samsung has just launched the Galaxy Z flip its second pull of the smartphone I went hands-on with it for what are you waiting for let's check it out so this is the new galaxy Z flip and well this looks gorgeous doesn't it I mean the mirror finish the striking colors it looks stunning all that is great but this is what it's all about flipping yep this is actually a flip phone but unlike your older flip phones it has a screen that cools yeah like this now this is what makes it truly exciting so when open up the galaxy flip is like you use a smartphone with your usual display your usual experience but unlike your usual Ford you can just fold this in and keep it in your pocket there's a sound when you fold the galaxy Z flip and it's a sound that will definitely remind you of all the flip phones anyway this is what it looks like when it's folded very compact and very nice as you can see it's got a display as well this is a 1.1 inch OLED display with Samsung calls a cover display and this is a display to be used to check the time the important notifications take you can even take a selfie with this display anyway like the galaxy full you can see there's this gap in between when the Z clip is folded but if you're wondering about the durability well the galaxy's Eclipse displays made out of glass unlike the fold which was all plastic this is a six point seven inch HD Plus AMOLED with ultra-thin glass and it's got very minimal bezels now if you're wondering yes the crease is pretty visible and I can even feel it also another thing to note here is that this is one tall display I mean this is a 22 is to nine display and yeah it's really tall now from the front the galaxy Z flip seems like a usual smartphone but there are some interesting use cases thanks to the next mode so the Galaxy SIII flip has a self supporting hinge which means you can lock it at an angle between 1710 degrees Samsung calls it the Flex mode and in this mode you get the viewing area on the top and an interaction area on the bottom so this might actually come in handy for save when you're recording a timelapse video with this you no longer need a tripod so that's amazing dude even use this will capture selfies hands-free or even make a video call there's a lot of the app support the Flex mode so for example when you're watching a YouTube video you can get the comment section in this and the video on the other half there are lot of other use cases and well it does seem pretty cool no but from the flip form fact of the galaxy deeply does not have cutting its specs but it's definitely flash upgrade if he just a Snapdragon 855 plus chipset a GB of RAM 256 gigs of storage a 12 megapixel wide + tool megapixel ultra wide dual camera setup on the back and a 3300 mAh battery with 15 watt fast charging CI flashes pangs but not exactly cutting-edge so the specs are good and definitely better than what you get in the motor raise a bird hit the galaxy Z flip is not about the specs it's about this folding form factor which isn't as crazy as the Galaxy fooled but it's still super cool having said that I'm not sure how useful this flip form factor can be other than being great for keeping it in the pocket and at $1400 yeah it's pretty pricey yeah I want to test it out more to get a better idea and hopefully Samsung will launch it in here soon well that was a quick look at the new Galaxy Z flip so what do you think tell us in the comments section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos that's me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next [Music]
