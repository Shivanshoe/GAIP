[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is the page from v1.com and this right here is the new realme 7 pro which by the way also comes in this buy box yeah now that aside this has to be one of the most interesting smartphones that i've used off late i mean let's face it the real mystics pro that arrived earlier this year had some compromises but the realme 7 pro this brings some great upgrades some nice changes and some really interesting features but also at a slightly higher price so the question is should you pay more should you buy this or say the poco x2 well i've been using this phone as my daily driver so let's find out so one of the biggest issues i have had with phones in this sub 20k price segment is the fact that they are all too big be it the poco x2 there will be no time pro max or even the real me 6 pro now compared to those phones i like the fact that the real me 7 pro is well more handy in my user there hasn't been a day where i felt like the phone is too big or too heavy it's very comfortable to use and it's very important to put things into a little perspective here's the dimensions and weight comparison of the real 7 pro the poco x2 and the redmi note 9 pro max now as you can see the real me 7 pro is a little smaller than both of them and a lot lighter 182 grams honestly i could feel the difference in weight while i was using it now one bummer when it comes to the design is that it's a plastic bag and next to the poco x2 and the realme 6 pro yes it does not look as fancy or premium but in my opinion it does not look cheap at all the good thing here is that it's a matte finish which looks and feels better than the glossy plastic i also like the blue color variant and this new split design apart from that there are the usual buttons the usual ports the dual sim plus micro sd dedicated slot and they don't have any problems now apart from that the design of the real me seven pro brings two upgrades that you know make a lot of sense to me the display and the speakers so yep real me has finally heard us and after the x2 they are back with amulet panels the realme 7 pro comes with a 6.4 inch super amoled display and this is great because this is a big upgrade over the ips lcd panel on the real v6 pro i mean this is amoled so it's obviously very attractive with very deep blacks and punchy colors i mean here's the redmi 7 pro display in comparison with the oneplus note to you know compare the amoled panels and yeah the nord amoled is a bit warmer but both of these displays have the same rich colors and black quality as for versus the poco x2 the realme 7 pro display just looks more vibrant and more attractive to be honest the poco x2 display is a little brighter yeah but that's not a huge difference look i think amoled is a great thing on the 7 pro i know the poco has the 120 hertz refresh rate but like i've said time and again amoled over lcd for me so amanda on the redmi 7 pro is nice and with white wine l1 on board netflix shows and movies playing 1080p and they look great so it's been mostly good but there's one bug that i came across so when i started using this phone at night the screen would automatically get warm yellowish even with the eye comfort mode turned off so let me show you this as you can see there's some blue light filter on the screen as it looks very warm and yellowish but when i check in the display settings the eye comfort mode is off in fact if i turn this on it gets even warmer now this is a software issue not a display issue because changing the time manually fixes this as you can see anyway so i went online to look for you know solutions to this issue and found that this has been an issue on realme phones as well and samsung phones too with a bug bringing the night mode settings from the last phone you were using with no way to change that now there are also some adb solutions a solution with activity launch and different threads but nothing worked except for me hard resetting the phone and not signing in with my google account in the first set of track so yeah that fixed it but this is quite a weird issue and i think this only affects people switching from stock android phones to you know this phone for example and i hope realme does something about it anyway since it's an amulet panel the fingerprint scanner has moved from the side to the front and that's a good thing because the on-screen fingerprint scanner here is very fast so that's nice and not just the fingerprint scanner face unlock is pretty fast too like on every other dvd phone so unlocking the phone is pretty smooth now apart from amulet there's one new design feature that i really really appreciate and that's the inclusion of stereo speakers so basically you get a speaker at the top and one at the bottom and obviously the bottom speaker is a bit louder and more powerful but the top speaker isn't too feeble or anything so that's pretty good but let me just play some music so as you can probably notice uh the combined dual speakers are very loud and uh yeah you also get the stereo speaker impact and that's pretty rare in this price range so i like it another area where the real me 7 pro comes with upgrades is on the camera front so this is the quad camera setup that you get and yeah it's the same as the redmi 7 with the same imx 682 primary sensor so that's good but there's one downgrade see unlike the realme 6 pro which had a telephoto lens the real me 7 pro does not come with a telephoto lens which is a little sad because a telephoto lens instead of the two 2 megapixel lenses would have made the setup better anyway other than that i think the cameras here are pretty good but there is one issue that i'll talk about so i've taken a lot of photos with descent pro so check them out now the daytime shots are well exposed there's good details and i also noticed some good dynamic range in some shots now it's important to note that some shots do have saturated colors which is a little much especially when there's a lot of trees or greenery but other than that i like the camera performance here in low light two three missile pro photos are bright detailed and sharp which is very important low light shots and again i noticed that the over saturation is still here in a few shots with some greenery now i obviously compared the cameras of the redmi 7 pro to the poco x2 which has to be the best camera phone in this price range and the results were pretty interesting so in daytime i think the realme 7 pro and poco x 2 take very good shots and they're similar when it comes to details and dynamic range but they have their advantages and their issues so the realme 7 pro photos have better exposure and shadows as you can see but there's the over saturation problem i talked about earlier and the poco x2 photos have the more natural colors but sometimes it ups the contrast a bit too much which is not something i like so honestly it's a very close call in daytime in low light though i think the realme 7 pro is better i mean the only big issue is saturation at times but other than that the central photos are sharper and nicer looking for example take a look at this comparison shot see how the poco x2 has kind of made things fuzzy in the background now check out this one now i take it the poco x2 shot is slightly brighter all around but look at the lights and if you zoom in on the tree notice the difference in sharpness and in details see like i said both these phones have the problems but they also take good photos the poco x2 is slightly better in daytime and the real me 7 pro is better in low light well i've added all the high resolution photos in a drive link below so you can check it out if you want a better clarity of this comparison anyway as for the other lenses the redmi 7 pro's ultra wide angle lens is good enough i mean there's obviously lack of details when compared to the main sensor but it retains the colors so that's a good thing when it comes to videos there's 4k 30fps video support and here's a 4k video shot from the phone well as you can see the quality is pretty decent although like the photos the colors are a bit too saturated to make things look kind of attractive now apart from that there are some cool camera features on the video front that i've used in oppo phones in the past there's ultra night video mode ai color portrait and the other color filters like sky blue forest green etc which are all very cool and there's also portrait mode video aka bokeh video spot so these features are cool and something people will enjoy and i like the fact that some of them are available on the front camera too which by the way is a 32 megapixel sensor now and no there's no ultra wide angle lens like the 6 pro which is a little bummer because i kind of like that anyway so the selfie camera is good here the photos have a slightly warmer tone but with the beautification turned off the details are very good so i like it plus the front camera too gets features like portrait video and ai color portrait so that's good look overall the camera experience on the realme 7 pro is good with the photos and videos that it captures looking good but the only issue is the over saturation which kind of makes the photos and videos a little unnatural but like i said other than that it's pretty good now moving on to another upgrade and that's on the battery and charging front so there's a 4500 image battery compared to a 4300 image battery on the 6 pro so it's a minor upgrade but the battery performance has been decent i mean the phone lasted me for around a day and a little more on most times with an average screen on time of five and a half hours which is decent nothing extraordinary but yeah it's decent anyway the exciting upgrade here is the inclusion of a 65 watt super charger i mean this is crazy this kind of a flagship feature and you're getting it on a mid ranges so that's pretty exciting so this charger charges the phone to 50 in 13 minutes one three and it fully charges the phone from 10 to 100 percent in just 30 minutes yeah 3-0 it's crazy fast and i love this animation it just gives you an idea of how fast this is now along with all those great upgrades the internals of the real me seven pro remain the same as the six pro you get the same great snapdragon 720g chipset and i like the fact that the base storage version is 128 gb because you know the price is also higher anyway so we all know that the 720g is a solid performer and it's pretty solid on the redmi 7 pro for a phone at this price i'd call the real me 7 pro a fast smartphone because the phone has been almost lag free for me yep there was some stutter i had five percent battery but that's kind of expected otherwise the phone was always fast and snappy even while gaming i played asphalt 9 and pub cod mobile and i got high graphics and there wasn't any lag also after an hour of cod there was no heating or anything so the 720 g is pretty reliable on the 7 pro so it was overall a good experience but the only thing that kind of gave me mixed feelings is the real me ui i mean i like really uh it's got all the features and on the real me seven pro it only has really me apps and apps like amazon facebook and wps office pre-installed all of which can be uninstalled so it's good but there were a few annoyances so when i was first setting up this phone i obviously put all the apps that i used to install on the play store and after every installation i used to get this full page prompt and yeah some with ads and that's just super annoying i mean imagine getting these prompts 50 times while you're setting up your brand new smartphone yeah it can be crazy also i noticed a bug in the decent screen so see this you have the icons over the close all button i mean it's not a big issue but it's not nice either anyway other than that it was all fine and as for the ads i did not notice any except for in those prompts i mentioned see i'll tell you what i still have a positive feeling towards this phone but yeah these issues are something that we should fix with an update now when it comes to connectivity i tested this phone with an airtel sim a jio sim and a vodafone sim and there weren't any weird signal issues or connectivity issues or even volte issues so i think that's pretty much ordered so it's time for the conclusion the readme seven pro starts at rupees 19 triple nine in india and that's two thousand more than what the realme 6 pro cost right now so yeah it's obviously priced a little higher so the big question is should you pay more for the real me 7 pro should you buy this over say the poco x2 or the redmi note 9 pro max well technically when compared to say the poco x2 you're paying 1500 extra because the realme 7 pro's base variant has 128 gb storage now i personally think that paying 1500 extra for the real me 7 pro makes sense i know this is not a perfect phone the cameras though good have the over saturation issue they're also the bugs and real me ui issues i talked about and yes the back is plastic but you know what for the extra price of getting three big features the amoled display the stereo speakers and the crazy fast 65 watt charging these are the features that make me like the real me 7 pro even with its problems so the verdict is if you want these big features i'd recommend you to go ahead and just get the real me 7 pro well that was my review of the real me 7 pro and i'd love to know your thoughts on the same so comment down below
