[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys dissipation vo calm and today I'm gonna talk about the best Android phone deal available in India right now now generally we used to see in Samsung phones with kind of okay specs in the 20 to 30 thousand price segment but recently I was going through the flip cards big savings days seeing deals and that's when I came across the galaxy a8 II now in the galaxy 18 launched in India last year this is what we tweeted yes the galaxy a8 II launched at the peace 47 990 last year in India and well that was a pretty outrageous price tag and right now it's available for a peace 40 mm which again is a pretty insane price for a phone that's not a flagship but a good high-end smartphone having said that during the big savings days saying the galaxy a8 II will be available what kind of great price of 21 triple nine yeah 20 mm for the galaxy a8 II and that kind of makes the galaxy eighty one of the most value for money samsung smartphones out there now why do I say that it's the best Android phone deal available right now well just look at the specs of the galaxy 80 so with the galaxy 80 you get a truly bezel is 6 point 7 inch full HD plus Super AMOLED infinity display yeah that's a long Monica for display but this is an infinity display no oh no you a true infinity display with no not no punch or nothin it just looks stunning the phone is powered by the Snapdragon 730 chipset which is one of the more powerful mid-range chipsets out there I mean it's hard to get an on eggs in or Samsung phone in India and the Galaxy 80 is one of the exceptions there's also 8 gigs of RAM and 128 GB of non-expandable ufs storage yeah these are great specs the cameras are also the highlight of the galaxy a8 II there are three cameras of 48 megapixel primary camera and 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens and a time of flight center now the specs seem good but what makes it truly awesome is this yet the galaxy 8 it comes with rotating cameras and this looks super cool and I know there are concerns about moving parts not being very durable but I guess that's a risk you have to take and honestly this looks too good to not take the risk anyway the retaining resolved pretty useful I mean thanks to this you can use the main cameras as the selfie cameras which means super needy insane please Kate ultra wide-angle selfies how awesome is that and I know this reminds me of the age of 60 but yeah this is super cool on the battery from the galaxy 80 comes to the modest 3700 mAh battery but it has a super fast 25 watt charger in the box when it comes to the software the phone was recently updated to Android 10 with 1 UI - so it's got the latest soccer on board now all these features are packed in a typical premium design but Samson the phone has a glass back it's a gorilla glass 6 back and it looks great if I were you I'd go with the white because black is a huge fingerprint magnet anyway the phone has a single speaker a USB C port but there's no headphone jack and no microSD slot no the galaxy 80 makes some compromises here and there but overall at to a 2k it seems like a great deal but let me just compare it to the Galaxy 831 which is also priced the same at 22 hours on the piece and the poco x2 which is priceless but it's very popular let's compare it okay so when compared the galaxy 80 first of all I think looks the more premium of 3 then there's the fact of the AAT has a bezel less Super AMOLED which I will take over the amulet in the galaxy 8:31 and the 120 Hertz IPS LCD on the poker X to the eye amulet is personally my choice under the hood the galaxy a8 he has a Snapdragon 730 while the poco x2 has the 730 G not a big difference to be honest the 800 the media take Helio p65 chipset which isn't as powerful as the 7:30 or 7:30 G the AAT NX 2 also have the more powerful UEFA storage when comes the cameras d poco X 2 and the galaxy der you won't come with additional macro lenses but do we really care about macro lenses anyway as for the primary camera the poco x2 has a 64 megapixel primary camera and having used it it's great now I haven't compared the cameras of the 80 versus the poco x2 but when the galaxy 80 launched it was launched as kind of a high-end flagship II phone and generally Samsung's cameras are pretty good so I think diety should be pretty good when it comes with a battery the galaxy a default shot but it's got pretty good fast charging so there's that so all in all I am definitely picking the Galaxy AAT over the galaxy 31 or basically any other Samsung phone in this price segment at 22,000 it's basically a steep now compared to the poco x2 I think the galaxy a8 it kind of holds its own and also brings a few advantages which is definitely nice I mean at this price you don't really get a Samsung phone or basically any other phone with a Super AMOLED display that's truly bezel s a premium design and good specs all wrong plus it has the unique rotating cameras which definitely make the phone stand out yes the phone is not perfect I mean it's quite hefty at 220 grams it does not have the headphone jack no micro SD slot and the rotating camera module means that you'll have to be a little more careful with the device but if you can look past all of these at 20 mm I think it's a great deal and quite possibly the best Android phone deal available right now but the galaxy a8 II deal will go live on Flipkart tomorrow and there are some other deals that I came across and those aren't as impressive as the Galaxy AAT deal but I think you should know let me just share them with you okay so there's reading the X 2 probe which will be available for peace 25 triple 9 and there's a red mckay 20 probe which will be available for 23 $4.99 so yeah check this out if you're interested anyway let us know if you know of any other deals that you came across and just comment down below so that everyone can know also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to shake the friends subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos well that's me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one [Music] you
