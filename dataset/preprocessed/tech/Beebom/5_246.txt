[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is the page from v1.com and oneplus recently unveiled its brand new oxygen os 11 update and this is an update that has divided people on the internet some people are okay with it but mostly people don't like it because with this update oneplus is kind of moving away from stock android well i have the update installed on the oneplus 8 pro as well as the oneplus 8 and you know what there are two big aspects to this update the visual changes and the features talking about the visual changes first the moment i installed the beta on the oneplus 8 pro i could see the new ui all across b the setup page the apps or the settings see i've been a long time oxygen os user in fact the moment i'm not reviewing a phone i go to the oneplus 8 as my daily driver and the biggest reason for that is the software look if you ask me it's just the best android experience out there but oxygen os 11 well it changes that yes the new oxygen os update is a major revamp and it looks very very different from stock android let me show you so here's the oneplus 8 running oxygen os 11 preview next to another oneplus 8 running oxygen os 10 stable and i'll show you a lot of the changes to be honest some of the things i like some of the things i don't so the big theme of this new ui is the big and bold text all around it works in places like the lock screen where the bigger day text looks cool but everywhere else it kind of reminds me of one ui and also windows phone but look at the settings page as you can see it has the same collapsible ui aimed at one-handed usage and it's not just the settings the one ui like style has been implemented all across be the stock apps like the phone app the gallery app the clock app the messages app and more even the quick settings has a new ui with the collapsible headers and a new red black accent by default which i'm not a big fan of but hey you can obviously change that anyway in my time with the update every time i used the phone it felt like i was using a hybrid of oxygen os and one ui and i'm not sure i like it i mean personally i like one ui on samsung phones but that's because it's very unified there oxygen os on the other hand seems like it's confused whether it wants to be like one ui or not i know it's still a beta so this time to improve but right now things aren't consistent for example the phone app has these tab styles while the new gallery app has a totally different ui for tabs plus the whole one ui like interface isn't implemented everywhere for example you can see it in the main settings page right but not in any of the sub menus it's kind of weird now if you ask me i get it why people are so divided over this new ui and oxygen os i mean this is clearly moving away from stock android i mean i'll be honest this new ui isn't bad for example some apps look great with this new ui like say the new weather app here it is next to the old weather app and the new one clearly looks more modern so it's not bad but you know what the new ui under everything that's appealing about oxygen os at least for me anyway apart from the new one ui inspired interface the oxygen os 11 update also brings a new oneplus sands point replacing the oneplus slate phone there's also a new live wallpaper which changes according to the time of the day so that's cool too another thing i noticed is that you no longer have the option to use shelf as the leftmost screen however you can enable it to access wires swipe down on the home screen now moving on to the features that the oxygen os 11 update brings now unlike the visual changes that have me confused about oxygen os in general the new feature editions are definitely good first off always on displays here so in the display settings i can set the ambient display option to always on now the different clock styles in the customization page and most of these were already present but there's this new default clock style which is okay but the interesting new one is the new inside clock style see this is pretty cool see this is divided into two bars with the clock in between the bar on the top is interesting the gaps there show the times i've unlocked the phone and used it the bar below the clock is the time bar so the clock's color and position changes according to the day of the time so it'll change from morning to night so this always on display is kind of a mix of aod and digital well-being so i like it next up dark mode on the new oxygen os update is improved to this finally a quick settings toggle which i can use to quickly turn on or off the dark mode in the display settings there's also an option to schedule the dark mode which is something i've always wanted on oneplus phones this is great but i don't like the fact that the new oxygen os 11 ui uses a lot of dark gray instead of black this is a dark mode on oxygen os 11 and oxygen os 10 side by side and you can see how this dark gray instead of true black in the quick settings panel and even in the settings page there's a lot of grey which i hope oneplus fixes in the upcoming betas now these are features that i've seen people talk about online but there are a couple of new additions in the camera app as well now i'm not sure if these are from previous betas but these are definitely not in the stable version so they're kind of new okay so i'm talking about the new modes in the video mode of the camera as you can see on the top there are some new options there's now a portrait video option and a new nightscape option too there's also a new gesture in the camera app you can just press hold on the last photo taken like this and share it quickly this should be useful lastly on the new features front is the new zen mode this is the new zen mode next to the old one and it does look cooler because of the new themes based on ocean space and nature there are some more durations to choose from you can choose from one minute to 120 minutes so you have the options apart from that there is also a new room speech you can create a room where you and say your family or friends can all join in at the same time and make sure that none of you are using your phones well those are the new features and changes in the new oxygen os 11 preview and if you ask me my opinion about this update i'd say i have mixed feelings mixed feelings because i like the new features here because these are features that we have been waiting on for quite some time now and yeah these are good but on the other hand the ui is something that i don't like much i mean it's not bad but personally i kind of associate oxygen os to bring a stock android look and feel see i don't really understand why oneplus needed to change the ui so much nobody was complaining about oxygen os people are buying oneplus phones like the oneplus not because of oxygen os so i don't see the point of this big overhaul that oxygen os 11 brings this honestly makes me kind of skeptical about the future of oneplus phones well at the end of the day it's still a beta and it might get better as we go along but if this is what oxygen os is going to look like what's your opinion on the
