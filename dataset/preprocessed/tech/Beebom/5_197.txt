[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is the page from b1.com and asus has just launched its new zenbook in india this is the new zenbook 14 ux435eg and this is the laptop brings the latest specs like the new intel 11 engine processors and there's some cool features like the super cool touchpad which is actually a secondary display i'll get to that but the big question is is this laptop for you first up let me make it clear that the zenbook 14 is aimed at professional uses so what do professional users actually want in their laptops see i think the most important factor is good and consistent performance for at least a couple of years second i think these users want a good portable laptop that's sleek and lightweight and has a good screen good battery life and third is features i mean special unique features aimed at productivity is something that all professional users like so that's something that matters as well so how does the new zen book 14 do on all of these fronts to talk about the first factor i think the zenpo 14 is a laptop that can be considered for long term consistent performance i mean i've only used this laptop for a couple of days and so far it has handled a number of chrome tabs easily and even apps like photoshop with a lot of these so it's promising the specs are also the latest the zenbook 14 is part of the latest 11g chipsets and it's available in both core i5 and core i7 variants with nvidia's mx 450 dedicated graphics our variant features the 11th gen intel core i7 chipset with mx 450 graphics 16 gb lpddr4x ram and 1tb of fast pcie gen 3 ssd so the specs are pretty good now the fact that these laptops have the latest 11 gen intel processor means better clock speeds performance improvements especially single thread performance and gpu improvements as for the graphics like i said we have the mx 450 variant and that means performance somewhere close to the 1050 ti now even professional users like to play some casual games on the laptop and this gpu is decent enough for titles like cs go so yeah that's good as for the thermal performance i did not notice the new zenbook 14 getting too worked up even if i had multiple chrome tabs open or when i was playing some casual games and yeah i did notice that the laptop got a little heated up here but i wouldn't call it overheating or anything crazy so i think that's fine as for the fans even at the max speed they weren't too loud i mean there is a new built-in 87 blade fan that said to take in more air and dissipate more heat and i think it forms pretty well so the performance of this ultra portable laptop seems good so far so that's promising and that's one important thing sorted but i think this is a laptop that's pretty sorted on all those other factors too that i talked about at the start see i'll be honest with you when it comes to the look and feel the new zenbook 40 looks a lot like the zenbook 14 ux45 that launched earlier this year you still get the same aluminum alloy body all around which by the way has a coating that makes sure it's not super cool to touch especially this winter season and there's also the concentric circle design and you know what these are not bad things because it's a premium design it's t d a 10 h military certified and in typical zenbook style and very importantly it is very thin and very lightweight at 16.9 millimeters thickness and 1.19 kg weight now this is an incredibly portable laptop it's fantastic and even with its sleek design it has all the important ports on the left there are two fast thunderbolt 4 usb c ports a full hdmi port and on the right you get the headphone jack the micro sd card reader and a usb a port so yeah the ports are pretty well sorted when it comes to the display it's a 14 inch ips lcd full hd matte display with 100 as rgb gamut touch support and very narrow bezels all around that make up for a 92 screen to body ratio and a very modern look now i know for professional users the display quality is something that matters a lot and so far i think this is a display that's pretty good see i think the display is vibrant and brightness is in point the viewing angles are pretty good and even though this is not oled it's ips lcd i noticed the blacks to be fairly deep so that's nice also like i mentioned it's a touch screen display and in my brief time using the laptop why the touchscreen i found it to be fairly responsive now the bases are on the display might be narrow but the top bezel does manage to include the webcam as well as the ir sensor for windows hello so here's the webcam in action and i found the webcam quality to be decentish as for the ir sensor it works very very well i was able to unlock the laptop using windows hello anytime with a lot of these even in the dark and it's very consistent and fast as for the speakers there are harman kardon certified speakers at the bottom and while they aren't the loudest especially because they are you know bottom facing i found the sound quality to have good depth and clarity so that's good coming to this keyboard this is the backlit keyboard that you get and the keys here have a travel of 1.4 millimeters and i like the timing experience it offers see at the start i did feel that the keys were a bit mushy but after a little time i got used to it just fine now as for the layout it's pretty straight forward but you do get these extra hotkeys to disable the camera take a screenshot or launch the my asus app which by the way remains feature-packed nice it brings you customer support system diagnosis software updates linked to my asus app hardware settings like battery health fan profiles display profiles and more when it comes to the battery there's a 63 wattage battery that's said to last up to 12 hours which is very good considering the specs of the laptop now i haven't used this laptop extensively but in my usage the battery did last long so i am positive about this the charger that you get with the laptop is a 65w usb c pd charger and yeah you can use other pd chargers to charge this laptop so all in all almost all of the important things about the zenbook 14 are right on money but there's also the factor of features now i mentioned the screen pad at the start and that's like the ultimate productivity feature of this nb40 so this is the trackpad actually aka screen pad 2.0 and it's actually a full-fledged 5.6 inch ips lcd with fhd plus resolution and this can work as a secondary display to make things more productive for users so you know what you can launch apps here and use it alongside the app on the main screen for example i can write something on the main screen while opening up a reference website on the screen you can move any app from the main screen to this like this and vice versa there's also a very cool task group feature which launches multiple apps at once i've set a task group of chrome music and notepad and i can just tap this to open the three altogether chrome notepad in the main screen and the music app on the secondary display see there are a lot of ways you can use this screen pad to multitask and work better so i think it does add to the overall work experience overall that's all about the new zenbook 14 and at the time of shooting this video i don't know the price of this laptop but if you ask me my opinion about this i think this is another very good zen book for anyone looking for a feature packed professional laptop i mean yes i've only used this new zen book 14 for a couple of days but so far it seems to get most things right i like the sleek design with all the ports and functionality the performance the battery the display and the very cool screen pad 2.0 makes the zendoo 14 different from the competition so the new zenfone 14 brings a kind of a very good overall experience but i'd love to know what you guys think so make sure to comment down below and yeah give this
