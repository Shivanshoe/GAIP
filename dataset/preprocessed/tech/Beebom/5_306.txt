[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient bibim calm and Android 11 is here well sort of I mean this is the first Developer Preview of Android 11 and while it's so very early release we have it installed on a pixel 4 so let's talk about the most exciting features of Android 11 and yeah do note that I'll be talking about a lot of other minor changes at the end of this video so make sure to watch till the very end now let's talk Android 11 every other update brings changes to the notification shade and the settings page and while there's no change on the settings page front hey there are changes on the notification shade front so let's check it out so first up there is a dedicated conversation section so when you get a text or an email these notifications will be grouped under this conversations section in the notification shape and I think you'll look modify another feature in the notification shade that I like is the ability to paste images in replies in the notification shade now I couldn't get it to work on the pixel 4 but it sounds interesting bubbles the Facebook child has like feature that we came across in an early Android 10 beta is again here on Android 11 so like I said this is a lot like Facebook Messenger chat heads so basically with bubbles you will be able to get chat head support in apps like Google messages or basically any other messaging app that chooses to support this right now you can just go to an app's notification settings and enable the bubbles option after which the apps notification will show up in a chat head like this obviously bubble support is available in the Google messages app and as you can see I can just use this bubble to text akshay anyway I'm hoping apps like walks I have telegram and third-party SMS apps support this feature with Android 11 goes out later this year and return brought more control wind comes to location permissions and Android 11 is making things more stricter so when an app prompts for the location permission an android 11 you get these three options only this time while using the app and deny yeah there's no allow all the time option apparently apps that need access to location in the background will have to get google's approval to get on the Play Store anyway not just the location permission there's more controller in comes to other permissions to with a hundred eleven you will be able to give apps temporary permission to your camera and microphone which I think is the right way forward also Android 11 will block apps will repeatedly asking the same permissions again and again if you deny it twice or more yeah that's super handy Android QB two last year had a pretty early version of a screen recorder but it was grabbed with the fienl Anderton release now Android 11 preview brings a new screen recorder and well this seems to be the real deal so there's a toggle to enable screen recorder in the quick settings page and once you tap it you get this prompt asking you if you want to start recording well I can press start now and after 3 seconds it will start recording the screen as you can see when the screen recorder is running there's this chromecast like icon on the status bar and there's a notification that lets you stop pause or cancel the screen record there is no option to record internal audio or show tabs or anything basically but I think we'll see that in a future release do not disturb is also getting improved with Android 11 now the Android 11 preview brings a new reorganized DND page so here's the DND page in android 11 next to the DND page in android 10 now the key change here is how exceptions are categorized unlike i under 10 android 11 divides exceptions in people apps and alerts and other interruptions now all of these different options have more sub options so in people you can allow calls from anyone to just start contacts you can add apps to exceptions in DND and you can enable alarms reminders and other sounds under other interruptions well all in all this new organized DND page does seem more clean and nice we have been waiting for this every single Android screen has this and when it's finally here Auto dock mode yes honored 11 finally lets you schedule the dark mode as you can see in the Android levels dark theme settings you can now schedule the dark mode to automatically turn on at sunset and turn off at sunrise there's even the option to set custom timings for this so yeah you no longer need a third party after scheduled dark mode or stock Android now apart from these hundred eleven features there are a lot of other minor changes here and there the option to pin apps to the top in the share sheet is back again thankfully I don't have an also mute notifications when you're recording a video which i think is a great addition and there's an option in the developer options page to show the screen refresh rate all the time you're turning it on shows the refresh rate of the pixel 4h fluctuates between 60 and 90 and as you can see there are color changes as well I know it's kind of like fraps but it's green refresher and not exactly frame rate lots of new notification history page now which is separate from the notification log and I think this will come in pretty handy you can access it through the activity launcher right now but I hope it makes it to those stable leaves moving on the folks at XD have also found trace that scrolling screenshots are finally coming to an 11 and the fact that Android 11 will implement the music player in quick settings like iOS Control Center apart from that this project main line supports other parts of Android can be updated individually better support for curved and waterfall displays displays with punch holes and foldables and a lot of other under-the-hood changes for better 5g support and some pixel for exclusive features well as of now 111 does not bring any major visual change but we'll see how it goes as more pitas arrive anyway if you want to know every single feature that Android 11 brings and if you want to know how to install the Android 11 update on a pixel device check out articles from the
