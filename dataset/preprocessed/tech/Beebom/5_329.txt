hey guys this is a zombie on comm and VR here in Las Vegas for CES 2020 and oneplus has just unveiled its first concept smartphone the oneplus concept 1 and when there's a lot of hype and curiosity around it so what's it all about well we went hands-on with it so let's check it out okay so this is it this is the new one plus concept one and everything concept II about this one is here on this back as you can see clearly this is another 1/2 spoon that's being created in partnership with McLaren the concept 1 obviously has the orange papaya leather stitched on the back in typical racetrack style and I think it looks great but the highlight here is the new glass the 1 press concept one features an electrochromic glass which makes the cameras on the spoon invisible when you're not using them yeah it's pretty simple it's all black seamless flush on the back and cool looking when you're not using them but the moment you open up the camera app boom the cameras on the back become visible it's all super cool the feature has been inspired by the sunroof in high-end McLaren cars like the McLaren 720's which have the same electrochromic glass that can go from transparent to translucent width is so here's the concept one's invisible cameras coming alive in beautiful slow-motion well that was pretty cool and that was slo-mo but and realized the cameras become visible fairly instantly as you can see here one per se as it takes 0.7 seconds to go from dark to visible and I'd say yeah that's pretty much about right it's fairly fast so the question is how does this technology work well like I said the one plus concept one features an electro comic bag and this solution features two layers of glass with the electrochromic material in between there's also indium tin oxide on both the glass panels to make them conductive now since the glass is conductive now it can use the current from the phone to change the tint on the glass or it can make things darker or lighter depending on when you using the camera so you must be thinking what about the power consumption that must be hired right well according to what plus the battery consumption isn't all that different they said that the cause everyone has the SATs in battery life as the oneplus 70 pro the phone the concept phone is based on so yeah that's pretty good also if you're wondering about the durability it should not be a problem because on the top is the same gorilla glass with the electrochromic layer below it so yeah that's also fine anyway as you must have noticed the electrochromic glass is hiding the three cameras as well as the LED flash so what happens when you just use the torch aka the flashlight feature well here's me doing exactly that and as you can see the cameras are still hidden but the LED flash is in action and it's visible and when I turn off the torch the LED flash just goes back to hiding pretty awesome huh plus one plus has added a new camera feature that uses this electrochromic glass in the pro mode of the camera you can see this new nd eight option which means you can enable it to take long exposure shots or darken shots in times then you need to balance the exposure yeah this feature might come in handy for a lot of people so why is the one press concept one a concept phone I mean everything seems to work just fine so wide of concept tag well oneplus has a very simple answer for this c1 plus is it wants to test out these invisible cameras more extensively to see how they perform in long term usage if they're reliable enough plus their factors like cost and production so it'll be some time before we actually see these invisible cameras in a proper 1/2 tspoon we can buy however I'm still betting on the oneplus 80 to feature this what do you think about the same tell us in the comments anyway so coming back to the oneplus concept 1 is there anything else special about this concept phone well the rest of the oneplus concept phone is just the 1 plus 70 Pro McLaren Edition the processor that curved display the battery everything remains exactly the same here is the 1 / 70 pro and the oneplus concept one side by side and you know what the concept one just looks better yeah it's just a bag that is changed but it looks a lot better on in all the one first concept one's invisible cameras aren't really a game-changer I mean this new tech does not really solve a problem or anything but boy do they look cool the invisible cameras tech just makes up for a beautiful and seamless looking phone with knowingly camera bombs or cutouts and I like it not only if you want I say it comes in wireless charging that'd be great anyway what do you think of the WordPress concept what do you want this take in your future smartphones tell us in the comment
