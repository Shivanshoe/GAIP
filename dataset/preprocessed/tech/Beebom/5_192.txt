hey guys this is the page from b1.com and media tech has been kind of on a roll lately i mean the company beat qualcomm to become the world's largest smartphone chipset vendor in q3 2020 and recently announced the smartphones packing their latest domain city 800u and diminci3000 plus chipsets are coming to india very soon so yeah like i said on a roll now the divincity thousand plus seems pretty exciting to me because it's set to bring in powerful specs plus some cool new tech now here are a few questions that i'm gonna answer for you guys so what's new in the media tech diamond city thousand plus how is it different from the mediatek diminished 3000 well let me tell you well first off let's take a look at the specs so the mediatek diamond city 1000 plus is a 7 nanometer chipset with an 8 core cpu it features four powerful arm cortex a77 cores with a clock speed of up to 2.6 gigahertz and for efficiency arm cortex a55 cores that can go up to 2 gigahertz other than that there's the arm mali's d77 gpu the new mediatek apu 3.0 ai engine with 4.5 tops performance support for lpddr4x ram and ufs 2.2 fast storage so the specs seem pretty good because the cortex a7 is arms flagship cpu from 2019 and this is the same cpu that was used in the prime core of the snapdragon 865 so yes i'm positive about the performance but i would have loved to check out a device with the chipset or you know get the benchmark scores but if the dimension 3000 is any indication the performance should be pretty good i mean here are the benchmark scores of the demand city thousand and yeah these scores look good plus there's the mediatek's hyper engine 2.0 gaming tech that's at reduced latency improve frame rates and also make the network more stable for a consistent and smooth gaming experience well i guess i'll have to check out the impact of the hyper engine 2.0 when i get a device with the mediatek dimension 3000 plus so yeah stay tuned for that moving on when it comes to display support this is one of the areas where the dimension 3000 plus trumps the dimension 3000 so the thousand plus supports 90 hertz qhd displays 120 hertz fhd displays and 144 hertz full hd plus displays which isn't something that a thousand supported so yeah that's an upgrade plus there's the media vision hdr video playback feature on board which uses ai to enhance sharpness and colors convert hdr to hdr content while also bringing hdr 10 plus video playback support and av1 decoding with hardware acceleration now coming to camera features which is generally an area of interest for me when it comes to new chipsets so the device 3000 plus has support for 4k hdr multi-exposure video recording which basically means it captures different exposures for every single frame in a video resulting in better overall video quality there's also night ready video capture which makes your video shot in low light are crisp and detailed and as for the isp it's the same as the dimension a five core isp that can support sensors up to 18 megapixels or combinations such as 32 megapixels plus 16 megapixels and more apart from that 5g is obviously kind of the big highlight feature of the dimension 3000 plus so there's an integrated 5g modem in 1000 plus and i like that dual sim 5g with dual standby and dual vo nr is supported which means you'll be able to use two 5g sim cards simultaneously on your phone sometime in the future now that should mean more battery drain right but there's the mediatek 5g ultra safe tech which has two modes a low bandwidth mode and a high bandwidth mode and the chipset dynamically switches between them depending on the app you're using thus conserving battery life anyway other connectivity features include wi-fi 6 and bluetooth 5.1 plus support so it's clear that the dimension 3000 plus has got the latest standards well those are all the details on the mediatek divinity thousand plus and from the looks of it it seems like a very capable processor be it in terms of performance camera features or connectivity i mean qualcomm was kind of becoming the monopoly when it comes to smartphone chipsets and mediatek has bounced back and it's great for us i mean i think it all started with the mediatek g90t which is still date a very popular chipset and now with these new demand city chipsets it's clear that mediatek is serious about things anyway if you ask me i can't wait to actually use the phone featuring the new dimension chipsets to get a better idea compare the performance to snapdragon chipsets and i don't think i'll have to wait long because mediatek has confirmed that the oppo reno5 pro will be the first phone with the diamond city thousand plus chipset in india and well that actually makes the phone more exciting anyway what do you guys
