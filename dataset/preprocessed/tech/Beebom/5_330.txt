the Galaxy S 11 know the 1+8 know the iPhone 12 nah pixel 5 definitely not now these are the most anticipated phones of 2020 this is this is the most awaited phone of 2020 [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient be wongkom and there are a lot of foods that I'm excited about in 2020 there's obviously the flagship from Samsung oneplus Apple Xiaomi and they're obviously interesting phones like the galaxy full to surface duo and a lot more however as you must have guessed the most anticipated for of 2020 is not one of these it's a different phone altogether let me give you two hints in one this is a phone that we have been waiting for since quite a long time say more than a yes it into this phone is the successor to the most popular phone of 2018 yeah just comment on your suggestions and see if you get it correct now I'm sure a lot of you must have guessed it the phone I'm talking about is the poco f2 yeah poco f2 is most definitely the most anticipated phone of 2020 I mean think about it the poco f2 is P phone we talked about in all of 2019 every other week that'd be news rumors speculations leaks and all the Pope who have to birth yeah the Pope wave too did not arrive at their a 90 now we kind of knew it and we kind of expected it if you saw a video but now we have good reason to believe that the Pope wave 2 is coming in 2020 finally now the good reason our tweet this is a not deleted tweet from pocos global head and in say in response to a user asking when is the pro choir to coming now obviously they are not details and the tree just says you will hear a lot more from poco in 2020 however this I think is also the first time since quite a while at a poke or charm official has mentioned the poco brand and now that the tweet has been deleted this makes me think that the Pope who have to is definitely coming in 2020 I mean there's never any smoke without a fire right so the Pope I have to is coming and I really hope it does it has to be the most awaited phone of 2020 and it's been one and a half years since the first book of the program I am hoping that the poco f2 will be a big big upgrade and update that even the poco f1 users can go for so what should the poco f to cover it well first of all it should fix all the issues from the Popo everyone liked the design the pokhara phone as you can see hasn't aged very well when it comes to design here's the phone still very solid but premium not really so a more premium industrial design and finish is something that the pork or f1 success that needs along with maybe wireless charging or an IP rating I mean it is 2020 so it should be a big upgrade second the display see the program phone display is pretty good but it is IPS LCD and look at that notch and those bezels yeah in 2020 these are not going to cut it so in poco f2 I'm hoping we get AMOLED with a punch hole design since punch hole amulets are kind of going to be the norm into a training on the camera from the poke we have to shoot come with multiple cameras including an ultra wide-angle lens so how about the multiple-camera setup of the mean no dead I mean that's a phone that has got cameras for every single situation out there a 50x zoom in ultra tiny for the sensor 12 megapixel daily for the sensor which also asks for the portrait mode and insane hundred eight megapixel sensor at 20 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens and a 2 megapixel macro lens yep everything perfect for the program to moving order things under the hood there's another speculation around at the poke or f2 might come with the snapdragon 765 chipset which is a decently powerful chipset but you know what if you ask me I think a body poco f1 success I should come with the best there is the snapdragon 865 chipset I mean yeah the 5g modem might make things expensive but you know what I'm okay with poco after getting a little expensive as long as it packs in the flagship chipset apart from that a slightly bigger battery and recently fast charging along with me UI for poco with no ads whatsoever should be just fine for me so poker have to it all of these features should be pretty awesome right but you know what all of this right now is just wishful thinking pure wishful thinking there's no confirmation from Xiaomi there's no launch date no specs no numers and yeah like I said nobody at Chaminade poco has confirmed at the poco f2 is definitely coming in to a draining having said that I really really hope that the poco f2 arrives in India in 2020 and if you want the same just go ahead and tag pocos global head and polkas head in India with this video to make sure that they know how excitedly all of the Popo f2 in 2020 because until it launches the Popo f2 is going to be the most anticipated phone of this here so what are you waiting for
