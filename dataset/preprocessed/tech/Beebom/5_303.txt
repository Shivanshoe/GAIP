[Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a patient B boom calm and this right here is the brand new i koude 3i q I go up I think it's IQ tree and but this is the first smartphone from the Aiko brand in India and well there's a lot of hype around it so what are you waiting for let's check out the brand new IQ 3 okay so we have two variants of the IQ 3 this kind of usual looking tornado black radiant and this very different and I think very weird looking volcano orange waiting to be honest I like the touch and feel of this orange variant as it has this rubble matte finish but yeah the color the paint splash pattern I don't find it a people and even the black gradient is less wild and I think this pattern looks kind of nice of premium this is a good your glass 6 back and as you can see you get the IQ branding the rectangular camera module and that's pretty much it on the front you get the six point four four inch Super AMOLED display with a very small punch hole on the top right now I would have liked a higher refresh rate display because the competing phones like the 1 / 70 and the 850 Pro have it but there are two interesting things about this AMOLED display first is the fact that it has 180 Hertz super touch response rate which means this display should respond to touch faster resulting in low latency which should make a nice difference specially while gaming now I did notice the overall gimme performance to be really smooth with the screen responding nicely but I'm not sure if it's the usual high-end performance or something to do with this high touch response rate anyway second is the fact that this display goes as bright as 1200 nits which is really bright I mean I took the phone outdoors and well I could see the display just fine so it's very bright the front also has the indiscreet fingerprint scanner which IQ says is very fast and well it indeed is it's just super snappy as you can see they space a lot too if you want to use that and even face unlock is crazy fast just look at this one look and it instantly unlocks oh yeah this is nice when comes with the buttons and posts the IQ 3 is a game eccentric smartphone so along with the usual buttons you get these two pressure-sensitive touch buttons on the top and bottom of the right side now I could cause these the monster touch buttons and well you can't program these buttons and games like pubsey mobile to shoot or score you get the idea now we did play some games with these buttons and while it takes time getting used to it's kind of fun and I also like the haptic feedback off as well gaming now apart from these buttons the left side also has the AI assistant button which you can use to activate Google assistant quickie then there's the headphone jack on the table the USB C port the single speaker and the dual SIM slot on the bottom if you're wondering the IQ tree does not have an IP rating or wireless charging or stereo speakers now the design of the IQ tree isn't exactly mind-blowing yes the touch buttons are nice and the AI but is also good but apart from that it's kind of usual now what makes this full truly exciting is what's under the hood the ico tree is part with the latest and greatest snapdragon 865 chipset with the new Adreno 650 GP up to 12 GB lpddr4 gram and up to 256 GB of ufs 3.1 storage now the specs seem really good and let's check out the benchmark scores well here the add to the scores next to the real me X 50 probe which has similar specs + 1 / 70 which has 855 + as if you see the IQ 3 easily beats the 70 quite expectedly and it's quite close to the X 50 Pro here's the gig bin score now and when the 865 is obviously a powerful powerful chipset so please cores are no surprise now due noted the IQ 3 is available in two variants in India a 4G version and a 5g version now both of these phones have the same exact specs the same snapdragon 865 processor but yeah this is a good move by - giving the choice to the consumers so like I said in a real make 50 pro video 5g is kind of irrelevant in India and if you think the same there's the 4G version for you and if you think you want a smartphone with which is future proof then there's the file diversion for you so yeah you have the choice no you're talking about the real world performance I've only used the IQ 3 briefly but so far so good I mean I've had a few pub Gmail sessions on the phone and every single time the performance was smooth and lag free look to be honest I don't really have doubts around the IQ trees performance since it packs the flagship process of 20/20 but what I do have my doubts on is iku UI so the iku 3 turns on i 2uy 1.0 based on android 10 and it's a feature patch skin for example there's the monster mode a key the high performance mode which when turned on brings a new gaming centric theme for the phone looks really cool there's the ultra game mode which brings our ton of features to enhance your gaming experience like the ability to map the touch buttons it has the frame rate for the game or vibration and more the different customization options - like the different phase lock effects or fingerprint scan effects so yeah it's a feature pack skin but it has its problems first up IT UI has these lockscreen ads that I just hate especially since this is a premium smartphone secondly the bloatware just look at this let's hello daily hon WP soft face opera and not more and also these weird hot apps and hot games recommendation folders and yeah it's annoying yeah you can understand a few of these apps but this is not the experience you want on a high-end phone anyway moving on the ICO 3 isn't really a camera centric smartphone but you get a capable quad camera cell there's a forty eight megapixel main camera at 13 megapixels telephoto lens capable or 20x zoom a 13 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens and a 2 megapixel depth sensor well I have taken a few shots with the ICO 3 so check them out now I wasn't expecting a lot in the ICO 3 cameras but you know what these photos look pretty good I mean this is obviously not flagship great camera performance but it's fairly good in good lighting in low-light things don't seem as good but yeah it's still pretty early days I also took some ultra wide-angle shots and while these photos look cool thanks to the 120 degree wide field of view I'm yet to truly test things out there's also the portrait mode which doesn't seem very impressive so far check out these photos on the video front there's 4k 60fps video support and there's a is with a super anti shake mode for super stable videos now I did capture a video from the phone and while it's decent as you can see I did notice that the food has a lot of problems focusing I mean autofocus is just crazy finicky on the IQ 3 and hopefully I could we'll fix this with an update when it comes to selfies the I country comes with a 16 megapixel selfie camera with the usual features like they ported more night more and more and well here are few selfies from the phone and I'd say they're decent ish if you ask me so far the cameras on iq3 seem fine although I do have my doubts around it so yeah I'll be taking a lot more photos with lastly there's a battery the IQ 3 comes in 4440 mAh battery with an insane 55 watts super flash charger yeah we saw the 65 watt charger from real me yesterday and today take look at this 55 watt charger now I haven't got to truly test in the 55 watt charger but I did know this ones that it takes the phone from 10 to 50 percent in just around 14 minutes which is just really good so concluding things in my time with the IQ 3 so far it's clear that this is a power-packed smartphone mostly aimed at gamers and power users I mean there's a flagship chip said the latest RAM and storage standards features like the pressure sensitive buttons the high touch response rate display and the big battery with superfast charging so yes this is a power packed phone but I'm not sure if it's an all-around great option I have my doubts firstly I'm just not sold on iku uy with all the issues I talked about second I have my doubts on the camera plus a lot depends on the price which I don't know at the time of shooting this video so yeah I will reserve my verdict on the I could see for our full review so stay tuned but those are my first impressions on the ICO 3 but what do you think tell us your thoughts in the comments down below and if you have any questions of the IQ 3 just drop it down below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos but that's me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one [Music] you
