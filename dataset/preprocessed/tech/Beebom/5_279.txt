[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys dissipation be boom calm and Samson has just announced its brand new Galaxy 800 do you want smartphone and as you can see here it's right here with us so what are you waiting for let's unbox the galaxy a31 and see what's new in the latest a3 smartphone let's unbox it so in the box you get this transparent silicon case these earphones the USBC cable a 15 watt fast charger and of course this the galaxy a 31 this is Samsung's new a series phone and design build wise it's not a whole lot different than other a series smartphones it has the same plastic finish which is basically plastic that mimics glass and it has the same prison crush gradient with this pattern here and while it looks good it is a bit of a fingerprint magnet this is obviously the prism crush blue variant and I think it looks good but my personal favorite has to be the wide variant but yeah that personal thought aside I think this is a very functional design you get the usual buttons and the bottom is where all the action lives we'll get the USB C port the headphone jack and the single speaker another thing to note is that the phone comes with the dedicated dual sim and microSD slots in this slightly weird design I mean I had a little trouble getting this out and putting it back in but hopefully that's not a problem for everyone moving on to the front you get this display the galaxy 8:31 comes with a six point four inch sh t plus Super AMOLED display with the Infinity you design I mean it is Super AMOLED and yes it's bright sharp and vibrant and yeah I like it a lot specially since it's 2020 and we still don't have a lot of AMOLED phones in the mid-range and the budget segment anyway the galaxy m31 has the wide wine elven certification and Netflix and Prime with your movies then shows run in HD so no problems there and as you can see watching videos on the display is a nice experience anyway on the front you also get the in display optical fingerprint scanner which is decently fast and there's also phase unlock which is pretty good so Super AMOLED display in the Galaxy everyone is obviously one of the highlights but there's also the quad cameras on the back you get four cameras here of forty eight megapixel primary camera and 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle camera a 5 megapixel macro sensor and a 5 megapixel depth sensor with all the different features like scene optimizer that supports 30 scenes now the different modes like I focus more and more well the quad camera specs sound good and I've been taking a few photos from this phone and so far the experience has been quite good in good lighting the phone takes some really good shots the colors are AB the details are good and the dynamic range is impressive I mean just look at this shot and now how the galaxy it everyone has managed to take a very good shot sometimes the aiready one does not capture the shadows as well but overall it's not a big deal as you can see in this photo check out some low-light shots now and I think they are pretty decent oh yes there are some issues sometimes but mostly the 8id one does well in low-light - anyway it's not just the main camera the ultra wide-angle camera captures create shots while keeping the colors and the great dynamic range as you can see some of the photos here are really cinematic yeah some shots are not as detailed but I'm ok with that since most ultra wide-angle cameras in this segment have this issue apart in that the galaxy a31 also has a dedicated depth sensor so the portrait mode shots turn out it's pretty decent there's also dedicated macro camera which does an ok job just take out a couple of shots from macro lens on the video front there's no focus support or even 1080p at 60fps which is a bit of a letdown but here's a 1080p video shot from the phone man it's very stable and the quality is all right on the front the galaxy a31 features a 20 megapixel selfie camera and here are some selfies from the phone and as you can see the details in these selfies are pretty good and overall exposure is also pretty good overall I'm yet to compare the galaxy 31 squad cameras to other phones in this price segment but so far I think the camera performance of the galaxy 8 everyone is pretty good next up let's talk under the hood specs so the galaxy 881 unlike a lot of Samsung phones does not come with an X in Oz chipset it comes to the mediatek helio of p65 chipset with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage now I'll check out the benchmark scores of the 8:31 well to be honest the he knew p65 isn't a world beater chipset but yeah let's so for the best when comes a real-world performance though it's too early to judge but so far the phone has been fairly smooth when it comes to gaming pubsey mobile runs on HD graphics and hide framerate by default and that's the highest setting and the gameplay is fine I did pay some stutters here and there but it's definitely playable overall like I said it's too early to judge the performance of the galaxy 31 but there's one thing I like and as the Fagin the phone comes in the latest one UI on board it is 1 UI 2.1 on top of android 10 and that means you get all the trade when your features including Samsung pay dark more navigation gestures and more when you are on the Galaxy it everyone also includes a live intelligence features which are aimed at India like smart cropping screenshots useful card in the messages app the more Universal search and the great multilingual keyboard then there's the battery which is one of the impressive things in this phone the galaxy 8:31 comes with a big 5000 mAh battery which means that this phone will last long no matter how you use it I use my phones extensively and I think the galaxy 830 ones big battery should be able to handle it with ease especially since its paired with the efficient Super AMOLED panel I played pub G Mobile on the galaxy 31 for an R and the phone lost 14% battery which i think is pretty good I also did a video playback test I played a YouTube video at Matt's practice on the phone for an hour and the battery drain was just 9% now that is pretty awesome because if you charge the phone fairly quickly this 15 watt charger comes in the box and I think it shouldn't take that long to charge the port well it's time to conclude things so at the time of shooting this video we don't know the price of the galaxy 8:31 but on and on it's pretty clear that the galaxy 8:31 is all about three important factors the display the cameras and the battery see the Super AMOLED display looks great the cameras seem very good so far and the parent Foreman should be up there having said that a lot depends on the price because the Helio p65 performance is something I'm yet to test out and it will be interesting to see how the galaxy 31 cameras compared to the competition but these hours apart the galaxy a 31 seems like a solid package people looking to buy a new Samsung a series smartphone but those are our first impressions of the galaxy 8:31 so what do you think tell us in the comment section down below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends and yeah subscribe to a channel for more amazing tech videos but that's me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one [Music]
