[Applause] hey guys this is a patient b-bomb calm and this is the new galaxy m31 now if we did give you a first look at the galaxy m31 previously but it's now time to take a more detailed look yeah let's talk about the galaxy m31 what's new with it and how does it compare to the intensely competitive budget smartphone segment well let's find out so as you must have probably noticed the galaxy m31 does not exactly bring a brand new design or something out of the world but for a budget smartphone this is a phone that looks decent and functional I mean you have things like a physical fingerprint scanner which is very fast and something I still like over in display scanners there's also face unlock which is also pretty fast so yeah that is nice on the front you get this nice 6.4 in Super AMOLED Infinity you display with Gorilla Glass 3 it is a Samsung AMOLED panel so it looks great and you get all the perks like the deep blacks the vibrancy the always-on feature and more the phone is l1 certified so shows and movies on Netflix and prime video should look nice now one thing impressive about the galaxy m31 design is how lightweight and sleek it feels in the hand it's impressive because the galaxy m31 has a massive 6000 mAh battery yes or 6000 mAh battery and even with that massive battery the food only weighs like 90 grams so yes it is impressive anyway the 6000 mAh battery combined with the power efficient AMOLED means this is the phone that lasts long when it comes to charging there's a 15 watt fast charge in the box so that's nice as well anyway the usual buttons the dual sim micro SD triple slot the headphone jack the USB C port and the single speaker round of the design now the next big highlight of the galaxy m31 is its cameras we're talking about a 64 megapixel primary camera an 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle camera a 2 megapixel depth sensor and a 2 megapixel macro lens so yeah this is an impressive package for a budget smartphone now 64 megapixel sensor is obviously the big upgrade and highlight and if you saw I am 31 first look video you already know that the 64 megapixel sensor captures immense detail well here are some thoughts I have taken from the phone and you know what was 64 megapixel sensor does seem pretty good even in low light the sensor good job now I haven't compared it to phones like the noded probe but these photos look nice I'm also taking a few ultra wide-angle shots and I like these photos too it's 123 degrees right so you get to capture a lot more of the scene and as it Samsung phones the ultra wide quality is really good there's the live focus more as well which seems very good when it comes to the details and accuracy of the edges so that's pretty good too the phone also comes with a macro sensor and I know program comes to macros but I'd say the camera here does a decent job apart from that there are a lot of other camera features like the flaw detection ai scene optimizer night mode and a panorama mode with ultra wide-angle camera and yeah a lot more when it comes to videos there's a is here folk recording and the great super steady mode well here's a video from the super steady mode I captured while I was riding a bike and as you can see things look really stable although the ride was quite bumpy moving on to the front there's the 16 megapixel camera with the usual features and well here are a couple of selfies from the phone which do look nice when are in all the galaxy m31 squad cameras seem to perform really well and yeah I did not compare it against the other phones in this price range but I think it'll do fairly well next up let's talk performance the galaxy m31 comes the Exynos 96 11 with up to a GB RAM and 128 GB storage now if you take a look at the benchmark scores it's clear that the Exynos 96 11 isn't going to beat the competing chipsets but if the mtar yes is anything to go by the Exynos 96 11 is no slouch when it comes to usual day-to-day tasks or gaming I mean the galaxy m31 has been going along without any hiccups when it comes to day-to-day tasks and when it comes to gaming it handles games like pubsey Mobile on high graphics and as you can see as a gameplay smooth and nice so yeah I'm expecting decent performance from the entire UI on the software front the galaxy m31 comes is one you are 2.0 on top of Android 10 which is the latest software and that means you get all the great features beat the dark mode the navigation gestures little well being and more also if you're wondering about the pre-installed apps they are a few installed apps there's Facebook Amazon Netflix daily hunt hello Prime video but the good thing is you can uninstall apps like daily hunt and hello so I don't think it's a problem apart from that a lot of you asked us in the first look video if the m31 has voice over Wi-Fi support and well I checked it out and as you can see there's the voice over Wi-Fi I couldn't so yes it does support it well coming to the price now at the time of shooting this video I do know the price of the galaxy m31 but I'm expecting it to be around 1415 K and at that price I know there's a lot of competition and the Exynos 96 11 chipset on the galaxy m31 is the same as the chipset on the galaxy and 30s but you know what the galaxy m31 brings a few key highlight features that samson fans will really like take for example the insane 6000 mAh battery or the nice Super AMOLED display or the 64 mega pixel quad camera cell so yeah the galaxy m31 can be a decent phone for anyone looking for a phone with a big battery or create cameras or an AMOLED display having said that these are just my first impressions and I will reserve my word for when I have truly tested things up well those are my first impressions of the new galaxy m31 so what do you think tell us your thoughts in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends
