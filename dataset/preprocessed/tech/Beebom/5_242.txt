[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from vm.com and recently two new laptops from hp arrived the new hp omen 15 and the new hp pavilion gaming 16. now these two laptops have recently launched in india so we have them here let's find out what makes them truly interesting let's begin okay so first up this is the new hp omen 15 laptop and i really like the matte black classy look with the pretty cool omen logo in the blue and green grated finish but the first thing that really got my attention on the omen 15 is the cooling system see hp's home and laptops have had a perception in the past of not being very cool but the omen 15 changes that there's the new omen tempest cooling tech here and i noticed the new cooling system because of the massive exhaust vents on the back along with the big dual fans plus there's another vent on the side along with the ports so thermal performance seems promising and i obviously tested it out but before i get into details of the thermal performance let me just wrap up other details like the ports here on the right you have two usb 3.0 ports a display port a thunderbolt 3 usb c port and on the left you get the proprietary charging port an sd card reader a headphone jack an hdmi port and a usb 3.0 port so you get pretty much everything you need when it comes to the ports now when i open up the lid here and by the way i think the lid could have been more solid because every time i open up the lid and use it with one hand the screen kind of wobbles but yeah apart from that i really like the display here well the hp 115 is available in multiple display variants including one with a crazy 300 hertz refresh rate now i would have loved to try it out but this display right here is pretty awesome too this is a 15.6 inch ips fhd anti-glare display with a 144hz refreshing and i think this display looks really good it's fairly bright the colors look very nice and the matte finish means the reflections are handled pretty well plus with the 144hz refresh rate it's a very smooth and responsive display i mean i've played some aaa titles on this laptop and the experience on this display has been fast and nice see the high refresh rate display here combines very well with the high-end specs at the laptop packs the omen 15 comes with the intel core i7 10 750 edge cpu coupled with the nvidia geforce gtx 1650 ti gpu with 1tb pcie ssd and up to 16 gb of ddr4 ram now some important points to note here is that the top end variant of the hp omen 15 comes with the nvidia rtx 2070 super with max q design so you can choose to have better gpu performance also i like the fact that you can upgrade the ram here and there's also an empty nvme slot so you can also upgrade your storage now coming to the performance even though there's 1650 ti on board the laptop was able to handle aaa titles with ease pubg ran amazingly well at ultra graphics i got an fps of around 60 and 70 which is very good however i wanted to take full use of the 144 hertz panel and so i said the graphics too high and the fps was in the 80s and 90s and the game felt super responsive i also played far cry 5 another intensive game and at ultra the graphics was fairly good and the fps was in the 50s and 60s but yeah when i said the graphics too high i got the fps in around the 70s so yeah you can always set the graphics to medium and you can even get better frame rates as for the thermal performance the big fans and the vents make the hp omen 15 a very cool machine see i generally played my games with the thermal control set to auto in the omen command center which automatically controls the fan speed and i did not ever feel like the laptop was overheating see the room temperature during my testing was around 25 degrees and after an hour of far cry 5 at ultra i did not feel any heat on the touch pad or on the keyboard and the temperature was around 3840 degrees there was some heat dissipation from the top which was around 47 to 50 degrees but that's not something we're gonna touch so it's all right as for the fan you can always crank up the fan speed from the omen command center and yes the fans do get slightly loud but yeah i wouldn't say it's super loud now apart from gaming i think this is a laptop that can handle things like 4k video editing and well i ran a few benchmark scores so check out this course so here the benchmark scores and as you can see beat the 3d mark or the pc mark or even the far cry benchmark the benchmark scores are pretty good look in my opinion so far i think this is a laptop that can handle intensive tasks but yeah there's more to this laptop there's the keyboard here which i really like first up i think this layout is pretty good and this is a full-size keyboard so that's nice and pretty rare the keys are pretty good too the travel is decent enough and i enjoyed the typing experience on this keyboard plus this is a four zone rgb backlit keyboard as you can see and i think it looks really cool when lit up plus you can customize the lighting through the omen command setup as for the trackpad it's pretty usual it has the windows gesture support and it's overall decent enough as for the portability i'll be honest with you this isn't a super lightweight laptop but hey it's a gaming laptop and given that it's not heavy too and lighter than most of the laptops in this character i mean with everything it's packing i'd say it's 2kg weight is all right plus it's the smallest 15 inch gaming laptop in terms of footprints so that's nice as well as for the speakers here you get two of them one right here and one right here and while these aren't anything crazy loud but these have decent clarity and ample depth lastly there's the battery the highest end omen 15 variant comes with a 71 watt battery and the 200 watt charging adapter but the one we have has a 52 watt battery and a 150 watt charging adapter see when it comes to battery life this is a gaming laptop so expect around three three and a half hours of battery life so concluding my experience of the hp omen 15 i think this is a very good gaming laptop and i like the fact that this starts at rupees 76 000 and the variant we are using costs one lakh twenty one thousand rupees and the top end variant of the hp omen 15 costs 1 lakh 71 000 piece which is great because i like the fact that there's a weight in for basically everyone no matter what your budget is now the reason i call this a good gaming laptop is because of three things the high-end specs that can handle aaa titles the 144hz display that looks great and is very responsive and the great thermal performance which i think is the big highlight here now there's obviously more to this laptop but these are what make the hp omen 15 a good gaming laptop to me apart from the hp omen 15 hp has also launched its new pavilion gaming 16 laptop and i think this is a laptop exciting for both gamers and content creators so the biggest usp of the hp pavilion gaming 16 is obviously this big 16 inch full hd display in a 15 inch form factor all thanks to narrow bezels and this big display means it's great for gaming as well as things like video editing plus i like the overall design too as it incorporates this big touchpad and the front firing speakers the specs are pretty good too you get the 10 gen core i5 i7 chipsets with the fairly powerful nvidia 1660 ti gpu 1tb hdd plus 256gb ssd and wi-fi 6 support plus the pavilion gaming 16 does come with the omen command center so you can tune the performance of the laptop according to your needs well the hp pavilion gaming 16 starts at rp 70 triple nine in india so this is another new hp laptop that you can check out if you've always wanted a bigger display on your gaming laptop or maybe you just want a powerful laptop for your creative needs so what do you think of the new hp omen 15 and the new hp pavilion gaming 16 laptops tell us in the comment section below
