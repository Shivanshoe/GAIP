[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey guys this is a page from p1 calm and the redmi note 9 pro arrived recently and readme 6 arrived last week and now the big question is should you buy that admin no time pro or the real me 6 now I know the deal music seems more feature pad with the 90s display faster charging and more but there's much more to food than just this right there's the cameras the battery the performance so I have been testing things out and let's say the results are pretty surprising so yeah I suggested to watch this video till the very end now let's get on with the fight ok so this is the redmi note 9 pro and this is the real mistake side by side and we are going into details so let's start off with the design now to be honest I think both of these phones look great they both have different gradient finishes and they both have different style camera setups when it comes to usability both of these are fairly big smartphones but I think the really six is the more comfortable phone to use see the redmi note nitro is bigger and it's more hefty at 209 grams compared to 190 grams of the readme 6 so yes the range since the screen bear in the hands but that's also due to the fact that the real v6 has a plastic back yeah this looks like glass but it's actually plastic the redmi note type pro the other hand has a glass back metal frame and yeah it's the more premium looking of the tooth when it comes to the functionality of the design well both of these phones have a single speaker on the bottom which is decent on both of them so yeah it's fine there's the side mounted fingerprint scanner which is pretty fast there's a USB C port the headphone jack the triplets lot for dual Sims and micro sd but yeah the redmi note 9 pro does bring a couple of more functionalities that ideal line first up it has a notification LED which is a great feature gone red and second it has the aya blaster again a great feature so the design front the redmi note time pro dust pack-a-punch the features and a more premium design although yes never six is more handy going on to the display the read mistakes has a 6 point 5 inch display while the redmi note time pro has a 6 point 6 7 inch display now both of these displays are IPS LCD s but there's one key difference the refresh rate the real mistakes has a 90 her's display and when using both the phones side-by-side i could just feel the difference Green misses display it just feels more smoother when you're scrolling or even doing usual tasks is honestly great to see a budget phone cover the smooth 90 hers display I didn't know what I was expecting the redmi note time pro to match this but well that did not happen when it comes to display quality both of these are nice displays but the note 9 pro display is slightly brighter but overall it's not a big difference well if you ask me the real me 6 is the better for Nia honestly I take a 90 Hertz IPS LCD over 60 Hertz IPS LCD any day so yeah the real uma 6 is the one for me but anyway there's one thing I don't like about both of these phones see they both have the white wine Elvan license and while HD works in YouTube the poor don't have HD support in Netflix and prime video which is really weird I mean I just hope both these companies fix it so next up let's draw performance the redmi note I'm Pro comes with a snapdragon 7 to any G chipset with up to 6 GB RAM and what do we need GB storage while the real mistakes comes with the mediatek helio g9 TT chipset with up to a GB RAM and 128 GB storage now I showed you the benchmark scores in a note 9 pro first impressions video and when the g9 TT scores higher than the 720 G in a doodle when it comes to Geekbench the Snapdragon 720 G scores a little higher now as you can see the difference isn't that huge but it goes on to show that these chipsets are very close performance when it comes the real-world usage I have taken turns to use both these phones as my Tralee driver in the past 2 weeks and I can say that both these phones bring great performance I did not come across any lag of starter now to be honest the real mistakes did feeling a little smoother and that's mainly due to the 90s refresh rate but overall they both perform really well when it comes to gaming to both the phones do well but when it comes to pubsey mobile the real Mystics has the edge as the g9 TT supports HDR ultra graphics while the maximum 720 G can go is HD high so you're not something you should take note if you're a big pubsey play having said that I fought the pub G performance on both these phones really smooth so yeah also I know the Snapdragon 720 G is an eight nanometer chipset and the media tech g9 TT is a 2 n nanometer chipset and that means these 720 should be more power efficient when I tested things out and that exactly wasn't the case so we play pub G mobile at max brightness on HD and high graphics on both the phone for an AR and my new dreamy sixes display was set to 90 Hertz now after NAR the redmi note i pro lost to any person battery while the d musics lost 21% battery yeah not a big difference now if you think about it the redmi note i pro has a bigger battery so it strain is higher too so yeah it's not a big difference well if you're wondering about any heating issues when both these phones get slightly warm when you're playing games for long hours real me 6 which of MediaTek g90 does get a little move on but it's not overheating and i don't think there's any problems here overall I think you'll be fine with any of these phones when it comes to performance yep the Jean IDT does have a slight edge when it comes to gaming but it's not a big difference so I think you'll be fine with any of them on the software front it's kind of subjective really the UI as good feature back and so is new UI 11 when it comes to bloatware there he'll be 6 let me skip one of the pre-installed apps so I did that there is me notan I Pro the other hand does come with these bunch of pre-installed apps and games but you can uninstall them so that's good to know moving on to another important comparison that cameras both these phones have quad camera setups but the redmi note 9 pro brings a forty eight megapixel sensor compared to the 64 megapixel sensor in the REME 6 also the node type pro has a 5 megapixel macro lens compared to the 2 megapixel macro lens on the real me 6 now I have taken comparison shots with both these phones so let's take a look folks a good light both these phones captured good shots but I've noticed two things it's the fact that the really six photos are more detailed and have a higher contrast resulting in more appealing shots yeah let's zoom in on this building here see the difference it's due to the sixty-four megapixel sensor obviously but like I said it's not just that the real me six photos do look more attractive to now there are times in the no time Pro captures better shots because really six has just bumped up the contrast a bit too much but mostly the reason 6 was better is the case in low-light is when you know that there are times when there's some noise enemy shots and yeah you can notice some noise in the redmi note and pro shots as well but other than that the real musics always captured more sharper and more detail shots in the note I Pro just look at the leaves in this shot now here's another comparison and again the readme 6 is just better makeup so ultra wide-angle shots both these foes do a decent job although I did notice McCullers in the note 9 pro photos but overall I'd say both are good and yeah it depends on what you like now I also took supported more charts and here I like the deal me 6 photos more I have it both do a little smoothing on the face but the real me 6 photos do look more attractive while the note 9 pro photos do look a bit overexposed here's another shot and look at accession he has the Newton I prefer just seem a bit natural but the readme 6 photo looks nicer apart from that I did take a couple of macro shots and I'm no pro at macro shots but here the node type pro is the winner because you can just see the details better here if you zoom in when couple of videos here's a folk a 30fps video shot from both these phones side by side now quality wise they seem on par and the stability is average because both these phones don't have oh is however you can see that the node 9 pros video just has a warm tone which I don't like much it's something I notice in the photos as well so yeah hopefully Xiaomi can fix this anyway there's also Pro Mode for videos in the note 9 probe with features like love folk squeaking histogram and more and I think this can come in handy to some people when it comes to the front cameras both the phones have 16 megapixel cameras and here are some comparison selfies now I think both these phones take decent selfies and while there is some smoothing sometimes I think the redmi note 9 pro captures more detail and more sharper selfies yeah as you can see in this photo overall I think the real Mystics has better cameras in tow it takes better photos in daytime low-light videos you get the idea the redmi note i Pro is decent too but compared to the redmi note 8 pro it's not a big upgrade move on to the battery and charging the redmi note time pro comes with a massive 5020 image battery while the real mistakes has a fairly big 4300 MH battery well I was expecting better overall battery life from the redmi note not pro and well it did not disappoint in my usage which is usual day to day usage I got a screen on time around eight and a half hours around the note 9 probe which is really good lately since is pretty good too with the full set to 90 years the spleen and time of more than 6 hours is also really good so the battery life is good on both of these smartphones but yeah the redmi note I'm Pro has a usual 60 years play and it has a bigger battery and it did last longer for me so yeah it is slightly better in which charging speed is also pretty important to me and that's an area where the real me six outright beats that I'd mean no time Pro checks out see the 18 watt charger on the note 9 Pro takes 2 hours and 15 minutes to charge the phone from ten to hundred percent I know it's a big battery but that's a lot of time on the other hand the 30 watt book charger on the reading 6 takes just 60 2 minutes which is what our two minutes and yeah this is a big difference when it comes to the connectivity both of these phones have all the modern standards including voice over Wi-Fi but yes the redmi note 9 products come with nav except Hort which is India's very own satellite system and yeah the read Mystics kind of misses out on that well it's time now for the verdict let me note 9 Pro versus the real be 6 well my choice is the real me 6 see the real me 6 is just the better phone here it has a better more up-to-date 90 hers display better camera performance in almost all major situations faster charging and it's a more handy for which I think is very important now all these are important factors in the redmi note I'm Pro is not a bad for an extent and looks really good has a slightly better battery life and like the real mistakes it brings good performance but other than that three mistakes is clearly just ahead yeah the read mistakes is the phone I would recommend over the redmi note 9 pro well that was a pretty detailed comparison of the redmi note 9 pro and real mistakes and to be honest the redmi note 9 pro and the redmi note 9 Promax aren't as impressive as previous smart phones internet me note series anyway what do you guys think about that tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share
