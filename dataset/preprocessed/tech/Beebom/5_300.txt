it's time for the word it should you buy the rainy x50 Pro or wait for the 1+8 [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the readme x50 pro 5g arrived in India recently and this is the first budget flagship of 2020 now there are two major questions around it first should you buy this 40,000 rupees phone from real me second should you rather wait for the ultimate budget flagship the 1+8 well I have been using this phone as my daily driver for quite some time now so I'm going to answer all of your questions so yeah let's begin with our real me X 50 pro review okay so you have seen a first impressions video and you probably know pretty much everything about the new real me X 50 pro so you know what I'm going to keep things straight forward and crisp so what are the three most important aspects about the real me X 50 Pro there's the hard read because it brings cutting-edge hardware that should stay cutting-edge in all of tradewind then there are cameras because all of us want to know if these cameras are flagship grade or not and there's the new 65 what fast charging which is definitely going to set the standard for fast charging this year so let's take it one by one starting off you know the specs of the expected pro and they are really good snapdragon 865 lpddr4 ram ufs 3.0 storage yeah these are the specs you're going to hear a lot in 2020 first up numbers aside like I said this is the phone I have been using as my daily driver and so far on the performance front the readme actually Pro does not disappoint it's just a fluid lag free experience beard when it comes to day-to-day usage of playing high-end games and trust me when I say that I've played a lot of games on this phone and it's already lag free however I did some tests on the game in front so we ran the game bench test to see how the snapdragon 865 on the X 50 Pro is performing when it comes to frame rates so we play pubsey mobile at HDR and ultra settings for and are on the phone and the frame rates were around 40 fps most of the time and as you can see from the game badge results the frame rate was consistent 97% of the time which is really great performance you also take the battery drain during this test and in an hour The Fool lost 18 percent battery which is decent enough considering it's a powerful jet setting if you're wondering about any heating issues well they really made 50 products a fine job and now I'm not sure if it's tax to the vapor cooling or Snapdragon age 65 efficiency but even after an hour of gameplay the temperature was around 35 did math which is nowhere close to overheating another thing I checked is ufs 3.0 on the readme x50 Pro versus ufs 3.1 on the IQ 3 because readme claims that their storage is just fast so I ran out of storage benchmark on both the phones and turns out the real me 850 pros ufs 3.0 storage is actually marginally faster than the ufs 3.1 storage on the IQ 3 so yeah the claims are indeed true I don't know the flagship hardware the real me 850 probe does its job very well I think it'll do great in the long run as well I'm definitely positive next up the cameras these are the quad cameras you get on the real makes 50 Pro and honestly I was a little underwhelmed by this because this is basically the same camera setup as the real me x2 Pro see I was expecting Sony's new imx6 86 64 megapixel sensor on the X 50 Pro because I think that's going to the standard in 2020 but it's not here anyway specs aside do these cameras qualify as flagship great cameras well the answer is no but they are decent for the price so you have some photos I have taken from the phone and if I talked about the positives I'd say the photos have played EPN the colors look good and there's good dynamic range to beat in good light or even low light however like I said it's not flagship great so the really makes 50 probe easily beats the IQ 3 when it comes to the cameras but when compared to the oneplus 70 it comes quite close but still falls a little behind let me show you so in this comparison here you can see that the 70 photo looks more appealing with better contrast yep contrast this is where the X 50 Pro kind of feels a little lacking here's a low net comparison and here the photos look very similar but again the 74 that just looks a teeny bit better thanks to the warmer tone and contrast here's another comparison and this is a photo I took with the Sun coming right into the camera and the 70 has handled things better with better colors and better exposure it's just more appealing now honestly the real me X 50 Pro photos have better detail than the 70 photo if you zoom in because it is 64 versus 48 but even when you zoom in you can see this over sharpening that is going on and this is something you'll notice only when you zoom in but yeah it's present in all photos of the X 50 probe but if you ask me the real me actually Pro has decent camera performance but it's clearly not beating the one per 70 I also compare the video quality between these folds so here's a fork in her ear pierced video from the x50 Pro and 70 side-by-side and as you can see there's a huge difference in stability the 70 video is a lot more stable tanks 200 is and compared to that the X 50 Pro video is just not stable in 4k and it has over saturated colors which don't look so good I also compared videos from the stability modes that shoot in 1080p and as you can see here the X 50 Pro video now is stable although 70 feels a little more stable to me also the X 50 Pro video is a little zoomed in or the quality wise it's decent enough well real cameras aside the front cameras here are definitely more exciting see the pixel 3 XL in 2018 came with an ultra wide-angle camera on the front and ever since then I've always wanted an ultra wide camera on the front but finally the X 50 probe brings it and I think this is actually really useful I mean check out this usual selfie and the ultra wide selfie as you can see the main camera does a good job with the details on the face and it's an all-around good selfie the wide-angle selfie isn't as detailed the face is a little smoother out but you get a wide view so I like here are some more selfies from the phone and I really enjoyed the experience of clicking these walter wide-angle selfies as you can see from the face so yeah this is a nice addition so honestly the front cameras of the real makes 50 pro are really exciting and I really hope more and more companies follow the X 50 Pro and bring ultra wide lenses to the front camera now coming to the back cameras where like I said they're decent be the main camera the ultra wide-angle lens or even the portrait mode but yeah there's no I make 686 no 4k 60fps no OS so yeah it's nothing extraordinary third most important thing about the X 50 Pro is its new 65 watt super dodge charger and it's kind of the most exciting feature of the real me X 50 Pro see let me give you an idea by doing a comparison so the one per 70/30 what - charge goes from ten to hundred percent in 55 minutes nice the IQ tree with its 55 watt super flash charge takes 45 minutes great and the X 50 probe is at 65 watt super dark charge takes only four minutes yup I love discharging speed I mean I would just put the four to charge and in ten minutes boom 50% this is really good I back in 2018 the 1 plus 5t the fast charging phone back then took 74 minutes to fully charge with the ex roti pro we're now down to 34 minutes yes we have come a long way in two years so yeah 65 watt power charging on the Xfinity Pro is something I want to see more of the same so those are the three most important aspects about the real me x50 pro but what about the rest of the phone I mean I know a lot of you guys think real me is launching phones with the same design again and again and well I kind of agree but yeah this is a lot more premium that previously in me phones it's the same finish you get on oneplus phones so this is obviously nicer anyway I like the design specially the new colors and this also steal your speaker's here which are really good so good job on that front yep there's no headphone jack on the phone which I know a lot of you people are disappointed by but honestly in 2020 I wasn't expecting it in the flagship for now what I was expecting in a flagship phone in 2020 is an IP rating or wireless charging which the 850 Pro does not have the display is a 90 Hertz AMOLED panel and I haven't faced any issues when it comes to speak it gets pretty bright so how do you store a problem and it's overall a really nice omelet pan I mean really UI feels really nice with 90 Hertz goodness so yeah I've got completed apartment at the Ford has do uni you on board and it's the ad-free blow free kind which is nice the battery is a 4200 mhm Pat and while it isn't extraordinary it will definitely last your day I mean I usually got a screen time of around four four and a half hours which is decent because I had the phone always said 290 Hertz so yeah this battery life is pretty decent now coming to the connectivity the real me as 50 pro comes with 5g support which is great but kind of useless in India right now there's also dual frequency GPS and dual SIM slot with no microSD so also if you're wondering the readme X recruiter does have voice over Wi-Fi support I mean I've put in an air two SIM card in the port and as you can see the phone has the voice of a Wi-Fi icon on the top anyway it's time for the word it should you buy the real me X 50 pro or wait for the 1+8 well if you ask me honestly I think the me x50 Pro is a solid budget flagship from really it's got the trade when he specs nice and premium build and design insanely fast charging are good software experience and decent battery life it's definitely better than the IQ 3 but yeah it's not perfect see the cameras aren't anything special and the bigger problem with the x50 Pro is that one plus 8 is rumored to be coming in March and or April beginning now the one person it will bring the same specs and start to bring in exciting features like the IP rating wireless charging a what to any herds arm in a display and the Sony iMac 686 sensor yes the one person might be priced higher but I'd rather wait for it then get a phone that's around 40 K and then regret it later so or not yes I'd recommend you to wait but if you just can't and you have to get a budget flagship like right now the real me actually broke won't disappointed so that's a word it on the real me X 50 probe but what do you think that was in the
