we need hey guys this is from v1.com and samsung recently announced the galaxy s20 fe 5g variant in india and i was actually excited for this phone because a samsung flagship with a snapdragon chipset that's pretty rare and that is something they've all been wanting for so long anyway so this is the galaxy s20 fe 5g and you know what when i looked at the specs in the pricing i felt this is not just a fan edition smartphone anymore i felt this is a phone that's actually killing samsung's 2021 flagship that is the galaxy s21 so to give you an idea of what i'm talking about i'm going to divide this video into four sections first up how is the galaxy s20 fe better than the s21 second what's similar between these two phones third the processor because that's a very important aspect when it comes to samsung flagships and lastly how's the s21 better than the s20 fe so let's begin so starting off with what's better in the galaxy s20 fe 5g first up the s20 fe 5g comes with the 25 watt fast charger in the box now as you guys know the s21 phones only have the usbc cable so this is a big big point for the s20 fe right there in fact i'm going to give it 25 points if you know what i mean the s90f also has a bigger battery when compared to the s21 the s20 f5g comes with a bigger 4500 mah battery compared to a 4000 image battery on the galaxy s21 now the battery performance of both these phones is not a big difference in my testing especially because the s20fe also has a larger display but yes overall the bigger battery in the h20f should last a bit longer in some situations another thing in the s20 that you don't find in the s21 is the micro sd slot i mean both these phones have the same 128 gb base weighted but a microsd slot is definitely a good thing to have and yeah the s21 does not have that while the s20 fee has it now moving on to the similarities between both these phones there's actually quite a few of them actually the reason why i feel the s20 fe 5g competes against samsung's 2021 flagship so well is due to the similarities first up on the design front both these phones have plastic backs with an aluminium frame they both have a design that's ip68 rated for water and dust protection and both these phones have support for wireless charging reverse wireless charging and stereo speakers both these phones are also fairly comparable on the display front so they both have 120hz amd displays with the fhd plus resolution and both these displays are actually quite nice but there is a bit of difference see the s20 fe 5g lets you set the display to either 120hz or 60hz while the s21's amulet is more adaptive so the adaptive mode can basically tune the refresh rate depending on what's on the screen apart from this difference both these displays look crisp and nice but when i compared them closely the s21 display is a little better it's marginally brighter as you can see and it also has better viewing angles if you ask me it's not a big deal the s20 fee display actually looks great but yeah these differences are something you should know now another area where i think both of these samsung flagships are fairly comparable is on the camera front see specs wise both these phones have kind of similar main camera and ultra wide angle camera the s21 does have a 64 megapixel telephoto lens but strangely it supports 3x hybrid zoom while the s20f is 8 megapixel telephoto lens supports 3x optical zoom anyway i have taken a lot of photos from both of these phones to get a better idea so let me show you so just take a quick look at these photos and there are a few teeny tiny differences here and there but overall when i first looked at all of these photos i thought they don't really look that different do they i mean they both are premium samsung phones so they both have the rich color science they both have 12 megapixel sensors so details are kind of similar now sometimes i noticed the s21 amping up the contrast a little and in low light some s21 photos are slightly sharper but it's not a big difference if you really ask me so chipsets are always a big deal when it comes to samsung phones because they kind of make them or break them and that's the big difference between these two phones so the galaxy s21 comes with the latest exynos 2100 chipset which is the newer chipset it's based on the five nanometer architecture has the latest arm cores the s20 fe 5g on the other hand comes with last year's flagship snapdragon 865 chipset which is also fairly powerful now when you look at the benchmark scores of both the phones the exynos 2100 does well quite obviously but it's not a big difference by any means i mean check out the antutu scores of both these phones yes the exynos 2100 scores are higher but the 865 is fairly comparable now same with the geekbench scores as you can see here see again these are just numbers when it comes to real world performance the s21 might have more raw processing power but in my basic tests i found the performance on both these phones pretty comparable well in my gaming test after half an hour of cod mobile on both these phones the performance was fairly consistent on both phones with graphics set to high and frame rate set to max now as for the temperature the s21 was slightly warmer it was around 4142 degrees while the s20 fe was at 38 degrees i also did a throttling test with the cpu throttling app and the snapdragon chipset actually did better there see how the s21 has more light green and orange in the graph indicating throttling in fact as you can see in the end result it says the cpu throttle to 65 of its max performance in the s21 while the s20 fe 5g cpu throttled to only 85 of its max performance so that is a very big difference and the s20 fe-5 is clearly better now do note that i started the test with both phones 100 so you know what even though the s21 has the newer chipset the s20 fe 5g with the snapdragon 865 actually holds its own pretty well so lastly what's actually better in the galaxy s21 now first up it has a more lightweight and compact design here the dimensions and the weight of these phones and clearly the s21 is just a nice small phone i definitely like that now it's not like the s20 fe is bulky or anything i mean it's a fairly handy phone it's not heavy but yeah the s21 is more compact i'll give it that also the s21 has better screen protection it has the latest gorilla glass victors while the s20 fe 5g has gorilla glass 5 on board now another area where i found the s21 to be better is on the selfie's front numbers wise the fe has the upper hand with a 32 megapixel sensor but in my testing the selfies from the s21 just look better with better skin tones sharpness and details well it's time for the verdict so the price difference between the galaxy s20 fe 5g and the galaxy s21 is basically 22 000 rupees and if you think about it there's not a lot of difference between these two phones look if you ask me i would not call the s20 fe 5g just a fan edition phone anymore i think it's more than that more like a flagship edition phone because it basically has almost every flagship feature it has a powerful chipset ip rating wireless charging a 120 hertz amd display good cameras bigger battery and a charger in the box so clearly the s20 fee just makes more sense to me as the samsung flagship to buy well i'd love to know what you guys think of the galaxy s20 fe 5g and how does it compare to the galaxy s21 so put down your thoughts in the comment section below also like this video share it around for
