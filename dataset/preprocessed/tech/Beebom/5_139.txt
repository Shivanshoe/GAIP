[Music] so [Applause] hey guys this is patrimbio.com and this is the new ico z3 5g and this is a phone that seems to hold up pretty well against the competition if you just look at the specs and as a reason it's been getting a lot of hype now that's also the reason why we thought let's not do a simple first impressions video let's do a proper review so i use it as my daily driver tested it out and turns out the iq z3 is a phone full of compromises yes this is my ico z35g review so let me just get it out straight away the biggest reason everyone's talking about the iq z3 is because it brings the latest snapdragon 768g soc at rupees 1990. now i think you already know the specs and it's not just numbers the performance is one area where the ico z3 2d shines typically it's not a snapdragon 860 beta the poco x3 pro remains the most powerful phone in this segment but it does go ahead of every other phone in benchmarks here's the additive score of the snapdragon 768g on the iq z3 versus the 750g on the mi 10i versus the dimension 800 on the real me x7 and as you can see the 768g scores a lot higher actually now for people who don't know the 768g is basically an overclocked 765g it has both a higher clock cpu as well as a higher clock gpu now there are also a few minor differences in the standards like bluetooth but it's basically the same chipset which is not a bad thing i mean the iko z3's performance is excellent i've been using the six plus 128 gb base variant of the phone and this thing is pretty good apps launch up quickly there's no weird lag and the gaming performance is consistent without any hiccups like thermal throttling or any overheating issues so the ico z3 does live up to the promise of great performance in this price but it still doesn't quite feel like a phone i personally buy at 20k so the iko z3 does a few things pretty well for example the 4400 image battery performs as well and the charging speed is good i mean i got sots of around five five and a half hours on an average which i think lies in the good battery ballpark and the 55 watt charger that the phone comes with is pretty fast it charges the phone from zero to sixty percent in around half an hour and it takes the phone from zero to hundred percent in around 55 minutes which is pretty fast so i like what's good about the iq z3 and what i don't like is the compromises there are a lot of them so first up the design has a few compromises i mean the in-hand feel of the phone is good it's not too heavy or bulky at 185 grams and that's a good thing but the phone does not look or feel like a premium phone that costs 20k see i would have been okay with the plastic frame and plastic bag if there was a good looking matte finish or something that looked more premium well this does not now i know looks are subjective but what's with the teardrop notch and the big chin in 2021 it just looks outdated on a phone from 2019 and i can even see some screen bleeding near the notch then there's also the fact that this phone does not have stereo speakers as for the display it's a 6.5 inch ips lcd 120 hertz panel with panda glass protection and yeah that's actually the name of the protection and this is a good screen it's decently bright i compared it to the note 10 pro max's display and the notes display looks slightly brighter to me but it's not a big difference as you can see here the iko z3's display is also sharp the colors look good enough although the viewing angles could have been better the 120 hertz refresh rate works well too i had it set to smart switch and there were no weird stutters when switching between different pages and apps so what's the problem see the fact is there are phones like the redmi note 10 pro max now in this price range would bring 120 hertz amoled at a lower price and that's kind of what makes this display not so impressive i mean i wish ico would have used amoled here to at least cover for the other issues in this phone but yeah it is what it is there's one more thing on the display front the display here is set to support hdr10 but i checked in netflix and i checked the prime video and did not see any hdr tag in any of the shows so it's probably not working yet see i would have overlooked the dated sort of design the lack of amoled panel well i wouldn't have but let's say i would have overlooked these and i would have been okay with this but there's still one thing that i just cannot be okay with the software experience on this phone the fun touch os 11 experience i mean we recently made a video on the fun touch os 11 update and we talked about all the big issues and well they are all present in the ico z3 and you know what i found some more first up the lock screen poster feature it's enabled by default i mean there's not even a mention of it in the setup process to let you know it's on anyway so it's basically adware promote stories and if i want to disable it i'll first have to give the lock screen poster service my permission to make and manage phone calls that's all i also have to give it access to photos media and files just to disable this feature which by the way i did not even agree to in the first place yeah this is super weird now that's wrong how can i even trust this phone if it interferes with the experience in google apps chrome to be specific and chromium by default comes with this vivo homepage by default which is basically a way to show these ads and recommendations i mean these are proper ads well this is not cool now there are obviously all the other issues there's bloatware with the hot apps and hot games folders there's the usual unnecessary notifications and the multitasking gesture still does not work yep it just does not work there are also these pop-up privacy terms for every single app and most of these are kind of shady i mean to search for apps in the app drawer i have to accept this privacy policy which clearly mentions it collects gid guid ip address location and it will be stored at vivo servers for three years and the data may be processed by third parties so the software on this phone is the biggest compromise it's a big deal breaker but if you still want to know about the camera experience i'll give you an idea here are the specs and i'll be honest the cameras here aren't exactly compromised it's actually not bad not extraordinary but i'd say it's decent enough i mean the ico z3 captures photos that are sharp and it gets the exposure mostly right for example this photo is pretty good right but you know what a lot of its photos have this warm sort of yellow tinge that gives them an over saturated feel inner light the warm tinge isn't that visible and i think it does pretty well in low light although it does struggle with harsh lights or a darker situation i even compared things to the redmi note 10 pro max's cameras to get a better idea and while the z3 kind of does match up with his exposure the warmest tone is visible to make it clear the note 10 pro max isn't perfect with colors but it's just better than the iko z3 and if i just zoom in on almost any shot see this one you'll see more details in the note 10 pro max photo the note 10 pro max is also better in low light it handles lights better as you can see in this shot where i use tap to focus on both the phones and it's not just the lights the redmi phone takes sharper shots as well for example just look at the trees in the shot moving on the ico z3's ultra wide angle lens is kind of fine i personally found it to be decent and yeah it's as decent as ultra wide angle cameras go in this price range now one aspect of the camera which i found pretty good is the selfies most selfies have sort of a balanced tone not too sharp not too soft so i like it video performance is kind of okay here's a 4k video shot from the phone and you can clearly see the over saturation all around it's a bit too much if you ask me and since there's no ois the video is kind of jittery see overall the point is that the ico z3 5g is a phone that has just too many compromises i mean i can't recommend the phone just because it has snapdragon 768g he's granted the snapdragon 760 g is a good performer here but i just can't ignore the outdated design the lack of amoled and honestly i don't want anyone to go through the fun touch os experience here lukaico is obviously targeting the online market and taking on the likes of oneplus but if it wants to be the next oneplus the specs just won't be enough iko has to work on the software experience on its phones because that's the biggest problem and if you're interested in the ico z3 for 5g first up like i said recently i'll say it again 5g in india right now is a big gimmick and there's also the fact that the iko z3 only has two 5g bands n77 and n78 lastly if you're wondering which phone should you buy instead of the iq z35g well there are quite a few options there's the poco x3 pro for the high-end performance the redmi note 10 pro max for the 120 hours amoled premium design and better cameras and you can also take a look at the mode of phones for you know the cleaner software experience anyway
