[Applause] [Music] hey guys this is patient B you all calm and the Galaxy S ten light is finally here which honestly is it as light as the name suggests yeah watch this we'll get to the very end to know why anyway the Galaxy S 10 light is a phone that I have been excited about since it was announced because this seemed like a great budget flagship finally from Samsung so what I waiting for let's do the unboxing accessory in the box you get the usual silicon case USB C earphones which is nice the 25 watt fast charger and the usual manuals I know with of course the galaxy s 10 light this is the new S 10 light and like I said the galaxy s 10 light name might confuse people to think this is just a lightweight version of Samsung's flagship but let me tell you it's not not red cup suspects not very comes to the society here the Galaxy S taillight is a big phone it's even bigger than the Galaxy S 10 plus now this is a big phone but in my brief usage it's a food that's felt very comfortable in the hands I mean it's fairly lightweight 886 grams and it's fairly sleek as you can see plus it helps that this is an attractive looking smartphone our black version just looks classy the back here is plastic not glass but unlike a lot of other phones that look cheap this looks fairly premium and very glossy you get the new rectangular camera Kara that's definitely going to be Samsung's whole design language for the upcoming smartphones and so far I'd say it looks fine the front is what actually makes this phone special this here is a big six point seven inch AMOLED display with narrow bezels all around and the center punch hole that we have seen in the note 10 flagships and well this looks beautiful it's a samsung amoled and well it looks great deep blacks beautiful colors and it gets bright too I'm loving this display on the front you also get the optical fingerprint scanner which is decently fast there's also face a lock which works well so you have all the options when it comes to unlocking the phone apart from that you have the usual buttons and unlike many Samsung fools the Galaxy S turn light has all the buttons on the right side just the way I like it a lot of the hybrid duels in slot with micro SD support and the single speaker and USB see on the bottom there is no headphone jack even though the Galaxy Note 10.1 but this is a premium food throw I wasn't really expecting it so the Galaxy iStent light is a looker but what actually makes this phone not so light are the specs the galaxy s turn light comes it's slap chip level specs the snapdragon 855 8gb ram 128 gb storage yep flagship great specs in fact this is Samsung's only phone and they have to come with the snapdragon 855 chipset I know it's not 855 plus but honestly the plus did not really make a huge difference it was just mostly overclocking so yeah I'm fine with the 855 anyway as always I ran a few benchmark tests and unsurprisingly the numbers are good on par with what you get on the lights and one plus 70 now our benchmark scores are Creed but what's more important is the phone feels really smooth and nice Indian oil usage I obviously haven't used this phone extensively but so far it's been real good gaming should be great - I only played a couple of pubsey mobile sessions and the gaming performance was what you expect from a flagship phone on the max graphics look I'm really optimistic about the galaxy s turn lights performance and I will be using this phone as my daily driver for the next few days so I will have a better idea for our full review anyway moving on to the cameras the galaxy s2 light packs a punch here as well yeah it's not really a light smartphone there is a triple camera setup including a forty eight megapixel F 2.0 primary camera with oh is a 12 megapixel F 2.2 ultra wide-angle lens and a 5 megapixel F 2.4 macro lens now that's a capable camera setup and well it shows in the pictures here are some photos we have taken from the galaxy s 10 light and I think they look great take for example this photo mummy took in a park next to his place and the colors looked really good here and the food overall is sharp and just attractive here are some more photos and so far the galaxy s 10 light cameras look great even in low-light the photos look really good so far we also took a few shots from the ultra wide-angle lens and even the ultra wide photos look really good just check out this one it's got the colors the dynamic range looks awesome yeah it's good here are some more cool ultra wide-angle shots below for the macro lens so here are a couple of macro shots which look decent although I'm yet to truly testing something apart from these cameras you can all the other sampson camera features in the s10 lightness the live focus mode which so far has worked well and yeah here are a couple of more portrait shots I took from the eastern line this also other features like the prom or the night mode and more moving onto video as the galaxy s2 light comes at 4k video recording support with OAS and E is there's no focus 60 FPS support which is a little weird but here's a forked Hurley FPS video from the phone with me just walking around and things look good and the video is pretty stable too there are a couple of interesting video features - they're super steady mode and here's a video with the mode turned on and this is me not walking around instead running and considering that this is a very stable video then also the live focus video option which works with both rear and front cameras anyway here's a live focus video of me saying something probably asking you to hit the bell icon if you haven't already do that and subscribe as well if you haven't already lastly there is the front camera the galaxy s 10 light reaches a 32 megapixels selfie camera with all the usual features like life focus for all I focus video etc you know a couple of selfies from the phone which look good I'd say overall so far so good when it comes to the cameras on the galaxy s 10 light but yeah I will be testing out the cameras a whole lot more in the coming few days and I will be even comparing the cameras here to the oneplus 70 so yeah things are going to get interesting next up there's the battery which goes further improving that this is not a light phone the Galaxy S 10 light comes with a 4500 mAh battery which is the biggest battery when it comes to the s tenth phones heck even the s 10 plus comes with a 4100 mAh battery now I'm not a fan of the battery life on the s10 so this big battery is good news plus on the charging for in the Galaxy S turn light supports 45 watt charging and comes to the same 25 watt super fast charger that we saw with the Galaxy Note dead plus flagship and as we saw in a video this thing is actually super fast so another great thing about the s10 light apart from that on the software front the galaxy s2 life comes with one UI 2 point on top of Android 10 so you get all the features like dock mode which you can steal the link to windows feature Samsung pay feature the anti gestures and a lot more that was a good look at the brand new Galaxy S 10 light and the only thing that's actually light about the smartphone is the price that would be thirty nine triple nine price tag which is just great pricing now about from the pricing the Galaxy S 10 light is not actually a light smartphone this is a true budget flagship from Samson ready to take on buttless honestly the estin light at this price seems like an impressive budget flagship from Samsung we have all been waiting for yes it's a little late to the party but it's got almost everything going for it the attractive looking design the beautiful AMOLED display with a center punch hole cameras that so far seem very good a big battery with fast charging and the latest software on board so what's exactly the catch here should you buy this over the oneplus 70 well the answers to these questions is something I am working on so stay tuned for our full review of the galaxy s 10 light which is coming soon well so far I've been really impressed with the galaxy s 10 light but what about you guys tell us your thoughts in the comment section below also if you have any questions any this comment below and we'll answer them in our full review which is coming soon so stay tuned for that also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos well as me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one [Music] you
