[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and the new iphone 12 mini is here this is the indian variant and it has to be one of my favorite new iphones of this year and i'm obviously going to show you the iphone 10 mini but we're also giving one away so make sure to watch it in the end to know all the giveaway details the rules etc now before i unbox the iphone 12 mini let me just disinfect it because i want to show you a very cool way of doing it because this is the new goldridge virus shield 4.0 a uvc technology based disinfecting device that kills 99 plus covid19 viruses and other harmful pathogens and bacteria it has a 30 liter capacity so you can just put in things like your phone keys wallet earphones fruits and vegetables and more and all of these will be disinfected in two to six minutes pretty cool right gorgeous virus shield is tested and certified for uvc is radiance by an icmr impanel lab and it is 100 leak proof so i'll leave a link to goldridge wire sheet 4.0 so make sure to check it out so going back to the iphone this is the iphone 12 mini indian variant and as you can see the box is pretty compact because there's obviously not a lot of stuff in it so let's open up the box and see what's inside so this is the new iphone 12 mini and yeah the blue color looks very nice let me just keep that aside and as for the accessories in the box uh like you probably already know there's only the cable this this one usb seat lightning cable and that's pretty much it you get the stickers and the sim ejector tool but there's no earpods or the charging adapter so yeah that's pretty much everything you get in the box okay so now let's talk about the iphone 12 mini now i said at the start that this is probably my favorite new iphone and that's because of this size this is such an amazing small phone and to tell you honestly it's even smaller than i thought it would be i mean i've been using the pixel 4 which is another great compact phone and the iphone 12 mini is even smaller than that to give you more perspective on how small this phone is this is the galaxy note 20 ultra in my hand and now take a look at the iphone 12 mini in my hand see how wonderfully it fits in and it's not just smaller than these bigger phones it's even smaller than other compact iphones like say the iphone se as you can see it's not only smaller it's also narrower which makes for a better hand usage honestly i love the in-hand feel of the iphone 12 mini i can use it one-handed i can swipe down from the top more easily and i also like that it looks and feels as premium as any top and iphone and that's because it has the same modern look i mean this is new the square of edges and i like it it somehow feels more modern and solid in the hands and i think these aluminum sides look way better than the stainless steel on the pro models which is a crazy crazy finger magnet plus the blue color is nice too although yeah a matte finish would have been more perfect so that was the mini part of the iphone 12 mini now generally when we hear about a mini phone a thought comes to our head that there might be some cut downs here and there is that the case with the iphone 12 mini well not really like the iphone 12 or the 12 pro the max it's got the stereo speakers slightly smaller but so far they seem loud enough ip68 rating wireless charging and the new mac safe support now the max safe chargers haven't arrived in india yet so i'm here to check that out but there's no cut down on other specs too there's the same super nintendo xdr only with hdr 10 and dolby vision support i mean no pro motion high refresh rates but the oled is definitely nice and there's also the ceramic shield front under the hood there's the five nanometer a14 bionic chipset 4gb ram and up to 256gb storage now all that is good but there's one thing though i don't like the fact that there's only 64 gb storage in the base weight and i mean come on this is an expensive phone as for the cameras there's no triple cameras like the pro but it's got the same 12 megapixel main and ultra wide angle cameras and judging by the few photos i've taken from the iphone 12 mini the camera performance should be excellent i mean these shots are fantastic right and not just photos i also shot a diwali gibbs unboxing video for instagram using the mini and the quality was very good you can check out this full video on instagram page and when you're there make sure to follow us too now there's one kind of cut down in the iphone 12 mini and that's because of the small size of this phone so the iphone 12 mini has a mini 227 mah battery and this is the one thing i'm worried about this phone i mean iphones except for me the max don't have outstanding battery life and the battery on the mini is very small so that's something you should be noting if you're planning to buy this phone as for the charging just 20 watt fast charging support and well as you know there's no charger in the box in this 70 000 rupees phone anyway let's face it apple says everyone has a charge at home but everyone has those old usb a chargers so you'll have to buy a usbc charger separately i tried the samsung 25 watt usbc charger and it worked the phone was charging fast so you can try out other third-party charges too so that was a nice brief look at the brand new iphone 12 mini and honestly it's all about this size i mean the new iphone features the cameras the new chipset all of that is great top of the line but i think people are generally interested in the iphone 10 mini because of this really great really compact size honestly every manufacturer is copying the new trends in iphones b the headphone jack or the notch and this year there are rumors that companies are planning to follow the no charger trend but i think they should follow the mini trend instead i mean companies should be launching more compact phones because these days almost every single phone is hefty especially in the budget and in the mid-range segment so i really hope companies take inspiration from the iphone 12 mini and bring us more compact lightweight phones as for the price the iphone 10 mini starts at 69 900 and yeah that's kind of a flagship price but hey you can win it so yeah we are giving away a brand new iphone 12 mini to one of you guys i mean diwali is here so this
