[Music] uh [Applause] hey guys this is paige from beyond.com and one of the most underrated aspects when it comes to smartphones is the whole setup process i mean when you buy a new smartphone we just quickly go through whatever options there are to just you know experience a brand new smartphone but the problem is a lot of companies just use this whole setup process to sneakily put in recommendations adware features bloatware etc so which android ui has the most cleanest non-shady setup process and which android ui has the absolute worst setup process well it's actually surprising so watch the video till the very end let's begin so here we are we're actually comparing five android skins there's one ui on the galaxy m32 there's me ui on the redmi note 10 real me ui on the naso 35g oxygen os on the oneplus not ce fun touch os on the iq z3 and stock android on the moto g60 now we are comparing this to see which android screen has kind of the fastest and the cleanest setup process i'm not comparing color overs here because i've checked and color os and realm ui have the same identical setup process so all of these phones are factory reset and we are in the first page of the setup now first up you have to set the language and the region in all of these phones and that's pretty straightforward after that you get the company user agreements on most of these phones except on the moto g60 probably because it's just android with no skin whatsoever as you can see it's already on the network connectivity page anyway so getting to agreements first there's one ui which also has the most confusing agreement page because most people here just hit agree to all of the above but the sending of diagnostic data and marketing info is optional and you can skip them and then tap next then there's miui and it's important to note here that the face moji keyboard privacy policy is sticked on by default when it's actually optional so the first thing i always do on xiaomi phones is untick this because i think you should just use gboard swiftkey or anything else the user agreement on real ui and oxygen os is pretty simple you can just accept it realme ui does show another terms of service page where everything is ticked on by default but the truth is the second option the user experience program is optional so i'll again disable this and then tap next next there's fun touch os which has a lot of these pages there's privacy terms evolution terms and then the user experience improvement program which i'm gonna skip because that just takes user data okay all of these uis are on the wi-fi page and so far stock android has been the simplest followed by oxygen os and real me one anyway so i can connect all of these phones to wi-fi and then they check for any updates and then they get to this page copy apps and data now i'm going to skip this and after a few loading screens you get the sign into a google account page and again i'm going to skip this as well and then all of these phones get the same google services page here i'm going to disable the send usage and diagnostic data option i mean why would we send more data to google than we already are next most of these phones are on the screen log page but me ui and oxygen os ask you to review additional google apps now there's nothing you can do here so i'm just going to accept it and on other phones i'm going to skip the lock screen process as well now this is where it gets most interesting so one ui as you can see is recommending more apps miui is asking for the me account realme ui is asking for a heat app account if you have one oxygen os is on the co creation labs page one touch os is on the recommended services page and stock android on the moto is on the privacy and software page well it's interesting because the stock android setup is almost done i can just disable the automatic updates and the stain touch option that comes next and the phone then takes me to the navigation gestures tutorial and it's done here's the home screen so stock android is clearly the most straightforward and you know clean in terms of the setup oxygen os is in the second place and i say this because it's on the co-creation labs page aka oneplus fancy name for the user experience program i'm going to disagree to it then skip the red label club and the screen lock options choose the font choose the navigation style and it's done so yeah oxygen os is set up too and i did not come across any weird app recommendations or any shady adware features only the user experience program which is part of every android skin out there so i'm just going to remove the moto g60 and the not c from the frame look so now we have four phones one ui miui redmi ui and fanta os all of them known for pushing bloatware and adware so what's exactly the truth let's see how it goes so first up i'm gonna take all of these recommended apps on one ui because i don't want so much bloater on my phone next i'm gonna skip the me account in miui and the hate app account in real me ui i'm also disabling the auto update overnight option in real me ui and also skipping the import data option because these are straightforward options and not exactly bloatware anyway coming to fun touch os i know these recommended services are not so fun because i've used this phone there's art plus plus turbo which apparently speeds up app launching but why does it need internet to do that there's jovi home which is basically a page full of ads and recommendations global search is something you'll come across a lot but it has a shady privacy policy and this too brings recommendations so so i'm going to turn it off now one more option that i don't like is the first one allow the system to use the permission which automatically gives a lot of system apps permissions so i'm going to disable all of these because these are shady af coming back to one ui there's one more app recommendation so i'm taking that but do note this is just a start in one ui meanwhile is on the set password page aka the lock screen password so skipping that real me ui is on the personalization page and when i hit next and then get started the setup is done it's on the home screen so yeah surprisingly no weird recommendations in real me ui which is very very good anyway so we are down to these three phones now so one ui is on the samsung account page and i can skip that and it says you are all set up with the finish button so yeah it looks like the phone is set up but one ui actually brings more recommended services with the expedient samsung services page on the other hand miui is on the additional settings page and this is very important because i always disable the user experience program the glance for me option because this is miui's wallpaper carousel feature that just brings ads also when you disable this you'll get this prompt make sure to hit the no thanks button below the big try button after that i'm going to disable all the other options then there's one touch os which is on the import data page and i can skip it now coming back to one ui there only seems to be this agree option and this will enable the glass lock screen feature which brings ads on the lock screen my galaxy which brings a lot of annoying notifications discover which is app recommendations basically and more well actually the option to disagree here is hidden i can just tap here and this page opens up where i can just disable all these services one by one so it's actually hidden now after i do this you can now see the escape option this is very important now to me ui i can choose the app drawer and that's it miui is set up that's pretty decent because one ui and fun touch os are still recommending more apps and services yeah they are not done yet as you can see frontal choice is showing me the phone essential apps which include quite a few non-essential apps so yeah i'm just gonna untick all of them and also and take this because who needs a spammy v app store now that's it punta chos is set up too so there's only the galaxy m32 with one ui left and you know what it's still not done first up you get this recommendation service and i'm gonna disallow this i'm also going to skip giving my details and next up you again get more app recommendations and you have no option but to tap on modify and untick these apps one by one and then tap on finish and yeah that's it finally one ui setup is done now i know this was a long process but at the end of it i have to say this one ui and also one touch os are the absolute worst when it comes to setting up your smartphone i mean one miss on either one ui or front touch os and a bunch of recommended apps adware services get installed on your phone it's crazy i mean i can't believe i'm saying this even me who i set up process has gotten better because i remember in the past there used to be an additional app recommendations page that's gone now then there's real miui which is better than all of these skins because there was no app recommendations no adwell lock screen feature nothing it's surprisingly very clean and i think real me or oppo do not get enough credit for this now if you want the most simple or the most clean setup experience in a smartphone you'll get it in oxygen os and stock android see stock android on the motor phones is just a quick setup process with no frills there's just absolutely nothing an oxygen os is no longer stock android but it's still a way cleaner experience when compared to other skins so to give these phones a ranking from the best to worst at number one would be stock android oxygen os at a close second deal miui a third miui at fourth one touch os at fifth and one ui at sixth so that was our ultimate smartphone setup comparison but i want to know from you guys which of these setup processors do you think is the worst which android ui skin is the worst when it comes to the setup
