this is the brand new zenbook 14 flip only that has just launched in india and like the previous zenbook flips this too is a really cool really exciting laptop now there are three big highlights if you ask me number one is obviously this whole flip design and number two is this 2.8 k oled display that's actually a show stopper and number three is the fact that this is powered by an amd chipset now before we talk about the specs or the stunning welded panel this is how the zenbook 14 flip oled looks like yeah if you've used the zenbook over the years this looks and feels right at home and that's not a bad thing you still get the aluminium alloy design with the concentric circle finish it's still a very rugged design with the whole mi lstd 810 h military grade certification and it's still super portable at 1.4 kgs and 15 millimeters of thickness and this is important because you are going to use it as a tablet too also important in that case is the hinge here and asus has used its 360 degree ergo lift hinge which seems super durable in my usage and i like the fact that it lifts up the keyboard a bit for better heat dissipation but that only happens up until here after this you have a tablet on your hands yes this is a flip so you can flip it but you can also set up the zenbook 14 flip in a tent mode like this and watch movies and shows or you can set it up like this and use the touch screen without having to you know carry it around or keep it on your lap as for the speakers there are two speakers on the bottom tuned by harman kardon and i found the speakers to be decently loud especially for a 14-inch laptop the base is non-existent which is kind of expected but the audio details were clear and nice now all of this is great but it's made even better because of this oled display just look at the specs of the display it's a high resolution display there's 90 hertz refresh rate 16 aspect ratio and did i mention it's oled yeah it's on it and trust me when i say that this is a beautiful display i've been watching videos on this display is an awesome experience because just look at the colors the blacks or whatever color you want to look at but the point is this is actually good i also like that this display is very bright at a peak brightness of 550 nits which kind of negates the glossy nature of the screen also like i said it's an oled i mean a 90 hertz panel and with the windows 11 dynamic refresh rate feature the ui just feels smooth and responsive on this display now this is also a touch screen i mean duh and the touch response is really good when it comes to day to day usage interactions and gestures happen immediately and the entire display feels smooth to work with and all the windows 11 gestures are supported and work flawlessly this display also supports styluses and asus centers this asus pen which is sold separately anyway we use this pen on this display here and the response the latency is all pretty good so this laptop can also be used for drawing and other similar use cases another point on this display is that this has 100 dc ip3 coverage so if you're a photo editor or a video editor this can be really good for your use case as for the question of can you do photo editing and video editing on this laptop well here the specs of the variant we have and we all know that the ryzen 9 5900 hx is a solid chipset and i like that apart from the chipset upgrade from last year's zenbook 14 flip asus has also used a faster ram and more storage so the specs are good and we did run some benchmarks to give you a better idea on the performance so take a look so here are the cena bench scores which i think are pretty good now here are the geekbench 5 scores which are higher than 11 gen core i7 chipset we also ran the puget bench photoshop test where it scored 739 which is pretty good and this means that it should be able to handle photoshop easily the laptop did not do too well in the puget bench premiere pro test and that may be because there's no dedicated gpu here numbers apart in day to day usual workflow with chrome slack some photoshop some 4k videos we did not notice any drop in the performance the cpu usage was hardly 10 15 percent and the laptop itself is silent and unproblematic now this is not a gaming laptop but we did play asphalt on tablet mode and it was a lot of fun the touch experience is great and the game performance is good and yeah it's just a very good experience the thermals are also pretty good there are two heat pipes and two cooling fans and i did not notice the fans getting loud or anything and the laptop was mostly cool and good there's also the mice was absolutely changed the fan profile along with a number of other useful options as for the other basics of the laptop i really like this shitlet keyboard when it comes to the typing experience there's 1.4 millimeters of key travel the keys are well shaped and the feedback is flat but good the keyboard also has wide back lights with multiple levels of brightness and as for the layout i think it's good and like a couple of hotkeys to disable the webcam and the mic as for the webcam it's a usual 720p webcam nothing special really and as for the trackpad it's quite big and i like that it's responsive this also has asus's numpad feature so you can tap here and get this numpad on the trackpad when it comes to ports on the left you get the hdmi a couple of usbc ports that support usb charging as well as displayport on the right there is a usb a port a 3.5 mm jack and a micro sd reader the laptop also has the fingerprint scanner in the power button lastly on the battery front you get a 63 watt battery and 100 watt usb c charger now we only had the laptop for a couple of days so it's too early to judge the battery performance but we got around five six hours of battery life which is okay so coming to the pricing now the zenbook 14 flip oil it starts at rupees 91 990 and waiting we have cost one lakh thirty four thousand nine nine rupees now in this price range there are other two in one laptop from dell hp and lenovo but all of these two and one laptops are powered by intel chipsets so if you want a two in one laptop with amd this is the only option you have now that's not the only point none of the other two in ones can match the 90hz oled display in the zenbook almost all of them have ips 60hz displays plus you know what i've only had this laptop for a couple of days so can't really give a verdict here but this looks like a good all-around option for anyone looking for a high-end two-in-one laptop with solid performance anyway i want to know your opinion on the same so comment down your thoughts on the new zenbook 14 flip on it in the comment section below and what do
