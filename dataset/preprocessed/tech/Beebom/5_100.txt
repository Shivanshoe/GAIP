[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is paige from vm.com and samson's the one ui 4.0 beta update has been going around for quite some time now and you know what it's finally here in india and i have it installed on the galaxy s21 right here so you probably know what i'm gonna do right well i'm gonna tell you the coolest new features in one ui 4.0 and there's actually a lot of features so yeah let's begin [Music] first up the visual changes so the biggest ui change in one ui 4.0 is support for wallpaper theming so all you need to do is go to wallpapers from the home screen and as you can see there's this new color theme option this shows you multiple themes based on the colors of your wallpaper i can use this one or this one or even this one now if i change the wallpaper to this i'll get a set of new color theme options to choose from plus i like the fact that samsung's wallpaper theming engine is supported by not just the ui elements but by all samsung stock apps i mean here's the phone app is the calculator app so this is cool apart from this one ui 4.0 brings a new charging animation that looks like this yes it's much brighter and colorful compared to the previous bland white animation so yeah i like it the brightness slider in the notification shade is bigger too and it's a lot bolder there's a media output option on the lock screen so you can switch you know things faster the edge panel does not blur out the app you are in anymore i've also noticed one minor change in the dark mode see the dark mode in one ui 4 dimms the icons as well a little here the icons in the light mode and here the icons in the dark mode see the difference anyway moving on the widget speaker panel has been changed too so this is it and it's actually a dot like android 12 and i think this is way more intuitive than the endless horizontal scrolling widget section of previous one ui iterations they knew we just do like this dual clock widget which changes colors depending on day and night of the location there's also a new calendar widget which shows you the monthly view along with today's events i also like how all widgets now have a more rounded corner design now the ui in-apps haven't changed much but there are a few changes here and there so for example the my files app has bigger thumbnails for recent files and i like that you can edit the main page of the file manager to only have what you want another example is the calendar app which features this bar at the bottom to quickly add events [Music] so next up the camera app in one ui 4.0 brings a new defined ui as well as some really cool features first of all the text is a little understated now which i like and gone are the tree icons for different lenses the new camera app shows you the exact numbers for them i also like the fact that the ui shows me the exact zoom level i'm on which is always a big annoyance with the previous camera app now the ui in pro mode is better too it has a more explanatory text for different controls and i think it should be handy for a lot of people there's also a new level indicator in the pro mode which turns on when you enable the grid lines now apart from this when you scan a qr code now via the camera app you can either go to the url or copy that url which is very useful now all that is great but one change i really appreciate in one ui 4.0 camera app is the fact that the shutter button in the video mode is a lot faster to respond see in one ui4 the video recording starts the moment i tap the shutter in the previous camera app it starts once i have lifted my finger making it a little slow at times see so yeah this is great [Music] now samsung keyboard app is something that a lot of samsung users use so it's great that one ui 4.0 is actually improving so the samsung keyboard now has grammarly integration built right in let me show you so here i am writing a grammatically incorrect sentence and as you can see there's this green underline that pops up i can just tap on it hit this button here and it shows me how i can correct things i can stop here fix it and yeah become a grammar nazi anyway i like this because i make a lot of mistakes when i'm sending an email from my phone so this is handy apart from this new feature also like the samsung keyboard categorizes emoji stickers gifs under this new one button now and there's a new feature that lets you combine emojis like this and send it across i'm not sure i'll be using it or anyone will be using it but it's here i mean you can customize the emojis choose the animation you get the idea [Music] next up the device care page has also gone through a ui revamp and it has a couple of really interesting features now first of all here's how it looks as you can see it now shows you an emoji instead of a score to show your device status it also has these bigger cards for battery storage memory etc and it also has the software update and diagnostics option right at the end now coming to the features now in the more battery settings page there's this new protect battery option right at the end that limits charging to 85 percent for better battery health in the long term apart from that in the memory page you can now see the ram plus aka four gigs of virtual ram that i did see on the m52 so this is probably coming to all phones with one ui 4.0 [Music] let's face it we all love these labs pages with experiment features and you know what one ui has got it too finally in the advanced features page there's a new labs option in one ui 4.0 which has one feature as of now but it's a good feature so this option forces all apps to work in the pop-up window aka floating window as well as in the split screen mode for example netflix here does not support any of these modes as you can see there's no option here now i can enable this option in the labs page and now you can see the options in netflix awesome right plus i like the floating window now has these window options all the time [Music] the gallery is another app that has gotten a good update in one ui 4.0 i mean the gallery app looks the same as it did on one ui 3.0 and has the features recently got like the ability to change the date and time as well as location of photos i also like the new d master feature anyway one new gallery feature from one uf4 is the ability to create collages that include both videos and photos i can select a few photos and videos and hit create then select collage and now i can choose from different layouts set which video sound i want edit each photo individually yeah this is great for insta stories i think apart from this one ui 4.0 gallery app also lets you add emojis to videos and photos like this [Music] now what you have 4.0 is based on android 12 so duh there's obviously android 12 features but with a little twist you see privacy dashboard is here but one ui 4.0 has a redesigned ui for it i mean it still shows you all the details of which i've used the permission and when so it's not a problem it even lets you see clipboard usage anyway one uf4 also has the privacy indicators up top when an app uses the camera the mic they're also quick setting toggles for camera and mic you can also give apps approximate location which is awesome now one additional setting i found in one ui 4.0 is the option to clear what your device has learned via android's private compute core feature it's pretty handy [Music] now apart from all these one ufo window has a ton of these minor changes so let me tell you all about them really quickly for example video call effects along with background options now has a new mic mode option with an option to choose voice focus for better focus on the speech and better noise cancellation there's an extra dim toggle in the quick settings that does what it says should be handy for knights the share sheet is now horizontal and it is editable so awesome aod has an option to only turn on when the phone gets a new notification yes this is a new option digital well-being has a new driving monitor which checks how much you drive all week and what apps you use while driving now apart from that you can now use ai emojis on your samsung account profile picture or in contacts now lastly i have noticed better search everywhere with the file manager app drawer settings and more in one ui 4.0 so greatly appreciate that but there's a lot of one ui4 features and yeah this feature is kind of packed anyway let us know in the comment section below which one ui4 feature you like or you know dislike the most comment down below
