so what exactly is bloatware see any app that's unnecessary is bloatware for example if you have an android phone your device probably came with facebook pre-installed now is facebook an integral part of your phone's functionality no it's not and that is bloatware now if you're wondering hey does my phone have bluetooth apps chances are it does let's face it it actually does now there are three types of bloatware apps on android one third-party bloated apps like these and mostly these can be uninstalled easily so these are maybe okay the second type of lottery apps are from the manufacturer itself apps like these most of these can't be uninstalled they can only be disabled the third type of bloatware is from google i know a lot of these apps are something people use but what if you use a browser other than chrome or an email app other than gmail again most of these apps can't be uninstalled what are the negatives of such apps well some of these apps take up a lot of storage some apps send you unnecessary notifications and some apps just keep running in the background slowing down your phone so the question is how do you remove these system bluetooth apps apps that can't be removed easily today i'm going to tell you a very simple method to remove bluetooth apps on your android smartphone and yeah if you want to see more useful videos like this one hit the subscribe button and do not forget to hit that bell icon because we have some really useful videos coming up hit it so here's what you need to do first you need to set up adb on your windows pc or your mac or even if your linux it's fine just set up atp we have a very simple to follow guide on how to set up adb on all of these platforms just follow that and you should be fine once you have adb setup on your laptop go to your phone and enable developer options i think you know how tap on the build number four to five times and you should get this prompt after this enable usb debugging in the developer options then connect your phone to your laptop and when you use the adb command you should get this prompt on your phone just hit allow in this now you need to install this the universal android deep loader this is an open source tool available for windows mac os and linux and this is a tool that helps you remove system apps that can't be removed natively just install this and open it up and you should get this ui i know it looks a little boring and complicated but it works and that's what matters so by default this shows you the recommended bloatware apps you should remove from your device now you can just select all of the apps in the recommended list and remove them be done with it but i have heard some people facing issues on their phones when they do this so instead i'll recommend you to only remove the apps that you think you don't need so what you can do is search for the app you want to remove i have the oppo catering connected here as you can see in the adb devices command and now i can just open up the dbloader tool select all here instead of recommended now i can just search for the apps i want to remove so i can search for the color os browser which no one uses and select it i can search for the finches pay app and select it i'm also adding the oppo roaming app here now i can just hit uninstall selection and that's it these apps are gone simple right let me show you another example so here's the galaxy f23 connected now as you can see from the device's name on the top and i can search for system apps like my galaxy the samsung max app ar zone and just uninstall them with one click yeah this is good i know these apps are listed by the package name so if you have problems finding the app you want to remove just install this app called package name view on your phone this lets you search for the apps in your phone and see their package name so you can use the names here to search for them in the universal android deep loader look this is a great tool if you want to remove a system app that you think is bloatware and that's annoying you with background usage or notifications you can remove every single app in your phone with this tool even apps like the google play store if you want yes the com.android.vending app is the google play store now there are a couple of really important points that you should note about this tool first up the apps that you remove don't come back when you install a system update which is good but if you do a factory reset all of these apps come back this is because the system apps in your phone are part of the system partition itself and the universal deep loader tool cannot remove apps from the partition itself now i know some of you have questions like are there any problems or issues after you've removed system apps in your phone well as long as you don't remove critical apps from the os it's all fine now one good thing is that the deep loader lists important system apps in sections like expert advanced unsafe and untested so you should be fine if you stay away from these apps anyway this tool is super useful and to show you what difference it makes we removed all the bloatware from a real me phone a samsung phone a xiaomi phone an open phone and a vivo phone and it not only makes the experience better it frees up a lot of storage on the galaxy f23 the storage taken by apps by default is 3.21 gb and after removing bloatware 1gb of storage was freed up on the redmi 1.7 gb was freed on the real me 95g 2.8 gb was freed up the oppo k10 gained 1.9 gb and the ico 9sc gained 1.7 gb that is a lot of storage now while we are doing this test we also got an idea on which phones have the most bloatware that can't be removed now i'm talking about unnecessary apps not apps like clock weather messages play store etc so the oppo k10 has the most apps that can't be uninstalled 13 bloatware apps the galaxy f23 has 10 such apps the realme 95g and the iq9se have 11 and the redmi note 11 is the best here with only seven bluetooth apps that can't be removed yeah it's surprising now you can remove these apps with the universal deep loader tool but this gives you an idea of which manufacturer is putting in the most bloatware apps that can't be removed to conclude things this tool is super easy to use and i think you should use it to remove all the bloatware from your phones but i still feel that manufacturers should make removing bloatware from phones a lot simpler i understand manufacturers at these apps for multiple reasons but we the users should have the choice of what apps we want and what apps we don't i'm just add an option in the settings to remove system apps that are not exactly used by the os itself i mean yeah this tool this universal deep loader tool is good it works but it's not something a casual user would try plus there's always the risk of removing apps that might cause problems in your phone so a native tool a native option would be way better to remove system apps bloatware what do you guys think about this comment down below also give this video a like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos that's me signing off
