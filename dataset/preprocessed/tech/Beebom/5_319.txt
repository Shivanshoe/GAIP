[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is a page from V boom calm and Samson has just announced the new Galaxy a 51 well guess what we have the galaxy a 51 right here with us so what are we waiting for well we are probably waiting for you to hit the bell icon if you haven't already so if you've done that let's unbox the galaxy a 51 oh so this is the new galaxy a 51 and here's what you get in the box you get these earphones which is nice since it's rare these days you get the 15 watt charging adapter the USB C cable the usual silicon transparent case and when the manuals which nobody reads anyway talking about the new galaxy a 51 this is a phone that is the successor to the galaxy a 50 and the a 50 years it arrived last year so what other changes at the a 51 brings what's exactly new well let's start off with the nice design changes first so the galaxy a 51 still has a glass stick back but it's new there's a new pattern here if you look closely which I think looks really cool and there's the new rectangular camera module that we have seen in the s10 light and something that's pretty much a surety on the a sturdy series is well it's clear that this is going to be a universal design team on Samsung phones in 2020 plus I like the fact that the galaxy a 51 is so sleek looking and very lightweight so yeah it's very comfortable to use well I think the galaxy a 51 looks great specially this blue color that we have and I think it's a really good color it's really attractive looking and I also think that the a 51 is less of a fingerprint magnet when compared to the a 50s which is just a phone that gets much very easy on to the front there's another nice change there is now a center punch hole and compared to the a 50 s the bezels on the bottom are narrower tube overall the galaxy if everyone does look more modern and more peasant list the display is a 6.5 inch Super AMOLED panel with a 1080p resolution and it's the usual nice AMOLED display it's beautiful I mean watching videos on this thing is amazing just look at it the colors pop the blacks are deep and thanks for the bezel is design it's very immersive yeah it looks nice plus the phone has the Enver license is kind of expected so you can stream in HD on Netflix and prime video you also get the fingerprint scanner on the front it's an industry fingerprint scanner and it's decent enough like all phones there's also face and lock which is fairly fast so no problems also a lot of people had some funny comments about a face unlock shot in Estrin light video where I look bored and uninterested and other things so here's a more lively and happy me apart from that you get the dual sim plus micro SD triple slot so yeah a dedicated slot the buttons on the right and the USB C port the headphone jack and the single speaker on the bottom yeah you're pretty much covered or the design front next up the cameras have been upgraded the galaxy 51 comes with this new quad camera setup you get a 48 megapixel F 1.8 primary camera a 12 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens a five megapixel macro lens and a 5 megapixel depth sensor for the light focus mode well I've only used the cameras briefly but so far the photos of the a51 look good as you can see well the colors look good and the photos are sharp - especially in good lighting in low-light the camera did fairly well - I mean this shot of the leaf is pretty cool looking right I also took some shots from the ultra wide-angle lens so take a look well in this shot you can see the difference the perspective you get from an ultra wide-angle camera and the a 50 ones 12 megapixel sensor has done a fine job with the colors and dynamic range here are a couple more ultra wide-angle shots moving on to the macro lens shots so I like this new macro lens on the a 51 as it lets me get close to things and as it gives me the photos our tea set although ya have to test things out extensively then also the other Samsung camera features there is a live focus mode and the a 51 comes with a dedicated depth sensor so the results are fairly accurate when it comes to edge detection I mean there are a few inconsistence time and again but so far the portrait mode or the life focus mode of Samsung calls it works white there are also a lot of other camera features here like the night mode which now works with the ultra wide-angle camera as well there's the pro mode the scene optimizer which now has more scenes to recognize from and a lot more on the radio from the galaxy a 51 comes with 4k 30fps video recording support and there's even the really nice superstay for stable videos well I tested it out here's a 1080p video I shot running and and well the more has made sure it's decently stable when it comes to selfies the galaxy a 51 comes with a 32 megapixel camera with features like the live focus more filters beautification etc here are a couple of selfies we took from the phone and well they look fine as far as selfies go so my brief time for the galaxy a 51 the quad cameras here do seem like a good improvement over the galaxy a 50s so yeah things seem positive now moving on to things under the hood where things haven't really changed a lot the galaxy a 51 is powered by the Exynos 96 11 chipset with up to a GB RAM and 128 GB u FS 2.0 storage here the benchmark scores on the phone and while these scores aren't going to beat the competition they are decent anyway when it comes the real-world performance the galaxy a 51 has been fluent nice so I'm hoping it gets the job done on the gaming front pub G mobile defaults to high graphics on Exynos 96 11 so that's nice and when it comes to gameplay the performance was good in the couple of sessions I played on the phone overall the performance of the galaxy a 51 has been fairly good so far but yeah it's too early to judge so we'll have to wait and see anyway on the software front I like the fact that the galaxy 51 has the latest one you are onboard it is 1ey 2.0 on top of Android 10 and it brings in all the features we like in one UI but what's interesting is the new India specific features that Samsung has introduced with the galaxy 51 so the messages app now has a useful cards tab on the right where you should see cards with important info like big discounts movie tickets your flight tickets and more there's also multilingual typing where the keyboard will auto-detect regional languages including English and offer better predictions and better music lots of better universal search which searches in popular apps and lastly there's the smart drop feature and screenshots which ought to suggest sckraab based on what's interesting on the screen well these new into specific features certainly seem nice lastly the galaxy 51 has the same fairly big 4000 mAh battery with 15 what fast charging where it should be fast enough so that was pretty much everything about the brand new galaxy 1/5 one and at the time of shooting this video we don't know the price of the phone but yeah this is a phone that brings some nice upgrades and changes I mean the new design and this new color certainly looks modern and the center punch will amulet looks great the quad cameras seem to be pretty good too and when the Exynos 96 11 is the same as the a 50s I'm hoping it does the job and then there's the feature pad latest one UI 2.0 and out of 10 and the usual big battery with fast charging so if you ask me the galaxy 51 might not be the most extraordinary new smartphone but for people who are fan of the a 50 series the galaxy 51 is a solid new smart but what do you think of the brand new Galaxy a 51 tell us in the comments section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing videos including our s10 light review where we'll be comparing it against one per 70 so yeah subscribe the channel well as me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one [Music]
