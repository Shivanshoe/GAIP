[Music] money this is the new oneplus 10 pro flagship that's arrived in india very soon and you know what something is missing in this phone i mean if you remember in the past oneplus flagships were always super hyped be it for things like dash charging or speedy performance or even the hasselblad branding last year no matter what you say oneplus flagships are always hyped on the other hand there's this the oneplus 10 pro and there's no hype for this phone why what exactly is this missing loki is the new oneplus 10 pro in all its glory and compared to the oneplus 9 pro there are a few changes and upgrades sort of you'll know what i mean the biggest debate when it comes to the new oneplus 10 pro is this design yes this design which does remind me of the s21 ultra honestly it's kind of subjective and some of you might like this but i'm personally not a big fan i mean i like this 9rt sort of silky matte glass finish on this phone but i like the overall look of the 9rt more apart from this the oneplus 10 pro has all the oneplus design elements the alert slider hasselblad logo dual stereo speakers but one thing missing is the ip rating it's weird because the oneplus 9 pro and even the oneplus 8 pro had the ip68 rating now the indian version or the global version of the oneplus 10 pro might come with the ip68 rating but it's not there in the chinese version anyway one upgrading the 10 pro that i definitely think is good is the second gen ltpu amoled display see the qsd resolution the curve design all are the same from the 9 pro which is fine but the new ltpotech is the highlight because the second gen panel can go as low as one hertz in a lot more cases than before and a lot more quickly which will mean better battery life the cameras in the tempo also have some minor upgrades which if you ask me don't exactly feel like upgrades the oneplus 10 pro has the same 48 megapixel imx 789 sensor with ois the telephoto lens also remains the same old 8 megapixel lens with ois and the upgrade here is supposed to be the 50 megapixel ultra wide angle camera which can go as wide as 150 degrees now paper the ultra white sensor seems good i mean 150 degrees wide yeah seems pretty awesome but is it see by default the ultrawide mode in the camera app takes photos that are only 110 degrees wide which is strange however hidden in the more tab is a 150 degree mode that lets you take some super wide shots and it has these two modes now this is actually cool but the photos even in the non fisheye mode have this fisheye effect in the corners and the quality is kind of oakish just look at the tilted wall in the corner in this photo i mean i know some people like the whole fish eye effect but is this a feature you use every day i'm not sure you can't even shoot videos in this 150 degree mode now it's not just this i remember one plus hyped up the ultra wide angle sensor on the nine pro it was the class leading one over one point five six inches sony imx 766 sensor the oneplus 10 pro on the other hand has a new 50 megapixel sensor a samsung jn1 sensor that's a lot smaller in size at one over 2.76 inches now theoretically a bigger sensor captures more light wider dynamic range and lesser noise in low light i mean i took a few pictures from the 10 pro and 9 pro's ultra wide angle camera to get a better idea and in most photos i felt the 9 pros ultra wide angle shot looked a little sharper and more detailed c1 plus might have gone with the samsung j in one ultra wide angle sensor for the 150 degree wide-angle view but with the default mode set to 110 degrees and with the smallest sensor size it kind of defeats the whole purpose if you ask me another upgrade is the front camera which is now a 32 megapixel imx615 sensor compared to 16 megapixels on the 9 pro now this is kind of fine but it's strange that it's 20 22 and one pluses flagship phone cannot shoot videos in 4k from the front camera and we use the iphone a lot to shoot stories deals and whatnot and there are times when we need to shoot from selfie camera and we always do it in either 4k 30 fps or 4k 60 fps the new oneplus 10 pro front camera only shoots up to 1080p 30 fps not even 60 fps this is surprising because it can shoot freaking 8k videos from the rear camera the oneplus 10 pro also brings the latest chipset the new snapdragon 8 gen 1 with up to 12 gb lpd of 5 ram and up to 256 gb ufs 3.1 storage yeah no 512gb storage option if you're wondering now that apart these are flagship specs no doubt but if you've seen a xiaomi 12 pro video you'd know that i am a little skeptical of the agn one so i obviously had to run the cpu throttling test app now i've only done a couple of tests on the 10 pro but surprisingly it does better than the xiaomi 12 pro as you can see the phone throttled to 89 of its max performance and the performance numbers are pretty high so this is actually good but i noticed another thing a little bit of heating i checked the temperature of the phone after the 50 minutes test and it was around 40 41 degrees which is warm but not too much however there were times when i was doing a throttling test away from the camera and i thought the phone was getting a little hot here's a shot i captured from an iphone and you can see the temperature is hitting 45 degrees on the oneplus 10 pro which is on the higher side if you consider the delhi weather right now i also checked from the thermal camera that we have and you can see the phone was getting a little hot now i would not go ahead and say that the oneplus 10 pro has any heating issues because a lot of flagship phones which are powerful do get warm and i've only used this phone for a day but yeah when the indian version arrives i'll properly test it and see if it actually overheats the last upgrade in the oneplus 10 pro is the bigger 5000 mah battery which is great i'm all in for bigger batteries on flagships and there's also an 80 watt fast charger to go with it however the 80 watt charger here is actually a usb a proprietary super hook charger this is not the same 65 watt usb pd charger we got with the 9 and the 9 pro now no usb pd support means it can't be used to charge other devices that support usb pd charging for example i remember using the 65 watt warp charger to charge my macbook pro this 80 watt charger can't do that lastly the oneplus 10 pro in china comes with color rush 12 which is not a surprise in india it should come with oxygen os 12 which by the way is not very different to color rose 12 but i'll talk about that when the temperature launches in look after trying out the new one plus 10 pro i can tell you what's missing in this phone the bold oneplus like i said at the start whenever a new oneplus phone launched there was just a different vibe to it oneplus always seemed very confident about its products but the 10 pro it just does not feel the same see this is not a bad phone it's not extraordinary but it's fine the problem is the hype the oneplus boldness it's missing i mean it's clear that the oneplus 10 pro is not a big upgrade to the nine pro so if they want to hype it up in india they just need one thing aggressive pricing so you know what oneplus surprises will hit like if you agree with us and make sure to share this video so that reaches oneplus share this video right now also subscribe to our
