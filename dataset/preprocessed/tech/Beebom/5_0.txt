see this is an important video for you guys because this will play a big part when you're buying your next phone and also whether you should put a case on your Swanky new smartphone basically this video clears all the perception that people have on which phones have cheap parts which phones have costly parts we decided to find the repair cost of the most popular phones in India be it budget phones mid-ranges or flagships we research for the prices online we call the service centers and in some cases we even visited the service centers one thing to note these prices including GST but some companies also have 300 400 rupees as labor charges also the prices might vary a little because at times different service centers go different costs but overall these prices will give you a good idea so let's start the screen cost in Flagship phones so the screen cost of the iPhone 13 Pro is rupees 26 500 and weirdly the price is even higher for the iPhone 13 at RS 27 000. now in comparison the screen prices for Samsung flagships are way lower around 18K for the s22 ultra and around 12K for the s22 so kudos to Samsung especially for the ultra as it's a one lakh rupee P4 however things aren't the same for other Android flagships these are the screen prices for the OnePlus 10 Pro xiaomi 12 Pro IQ 9 Pro Vivo x80 Pro and the realme GT2 Pro and yeah these costs are high and I was honestly surprised with this the screen for the OnePlus 10 Pro and the xiaomi 12 Pro are specially expensive and for the xiaomi 12 proof you've got a lot of different prices from different service centers some say 28k something 24K some even saying 20K so I'm just gonna go with 24K anyway overall Samsung is looking pretty good here isn't it let's see the back glass prices now and this is where the horror stories of iPhone spare parts of costly are true the iPhone 13 Pros back glass costs rupees 40 000 iPhone 13's back glass cost 32 000 rupees yeah that's a lot of money now this is an area where Android flagships are just way better all these flagships come with the glass back and the back replacement cost is around three thousand four thousand rupees in fact I like how the s282's back glass only cost 3000 rupees considering the high price of the phone compared that to 40 000 on the iPhone now if you're an Android User you must be pretty happy but things are about to take a very different turn in the next few segments moving on the popular high-end smartphones under 15K and this list is xiaomi which has the highest price for the screen at 14 000 rupees once again in Samsung that has the lowest price for screen replacements its screen cost is half the price compared to other phones at around 6000 and are just really really good as for the back glass the prices are mostly affordable and once again it's xiaomi charging the highest price at 6000 rupees when the others are mostly around 3000 rupees Samsung's back glass price is again the most affordable it's just 1500 rupees when it comes to mid-ranges AKA phones under 30k the screen prices are more reasonable around five to seven K but xiaomi and Moto are the most expensive we are charging almost 9 000 for the replacement screen while the most affordable screen is from Oppo and Samsung yeah Samsung remains consistent in offering the most affordable spare parts now a lot of these phones don't have a back glass but the ones that do have a back replacement cost around 2000 rupees but realme is surprisingly affordable with the back glass only costing a thousand rupees we also check the motherboard cost of these mid-ranges because motherboard issues generally pop up in phones in this segment remember the Poco x2's motherboard getting dead after an update and people not finding the motherboard spare parts so these are the prices of the motherboard and they are obviously expensive because it's the motherboard but you can see that the price for the Note 2 and icon Neo 6 motherboard are very high at over 20 000 rupees see I think you'll be better off dumping that and getting a new phone instead lastly there's the budget smartphones under 20K now the screen replacement cost in budget smartphone ranges from 3.5 to 5K but there are two phones that are the most expensive redmi note 11 Pro screen replacement cost rupees 6200 and there's OnePlus charging 7000 for the not C2 light screen when others around 4000 rupees none of these phones have a glass back but we did check the motherboard prices now in the segment the motherboard prices remain under 10 000 with real me just over 10K but once again OnePlus is very expensive the note C2 light is a 20 000 rupee phone and the motherboard costs 14 000 yeah it just does not make sense to continue using the same phone the iPhone 6 motherboard price is the lowest which is a total flip from the Z6 Pro's High motherboard price overall there are four big takeaways from all this data one apple is not exactly the only company that offers this spare parts at crazy high prices OnePlus xiaomi and Vivo do the same even though their flagships don't exactly cost as much as the iPhone two Samsung's spare part costs are the lowest consistently in most of the segments and that is really good third in the budget and mid-range segment is spare parts of xiaomi phones and OnePlus phones cost the highest Ford some phones don't have this spare parts available for example the new iPhone SE does not have its back glass available anywhere and we are in service centers across different cities we also did not find the screen costs and back glass costs of newer phones like the Poco F4 look the aim of this video is to make sure that you guys are aware I mean you shouldn't be surprised when your phone screen breaks or the back glass breaks and the price is just too high you should be aware of the spare part cost so that when you buy a new phone you know all the details and it's your decision anyway this is important information
