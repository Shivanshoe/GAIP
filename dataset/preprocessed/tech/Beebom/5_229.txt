the 4 000 rupees android smartphone [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is from p1.com and you know what off late i've read a couple of really interesting reports when it comes to jio first a report that says jio plans to launch its android smartphone by december this year and second a report that says jio plans to launch fifty dollar four thousand rupees android smartphones now both of these reports confirm one thing and that's the fact that jio is finally launching its very own android smartphone i mean a jio android smartphone is not really a surprise because we did a video recently on jio where i said this you know what these partnerships make me think that jio will be entering the indian smartphone market maybe in 2021 i also talked about all the interesting investments in jio which make a lot of sense if you're making your android smartphone i mean google which is a great partner because android facebook again a great partner because instagram whatsapp and there's also qualcomm because well snapdragon chipsets so jio should be using these partnerships to make its very first android smartphone but what's really interesting is that the jio smartphone might be truly made in india now how truly made in india is something we'll know later on because a lot of things go into making an android smartphone but according to the bloomberg report reliance has gotten in touch with indian smartphone makers that are still active like lava international carbon mobiles along with local assembly companies like dixon technologies india do you know get the production capacity ready in india see right now there's a lot of anti-chinese sentiments and there's a huge push from the government for domestic manufacturing so it's clear reliance wants to make its smartphone as made in india as possible but yeah we'll see the report also reveals the approximate price of the jio smartphone and it's said to be around 4 000 rupees now this is interesting because we all know that india is a tough smartphone market to crack with so many phones launching every single week now let's face it right now the chinese manufacturers are the ones that are doing really well in the indian smartphone market but jio well geo has a different plan let me explain see according to neil shah who is the research director at counterpoint research geo is planning to use the blue ocean strategy now what's exactly blue ocean strategy see in the blue ocean strategy a company launches a different product at an amazingly low price to create a new market segment altogether and create new demand this makes the competition irrelevant now jio's product in this case is obviously the jio smartphone and i think this is great timing for that because the pandemic really has changed things everything shifted to phones be it education of businesses people are using their smartphones for a lot of different things and not everyone can afford a smartphone that costs seven thousand eight thousand or ten thousand rupees let alone higher in smartphones so the jio smartphone will be aimed at them the first time smartphone buyers who are looking for something very very affordable now to make this jio smartphone a success you will probably use its biggest weapon something that will help jio market this jio smartphone in the roots of india i'm talking about data see i'm calling data the biggest weapon because when jio arrived with free data back in 2016 it truly disrupted the telecom sector and then jio launched geofiber which brought lots of data at great prices and disrupted the broadband market so the free data is obviously going to be the biggest usp of jio smartphone i mean if you ask me i think that you will be offering a six month free internet plan or even a one year free entrant plan with the jio smartphone so that first time smartphone buyers actually go ahead and buy the jio smartphone plus what's interesting is that according to the bloomberg report jio is expecting to sell around 100 million to 200 million units of its your smartphone in the next two years which is a huge number but if it does happen maybe we'll see jio alongside the likes of samsung and xiaomi in the indian smartphone market share and well that's gonna be interesting look over the years smartphones under 5000 rupees haven't really changed a lot so if the jio smartphone at 4 000 rupees is actually good and if it does manage to sell say 100 million or 200 million units then yes it will definitely become the next big thing now if you're wondering if jio will become a threat to samsung xiaomi well from the looks of it no that does not seem likely at least with the very first jio smartphone but if jio does launch a lot more smartphones in the future well you never know things can get quite interesting well anyway what do you think of the jio smartphone do you think it will take the market by storm like jio did or how jiofiber disrupted the market tell us in the comment section below it's going to be very interesting also give this video a like if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it around subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos well that's me signing off thanks
