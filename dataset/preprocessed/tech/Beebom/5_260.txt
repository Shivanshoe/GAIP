[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is Paige from Iman calm and after the oneplus eggs back in 2015 one plus has again into the mid-range smartphone segment with the new oneplus not well this right here is the new one plus not and I know the reasoning behind the name the story but the nod name still in kind of seems a little weird to me but anyway that apart what's new with the oneplus not let's talk about it first up this is the Box to get the phone in and I think the box looks pretty cool with the whole not text is just different anyway something the boss will get the 30 watt warp adaptor the USBC cable this transparent silicon case one plus and North stickers this nod Welcome letter some manuals and obviously this the oneplus 5c I mean the oneplus not to be honest this blue color does remind me of the iPhone 5c and the Lumia phones from the past but I like it this color makes the one does not look different anyway this is a Gorilla Glass 5 bag but unlike the one person 8 or previous one plus flagship this is in matte glass finish its glossy but it's not a fingerprint magnet and for a phone that is a mid-range err this is a premium looking design I'll be honest with you it's not as nice as say the flagship want to say it with its frosted glass design and that especially because the frame here seems to be plastic but apart from that this should be one of the more premium phones in its price segment plus I like the in hand feel to the phone because unlike a lot of phones these days it's not massive like I don't want response it's narrow from the sides so it fits perfectly in my hands and it weighs around 85 grams which means it's not hefty or bulky I think it's just the right size coming to the functionality the alert slider is here which is great there's the USB C port and the single speaker on the bottom now one thing that's not present here is the headphone jack I was secretly hoping for it because this is an affordable one to spawn but it's not here so sad about that move on to the front the oneplus not features a six point four inch AMOLED panel with 90 hoods refresh rate and it's almost bezel s and I like it it is what this bigger punch hole since there are two cameras here but apart from that the display here looks pretty nice I mean it's to use a laminate with popping colors and tanks to 90 Hertz the UI just seems very fluid including even the live wallpaper now I haven't used it not extensively yet but I did notice that display might be a tad bit low on the brightness side I mean it's not bad or anything but yeah I'll be doing a brightness comparison in a full review just to be sure on the front you get the in display fingerprint scanner which is super fast and there's also super fast face and lock so yeah you're pretty sorted on the unlocking front under the hood the one-person audace has been leaked so many times comes with the snapdragon 765 G chipset with up to 12 GB lpddr4 X Ram and up to 256 GB of u FS 2.1 storage now the specs here are pretty good for a mid-range err I mean we aren't allowed to show you any benchmarks from the phone but we know that the 765 G is a capable chipset and it's better than 730 or 720 G having said that it's no match to the 865 or even the snapdragon 855 plus so we'll see how it compares to other phones in a full review after pub G mobile the phone supports HD and high graphics which is a little strange because I was expecting HDR ultra spot-on the soft in front of one does not comes with oxygen OS 10.5 on top of Android 10 and it's the clean bloat free oxygen OS experience that everyone really likes there's one change though instead of one plus phone and messages apps you get Google's phone and messages app as you can see I'm not sure why this change but it does not really happen the experience so that's fine after the issues I talked about in our offices you know as video they still Romania there's still no scheduled dock mode there's no dock mode toggle I know the dock mode toggle has arrived in the beta oxygen OS builds but it's still not here in the stable version and I was kind of hoping for that with the oneplus naught but yeah that's not there apart from that oxygen OS is a clean and nice experience so no complaints moving on to the cameras the nod brings the same camera setup as the one plus eight which is great really you get the 48 megapixel Sony IMX 586 sensor an 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens a 5 megapixel depth sensor and a 2 megapixel macro lens and you get all the features you expect from the camera app in one performs there is one thing missing though and that's 4k at 60fps video recording support now let me show you the camera samples in a review but it's the one plac'd camera setup so I am expecting good results the front cameras are interesting too I said cameras because you get a 32 megapixels sony imx6 one-sixth sensor and an 8 megapixel 105 degree ultra wide sensor i have been encouraging ultra wide-angle sensors on the front and I really liked it on the reading with 6 Pro and I liked it here so yeah I'm gonna test it out extensively in the next few days lots of selfies for me now surprisingly the one person odds front camera supports 4k 60fps video recording while the rear camera does not how strange is that lastly there's the battery the phone comes with a fairly good 4115 image battery and I didn't like the fact that there's 30 what warp charge they are the same charger that you get with the 1 + 8 + 8 Pro now the time we're shooting this video we don't know the price of the oneplus naught but I'm expecting it to be around 25k and at that price this could be a good deal I mean yes it's still very early days and there's a lot of testing to do but from the looks of it the oneplus not brings a lot of promise with it see I like the design the display is AMOLED 90 Hertz the cameras are the same as a 1 + 8 and you get dual selfie cameras the Android experience is arguably the best you can get and there's warp charge with a decent battery size so like I said promising but there's a lot to test ranging from the 765 g2 the battery life and yeah I will be comparing it to other phones once we get to know the price so if you're planning to buy the oneplus naught I'd suggest you to wait for our full review because it's coming soon well those are my thoughts on the new oneplus nod and as you can see I've already put in my SIM cards in this phone and yeah I'm going to test out every single thing in this one extensively so stay tuned for a full review also make sure to comment down
