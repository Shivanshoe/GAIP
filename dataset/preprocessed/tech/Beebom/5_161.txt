[Music] [Applause] [Music] so i've been using the oneplus 9 as my daily driver for almost a week now and i was actually working on a review and then the price was announced it rupees 49 triple nine also at the event one plus launched india's specific brand new oneplus 9r and that kind of made me wonder which of these phones made more sense the oneplus 9 or the oneplus 9r see in india oneplus phones are popular because they're supposed to be value for money premium phones and people online have been talking about how the new oneplus 9 is overpriced how the oneplus 9 actually has a few downgrades so does the oneplus 9r actually make more sense than the oneplus 9 well let's talk about it so first up this is the new oneplus 9r no it's not this is actually the oneplus 8t but you know what the oneplus 9r and oneplus 80 are basically the same phones here are the specs of both these phones side by side so as you can see the back of the new 9r has a new color and a sort of a different camera design but the back says the same thing 48 megapixel ois 14 to 26 millimeters yeah the 9r does not come with the hasselblad certification so it's pretty much the same as the 80. anyway that apart here are all the specs and clearly both the phones have almost the exact same dimensions and weight the same 120 hertz amoled same camera same battery charging speed now the one difference here is that the 9r comes with the new snapdragon 870 chipset scratch the new really because the snapdragon 870 is basically the snapdragon 865 plus or basically 865. yes it's like manufacturers wanted a brand new chipset for the 30 to 40k price segment and qualcomm just casually went ahead and renamed the snapdragon 865 to snapdragon 870 yeah it's just strange i mean here are the details of the snapdragon 870 versus the snapdragon 865 plus and the snapdragon 865 and as you can see they're basically the same chipsets the snapdragon 870 has a max clock speed of 3.2 gigahertz while the 865 plus has a max clock speed of 3.1 gigahertz you have that's a difference of 0.1 gigahertz now the oneplus 8t comes with a snapdragon 865 but honestly the 870 865 865 plus they are basically the same chipsets with only a slight difference of clock speeds so the oneplus 8t is basically the oneplus 9r variant and if you compare the oneplus 9 against the oneplus 8t we should get a good idea of which makes more sense the oneplus 9 or the oneplus 9r now we've all been hearing some chat online about how the oneplus 9 actually downgrades on a few things even though this is priced at 50 000 rupees so what exactly are the downgrades well first up the oneplus 9 actually has a plastic frame yep this side here is actually plastic i mean this is strange because the oneplus 8t has an aluminium frame design and even though we don't have the 9r it should be the same as the 80. anyway another downgrade in the oneplus 9 is the fact that it does not have ois yes this is a big one i mean if i remember correctly all of the oneplus flagships from the oneplus 2 back in 2015 have had ois even the more budget-friendly oneplus not has ois so it's very strange the oneplus 9 skips out in the ois even though the oneplus 8t the oneplus 9 i have it now os is actually an important feature because it not only helps with stable videos it also helps the camera capture sharp low light shots by keeping the camera stable even when your hands are a little shaky so the lack of ois is definitely a big miss especially in a premium phone like this now apart from these downgrades in the oneplus 9 there are a few important differences between the oneplus 9 india variant and the oneplus 9 global variant that you guys should know first up i'm talking about 5g bands so here are the 5g bands in the oneplus 9 india variant and here are the 5g bands in the us version of the oneplus 9 now see the difference the oneplus 9t just has two 5g bands n41 and n78 while the oneplus 9 in us has support for more than 15 5g bands this is a big big difference also if you're wondering about the 5g bands in the oneplus 9r well there's only one as you can see so one less than the oneplus 9. now i think this is very important because even though 5g is not here in india the higher number of 5g bands would mean better possibility of 5g support whenever 5g rolls out here in india now another thing that the indian weight into the oneplus 9 cuts down is wireless charging see the global version of the oneplus 9 supports 15 watt fast wireless charging and the oneplus 9 variant just does not support wireless charging i mean this is kind of sad why one plus why did you have to remove this in india see personally wireless charging is a feature that i want to see in more and more premium phones in india so yeah this kind of makes me sad i mean if you think about it the oneplus 9 is the successor to the oneplus 8t but there are only two upgrades the snapdragon triple eight processor and the new main and ultra wide angle cameras the rest of the stuff be the display the battery the charger the size and weight all remain pretty much the same now if you ask me personally i can give you an answer to the whole oneplus 9 versus oneplus 9r debate right away see i think the oneplus 9r just makes more sense you want to know why first up the upgrades just aren't big enough in the oneplus 9 see i know the snapdragon 8 is the latest flagship chipset and yes it brings a performance boost but it's not a big deal when compared to the snapdragon 865 i mean here the antutu scores yes the 9 does well but the 865 isn't too far behind and the 870 and the 9r with its slightly overclocked course should do slightly better in fact i have used the oneplus 8t as my daily driver in the past and i've been using the oneplus 9 as my daily driver right now and they both are fast and snappy like every other oneplus flagship phone it's hard to you know make a difference here as for the upgrades on the camera i compared the cameras on the oneplus 9 and the oneplus 8t and the photos from both these phones don't have a huge difference yes the oneplus 9 does take more color accurate shots at times probably due to the hasselblad partnership but is that a big deal i'm not too sure i think both these phones take decent one plus like photos and i personally would be fine with any one of them now the ultra wide angle lens in the oneplus 9 is upgraded too but like i said in a oneplus 9 pro video it really hasn't been as impressive as the 50 megapixel sensor sounded to be now if i have to choose between the oneplus 9 and the oneplus 9r i'd go with the oneplus 9r without any doubt c1 plus has been famous for two things really the overall experience and the value for money factor and i think the oneplus 9r is more in line with these points yes it's basically the oneplus 8t with a new paint job but it's more affordable and it's definitely value for money now one thing i'd like to add here is that there is nothing wrong with the oneplus 9 it's just that i feel oneplus wanted to keep the price at 49.99 while also packing it with the latest snapdragon triple a chipset which reports have suggested is priced higher so i think oneplus had to cut down on other things like wireless charging telephoto lens ois etc etc to keep the price below 50k but the problem is these are actually important aspects from a consumer point of view well i want to know your opinion on this which phone do you think makes more sense the oneplus 9 or the oneplus 9r just comment down below also give this video a like if
