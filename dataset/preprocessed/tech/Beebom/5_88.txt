[Applause] [Music] hey guys this is from bishopville.com and today i have something insanely cool to show you guys this is the lg cine beam 4k uhd laser projector the hu810 pw and this is just really really cool i mean i personally never used a 4k laser projector in my life and this actually blew my mind when it comes to picture quality the features and also its price now let me be clear that i'm going to divide this video into three sections number one the hardware number two the picture quality and number three the features let's begin first of all this is the projector here's how it looks and i know it's just a white box but it's a premium looking clean white entertainment box that will go with any home decor the front obviously has the lens and hiding underneath the lens are the tires to set the focus and another dial to set the zoom of the lens the right side of the projector has the shift dials the dials for both horizontal and vertical shift so that you can move the projection sideways or up and down like this now you can set up the projector on a table or you can mount it on a ceiling i mean the bottom of the projector has these mounting holes and i also noticed the adjustable legs as for the ports all of them are on the back there are three hdmi ports with one of them being an hdmi 2.1 port that supports arc erc as well as alm aka auto low latency mode for gaming there's also two usb a 2.0 ports an optical output and an ethernet port now the port selection is good and this is decently portable i mean you can lift it and move it around but at 11 kgs it's not as lightweight as i was hoping it to be now all that is fine but the most interesting thing about this projector is the picture quality let me show the specs first because they're pretty insane so this is a dlp dual laser 4k projector with a native 4k usb resolution hdr10 and hlg support 97 dc ip3 a very high contrast ratio and brightness of up to 2700 lumens now this is a laser projector and that means it has a longer life up to 20 000 hours also they're built in five watt plus five or stereo speakers in so like i said the specs are insane and like the fact that this supports a projection size of 40 inches to 300 inches to give you an idea you can get a projection of 150 inches when you have a distance of say 14 to 22 feet you can get a projection of 100 inches when you have a distance of 9 to 15 feet and around 40 inches the distance of three to six feet see basically you need that large huge area to get that 300 inch massive projection now coming to my favorite section of this video the picture quality it's just really really good see like i said this is the first time i'm using a 4k laser projector the picture quality made me feel like i was actually watching a tv is that good i mean here's a video playing from the projector and the image quality is just fantastic all 4k videos look sharp and crisp but i even noticed that it plays well with 1080p 720p or even sdr content apart from that there's hdr 10 support and hdr content just looks beautiful i tried out a few hdr shows and movies on netflix and they looked incredible especially our planet with stunning visuals now one thing i wanted to check with this projector was the plants because almost every project i've used in the past don't really show the blacks and this is another area where this is pretty good see the blacks are not as deep as you'd find on a display but it's very good for a projection apart from this there are so many features that optimize the picture quality here this adaptive contrast which intelligently changes contrast in dark and bright scenes there's irish mode that adapts the colors and brightness depending on the time of the day to be the most realistic and comfortable for the user's eyes you also get lg's true motion feature which brings motion smoothing and you know what they have different picture modes i found the standard mode to be the best but i think the different setups the different modes like vivid cinema will make sense there's also special modes like hdr a game mode a filmmaker mode in turns off any special setting to deliver the picture as the director intended look you'll have to play with the settings to get the best picture quality out of this but trust me when i say that this will bring you great picture quality also to make it clear like most projectors this too brings the best picture quality in a dark room which has a nice clean background but i also tried out in daytime in a bright room and was fairly good now if you remember i mentioned built-in speakers and you know what the speakers in this projector are surprisingly loud [Music] i mean the sound from these dual speakers will easily feel a room but that's pretty much about it there's no bass and the quality is kind of decent-ish but yeah there's no distortion at max volume so that's good now moving on to the what can you actually do with this 4k laser projector section is actually a lot of things you can do first of all the lg cinebeem hu810 pw comes with lg's full fledged web os platform they have the same web os you've probably seen on lg tvs and it comes with a popular lg magic remote with backlit keys now webos here means that you don't even need a separate source for this projector you can turn it on and you get all the popular streaming apps like netflix youtube hotstar apple tv and you can just start streaming content there's also an app store here so you can always download the apps you want plus it is web os and that means there's support for google assistant alexa apple homekit and there's also support for miracast devices as well as apple airplay now you must have noticed that i did not say chromecast because it's not mentioned in the support pages but i tried casting youtube from multiple android phones and work just fine i also tested airplay and it's very seamless you know what there's no lag whatsoever when casting with an android phone or an iphone it's very good i mean i even played bgmi with the projector and the experience was so good with no lag and almost no latency so yeah you can play mobile games on this huge screen with this projector on mobile games apart we also did some proper gaming on this projector so we connected the ps5 with hdr mode on via hdmi and set the picture quality to gamer now here's cod cold war from the ps5 in action and we played a bunch of games like miles morales tekken 7 and the experience was always awesome first of all the picture quality as you can see is fantastic very detailed and sharp with very good color reproduction i mean there is a bit of color loss but i think it's fine since at the end of the day it is a projection now when it comes to lag or latency there was no lag whatsoever and as for latency i felt the project accurately released both sound and video controller actions without any delay now it's not just ps5 we also projected some pc games via one of our gaming laptops and the experience once again was really really good we played far cry 6 and for the horizon 5 with the projector connected and the picture quality was again just awesome i mean here's far cry 6 in action and it just looks so good it's amazing that this is a projection now here is for the horizon 5 with all its details and glorious graphics and once again the projection is very detailed with good brightness balancing and there is no lag in the gameplay apart from games you can also use this lg projector to you know showcase slides documents and whatnot although i mainly focused on entertainment because obviously overall here's the bottom line the lg cinebeam hu 810 pw 4k projector is just seriously impressive see it's a 4k laser projector which means low maintenance long life and as you saw very good picture quality moreover it has web os and all of its features making it very versatile look this project is for people who have a huge projection room and they want a huge display especially since this can go up to 300 inches also this is for people who have a lot of cash respect this lg projector cost rupees 3 lakh 80 000 in india which is a lot i mean this is a 4k laser projector so obviously it's expensive but if you can spend this much you will not be disappointed with the lg cinebeam hu810 pw it's actually insanely cool well that price apart it is cool isn't it i mean it's super cool comment below if you think this really cool projector is cool comment down below also give this video like make sure to share it and
