[Applause] [Music] okay this is beta be more calm and this is the one plus eight and this is the me ten now I know there's a price difference of a piece five thousand between these phones and an 8oz of the paypal difference if you consider the sick GB variant of the one plus eight but I know a lot of people are confused between these two phones so I've been testing these out extensively in the last few weeks so it's time to put them to test these are my thoughts on one plus eight versus meet in so this is the one plus eight and the meat end side by side and honestly there's no doubt that both of these phones are premium high-end flagship smartphones the oneplus say it might not be the true blue flagship that's the eighth probe but it looks the same so yeah it looks like a flasher both have the curve good in the glass five front and back all the meeting has wireless charging support and oneplus does not anyway the both have the aluminum frame and both of these looks stunning but there are some key differences the one per se it has a more matte finish thanks to its frosted glass and this new color looks gorgeous the median on the other hand also has a great color but this has this mirror refinish that looks striking although it's a big big fingerprint magnet she looks are subjective so to each their own but I like to want to say design more because of its more compact and more handy form factor so if you compare the one plus eight is small in size as you can see the dimensions and it weighs a lot lighter 180 grams compared to 280 grams of the mate in that's a difference of 28 grams and honestly you can feel the difference I fished it one plus eight from the meeting and it felt way better in the hands because it's just lightweight more compact and just more comfortable let me again is the premium feeling hole but it's also big and bulky Plus this camera hump on the meter just gets in the way every time you hold the phone yeah the one that a - has a minor camera Bob but the meetin's camera Bob is huge other things to know about the design of these phones is the fact that both of these don't have an IP rating and there's the fact that both of these have duels in slots but no microSD slot and apart from that both of these phones have steel speakers but in my testing I found it the meatiest speakers are just a tad bit more powerful saw a big difference but ya see the median has an equally powerful speaker on the bottom and on the top so you get a more steel your sound experience so one plus a two has pretty good speakers but its top speaker which is in the earpiece here is an as loud or impactful as the middle speaker so the median speaker is a little better comparatively when it comes to display both these fools come with F HD Plus AMOLED displays with ninety hoods refresh rate and they both have the punch hole in the left top corner well as you see both these holes look almost present less and honestly just stunning it's not a pleasure using these displays because the 90s refresh rate makes for a smooth experience because it has that both these phones have great AMOLED panels the median display is marginally blighter but it's a very small difference apart from that the one plus eight display has a cool at all while the Xiaomi flagship go for a more warmer tone you can also changes in the display settings so you can have the tone you want anyway if you ask me I think both of these displays are great they look beautiful and I think they are on par part of that both of these phones have optical in display fingerprint scanners and just super fast face and locks so biometric authentication isn't going to be a problem in any of these phones now let's stop performance like the display the 1 / 8 and the meet and are neck to neck when it comes to under the hood specs snapdragon 865 you have a three point of storage up to 12 gigs of lpddr4 Ram yep top of the line specs and the benchmark showdown as you can see the benchmarks are top-notch and rules now like I said I have you both these phones as my daily driver and you know what I haven't really faced any lab or issues at all with either of these phones I've also played a lot of pubsey mobile operator these days all these phones and there hasn't been any problems I also did not find any heating issues so yeah that's pretty good so the performance is flagship II on both of these phones but the difference comes in the software experience see me 11 on meat and does not have any ads and it uses Google's apps as default so not things like phone dialer the browser but it's still not the premium experience I expected the medium probably lot of more than 10 apps and I'm not even including things like me credit of me babe this is disappointing on the other hand oxygen OS is the clean load free experience everyone wants on a flagship phone I mean it's not perfect it has an issue like dunno or the dog mode option but it's definitely the better experience when compared to me by 11 next up its camera time on paper the meetin is obviously the more powerful camera phone it's called on an 8 megapixel camera versus the 48 megapixel sensor on one with it but that's it I think the list is pretty evenly matched anyway we all know that meta pictures don't really means better performance so let me show you how these won't compare will in daylight both these smooth stay good shot but let me tell you straight away that Newton's hundred eight megapixel sensor Trump's the one person it's 48 bit of pixel sensor or most occasions immediate photos always have more detail I mean let us zoom in here you have to see the difference now here's another example and again let's just zoom in yeah the difference is pretty apparent but it's much of the details so worthless photos also seem to be soft when compared to the meat in photos now the median has one issue does tend to up the contrast at times taking a darker photo admitting the important colors like in this photo but mostly I found it to be better than the ones were saying you know like - it's a similar case the weekend easily beats - one plus eight is for the brighter sharper and more detail now one thing I did like about the one plus eight though it's the fact that in super low light it automatically triggers the night mode whereas in the median you have to go to the actual night mode so that's a good addition from one plus anyway the story is different wrinkles in ultra wide-angle lens check out some ultra wide-angle shots from these phones and you'll notice that the medians 13-megapixel ultra wide angle sensor just ups the contrast a bit too much at times and it's also a bit too soft around the edges you want to say it's under what I am the shots sometimes don't have enough detail but apart from that overall I think the one plus eight wins is wrong about this booth has a macro lens and to be honest I don't really care about macro and porn because they're mostly bad as is the case here but if you have to know well the meetin's macro shots are definitely better not by a big margin but as this photo tells you it's better on the video from the meeting can shoot 8k video yeah I'm not sure I care about that enough anyway here's a 4k video shot from both these phones they both the full scatter really stable videos thanks to it but I shot this during the golden hour and the meetin's video has caught the colorscience ride and just look at the road in the meat and video it's way more detailed so yeah the oneness it's video performance is average then they all selfie cameras to 80 megapixel sensor or the me 10 versus the 16 megapixel sensor on the 1 plus 8 well check out some selfies yeah the one per se it captures better selfies I mean you can notice the smoothening in the meat and selfie right now selfie for me to just have this yellow bhavish tones which are not a panel overall on the camera front i think it's pretty close the one proceed does better in some categories while the meat end does better in some categories but if you want to pick one on the camera front I'll go the meat 10 because of the main camera and its video capabilities lastly there's the battery the 1 + 8 has a 4300 image battery with 30 watt while charging compared to a larger 4750 image battery on the me 10 that support study 1 Wyatt as well as a wireless charging the meetin already seems better here but I'm all about details see in my usage of the pool the meetin's battery perform better but only slightly see I usually go to screen panel 6 and half-10 us at max on the meat then when the word proceed also offer 6 ours and maybe a little more screen on time on average which is also great and pretty clothes I also did a pub details that played pub demo by for an R and both these phones and the 1+8 lost 90% battery while the meter lost 18 percent battery and I was playing on HDR extreme so yeah that is close on the charger foreboding smooth come to 30 watt charges in the box the 1 plus 8 charges from 10 to 100 % in 65 minutes which is pretty fast for a whole thousand 300 image battery but what's interesting is the fact of the meeting which has a bigger 4750 image battery also takes 65 minutes to fully charge and that's pretty impressive that's probably due to the fact that the 31 charge of with the meat then is the USB PD charger but yeah it is impressive nonetheless the wireless charging speed which arm is 30 what why the charging is also super impressive while it's charging to charges the meetin fully in an AR and yeah I love it well the meetin has been what we were wireless charging support so you can charge other devices like beer earbuds so the meetin is obviously more feature pack on the charging front well that kind of brings us to the end of the comparison so it's time for the verdict which one should you go for the 1+8 or the me 10 but both of these foods have flagship specs and flash of features like ninety Hertz AMOLED the flagship Snapdragon chipset premium designs steel speakers and a lot of other things but they each have their own advantages see the one thing it costs less brings a sleeker and lightweight design that's way more comfortable and it comes with oxygen OS which is definitely a more refined and clean UI experience the median on the other hand has a superior main camera and a unique feature like while it's charging on for now if you ask me which one I would go for it's a close call but I'd personally prefer the one +8 simply because I'm not okay with the size and heft of the meet and it's a big phone and hefty port and the fact that oxygen OS is just better than me why having said that the meetin is still a good choice to go for if you want better cameras and wireless charging and if you live with the big size of the phone and the mean white glow to it well that was our comparison of the 1 plus 8 and the me 10 and I know a lot of you people are wondering how does the meeting compare to the 1 plus 8 pro well I'll be testing this out when the ones that's a pro arrives to us so stay tuned for that anyway what do you think of these two phones which one would you pick tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share with your friends who are like to buy any of these
