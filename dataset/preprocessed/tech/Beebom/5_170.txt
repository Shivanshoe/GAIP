[Applause] [Music] hey guys i'm akshay from vwoom.com and this here is the all new msi summit e50 yeah this is one of the new business and productivity laptops from msi and it is packed with features aimed at those use cases so what's this laptop all about well as a business user there are four things you'll be looking for portability consistent performance security and privacy and yeah battery life so does the msi summit e15 have everything you need well i've been using this laptop for over a week now let's check it out first up in our list of four things is portability and the msi summit e15 is a pretty portable laptop weighing in at around 1.8 kg and just 1.69 centimeters of thickness as you can see the design is really minimal and clean there's no unnecessary rgb lighting or huge cooling vents and there's also this new msi logo here which is more minimal i mean i like it but what about you do you like this new minimal msi logo or the dragon emblem tell us in the comments anyway speaking of the design the msi summit e15 also comes with this really nice 15.6 inch display with a by 9 aspect ratio now we have the full hd touch screen version of the laptop here but there's a non-touch option available as well either way this display is nice and crisp and colors look quite nice on it look i prefer laptops with taller aspect ratios but this is definitely more suited for opening apps side by side you know for productivity so yeah design wise this laptop is quite nice but moving on the next most important thing for any business user is definitely consistent performance i mean you need a laptop that's fast and can get the job done but you also need a laptop that can keep up that performance all day long the msi summit t15 comes with the latest 11th gen intel core i7 processors paired with 16 gigs of ram nvidia gtx 1650 ti graphics and a 1tb pcie gen 4 ssd you also get an additional ssd slot but that's pcie gen 3 so it will be slower than the default ssd anyway what that means is this laptop can easily handle everything you throw at it whether it's productivity apps and absolute ton of tabs in your browser and so much more now i don't spend a lot of time with specialized software like the ones you might use in a business such as investment banking or architecture etc however i did test out some benchmarks on this laptop and the scores are pretty great here as you'd expect in pc mark 10 the msi summit e15 scores 4736 points so yeah you can obviously expect good performance in all your specialized software with this laptop also since this laptop uses a pcie gen 4 ssd i was really interested in checking out the read write speeds here as well and this laptop basically blows the competition out of the water here are the read write scores for the msi summit e15 for sequential read write speeds as well as 4k read write speeds in comparison with laptops like the thinkpad x1 dell xps 15 yeah these speeds are pretty amazing aren't they moving on you also get a wide selection of ports on here basically covering every use case you might have the msi summit e15 comes with two thunderbolt 4 ports an hdmi port a combo audio jack two usb 3.2 gen 2 type a ports and a micro sd card reader so yeah the port selection is on point with this laptop there's also support for bluetooth 5.1 here as well as wi-fi 6 on board which is great anyway let's talk about the keyboard here now this keyboard is pretty standard with a white backlight that you can adjust with the f80 thankfully there's a full-size arrow key layout which is definitely something i want in more laptops so the keyboard on the msi summit 15 is pretty comfortable and thanks to the 1.5 mm travel it's fairly tactile as well plus it's not noisy which is definitely a plus point for office environments but since this is a business laptop there are some special keys on the keyboard as well for example there are shortcut keys to disable the webcam switch between performance profiles and this f12 key that's quite good so basically you can lay down the msi summit e15 completely flat like this and once you've done that you can press this f12 key and flip the screen this way you can show content on your screen to someone else without having to turn your laptop around yeah this is neat and it feels tailor-made for business users and boardroom meetings also these days a lot of work is being done over video calls and meetings right so i thought we should test out the webcam and my quality on this laptop as well so i'm recording this clip using the msi summit e15s webcam and mic now i think the video quality here is okay and at par with most of the laptops but tell us in the comments what you think about the video and my quality on the msi summit e50 apart from that you can use the sound tune feature here to enable noise cancellation if you are in a noisy environment which is great that said i also wanted to talk about the speakers here so the speakers here are on the bottom and i mean they are serviceable but not anything great they sure get the job done for video calls and such but there's no base here so if you're thinking of watching movies or listening to music you'll probably want to get speakers for that [Music] [Applause] moving on as a business user you probably have a lot of sensitive data on your laptop right i mean we usually don't talk about security and privacy features on laptops but since this is a business device it has some interesting features here as well first you get a tpm 2.0 module inside the laptop this trusted platform module means you can save data and password encryption keys in your laptop which is great because as a business user you probably have a lot of sensitive data that you don't want just anyone to get their hands on moreover the laptop brings windows hello support with both fingerprint and ir face recognition to unlock your system or use the built-in 5.2 key to log into compatible web services like google which is really good the laptop also comes with an led indicator on the webcam so you can know when an app is accessing the camera on your laptop plus the msi summit e15 has this cool feature that locks down the usb and microsd card ports when the laptop is locked this way you can ensure that no one can hack into your laptop when it's locked even if they are able to plug in a usb device or an sd card into it so yeah that's quite nice so yeah this laptop offers all the security and privacy features you might need in a business machine but what about the battery well the msi summit e15 comes with a pretty chunky 82 watt battery inside with sleek chassis plus thanks to the new 11 gen processors which are more energy efficient the laptop does last quite long in my usage the msi summit 15 lasts around 9 hours on a single charge with mixed use that includes watching videos browsing the internet and writing articles etc on the laptop now 9rs isn't the best battery life you can get from a laptop but this is still quite good plus the laptop charges by usbc so that's nice as well now msi isn't just offering the summit e15 for business users in fact the company has a whole lineup here for example if you don't need a dedicated gpu you can get the msi prestige evo range of laptops which is an intel evo laptop now in case you don't know intel evo is a certification that intel gives to laptops that meet some high bars of quality on intel evo laptops you get the latest intel processors up to three times faster wi-fi at least nine hours of battery life iris xz graphics thunderbolt 4 ports instant weak and more basically interleaved laptops are pretty much guaranteed to be really fast and really good anyway moving on there's also the msi modern series that you can check out for business use you get the same iris xd graphics here but you can get an nvidia mx450 gpu if you need slightly higher graphical capabilities on your professional laptop look the msi summit e15 is a business laptop and it's price like one at rupees one lakh seventy nine thousand nine hundred and ninety however at that price it checks off all the important things about a professional laptop it's quite portable it has a nice consistent performance security and privacy features and a decent battery life so what do you think about the msi summit e15 let us know in the comments also
