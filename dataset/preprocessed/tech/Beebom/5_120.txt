[Music] country [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is amion.com and samsung's new foldable smartphones have arrived in india the galaxy z4 3 which is an exciting smartphone with all of its new upgrades and there's also the galaxy z flip 3 which is packed with all of these cool new upgrades now both of these are interesting foldable smartphones but let me get straight to the point i have made the switch to the galaxy z flip 3. let me tell you why see there are actually two reasons why i switched to this phone first up the z53 has launched an indian rupees 84 triple nine and it brings quite a few important upgrades over the original galaxy z flip which was if you remember initially launched at one lakh 999 rupees so you know what this means right this means that samsung is bringing its foldable smartphones to the mainstream i mean at 85k i can see a lot of people getting interested in this foldable smartphone especially with all the specs and features that it packs and yes i'm one of those people who is interested now the second reason why i've switched to the galaxy z53 is because i've never really used a foldable phone i mean i've tried out foldable phones in the past but putting in my sim card using it as my daily driver that's something i'm doing for the first time with the z flip 3. so the question is how has my experience been with my first ever foldable smartphone well i'd say my experience has been interesting now let me make clear that you guys probably know all about the specs of the z53 it's got some really good upgrades the cover screen is bigger there's a 120 hertz amoled panel now snapdragon 8 with 5g powers the new flip even in india as for the cameras and the battery they remain the same as the z-flip although the z-flip 3 does not come with the charger in the box and it supports only 15 watt fast charging anyway you guys know all of the specs but i want to talk about my foldable smartphone experience here because i know a lot of you guys have these simple yet practical questions around foldable smartphones before you you know make the switch from usual phones foldable phones now the biggest question mark is around the durability of these phones now according to samsung the z53 has what it calls armor aluminium on the frame and the hinge making it a lot stronger the flexible display is also said to be 80 more durable with a new pre-installed screen protector that's harder apart from that the exterior has gorilla glass vectors and this whole design is now ipx8 rated which means it can survive immersion at a maximum depth of 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes now that's awesome because this phone is water resistance but do note it's ipx8 not ip68 so it's not dust resistance look when i started using the z53 i was a little careful around it especially because you get this prompt while setting up the phone it's like the do's and don'ts with the flip and yeah it makes you cautious so yeah i did take note of these points but apart from these points i've gotten more casual with the phone especially because it seems very well built there's no weird creaks or anything when i open up the flip or even close it and yeah this whole design just feels more solid and one thing is i was able to you know flip the phone with just one hand with some difficulty as you can see but yeah if you have bigger hands you might be able to do it but if you have smaller hands you will need to use two hands anyway this whole flip form factor brings some interesting use cases and i know there's a question around them being a little gimmicky but i personally found them useful so i love the fact that i can just fold the screen halfway place it on a surface and you know do things like making video calls video calls is one thing i've loved doing on the galaxy z53 i mean i can just place it like this and just talk without worrying about holding the phone in my hands all the time it's also super handy for photos and videos first off it's very useful when i'm shooting reels for instagram page and also storage because most of our instagram stories is me holding one phone to shoot and holding another phone or other gadget in my other hand to show off the flip 3 solves that problem for me especially because i can just hit the phone like a tripod now apart from this when you have the phone halfway open flex mode gets active which means some samsung apps like the camera app or the gallery app get divided into two for better usage also one cool thing is i can just flip the phone open to take calls like this and even end calls like this yeah that's cool as for using the flip tree as a regular full-fledged smartphone it's quite usual which is actually a good thing well first off you get an amoled panel that's brighter than the last gen it's also way more smooth thanks to the higher refresh rate and like any other samsung amulet it looks stunning it's also a tall 20s to 9 screen which is not a problem but i did notice some games not stretching out to cover the full screen by default as you can see bgmi works like this on the flip 3 by default like i said but the full screen stretch option fixes this so it's not an issue however the tornado of this phone means that the power button is placed higher and the volume rocker even above it so accessing them hasn't been very easy but hopefully i'll get used to it now i know you're wondering yes you can still feel the crease in the middle of the screen it's also visible at angles but it does not affect the overall usability of this phone so i'm honestly pretty okay with it as when the flip 3 is folded like this well first of all it becomes so easy to carry i mean this goes into all sorts of different pockets without any problems in fact i'm always worried when i'm using a big phone because i have this fear of the phone falling off from my pocket well i was more assured with the flip 3 because it's small and nice now one thing to note is that in this mode the phone is double its thickness but i don't think you'll have issues putting it in your pockets unless you have you know super tight jeans on so yeah that's something no in this mode you can also use this secondary cover display which is more useful now well it's got a bigger screen and you get these different widgets there's the clock where you can set different styles and there's a music control widget weather alarm timer you also get detailed notifications here not just an icon which is good now these notifications are not actionable but most of the time i open up my phone to check the notifications so i just check the cover display on the flip 3 for that now and by the way you can also use the cover screen to take selfies from the main camera it's cool but i would have liked an easier way to access the cameras from the cover screen than going to the camera app and then hitting this icon to use it look overall if you asked my opinion about using the galaxy z flip 3 as my daily driver i would say it's a pretty good experience i mean i've only switched to this phone a couple of days back but i plan on using it for a long period to get a good idea about foldable smartphones so far i'll just put this way this flip foldable form factor makes the z flip 3 an exciting smartphone to use you know what it hits me with a lot of nostalgia flip phones it's just so much fun to fold and unfold it does not seem fragile which is my biggest concern and it's useful for people like me who shoot a lot of videos on their phone now all that is great plus i switched to the galaxy z5 because all of the other basics of this phone seem good well the display looks pretty awesome the performance so far has been top notch the cameras are the best but they seem good enough the battery life is something i am concerned with but i have gotten around five hours of screen on time so it's decent dish now these are obviously aspects that deserve a more long-term testing and i'll be doing just that but it's clear that samsung wants to bring foldables to the mainstream with the galaxy z5 and i think the company has succeeded on that front it's definitely gotten the attention of everyone wanting to buy a premium flagship smartphone well i'm enjoying using the galaxy z flip 3 as my daily driver but yeah this is not a review this was more of my experience so if you have any
