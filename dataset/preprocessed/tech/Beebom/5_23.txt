the new xiaomi pad 5 versus the ipad 9gen you guys wanted this and we are here to do a detailed comparison between these tablets and tell you which tablet you should buy be for multimedia or for productivity i'll also be comparing the xiaomi pen versus the apple pencil and the keyboard so make sure to watch the full video let's begin so first up the design here both the tablets side by side and size and weight wise they're kind of close and similar but both of these tablets have their advantages in the design the xiaomi pad 5 for example looks more modern with its flatter aluminium frame and thanks to the thinner bezels it manages to pack in a bigger screen than the ipad the xiaomi pad 5 honestly looks like one of the modern ipads the ipad 9 on the other hand kind of looks outdated with curved design and the big bezels on the front but it has two functionalities that the xiaomi pad 5 lacks it has the touch id so you can just unlock it with your fingerprint i mean the xiaomi pad 5 has face unlock but touch id is just more reliable the ipad also has the headphone jack which the xiaomi pad 5 lacks apart from this the ipad 9 gen has a metal back while the xiaomi pad 5's back is plastic overall the xiaomi mad5 wins on a more modern design while the ipad 9 gen has more functionality let's talk about the display now both the displays are kind of similar in terms of specs similar pixel density same 500s of peak brightness but the xiaomi pad 5 has a couple of advantages up its sleeve one it's a modern 120hz display which means the ui just flows it's very very smooth second it has support for dolby vision as well as hdr 10 and the shows that are compatible just look great now if you don't care about these points i found the ipad's display to be a bit more natural in terms of colors that's there but the xiaomi pad 5's display seems to be tuned to look like an oled panel and that's why the contrast and the blacks look better on it see i personally like the zombie pad 5 display mode because it just looks more beautiful when watching shows and movies also you should know that the ipad has a 4 is to 3 aspect ratio that is geared more towards productivity while the xiaomi pad 5's 16 is to 10 aspect ratios aimed at shows and movies apart from this the ipad's display also seems more reflective in comparison to the xiaomi pad 5 display another area where xiaomi pad 5 has an advantage are the speakers the xiaomi pad 5 has quad speakers while the ipad only has td speakers so obviously the speakers on the xiaomi pad 5 are just louder and it's also pretty good in terms of sound quality [Applause] [Music] now just to be clear i found the ipad speakers to have little more detail in songs when it came to instruments but when it comes to overall preference i'll choose the xiaomi pad 5 because it's louder and the sound quality is also fairly good moving on to the performance which is also a big factor here are the specs of both the tablets and first of all points to xiaomi pad 5 for putting in more storage in the base weighted as for the chipsets let me put it straight away the snapdragon 860 is good it's powerful and it's well optimized on the xiaomi pad 5b for day-to-day usage or gaming but the ipad 9 gen's 813 bionic is just more powerful the ipad beat the xiaomi tablet in every benchmark that i ran beat and to geekbench or even 3dmark so the ipad wins on the benchmarks one but if you talk about the day-to-day performance both of these tablets are very similar both almost lag free and both handle different apps and multitasking with ease is also very similar in terms of gaming too we played asphalt as well as bgmi and the performance is very similar on both these tablets i mean the ipads are known for the good performance but i'm just happy that we have an android tablet that actually competes with now one area where things get very different is the software i know you've been waiting for this new wifi pad versus ipad os but before we go any further if you made this file it seems like you're enjoying this video so why not hit that subscribe button and the bell icon make sure you never miss any cool tech videos like this one see i'll be honest me ufo pad is good if you think about it from android standards unlike most android tablets which have the phone ui expanded for the bigger screen this is more optimized be it apps or beat the multitasking features in fact the multitasking features are kind of borrowed from ipad os but even with all these features it can't really beat ipad os see ipad os is not exactly perfect the gestures and the multitasking can get a little complicated but apart from that it's definitely the more mature tablet os i mean ipad os you can simply hover an app over another to compile them in split screen view and what makes this better is that the multitasking menu on the top can put any app to split screen or turn it into a floating window or a full size one but just a tap of a button it works really well the ipad shelf is also a nice feature that lets you cycle through multiple windows of the same app so you can treat them as separate instances now it's not just multitasking ipad always has better more useful widgets and has support for apps like adobe photoshop which is a proper photoshop app with features like layers compositing etc as you can see it works really well here now there are also apps like procreate and good note which are powerful apps for things like sketching and notes apart from all this ipad os works really well with the whole apple ecosystem being ios or mac os there's obviously things like air drop face time continuity handoff and then there are more advanced features for example you can use the ipad as a secondary display to your mac you can also use the new universal control feature to use your max keyboard and mouse with your ipad this is super cool right see there are a lot more features and honestly ipad os is better if you want to use a tablet for productivity and also if you are in the apple ecosystem plus it will also be better supported by big margin luxami has confirmed the android 12 l update for the xiaomi pad 5 but that's about it on the other hand the ipad 910 should get support for at least six to seven years yes i'm not kidding to give you an idea the last ipad os update ipad os 15 arrived on the ipad a2 which launched in 2014 in fact it even arrived on the ipad 5th gen which also launched in 2017 so there's no matching the ipad os when it comes to software and sport anyway the battery is also an important factor on both these tablets pack fairly big batteries but somehow it's the xiaomi pad 5 that has the better battery performance in our one our 4k video playback test with the brightness set to max and the volume at 60 percent the xiaomi pad 5 lost 14 battery while the ipad lost 22 that's a pretty big difference we also played the same two hour movie on netflix with the screen set at max brightness and the volume at full two and the xiaomi pac 5 lost 29 battery while the ipad lost 37 percent battery i also did an android throttling test running added on the trot five times and while there was no throttling on any of these tablets i mean this is the first score and this is the last score so there's no throttling but the battery on the ipad was 27 while the xiaomi pad 5 lost 22 percent the charging is also faster on the xiaomi pad 5 it goes from 10 to 50 percent in 46 minutes while the ipad takes more than an hour the cameras are another area where both these tabs are kind of different the rear camera of the xiaomi pad 5 is better be it in terms of photos or even videos i mean it supports 4k video recording while the ipad supports 1080p now rear cameras and tablets are fine what's more important are the front cameras and that's where things get interesting so here are some comparison selfies and the xiaomi pad 5's photos look a little sharper and more detailed but what's interesting is that the ipad selfie camera is actually a 120 degree ultra wide camera because that means if you're going to do video calls this is awesome especially with center stage so if you don't know center stage is a feature that basically focuses on the subject in the frame so here i am with center stage enabled and i can move around and the camera will follow me what's cool is that the center stage widens the camera when another person joins in yeah this is great and this actually works well lastly like i said along with these tablets we also tested the accessories so here's the xiaomi pen and the apple pencil side by side and both of them have good features the xiaomi pen has these two buttons the button below opens up the notes app to quickly draw or note and this button also lets you switch between different pen styles the other button lets you switch colors of the pen and it also lets you take a partial screenshot like this so it's good the apple pens in first gen with this ipad support also has very similar features you can swipe from one corner with a pencil to take a screenshot swipe from the other corner to take a note or sketch there's also a very cool scribble feature which lets you select text delete text or even insert text using just a pencil and it's very handy to be honest the apple pencil is not perfect it's a minor thing but you can't even use the swipe up gesture with the apple pencil to go home or view the dock also the apple pencil charges like this kind of reminds me of on the other hand the xiaomi pen has some good things it costs 5000 rupees compared to 8500 of the apple pencil and i like that it magnetically charges like this on the tablet and you can use it to swipe up to go home but the apple pencil is just better when it comes to latency and pressure sensitivity we also tested the keyboard cases and the ipad 9 keyboard case costs almost 14k yeah just apple things on the other hand the xiaomi pad 5 keyboard case hasn't officially been priced in india but it should be priced better now i expected the ipad's keyboard case to be better but it's actually the opposite this is the ipad's keyboard in action and the problem here is that the keys just don't have any tactile feedback and it's just uncomfortable to type on it's just really bad i mean remember the butterfly keyboard on the macbooks this is that but a lot worse the xiaomi pad 5 keyboard feels like a proper keyboard with key travel proper feedback and you can actually use this unlike the ipad keyboard as of the functionality both of them have useful keyboard shortcuts but yeah overall the xiaomi pad 5 keyboard is just better well it's time for the verdict now the xiaomi pad 5 or the ipad 9gen which one should you be buying see it's very simple i mean if you want to buy a tablet for maybe entertainment gaming the xiaomi pad 5 is the better choice because of its more vibrant screen powerful speakers and better battery performance it's also good if you want a tablet that's slightly more affordable with more base storage and whose accessories are also fairly decent and affordable especially when compared to apple accessories on the other hand if you're looking for a tablet for creative purposes maybe for drawing sketching some photo editing and you are in the apple ecosystem then the ipad 9 chain is for you with exclusive apps and just better ipad os it also has the faster chipset so this is great for gaming too plus is the better tablet if you want long-term software support so that seems pretty easy
