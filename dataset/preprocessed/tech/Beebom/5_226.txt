[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys i'm akshay from bomb.com and this is the apple watch se the affordable apple watch that looks and feels almost like the cd6 there are some differences obviously but i think the apple watch sc makes a lot of sense especially for people considering buying their first ever apple watch we'll discuss this in three sections what's missing with the apple watch see what the hell does sc even mean and why the apple watch as he makes a lot of sense so let's get right to it okay so first off i'm sure when you think of the apple watch sc you kind of wonder where apple did the cost cutting right i mean it's priced at 30k so there must be stuff missing here and there is but it's not the kind of stuff that's a deal break first off there's no always on display here yeah the watch kind of stays like this until you rotate it lift up your arm or tap the screen so that's one thing missing it although you can rotate the digital ground like this and slowly increase the brightness of the screen and then bring it back down which is just a ton of fun this is also none of the added features like ecg readings or the new blood oxygen measurement feature plus it uses the s5 processor which is from last year's apple watch series 5. so clearly not the best processor it could have so why am i still saying that this watch makes a lot of sense firstly features like ecg and blood oxygen don't really matter to the average user i mean yeah there are probably people out there who probably need those features and for those people the cd6 is the watch to get but for the majority of people they don't really matter what they do need are features like irregular heartbeat notifications fall detection stuff like that and that's there on the apple watch i see now always on display is something i'm sure a lot of users want and yeah that should have been there on the sc but it's absence hasn't really affected me in fact i've been less distracted because the watch turns the screen off but still it's something that i'm sure a lot of people will not be happy about but you know i was using the series 5 before this but without the always on display the se's battery lasts quite a bit longer it lasts almost 2 days on a charge for me in my usage and that's when i was also using the cellular network so that's pretty nice if you get the gps only version i think it might last even longer moving on the s5 processor now that's something you won't even notice believe me the series 5 is a really fast watch and the sc performs just as well i mean it has the same chipset true the new s6 chip in the cd6 is even faster but the apple watch se doesn't feel slow or laggy at all no matter what it's a fast watch and it's much faster than the competition out there you know the more i think about it the more i feel se is kind of like apple's plan b i mean think about it apple brought the iphone se with iphone 6s internals and iphone 5's design at a cheaper price then it killed the iphone 8 and brought the iphone se 2 with the same design and slightly upgraded internals in the hopes of selling it at a cheaper price now it has done pretty much the same thing with the apple watch it killed the series 5 and brought the se instead with some cost cutting and a lower price this is apple's plan for countries like india where they need to sell devices that look and feel new but come in at a budget price i'll call sc strategic edition because apple is strategically selling its old products that's not a bad plan in fact we didn't like the iphone se 2 because it looked outdated and that's not a problem with the apple watch se so if you're wondering whether you should buy the apple watch se over the series 3 the answer is yes you should here's why look with the apple watch ac you will get a new design with bigger display which is obviously nice you also get the s5 processor which is a lot faster than the series 3. but more importantly the apple watch se will last a lot longer it will get software updates for a longer time i mean the series 3 will probably not get watch os 8 next year and it will most definitely not get watch os 9 in 2022 the apple watch se on the other hand will be supported for a lot longer and that's something that you should care about unless you buy an apple watch every year i mean spending 21 000 on a watch that may not be supported next year is not really a good idea in my mind moreover the apple watch se also offers lte if you want it which means it's the cheapest apple watch that supports apple's new family setup feature in case you want to give your kid an apple watch but not an iphone in comparison to the series 3 it also offers more storage fault detection support the second gen speaker and mic that's in the cd6 and the w3 wireless chip with bluetooth 5. so yeah if you're looking to buy your first apple watch the apple watch se makes a lot of sense it's also a good choice to upgrade to if you're coming from a series one or a series two maybe even a series three after all why wouldn't you want to get a new apple watch that's price lower offers pretty much all the features most people want and has the same design as the flagship i mean i'm thinking of buying the apple watch see it's just a sensible choice so yeah the apple watch se makes a lot of sense too it's a modern looking watch with good specs and not a lot of missing features at 30 000 rupees i think the apple watch ac is the apple watch for most people but what do you think let us know in the comments down below also give this video like and
