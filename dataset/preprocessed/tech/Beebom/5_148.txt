[Music] hey guys this is patientboom.com and this right here is the brand new redmi watch that has just arrived in india now i know a lot of you guys have a lot of questions around this watch like is it just a me band with a watch form factor or is it more is it actually a smart watch or a fitness watch should you buy this well this is my redmi watch review so i'm going to answer everything so watch till the end let's get started now before we begin i want to give a huge shout out to our sponsors for this video wondershare mobile trans which solves a big problem with mobile translates you transfer whatsapp data be chats media links from an android device to an iphone and vice versa that's not it lets you transfer other data between phones and also lets you back up and restore your whatsapp data to pc now this is great and you know what wondershare is having a great mother's day sale where you can get 20 off on all mobile trans tools and also stand a chance to win a hundred dollar amazon gift card so check out mobile trans and get 20 off from the link in the description down below so this is the redmi watch on my wrist and first things first the design here is obviously inspired by the apple watch but let me tell you straight away that this feels like a cheap budget smartwatch and yeah i get it i mean i don't know the india price at the time of shooting this video but in china the price is 269 u1 which is around 3000 rupees and frankly this fees like a smart watch that would cost 3k i have the ivory sort of creamy white version of the watch which i personally don't like but redmi is offering a number of different color options and i think the black or blue option will look a lot better than this now apart from this color i also feel that the 41mm watch case is too small i mean my first impressions when i first wore this where this looks like a kid's watch anyway the strap here is very similar to what you get on the me band it's rubbery and soft with the traditional buckle design and the strap here is changeable but i found this button too hard to press as for the watch case it's clearly plastic as you can see but i like that it's not too huge and does not have any weird protrusions it's also 5 atm rated for water resistance so you can't take it for a swim but considering the current situation i'm not sure when we'll go for a show now the display is one thing i think is fairly good for the price you get a 1.4 inch tft lcd surrounded by this big black bezels on top and bottom and it has a resolution of 320 by 320 so it's sharp and it has a max brightness of 350 nits which is pretty good now there's obviously no always on display or tap to wake but the display quality is pretty good it's sharp it's vibrant it has auto brighter support and the outdoor visibility of the screen is pretty good there is raise to wake if you're wondering and that's slow but it works so it's not really bad now apart from that there are a couple of things about the screen that i don't really like much first up i'm not sure of the screen protection here because i already have a few scratches on my watch second i'm not too sure about the responsiveness and that's mainly because of how the software works on the watch i mean here's the watch software in action and it's a pretty simple ui swipe left to right for different cards like heart rate sleep tracking weather music control etc so i pop from the bottom to get these toggles and swipe down from the top to see your notifications which like in the me band aren't actionable so you can't reply to messages there's also a single button that takes you to the app list which still don't have names just icons which can be confusing but yeah you get all the basic apps like your usual fitness tracking apps and the utilities like compass air pressure alarm stop watch time or find phone etc anyway the ui is actually fine it's fine but the problem is you must have noticed that there's no animation no sort of transition when you move across different pages so to show you better here's the settings page and when i swipe down it does not really scroll down it just goes to the next page of the settings without any animation or transition same with the app drawer honestly this just feels very unintuitive and unresponsive another issue i have with the software is to change the watch face i cannot just touch and hold on the watch face i have to go to settings and then go to watch faces and you can only have five watch faces on the watch i mean there are a lot of watch faces in the xiaomi wear app as you can see but yeah changing the watch face on the redmi watch itself isn't very convenient coming to the features now the redmi watch has all of these sensors to track different fitness data and one key feature missing is an spo2 blood oxygen sensor which is especially important these types i mean the new mi band 6 has it so yeah it's a key omission anyway get the other fitness tracking features their step tracking which in my usage was mostly accurate there were no weird addition of steps i even checked it by comparing it to the oppo watts so i wore the redmi watch on this hand and the oppo watch on this hand looking like a complete idiot but both of these watches were at zero steps i checked the step counter for a while and both of them felt fairly similar as you can see in the screenshot the sleep tracking is something i found accurate too it obviously does not track your naps but i found the sleep analysis to be fairly on point even in this comparison with the oppo watch as you can see here as for workouts there's no auto workout detection but you can manually start a workout from the workouts app in the watch so there's nothing fancy here but you get the basic workout options like running treadmill cycling freestyle trekking swimming cricket etc now i tried the freestyle walker option and you get details like the calories you've burnt and this nice little graph of your heart rate overall now talking about heart rate monitoring you can set the frequency to 30 minutes five minutes or even a minute the heart rate data also seems fairly right but i did notice it works when only when you have the watch tightened on your wrist so that's something to know now one important thing to note here is the redmi watch comes with gps and glonass built right into the watch so you can use it without your phone to track your outdoor workouts i tried an auto work with just the watch and i did notice that the gps takes approximately five minutes to get the location locked but after that the distance was accurate and so was the map yep i was just doing rounds in my society that's why the circle i also noticed that you get a lot more detail in this compared to the freestyle workout data i showed you earlier so if you ask me the fitness tracking on the redmi watch works fine but if there's one thing that really needs an improvement i think it's the xiaomi wear app i mean the ui is fine but it still does not sync with google feed and it also lacks in options for example there's no way to change your name here and i did not find a way to set goals in the app in fact i did not find the option to set goals even on the watch moving on if you're wondering about the smart watch features well that's where the redmi watch is kind of lacking like i said notifications aren't actionable you can only reject calls or mute them music control works fine but there's no storage for local music and there's obviously no third party apps here basically it's the me band with bigger display and gps lastly the battery life so the redmi watch has a 230 image battery that's rated to last up to 10 days now i started using the watch after charging it to 100 and i had the brightness of the watch set to auto dnd turned out at night heart rate tracking interval set to 30 minutes idle uh turned off the race to wake sensitivity set to high ab notifications coming in and at the start of the fifth day the battery was around 43 so i'd say it lasts around eight to nine days which is pretty good as for the charger you get this pogo pin charger that charges the watch fully in around two hours now before i conclude things let's do a quick comparison of the redmi watch with the amaze fit bpu which is a popular fitness watch in this price so specs wise both are fairly similar as you can see the difference is gps and geomagnetic sensor in the redmi watch and gorilla glass and blood oxygen monitoring in the bpu now one thing the specs don't reveal is that the amazebit bipu's ui is a lot better more intuitive now i don't have the bpu to show you right now because i'm shooting from home but if you take a look at this video you can see the bib use ui in action and yeah it looks good as animations i mean there's proper scrolling here and these make a big difference in the overall experience see the redmi watch is a decent fitness watch and it just has this one major problem and it's the ui and if you're okay with the ui you can go ahead and buy the redmi watch however if you're not okay with it and you can sacrifice built in gps i think the amis with bpu is the better option anyway i want to know your opinion this do you think the redmi watch makes sense comment down below also if you're wondering about the price i have the price pinned in the comments also give this video like if you enjoyed it make sure to share it subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos and yeah stay safe guys take care and
