[Applause] [Music] hey guys this is bhboom.com and as you probably must have noticed today i'm shooting from my home and that's because i want to show you guys my alexa smart home setup now my alexa smartphone setup is pretty simple but i think it will help you guys get started on your whole smartphone journey now i use alexa to you know control the lights my ac or geezer depending on the season my vacuum cleaner and the air purifier so what are the gadgets that i use so i've been using this new echo dot with a number of different devices for quite some time now and it's definitely made things convenient for me i've been using two smart bugs these ones from wipro a nine watt one and a 12 watt one and both of these have rgb lights brightness control and all the other cool smart features now i have set up one of these smart bugs with the floor lamp this one with the 12 watt bulb and the 9 watt one with this decorative lighting that i keep on at night and i love the fact that i can just turn on these lights by voice alexa turn off the living room lamp okay alexa turn on the living room lamp so yeah it works and it looks good now i don't really fiddle with the brightness of these bulbs i've just said it to 40 percent and that works for me but you can change the brightness alexa change the brightness of the living room lamp to 60 okay so yeah it's brighter also i've set the bulb to a warm tone because that looks nice and easy on the eyes at night but you can set things to any color you want it's very easy alexa change the color of the lamp to say blue okay so yeah smart bugs are cool plus i really like the fact that echo dot supports hindi and my parents only speak hindi so even they can use the echo dot to you know turn on or off the lights let me give an example alexa lights off alexa lights on so like i said smart bugs are actually really cool so this is how basically i'm using smart bugs at my home but for anyone who's just getting started let me tell you that setting them up with alexa setting the smart lights with alexa is pretty easy so you just need to enable the skill and set up the vipro app or the app of the smart bug that you have after which you can use alexa to control these bugs oh and by the way the wipro app on most smart bubble apps have features like schedule for example i've set the lights to turn on at 6 pm every single day so i don't have to manually turn them on every single night anyway apart from these smart bugs i'm using this smart lap from xiaomi now i have set this up next to my bed and i find it very useful and i think you'll relate to this see the reason i find this useful is because i no longer have to get up from my bed to switch off the lights i mean i always go to bed and just say alexa turn off the bedroom light and that's it i know laziness max but i love this so those are the smart lights at my home now coming to smart plugs like say this one i think they are equally useful now for people who don't know a smart plug is a plug that you can plug into a usual wall socket and make it smart or controllable by app or voice now i've been using two smart plugs i have the six ampere amazon smart plug that i've connected to my tv so this way i don't have to get up to turn on my tv yeah everything is connected to how lazy i am i can just say alexa turn on the tv and well it's on the other smart plug i use is the more heavy duty 16 ampere smart plug from homemade that you can use with appliances like your ac or geezer so obviously i was using this with my ac in the summers and right now i'm using it with the geezer so this way i can say alexa turn on the geezer and it's on and heating so kind of perfect right now apart from the smart plugs and the smart lights i also use the amazon echo dot to control things like my air purifier so i have the me air purifier 3 and i have set it up with alexa so i can just turn it on by saying alexa turn on the air purifier and it starts working another device i have is the really cool mid robot vacuum cleaner see i think this is a super cool device and we reviewed it recently on our website so you can check it out now this is super handy for me because i have a dog at my home which means my house is almost always dirty i mean there's dog hair all over the place now using alexa i can just say alexa turn on the vacuum and the me robot gets into action starts cleaning things up while also annoying cookie my dog so yeah it's a win-win situation so these are basically all the devices that i use and i think all of these work together really well plus i've set up routines in the alexa app that let me do multiple things via one command let me show you two commands that i use the most in the morning when i'm leaving for office i just say alexa i'm leaving and this command triggers multiple actions all the lights go off and the geezer or the tv if turned on go off now when i get back home at around eight nine i say alexa i'm home and all the lights turn on automatically my favorite page starts playing on the echo dot yeah that is some cool stuff right see these alexa features are nice but overall the point of this video is to let you guys know that setting up a smart home is fairly easy and not so expensive especially if you're just getting started i mean you obviously don't need everything at one go you can start with a smart plug or a smart bulb with the echo dot especially since you get these in great combos i mean for example when you buy the amazon echo dot 4 gen with the smart combo offer you can get the 9 watt bulb for just a piece 200 and the 12 watt bulb for just a piece 249 so it's actually very affordable in fact if you buy the amazon smart plug with the echo dot it only costs a thousand rupees which is a thousand rupees discount from its usual price the two burbs and the smart plug at these prices with the amazon echo dot are actually a great way to you know get your smart home plan going because i started the same way and trust me once you get used to a smarter home there's no going back anyway i want to know how you guys have set up your smart home because that will
