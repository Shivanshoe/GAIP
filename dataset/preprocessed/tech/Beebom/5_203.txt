[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is from v1.com and facebook has been adding a lot of new features in whatsapp i mean we hear about a new whatsapp feature every other week and now that some of the cool new features have actually arrived in whatsapp stable and beta i thought why not show you guys these new whatsapp features in action well i'm going to do exactly that but before we start let me tell you that this video is sponsored by wondershare mobile trans which solves a big whatsapp problem see i was planning to switch to the new iphone 12 mini but you guys know i'm an android user so the problem is how do i get my whatsapp data on the iphone but this is what mobile transfixes as you can see it lets you transfer whatsapp data be chats media links from an android device to an iphone and vice versa that's how it also lets you backup your whatsapp data on your pc now wondershare mobile trans is a paid software available for both windows and mac but b-bomb fans can get 45 exclusive

to use so here's whatsapp and i can just go to a chat open up the profile and as you can see there's this new disappearing messages option i can just turn it on right here and that's it now you can see in the chat that there's this the messages in this chat will disappear after seven days and i can tap on this to turn it off now you also get this icon on the profile picture to show that disappearing messages are turned on now this is great but honestly this kind of feels very basic right now i would have liked more options like an option to choose the days or the hours after which the messages disappear also anyone can forward these messages or take a screenshot so it's not exactly foolproof but yeah at least it's here now [Music] so the wallpapers option on whatsapp has always been quite basic but the newer beta whatsapp include newer wallpapers and some really cool new options so i'm using the whatsapp beta and i can just go to the settings chats wallpaper and as you can see it now shows a preview of the wallpaper and whatsapp anyway i can just tap change and it now shows bright and dark wallpapers in different folders and these include newer wallpapers that we haven't seen before and i think these look really cool especially the dark wallpapers and i also like that i can set a bright wallpaper and when the dark mode is on you can customize how much you want to dim the wallpaper in the dark mode it's really cool plus you cannot choose to add whatsapp doodles on solid wallpapers like this one and yeah one more thing you can now set a different wallpaper for each chat as you can see so that's great [Music] so we get a lot of unnecessary photos and videos on whatsapp especially in our family groups yeah we don't really like those good morning messages anyway this can take up a lot of storage on older phones which not have a lot of internal storage and for this reason whatsapp has added a new storage management tool which makes cleaning up storage a lot easier let me show you so i can just go to the whatsapp settings storage and data and here you can see the new managed storage option at the top right now i can just go here and as you can see it shows me the storage whatsapp is taking and i can also review and delete items to free up storage there's media that has been forwarded many times so here i can delete the useless forwards there's also a larger than 5mb section to clear the bigger files and below you can see which chat or which group has the most media share so i have this and i can just go inside select the photos and videos and delete them quickly this is easy and very useful [Music] so video calls are kind of the new normal i mean we aren't meeting a lot of people and that means a lot of video calls and whatsapp support video calls up to eight people and that's good but sometimes that's not enough and i think that's where the messenger rooms integration and whatsapp comes in handy so messenger rooms is basically facebook messenger's new feature that lets you make video calls with up to 50 people and you can use it via whatsapp so in the calls tab see this new icon above the calls icon this is the icon to create a messenger room now i can tap this and continue in messenger where i can create this group and then send the link of it to everyone i want in this video call group you can also create a room from a whatsapp group through the attach button so yeah this is cool and this also works on whatsapp web so you can even do your work meetings from your laptop [Music] there are a lot of other new whatsapp features that are really cool so let me just show them to you the first up you can now mute chats forever so if you have someone like akshay in your life you can mute them for always whatsapp is another feature that isn't new but something that has only recently arrived for everyone and i think it's a very very useful feature so you can now go to the attach menu and use the payment feature to pay someone or request money this uses beam upis so it's fairly easy to set up you can just select your bank and it will automatically get the accounts linked to your number now you can add the account and start making payments there's even a dedicated payments page here where you can see the payment history make a new payment or use the qr code to receive a payment moving on whatsapp also has the fingerprint lock feature android and face id support on iphones which you can use to lock up your chats whatsapp also recently brought animated stickers and these are stickers which felt animate like this in the sticker section you can notice the play button that indicates animated stickers you can also search for stickers now as you can see it shows you the different categories and you can also do a manual search i think this isn't beat up but it should write for everyone so [Music] so those are the new whatsapp features in action but there's obviously a lot of new features coming as well so let's talk about that so we'll soon be able to mute videos before sending them across and that's something i think everyone wants multi-device support is also coming so you'll be able to switch between android and ios more easily and even use whatsapp on multiple devices at once expiring media is also said to be coming it's similar to what we use on instagram you'll be able to send photos and videos that distract after viewing voice calls and video calls are also making their way to whatsapp web and yeah whatsapp is also working on a new vacation mode or read later feature as they plan to call it in which a new message coming from any chat in the archives will go to read later without any notification but those are the cool new whatsapp features in action so which feature do you like the most and yeah tell us in the comment section below also give this video a like make sure to share it and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos well that's me
