moto g71 amoled snapdragon 695 stock android 18 triple nine makes sense let's find out [Applause] [Music] so this is the new moto g71 and i'll talk about all of the aspects of this phone but like the g51 the biggest point of debate in this phone is the chipset so here are the specs of the g71 the g71 is the first phone in india with the new snapdragon 695 5g chipset then there's 6gb of lpddr4x ram and 128gb of umcp storage which like i mentioned in the g51 video bring speeds between ufs 2.1 and ufs 2.2 i think qualcomm has once again kind of messed up the naming a 6 series chipset is something we generally see at lower price points but this 63 chipset is actually more powerful than a lot of 7 series snapdragon chipsets let me show you here's a comparison of the 695 versus 750 g first of all the 695 is a six nanometer chipset unlike the eight nanometer architecture on the 750g this means the 695 will be more power efficient then the 695 has newer faster cortex a78 cores compared to cortex a77 on the 750g so it's more powerful then the 695 has the same adreno 690 gpu as the 750g but it has the higher clock speed so the 695 is actually powerful and just don't take my word for it it shows in the benchmarks here's the geekbench 5 score of the g71 compared to the redmi note 10 pro max's snapdragon 732g and you can see the 695 is way better both the single core score and multi-core score it's actually a big difference the 695 also beats the dimension 810 easily as you can see and to give you an idea it actually comes close to the dimension 920 in the new xiaomi 11i so there's actually no doubt in my mind that the snapdragon 695 makes sense in this price range in fact it's better than most of the competition when it comes to real world performance the moto g71 seems like a very fast and snappy phone see there's no lag anywhere and everything just feels like you'd expect from a good modern day phone the gaming performance is good too i've only played a couple of bgmi sessions and i've had no problems playing it even hd graphics so the performance is good and what's helping is obviously the stock android experience here it's android 11 with think shield security and there's no weird bloatware raz just a few motorola features and it's the experience i like motorola has promised the android 12 update and two years of security patches and that's fine but imagine how good it would be if this phone came with android 12 out of the box i think that would be better right anyway coming to the second big point of the g71 the phone has a 6.4 inch amoled with fhd plus resolution and while there's no gorilla glass motorola has confirmed some sort of hardened glass is being used now if you follow bbom close enough you know how i'm always in for an ambulance over ips lcd so thank you motorola for not going with a high refresh rate ips lcd here anyway this amoled here is decently bright at 700 nits of peak brightness the colors look vibrant and nice and the blacks are deep like you would expect on an amoled the phone has wide van element support so netflix or prime video is no problems at all so the chipset experience and the display are mostly sorted on the g71 now looks are subjective but this blue color is kind of growing on me every day in fact i think it looks better in person than in pictures don't you think here's how it looks side by side when compared to the g51 do comment below and let us know what you think about the looks of this phone i mean it's still a plastic bag that looks like glass but this is a phone that looks nice and kind of premium if you ask me plus i like the dimensions of this phone compared to a phone like the redmi note 10 pro max this is lighter and more compact i also like that the fingerprint scanner is here in the moto logo i mean at first glass it doesn't even look like a fingerprint scanner plus one on the aesthetics right there on the right the phone has three buttons the power button with this nice pattern on top for better recognition the volume rocker and the google assistant button which is something we have been seeing in motor phones off late the same slot is a dual sim slot with no micro sd support this whole design is ip52 rated for splash resistance and there's this one single speaker at the bottom so yeah no stereo speakers anyway if i move to the back there are three cameras a 50 megapixel f 1.8 sensor and 8 megapixel ultra wide angle sensor which also works as a depth camera and there's a 2 megapixel macro lens now here's some shots from the 50 megapixel sensor and in good lighting the photos look sharp and fairly detailed and i also noticed good colors and sort of this contrasty look in whatever photos i've taken so far in low light it's too early to judge but some photos look good while some kind of decent-ish now i'm yet to compare the g71 photos with other phones in this price range so can't really give a verdict right now as for the ultra wide angle camera it's been pretty good so far i mean most of the times it manages to maintain the colors from the main camera which is always nice the details go a little lacking but otherwise seems like a pretty good ultra wide angle lens moving on to the battery the g71 has a 5 000 image battery with a 33 watt turbo charger in the box which should be pretty fast i'm here to test things but amoled plus a 6 nm chipset plus a fairly big battery should translate into good battery performance lastly there are a few points to note the g71 has gca camera aggregation with 4x4 nemo so connectivity will be great also this is a proper 5g phone with 13 5g bands yeah that's a lot of bands so yeah this is good for future proofing to conclude things this is my initial impressions video but the moto g 71 6 128 gb at rupees 18 triple nine does it make sense well it does if you ask me it's got an ambulance screen a new powerful chipset sleek and lightweight design a big battery with pretty fast charging and it has the best software experience you can get in this price segment now i know the back is plastic the amoled 60 hertz and there's no stereo speakers but the point is even with these cut downs the g71 seems like a good solid smartphone i can see myself recommending to a lot of people now this is not the final verdict though i will be comparing the cameras to the competition and i'm yet to use it as my daily driver but i want to know your opinion on the g71 do you think it makes sense comment down below also give this video a like and subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos also hit
