[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is the page from bboom.com and this right here is the new asus zenbook flip s and this well this is a super cool laptop now i know what you're thinking you're thinking this is a well it's a convertible so i'm saying it's a super cool laptop but that's not really the case actually the zenbook flip s is a super cool laptop because it brings the cutting edge and there are two aspects to that the 4k oled display and the latest 11 gen intel cpus so yeah there's a lot to talk about and i'll suggest you to stick to the end because there's a lot of cool things to talk about in this laptop let's begin okay so i'm going to start with the design because it's the zenbook flip s and the convertible two in one design is one of the big factors in this laptop anyway first up it's pretty clear that this new zenbook flip s is a premium looking and premium feeding laptop it has a typical asus high-end design with the concentric circle design on the lid the cool jade black finish and the diamond cut red copper highlights all around and i think it looks fantastic another good thing about the zenbook flip s is the really compact design just look at how small this laptop actually is it's a great form factor and it's super portable which is very important in a versatile laptop like this one because it's very sleek it's uh it has a thickness of around 13 millimeters and it just weighs around 1.2 kgs which is awesome really now let me just open up the lid and show you the display which is honestly one of my favorite things about this laptop okay so just look at this this is a 13.3 inch 4k oled touchscreen and trust me it's beautiful this is a screen that looks amazing and i've been going gaga over it ever since i turned it on it's a 16-10 display that's slightly taller and i think that helps too in day-to-day tasks anyway coming to the display quality the display here is super crisp looks amazing especially when there's blacks on the display and things like brightness and viewing angles are very good plus what i really like is that the display is very color accurate with a wide 100 dci p3 color gamut which is important for all the use cases the zenbook flippers can be used for you know what that brings me to the convertible design of this laptop and the zenbook flip s comes with what aces calls the 360 degree air gold lift hinge design and as the name suggests you can actually go ahead and flip the laptop 360 degrees like this and i like the hinge it seems very solid and reliable because there's no flex so that's nice now this design means you can use this laptop in three modes the usual laptop mode which is great if you're working and you need the keyboard the touchpad etc pretty standard the second mode you can actually use this laptop in is the tablet mode so you can just flip the laptop like this and you get this beautiful display in the tablet mode now you can use it like this or you can use it like this either ways it just works plus the 4k display here is a touchscreen like i said and it's very responsive so using the laptop in tablet mode is a pleasure there's also windows ink and support for the new asus pen active stylus which we did not get in the review unit but ases will probably bundle in the box although they'll confirm that during the india lot so anyway you'll be able to just install the windows whiteboard app and draw things or jot down notes or you know just get creative now third mode is kind of fun the tent mode which is something i think college students will find very handy i mean you can just set up the flip s like this and enjoy your movies and shows pretty easily i mean hdr content on this 4k panel looks beautiful and that's honestly pretty awesome as for the speakers they're dual speakers here that are harman kardon certified and they aren't very loud but the clarity is pretty good so the design and display look great on the zenbook flippers but the specs are really interesting here so the zenbook flip s comes with the new 11 gen intel tiger lake core i7 processor with the new intel iris xe graphics along with fast pci 3 gen 4 ssds lpddr4x ram and wi-fi 6 support these are some top of the line specs now the new tiger lake chipset is obviously the highlight here but at the time of shooting this video a lot of details are known and honestly i really want to know how the new intel chipsets compare against the competition anyway as far as i know the new interchanges will be based on the new 10 nanometer architecture they'll have faster clock speeds while being more power efficient and they'll have better graphics don't worry i'll leave a link to all of the details about the intel cpu as we know overall i think the cutting edge intel chipset should make the zenbook flip as a capable machine i mean i generally don't use my laptop for a lot of intensive tasks and i've only had the flippers for a couple of days but i did try photoshop and it was super smooth so yeah i am very positive around the performance now thanks to the latest intel chipset onboard there's also the new superfast thunderbolt 4 usbc ports which are also used for charging apart from that there's also the hdmi port and on the left you get the power button and a usb a port there's no headphone jack here but asus will be bundling a high quality dongle in the box so there's that anyway i also like the whole keyboard and touchpad experience here this is an h2h keyboard here and the typing experience is something i like on the laptop and that's because the layout is good enough and the keys have a decent 1.4 millimeters travel these keys are also backlit so that's covered the touchpad seems pretty good too it supports windows precision drivers and it's fairly responsive and fluid plus since this is asus number pad 2.0 you can just enable this to get all the numbers and then use it anywhere with the calculator app or anywhere else lastly when it comes to the battery the zenbook flip s comes with a 67 wattage battery with a 65 watt usb pd charger in the box now previous zenbook flips have been criticized for their average battery performance but i don't think that's going to be the case with the new zenbook flip s because obviously there's the new intel chipsets which are supposed to be more power efficient there's the oled display and asus is claiming up to 15 hours of battery life on this laptop so all of that sounds really promising well as for the charging the 65 watt charger takes the laptop around 60 in just 15 minutes so that's fast well to conclude things the new asus zenbook flip s is a laptop that i thoroughly enjoyed using and that's because every aspect of this laptop brings kind of something new see the design here is fantastic with the laptop being super portable while featuring the convertible design the oled 4k display is just amazing to look at the battery life seems very promising and the new 11 gen intel cpu means that it's going to have the latest cutting-edge performance so yeah i'm excited about the zenbook flip s but yeah at the time of shooting this video we don't know the price and honestly i want to know more about the new intel chipset so let's wait for that anyway i'd love to know your opinion on the new zen book flip s and obviously the new intel cpus tell us your thoughts
