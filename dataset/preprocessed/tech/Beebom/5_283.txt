[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is passion be gone calm and ever since one person wield the oneplus bullets Wireless Zeo phones alongside the oneplus 8 series I have been super excited to check it out I mean it just Opie's 2000 DS seem like great value for money earphones so when the bullets wirelessly went on sale I quickly ordered it and yeah I've been using it for quite some time now yeah this is the one principle as well as Z and this is our review okay so let me give you a little background here see I love the one possible its Wireless one and before the Z came along I was using the bullets Wireless 2 as my primary here phones now when the bullets while is Z arrived what really got my attention is the price which is really good and the fact that it's not a whole lot different than the bullets Wireless to so I started using the one faced bullets Wireless the extensively and yeah it's clear that oneplus has got some corners to get the price down but you know what one possibility I'll is the even better is the one press bullets Wireless to in some aspects yeah make sure to watch the full video to know all of that now starting off here's what you get in the bullets Wireless ZBOX earphones I use DC cable and these ear tips yep that's it you don't get the silicon case you get with the bullets Wireless too but honestly I'm not complaining I did not use it anyway now coming to the design of the bullets while SZ it's the same recognizable neck band designed with the same rubberized cable but if you can't notice it the difference lies in the material used in the ear buds see unlike the bullets Wireless - which had a metal design here the bullets while is he has a plastic design in the earbuds yes it's something you should know and yeah it is noticeable since it's crossing having said that I think the bullets wirelessly looks decent enough and I like the fact that it's available in some really cool colors although yeah I went for the black version anyway since it is plastic it's slightly lighter than the one place bullets wireless - at just 29 grams and yeah these are super comfortable to use for long hours I mean I've always found the one place billets wireless earphones very comfy and Z is just no exception the rubberized neck band is comfortable and even the earbuds fit me perfectly I don't think you'll have any issues using the Z for long hours because I used to keep them on all day Plus unlike the bullets Wireless one and two the bullets wireless Z comes with an IP rating the IP 55 sweat and water resistant to be more specific and I think this is definitely great to have now coming to the controls and features the oneplus bullets Wireless Z brings the same controls and features like the other one first bullets wireless earphones but there are a couple of really nice changes so you get the power button on the left end of the neck band with a very well hidden white LED light just above it and you can use this to pair the earphones or turn it on or off but with the oneplus bullets while SZ you can also use this to quickly switch between two pair devices yeah double click and switch double click again and switch back yeah this is very useful because I keep switching from my phone to my laptop and vice versa also if you're wondering when it comes to pairing the bullets why Lizzie has quick pair support with one press phones but it did not work for me even after multiple tries say I pair the earphones the old-fashioned way but it was quick and easy on the 70 as well as the red make a 20 so no issues there but yeah I hope once this fixes this quick pair issue because that's pretty cool now coming back to more buttons you get these three inline buttons on the left here bud and they're still tiny and not so tactile you get buttons for volume knob one him down and an action button which we use to play pause or skip tracks turn on Google assistant and answer end calls as well everything works fine and I think the button works almost instantly so no issues apart from that there's also the glade magnetic control which is something we have come to expect from one place bullets wireless earphones and yeah it works great you can snap them together to pause music and take them apart to auto play yeah it works like a charm moving on to one of the most important aspects of a wireless earphone the sound quality now the lower price of the oneplus bullets wireless Z gives an impression that it might not be as good as say the bullets Wireless to in fact on paper to the one-piece bullets while a Z comes with nine point two millimeter drivers compared to ten millimeter drivers on the bullets Wireless to however I check things out I tested it on the red McGee 20 and one per 70 and I think the song quality is pretty good see the one place billets wireless he gets very loud and I did not notice any distortion at the max volumes I also found the instrument separation decent enough and the soundstage is pretty nice too when it comes to the bass I found it to be good too but yeah sometimes the tump is a bit missing in bass heavy tracks look I think for the price the one faceboo 'let's why Lizzie offer create sound quality no doubts about that now if you want to compare it to the bullets Wireless - yeah let me be honest the bullets Wireless - does offer better overall audio quality but it's not a big difference which is saying something also there's another thing to note the bullets wirelessly supports high quality AAC audio files but does not support aptX HD codec which is something you'll find in bullets Wireless - apart from that I also made a lot of calls from these earphones and I did not find any issues the people from the other side never complained about any issues from the Z's microphone overall at this price I am very happy with the bullets while is the sound quality now another thing that people are always worried about in Bluetooth earphones is latency while playing games like say pubs in mobile so the bullets wirelessly comes with Bluetooth 5.0 and on one performs with fanatic mode there's a low latency more as well well in my testing I think the latency was pretty low in fact I played some pub G sessions on the one 470 as well as the redmi k20 and yeah i did not find any latency issues whatsoever with the bullets why Lizzie next up another big highlight of the bullets wireless Z is the battery life and charging it's really insane the bullets wireless Z are rated to last 20 hours on a single charge 20 hours he has that is insane I mean in comparison the bullets Wireless - is rated to last 14 hours so yeah double as well as he offers insane battery life and in my usage I think the earphones lasted on 18 18 and a half hours which is really really good look I got these earphones on 15th May and I've only charged it yesterday so yeah I think I'm gonna charge it weekly plus there's more child support which apparently gives you 10 hours of charge in just 10 minutes of charging and yeah that is awesome I also checked the full charge time and the 30 T wall charger fully charges the CEO phones in around 24 minutes over on if you ask me at just rupees 2000 I think the one-plus bullets why Lizzie I just SuperDuper value for money and a lot of people in our team love it I bought it George's purchased it and and more to see the thing is the bullets wireless the offers are really nice comfortable designed with features like device switching which is honestly my favorite new feature there's also magnetic control which is created and it brings great sound quality amazing battery life and super fast charging now at less than 2000 rupees you have other options like the green be buds viola is the mean neck band earphones but honestly the one plus bullets Wireless Z is just better than these beat when it comes to features battery or sound quality it's just better also if you are wondering about the bullets Wireless - I think it's still a great choice for people who want a more complete audio experience and a slightly more premium design but yeah at the end of it all if you're planning to buy the bullets why Lizzie just go ahead do it it's an earphone I will recommend well that was our review of the new one plus bullets wireless Z earphones and if you still have any questions around these earphones just comment down below and I'll try to answer as many as I can also give this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and make sure to share it with your friends who are considering buying the new bullets wireless z earphones now if you subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos well that's me signing off thanks for watching I will see you in the next one [Music]
