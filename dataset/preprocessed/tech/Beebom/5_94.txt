[Music] [Applause] hey guys this is patrimo.com and google has announced a new android update it's called android 12 l now if you're confused android 12l is basically what we have been calling android 12.1 over the last few months but you know what this is a big big update for devices with big big screens be it foldables rollables tab labels i mean tablets now i have been trying out android 12n and it's actually a very interesting update so let me show you what android 12 l is all about first off i know what you're thinking why android 12 l well i think the l is for large screens i mean makes sense anyway i have tried out android 12l running on the android studio emulator on windows and yeah i tried it on both tablets and foldables and you know what this solves all the issues i have had with android on the bigger screen see most android tablets especially the tablets with stock android have a ui that's just phone ui expanded for the bigger screen and it's not very intuitive this is what 12l fixes first off here's the notification shade and quick settings on 12 l and as you can see it is divided down the quick settings toggles along with the users bar and settings button are on the left and the notifications are on the right now this is great because this is proper use of the big screen i mean in stock arrow tablets you still get the same phone like notification shade which just does not make sense anyway the music controls also come up here on the quick settings side which is nice now the settings app has also been optimized into elven it finally uses a dual pane design making use of the big real estate i mean it's a simple thing and i've seen samsung tablets using this dual pin design but it's only now that stock android gets this i'd say better late than never so basically you can go to the different settings and they show up in the pane on the right now another ui element that's more optimized than 12l is the lock screen so this is the new lock screen in 12l and as you can see it uses a two column layout there's the clock on the left and the notifications on the right again proper use of the screen now one cool thing on the lock screen is that the pattern or pin ui is now displayed on the side for better access to your fingers and you can just tap on the other side to bring the pattern or pin control to the other side like this or you know like this this should be super useful now apart from this there are a lot of other minor visual improvements in 12l for example the whole fold to unfold transition in apps has become more seamless this looks cool right there's also a quick wallpaper change in the home screen context menu which i haven't found yet now this is great but one android 12 feature that i'm really excited about is multitasking gestures so you must have noticed this new taskbar here in 12l now the stars bar is pretty handy because this lets you drag and drop apps to open in split screen quickly for this you have to have an app open for example i have chrome open here and i can press hold on the youtube music icon here and drag it to either the left side or the right side to open it up quickly in split screen i mean i like this i'm to be honest ipad os multitasking gestures are more advanced they're more extensive but yeah this is kind of a good start for android and just let me show you the multitasking gesture on 12 well once again so here i have the camera i've opened and i can drive the photos app on the side like this i mean it's easy and i'm doing this with the mouse with touch it should be even more seamless plus one thing to note is that with android 12 every single app out there will enter the multi-window mode anyway there are some more multitasking improvements into lvn first off the recent screen looks like this and as you can see there's a new split button in the first app so that you can quickly launch an app in the split screen along with another app in the recent screen now apart from this android 12 l has the swipe right or left from the bottom gestures to switch between apps quickly now this is something that i noticed was missing in stock android on the dlv pad that i used recently so yeah it's good that it's finally here in android then there's the split screen mode which is pretty much the same you can resize this plate but yeah only two apps can run at the same time now if you're wondering about the taskbar you can put apps here like this and it hides when you're in a game or watching a video and you can even manually hide it by long pressing but that's not working yet in this first developer preview apart from this android 12 will also make the play store better on big screen devices the play store will show apps that are more optimized for the bigger screens there'll also be separate ratings for tablet version of apps the update will also bring a nearby calling feature that lets you take calls on the nest hub or switch a call from your phone to the nest hub now apart from all of that there's obviously a lot of under the hood changes and guidelines for developers to you know build better apps the biggest screen beat foldables or tablets so that's nice anyway what devices will get the new android 12 l update so first up the beta release will arrive on the lenovo tab p12 pro as well as the pixel devices yeah the pixel phones will be getting the android 12 l update even though most of the features are obviously bigger screen specific but yeah pixels will get this update now what about the stable release well google is aiming the stable release for around march just in time for the next gen foldables in fact samsung has confirmed that it will bring some of the 12l features to its z43 foldable device so that's pretty much everything we know about the new android 12 l update and you know what if you ask me i think this is a very interesting update and it's not perfect and this is a very early build and i want to try it out properly on a device to get a better idea but this is a good start i say this because samsung's z4 fundamental phone is a mainstream device their device is like the oppo x the rollable smartphone which we went hands on a few months back then there's the meme export and the rumored pixel phone see the point is foldable smartphones are the future and they deserve a beautiful new ui that makes use of the biggest screen estate so yes android 12l is a step in the right direction anyway what do you guys think do you think your next phone will be a foldable running say android 12l or you still don't trust foldable smartphones comment down your thoughts in the comments down below also if you want to try out the new android 12l update you can check out our guide from the link in the
