[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and i've been wanting to check out the new one ui 3.0 update since quite a long time and with the good news is the one ui 3 beta is finally available in india and i have it installed on our galaxy note 20 ultra so what's new what are the new features and changes let me tell you all about it in a better precise manner okay so here's the galaxy note 20 ultra running one ui 3.0 and the s20 ultra running one ui 2.5 and let me get this straight one ui 3.0 isn't exactly a visual overhaul but there are some interesting changes to the ui now the biggest change is to the notification shade this is the new notification shade and honestly i'm not a fan of the full page shade but it has this transparent blur background effect which i think looks cool solo effect is present in the quick settings too and i've noticed that the quick settings now shows fewer toggles the date and time are in the center and the menu button and the power button have moved to the top which is hard to access to be honest anyway the settings page has been refreshed too as you can see there are updated icons and i noticed that the search in the settings is better now there's suggestions and a light add works better even when you're spelling something wrong just check this out see how the new search works better another ui change i like is the new volume control ui it's more accessible because it's right alongside the volume buttons and also has this transparent blur look which is cool now apart from that there are also some other minor ui changes here and there the recent screen is slightly tweaked so the settings pages have been sorted all across now take a look at the lock screen the clock is bolder and in the center and as you can see the fingerprint scanner icon has changed too [Music] so on the one ui home screen there are two new features that i think are very good additions so first up you can now add widgets directly from the icons on the home screen so i can just press hold on an icon and there's this new widget option which shows me all the different size and different type widgets available for that app i can just hit add and it will be added to the empty space how cool is this now another really good feature which i've used in a lot of other skins and it's pretty handy is the ability to lock the phone with a double tap on the home screen i mean double tap to wake has been available in previous one ui versions but double tap to unlock is new and i think very handy [Music] now from the home screen to the lock screen now i already talked about the ui changes on the lock screen front but there are some nice improved functionalities too now first of widgets are now available in the lock screen it's very easy i can just tap on the clock on the lock screen and as you can see it shows me all the widgets that i have enabled and yeah i can even go to the settings from right here and enable more widgets now this is super easy and definitely makes lock screen widgets more useful plus there's a new digital well-being widget too which makes sense especially on the lock screen another lock screen feature getting better is the dynamic lock screen wallpaper feature so this is the feature that changes the phone's wallpaper automatically and now it has more categories there's plants cats other animals food desert etc all pretty valid categories you can say always on display is improved too so here's the aod settings page and as you can see there's an option to add images as well as gifs on the always on display so you can choose images from the gallery and they look something like this it's cool and you can choose gifs from a number of options here or you can go to samsung's theme stores and get some more gifs now here's a g for example on the always on display and i think it looks fun don't worry these gifs only animate for a few seconds and then they go static one of the cool new features in one ui 3.0 is the ability to customize the layout and background of the call screen so the phone settings has this new call background option and as you can see it lets you choose between the two layouts there's also the option to set a photo from the gallery or a video as your call background for example i can set this as my call background because i'm just plain narcissistic now jokes apart i look i mean this feature is cool anyway you can now edit multiple linked contacts in the phone app as well as delete duplicate contacts with a lot of ease as for the messages app it now has a new recycle bin where you'll find all the deleted messages a very good addition i think one ui 3 also brings some minor improvements to the camera app so the new camera app is said to have better autofocus and better order exposure now i did not notice any difference in the autofocus but i did notice faster exposure lock and there's also this new lock icon showing you that the exposure has been locked so that's good another change i noticed is in the gallery app so basically when you're editing a photo or a video there's a new revert option that's very useful let me show you so when i added something in the older one ui gallery app there's only this reset button so when i hit save and edit the photo again there's no way to reset any of the changes or go back to the original file in the new audio 3 gallery app you can now edit and save a file and you can still revert all the changes you have done all of them so this is great because no matter what happens you can always get your original photo or video back and that's very [Music] useful so along with the new look notification shade there are a couple of changes so you can now basically choose between brief and detailed notifications so detail notifications look like this with more actions and this is basically the usual android notification and the brief notifications look like this which is basically just a small pop-up and something that has been present in one ui so that's the difference and when you set the notifications to brief you now also get the option to set the edge lighting style and more now apart from that since one ui three is based on android 11 there is the notification history option which by the way is turned off by default so make sure to enable [Music] now along with all the features and changes i just talked about there are a lot of other cool stuff here and there so in the screen recorder settings you now have an option to hide the status and navigation bar which is great because people find this handy you can now set do not disturb to work only in certain apps so you can set it for games so that you only get the important notifications and calls handy one uis finder is now much better as you can see it looks better it now suggests apps settings pages and more some of the options and settings have changed in the battery page high performance mode is now called enhanced processing and really i did not find the minimal battery usage aka max power saving mode in this bit anyway video enhancer is now something you can turn on or off in available apps and lastly the bixby routines app if you care about it has been revamped with the new look more control on routines and better recommendations now along with these changes one ui 3 brings all of the other android 11 features like bubbles better permissions wireless android auto and more so those are the new one ui 3.0 features and yet this is kind of an iterative upgrade that just refines things anyway
