[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys dissipation vo comm and after waiting for so so long Xiaomi has finally and wheeled its very first me laptops in India the mean over 14 and the mean on 248 her rise in addition now the horizon Edition is obviously the more exciting more higher end of the two and well we have it right here so what are you waiting for let's unbox the Meno 214 or rise in addition okay so this is the new me notebook 14 horizon Edition and I think it looks pretty class anyway in the box you get this 65 watt charger and I like the fact that Xiaomi is bundle this webcam since its work-from-home season and me notebook 14 horizon does not feature anyway let's talk about the laptop so first of all the design and the build quality and this is something that is already impressed me in this laptop the me not before the horizon Edition comes with an all-metal design and it looks beautiful this is anodized aluminium and it looks cool and it is very premium as you can see here the back has no branding at all and that's something a lie because it makes up for a understated classy look anyway the laptop looks good even when you open it up first of all I like the fact that I can open the lid with just one hand like this so that's nice and second I like the fact that I'm being greeted by this display this here is a 14 inch full HD anti-glare display and well I've only used this laptop briefly I think the display looks great now this is a standard 60 Hertz display and it's fairly bright viewing angles are good and the colors look punchy now all that is great but what means this display really impressive is the fact that it's for Xiaomi calls for rise in this bit yeah that's where the slapper gets its name from well it's basically a term for how narrow the bezels are and well they're surely pretty narrow all wrong this does give the me notebook a very modern look and I do feel that the laptop is pretty small for a 14 inch laptop all times to the better now as you must have noticed the bottom bezel is a little thicker and here you get the me logo talking about branding there's also the Intel sticker here and I'm glad it's the only sticker because I hate it when laptops have a ton of these stickers now I did say that the laptop is pretty small right well it is pretty sleek and portable it's very lightweight at one point three kgs and it's pretty thin at seventeen point five millimeters so yeah I definitely like this now coming to the keyboard it's a chiclet keyboard with the scissor mechanism and while lab I have a couple of doubts I like the feel of it I like the fact the keys here are well spaced and I like the 1.3 millimeter travel these Keys offer having said that this is not a backlit keyboard and it does not have the inverted T layout for arrow keys which can be a little annoying the trackpad on the other hand is fine it's a monitor trackpad and while it's not very big it's not very small - it's kind of average to be honest I like the fact that it's wide but I don't like the sound it makes every time I click it moving on to the ports now the right side features the USB C port two USB 3.1 ports an HDMI port and the charging port here the laptop has a proprietary charging port even though it has a USB C port onboard it's strange really I mean the me notebook added and Molina teen uses supports USB charging so this is surprising on the left you get this ring for cooling the headphone jack and a USB 2.0 port so on the port's from the me notebook fourteen horizon Edition is pretty covered but yeah I would have liked an SD card reader as well now damn nice also on that note the laptop does not come with a fingerprint scanner so yeah there's that apart from that the me notebook 14 horizon Edition comes with two grills for cooling and two to work speakers on the bottom I would have played a couple of songs since so far I haven't been impressed with these speakers these aren't logged and this just not enough depth it it's obviously because their bottom firing so honestly don't expect great audio experience from these speakers now let's talk about one of the most important aspects of the me notebook 14 and that's the performance Mino 214 horizon Edition comes in two variants of Core i5 and a core i7 way we have the higher-end variants of the lab pro fax at 10 comet Lake ten five ten you core i7 processor with 8 GB ddr4 Ram 500 GB m2 nvme SSD and NVIDIA and x3 50 graphics now these specs are what makes this laptop truly exciting I don't like the fact that the a GB RAM here is soldered so you cannot increase the RAM on this laptop but apart from that the specs are pretty good so I like that and yeah I ran a couple of benchmarks on the laptop so check them out this here is the PC mark score which i think is pretty good and this is the 3d mark score which takes the GPU into consideration now benchmark side in my time but the laptop it's been pretty smooth and Swift so I really think this laptop will be able to handle day-to-day notebook tasks with a lot of ease as for gaming xiaomi isn't fitting this laptop as a gaming laptop and they're right about that but as you must have noticed this is one of the first laptops in india to come with the MX 350 graphics so I obviously installed a few games not this laptop only arrived yesterday so I have only installed a few games disclaimer first I'm out of touch with PC games so don't judge me anyway as you can see I played pub delight on the laptop and at ultra graphics I got around 60 70 FPS which is really good I also played csgo and at high graphics the FPS hovered around 100 which is great for your eSports title shouldn't be a problem on the slapper as for full-blown Babji it's a very intensive game and even on low setting I fear some starters playing it so there's that look it's created the me notebook horizon Edition isn't exactly a gaming laptop but yeah if you want to run some casual eSports titles on it it should do fine and if you wanna run some high-end triple-a titles on low graphics you can maybe try it out now from a notebook perspective this seems like a very powerful laptop but like I said I haven't tested it extensively so it's a bit too early to judge that but yeah things seem positive next up the battery the me notebook horizon Edition comes in the 46 what are battery and a 65 watt charger now Asami cleans up to 10 hours of battery life which does sound good but yeah I'll be putting it to test on the charge if I know USB C charging is disappointing but the 65 watt charger is a fast charger that's rated to charge a laptop to 50% around 30 minutes that's pretty good lastly there's the software the mean would be 14 horizon Edition comes with Windows 10 home onboard with a 30-day free trial of office 365 now let's come to the big question a lot of you guys have been asking us there's a lot of chat on Twitter yes there's no ads on the me notebook 14 either of them and there's no bloatware there are a couple of Xiaomi features and I like them firstly there's me share which is the airdrop like feature that works the Xiaomi phones real me we were and Oppo phones so yeah it's great if you own any of these phones so you can quickly share files the laptop also has me blaze unlocked which is to unlock the laptop using the me BAM so yeah that's it just a couple of Handy features overall it's still very early days but it looks like the me notebook 14 horizon Edition does really really well on some France and not so well on a few other friends first the positives so the design is really sleek very portable and good-looking I like it the display with its narrow bezel looks striking the CPU GPU an SSD combo seems very powerful considering it's a notebook and active performance seems pretty promising as well now the doubts the lack of use DC charging the feeble speakers and the fact that the RAM is soldered then also the fact that the keyboard is not backlit look at the end of it all if you ask me it all depends on the price it all depends on which laptops the mean or the 14 horizon Edition competes against so yes we'll reserve our word it till we know the pricing details well that was our unboxing and first impressions of the new me notebook 14 horizon Edition that name is long anyway what do you think of this new laptop tell us in the comment section below
