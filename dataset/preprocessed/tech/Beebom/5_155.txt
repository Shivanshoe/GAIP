[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and asus zenbook dual laptops are something that really excited me back in 2019 i mean the whole dual display design of the zenbook do and the zenbook pro duo is something really cool and actually useful too from a content creation point of view now the zenbook dual laptops of 2019 were almost perfect but missed out on a brighter secondary display and it was still kind of budding when it comes to features now asus has launched its 2021 edition of its zenbook dual laptops and this here is the new zenbook duo ux482 so what's new what are the upgrades let's find out so first up on first look the new asus and book door looks premium like every other zenbook that has launched off late it has the same magnesium aluminium alloy finish on the chassis and lid and it's another fairly portable laptop having a thickness of 16.9 millimeters and weighing at around 1.6 kgs now all that is good but the usb obviously of the zenbook duo is the dual displays and i like the fact that the whole dual display design here has gone through some really good upgrades both on the software front as well as the hardware front first of all let me get the display specs out of the way the primary display here is a 14 inch led touchscreen with 1080p resolution 100 srgb coverage and a maximum brightness of 400 nits now this is the secondary display aka screen pad plus now this is a good high resolution 12.65 inch ips touchscreen panel which also has a max screen brightness of 400 nits and you know what this i think is the biggest upgrade here at least for me see the low brightness levels were a bummer in last year's zenbook doors so i'm glad that the new zenbook duo's secondary display matches the primary display in terms of brightness i mean the display quality of the primary display is still better because you must have noticed in our shots that the second display looks kind of dull compared to the primary one and that's because its viewing angles aren't as good as the primary displays apart from that asus has also introduced a new hinge beneath this secondary display which improves the angle and does the visibility of the secondary screen as you can see when i open up the lid of the laptop the secondary display also kind of lifts up nicely and that means it's easier to see unlike the last gen zenbook duo where i had to lean in a little now along with better viewability this hinge also improves the thermal performance of the laptop as it allows for better airflow so yeah it's a good design change but yes there is one thing is that you can't open the lid with one hand you have to use two hands every single time the software side of the screen pad plus display has been updated too with a new ui and some really cool new features first of all this is the new screen expert control center in the secondary display and this can be now moved to any of the sides being the left right or even the bottom i also like this new ui and the fact that this whole thing just feels more responsive now it's also a lot more customizable as you can see in the settings you can choose between the dark and the light theme and you can also customize the buttons and a lot more as you can see here anyway so the cool screen pad plus features we saw last year are still here so basically you can still move apps between the two screens with these you can also swap apps between the two screens like this you can also stretch one single app to both the screens and i think it looks really cool and there's still an option to create task groups here so that you can quickly launch apps at a certain position for example this task group opens up chrome on the primary screen youtube music on the right side of the secondary screen and notepad on the left side so this is nice so these cool features are there but there are some new additions first there is link to my asus integration in screenpad plus so you can make calls from your phone from right here and even mirror your phone screen right here there's also an option to launch these handy tools on the secondary screen via this shortcut now another really cool new feature is that you can use this whole screen as a touch pad yep you can just use this three finger gesture to turn the screen into a touch pad so yeah make this the touch pad disable the keyboard and yeah it's all cool there's also a new control panel app which supports apps like premiere pro after effects photoshop etc now when you're using any of these apps you can use the control panel app to get a panel on the secondary screen with various tools for example in photoshop you can have this whole panel on the secondary screen and as you can see it has the brush size dial buttons for undo flip and sliders for brush opacity and more you can also customize it totally which is cool so the zenbook door kind of makes the overall dual screen experience better but what about the rest of the laptop see apart from the upgraded secondary display the laptop also comes with upgraded specs so the laptop is intel evo certified and comes in core i5 and i7 variants and you can also go with the variant that has the mx 450 gpu but here are the specs of the variant we have right now so there's the latest tiger lake 11 gen horizon processor with the iris xc gpu 16gb of lpddr4x ram 1tb of nvme ssd and wi-fi 6 and bluetooth 5.0 so the specs are updated and for a laptop that's kind of aimed at productivity these specs should be fine now selection of ports have been improved too from the last gen there are two thunderbolt 4 usb c ports on the left now along with a full size hdmi port and on the right you get a usb a port headphone jack and a micro sd card reader apart from that the keyboard and the trackpad still remain a little inconvenient to be honest the keyboard is actually good with the keys offering fairly good travel but since there's no way to rest your hands i think it's something that will take some time getting used same with the trackpad which is all the way on the right edge and it's quite small yes you can use the full screen pad plus display as a trackpad but yeah i would have liked the bigger trackpad here lastly there's the battery the new zenbook duo comes with a 70 watt battery and a 65w usbc charger in the box see i haven't had the time to check out the battery performance of this laptop because i've only used this for a day but it's rated to last up to 17 hours so it'll probably be good as for the charging the usb pd charger charges the laptop from 0 to 60 percent in around 49 minutes which is pretty fast or not if i had to sum up this whole video in a sentence i'd say the new azure zenbook door 2021 brings some really nice upgrades see the secondary screen has improved in terms of brightness the laptop comes with a new hinge to make it easy to view there are new features and a new ui and everything is more snappy plus they are the latest specs better selection of ports and more i mean to be honest this isn't a laptop for everyone it has its quirks but anyone wanting to get on the whole dual screen laptop bandwagon can consider this and if you want more power even better specs there's also the zenbook pro duo that asus has just launched so yeah i want to know what you guys think of asus's new 2021
