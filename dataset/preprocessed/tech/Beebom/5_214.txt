[Applause] hey guys this is page from p1.com so you probably already know that micromax is making a comeback in the indian smartphone market on november 3rd but it's new in smartphones now here's a timeline of what has happened so far because first up they started off with this on august 15th the whole 70 years of independence or being independence teaser and then they posted this video of raul sharma talking about the micromax journey now when i was first watching this video i was like okay they'll talk about the product how they plan on taking on the competition but all the micromax ceo talked about was the border clash china blah blah no mention of any product any teaser nothing anyway after that teaser and that video just came along this invite for the november three launch and it says au karere which i think is kind of racist and not in good taste and also if you open the invite there's obviously the invite and there's a glass which again says alkara cheney come no specs no details on any of the upcoming smartphone nothing see honestly i think that micromax is over doing this whole cashing in on the anti-china sentiment in fact i feel the way they are hyping up these in smartphones they probably plan on selling these smartphones by pushing the whole anti-china sentiment and emotion not by promoting actual features in the new smartphones i mean generally when smartphone makers tease their upcoming phones they talk about the key specs like super fast or smooth performance incredible cameras high refresh rate displays long lasting batteries etc etc but on the other hand micromax they aren't talking about their phones at all all the teasers this invite they all talk about china trying to invoke patriotism in people and whatever little we know of these new in smartphones we know through leaks and rumors i mean from the leaks and rumors the in one and the in one the supposed name of the new micromax smartphones will come with mediatek chipsets the g35 and g85 5000 image batteries dual cameras hd plus displays so yeah these are going to be low end smartphones but all of this all of this is very strange because at the end of the day it's the product that actually matters i mean micromax should know better because i remember back in 2014 micromax was doing pretty well in fact it actually managed to beat samson to become the top smartphone maker in india back then in q2 2014 and you know what it even sneaked into the top 10 smartphone makers in the world so that was pretty good now you all know the rest of the story the chinese companies arrived in india they beat micromax and that's it but i don't think that the chinese companies were the only sole reason why micromax failed i think there were a lot of issues with micromax i think you will relate and agree when i say that macromax field because of factors like the buggy software builds the bloatware the poor service center experiences the fact that most of its phones with chinese phones rebranded and more so the thing is no company can ever push a product out of the market i mean a good product will always survive so if the micromax smartphones were actually good they would have survived so today when they're making a comeback in the indian smartphone market they should be focusing on their new smartphones the product instead they're playing with us sentiments let's face it when it comes to product versus emotions it's always the product that actually wins i mean with this whole strategy micromax will obviously get a lot of hype for its in smartphones which is great but at the end of the day like i said it's the product that matters and the product is what will make or break micromax especially in the indian smartphone market which is like super competitive right now and very hard to crack well to conclude things i'm actually glad at micromax and indian smartphone brand is making a comeback in the indian smartphone market it's very good and i really really hope that the new smartphones are actually good and something that people can buy because more options especially indian options are always better but but dear macromax if you're listening please let's talk about products let's talk about how your products are different from others and how they are fixing the issues that are present in the current smartphone world let's talk like a tech company not like a political party well do you agree with us do you think that micromax should be talking more about the new smartphones rather than using this anti-china sentiment tell us your thoughts in the comment section below also give this video a like and make sure to share this video share this video lastly subscribe to our channel for more amazing tech videos last me signing off thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one [Music] you
