enough with the keyboard the chargers the mouse the earphones blah blah blah blah these are eight super unique gadgets under thousand bucks that you can easily find on amazon and spoiler alert these are actually really really cool first up this is a bluetooth speaker first up this is a vacuum cleaner this is a very simple device for 8 15 rupees and this has a very simple use case you turn it on the fans ramp up and you have a portable vacuum in your hands [Music] so if you're like me and you like to keep your desk clean and nice this is for you the fans go up to twelve thousand rpm but what's important is that this is powerful enough for most desktop clean uses two double a batteries so ain't no thing about the charging so if you're a 90s kid and you've watched a great show the legendary shakalaka boom boom [Music] first up amazing show and second you need this this is a 3d pen that only costs 99 rupees and with this you can make things like this cool shuriken the deathly hallows logo with this rotating thingy this cute little butterfly i love bebop for the pros so as you can see we are very very creative people especially me i love to be you know [Music] here's how it works you turn it on it heats up and also shows you the temperature you get the green light you insert the filament you get a green and a pink filament in the box and you can buy more and then you press this button and you get started it's very easy now you can use it with an adapter plugged in or you can use it with the power bank this is really great and you know how this is really really good this is not just a 3d pen no sir this is 3d pen too new and improved jokes apart for 9.99 rupees this is actually really good have you ever ever wanted an apple watch for a really really really low price well enter the mi smartwatch for men well at least there's the name on the amazon listening sorry ladies this smart watch cost 6.99 rupees and the best thing about this watch this actually works not kidding but only on men sorry ladies look look this is not actually that bad as cheap as this watches it has a basic ui that still has all the functions like step counting heart rate blood oxygen monitoring sleep tracking music control remote camera and more in fact step counting is fairly accurate the heart rate monitor is slightly off when compared to an apple watch but it's still close enough as for the blood oxygen meter it might make you wonder if you're dead because sometimes it just throws up random numbers otherwise it's good but it's still close enough the battery is said to be 150 mh which is obviously not a lot and i think it should last about two days and it charges like this something note this is not touch screen there's this just one button to use it and the screen is spread in but for 6.99 rupees i mean i'm just glad it works influencers this is for you [Music] unlike the thing like that we showed you in our gadgets under 250 rupees video again sorry about that this one is actually good this is an 8 inch ring light and it has plenty of tricks up its sleeve you can set it to bright white mild yellow or warm yellow you can increase or decrease the brightness in this and this actually gets very bright and it does make a difference what's super cool though is that this is a multicoloring light there are all the colors you need they are even cool effects like these now it comes with this tripod connector and a mobile phone holder the price just 649 rupees boom light drop [Music] bonus scene here's what the box says advocates practical sasik simple natural product design ideas humanist dies of design no grandiose appearance only design that fit the user experience i love it speaking of influencers this is another one this is a personal robot cameraman and it is actually very cool you mount your phone on it you turn it on open the camera and now if i move my personal robot cameraman moves with me it even goes 360 degrees it can track faces it can track objects and i like the fact that this works with a native camera app on your phone it works in apps like instagram too the face tracking is kind of slow sometimes but mostly i thought it was good you can even track two faces with this lot overall this works which is awesome for 79 rupees and if you're still wondering what the use case for this is well you can use this to
