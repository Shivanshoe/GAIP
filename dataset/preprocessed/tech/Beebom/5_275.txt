hey guys this is patient B one calm and I've been using 1/2 spoons for a long long time now I've used the 1 plus 1 to the 1 plus 8 now and one of the reasons I really like what the spoons is oxygen OS yes it's a great experience and I know there's a perception that oxygen OS is perfect but you know what having used a lot of one plus ones I think yeah oxygen OS is great but it is not perfect see I've been using the oneplus 8 for the past few weeks now and some of the problems some of the issues in oxygen OS have truly come to the fore well let me go into detail but before we begin for all those of you who are new here I suggest you to hit the bell like and get notified every single time we post an awesome new video now that you've done that let's talk about oxygen OS and yeah the first thing that needs fixing in oxygen OS is the dark mode see in other Android skins I can enable dark mode via a quick settings toggle like this I'll set the dark mode to automatic so that it automatically turns on at sunset it's convenient and great on the other hand to enable the dark mode on oxygen OS I have to go to settings then go to customization and here change the preset team to nuance dark or change it with this to an option here this is annoying because first I always look for the dark mode option in the display settings and second there's no quick toggle to enable the dark mode and yeah as you might have guessed there is no automatic dark mode to search between the light and dark teams I have to go to settings customization every single time it's frustrating and it's not just me a lot of people on reddit agree so I hope one perspex is this real soon moving to point number two the oxygen OS launcher look honestly I like the oxygen OS launcher and on oneplus ones I never install a third-party launcher because oxygen was launched it brings I can back support lets me choose between shelf and google disk of page and it has most of the features at what however there's one feature that is kind of annoying to me see in the oxygen OS launcher there's no way to select multiple apps at once neither on the home screen nor on the app drawer it's something I miss a lot because it's super handy on other skins me y1u i real me you are you name it they all let you select multiple apps so that you can move these apps to a different page on the home screen or create a folder with these apps or you know uninstall these apps easily on oxygen always I have to do it one by one need to remove some air from the home screen do it one by one trust me it's super boring and I really hope one purse does something about this the dark mode the launcher and the next is the fact that oxygen always still does not have of one handed mode I mean it's surprising because almost all one postpones are fairly big see the one plus eight is stalled the one plus eight true the seventh row or 72 are all big phones where oxygen OS needs a one handed mode I mean I remember oxygen OS is beta bills did bring a one handed mode which wasn't a true one-hand mode it was more like iOS is reachability feature but it later on it was removed and right now there's no one handed mode in oxygen OS anyway if one plus does plan to bring one handed mode to its phones I really hope it's the true one handed mode that we have seen in other you guys that really minimizes the screen the UI for a true one-handed usage I'm really UI and color OS even have a gesture to enable the one handed mode so one plus can take some keys anyway the next thing I'm going to talk about isn't exactly an issue it's a feature that can be improved a lot I'm talking about hidden space and to be honest I am not sure how many people use it but I think the hidden space feature in oxygen OS is pretty cool for those of you who don't know hidden space is a space where you can keep your hidden apps and I like the fact you know I can access it by going to the app drawer and swiping right or I can go to the homescreen and pinch out to access it this is cool right and I can even lock it up so you know what it's via dad and only lets you hide apps how about some more functionality hide photos files and more I know the file manager in oxygen OS has a lock box feature but the hidden space can be the one-stop for everything you need to hide so yeah I hope oneplus gives a thought to this now the next issue is a bit personal see time and again oxygen OS comes up with these weird bugs and I was using one per 70 it had this weird auto brightness bug and now I'm using the one plus eight and it has this spirit bug that I want to talk about seen on of apps don't support the new aspect ratios for example Ludo King works like this and so does Netflix we're playing a video but thankfully you can for these apps too work on the new aspect ratio and other phones when the problem is on the 1 plus 8 the apps to display fullscreen page is broken as we see the all apps page shows you only these three apps so I cannot force apps to go fullscreen and unlike other skins the app info pages don't have this option I hope one plus picks is this soon because the black bar on top of Netflix is definitely annoying it feels like I'm using a pixel and that's not a good thing apart from all these issues the missing options and whatnot there's one feature that have always missed in one pressed phones I'm talking about always on display but hey good news one cause has confirmed that it's bringing always on display to its phones so I guess that's all look all in all like I said at the start oxygen OS is great and it's one of the reasons I pray for WordPress phones but it's obviously not perfect I might be nitpicking on some of the things but if oneplus does fix these issues in oxygen OS I think oxygen OS can be close to perfection but for that the folks that want us need towards this video so make sure to share this video around so that gets to one plus and we can get these fixes and
