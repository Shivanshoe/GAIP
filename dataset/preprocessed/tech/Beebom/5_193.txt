[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is baseball.com and welcome to our year in roundup of the absolute best android apps i mean if you've seen our other android apps videos this year you'd know that we got some great apps some really good ones but today we are talking about the best android apps of 2020. now before we begin a huge shout out to wormhole for sponsoring this video so wormhole is actually a great tool if you want to control your smartphone from your mac or windows pc i mean i have wormhole setup and as you can see the iphone screen is cast on my laptop but this is more than just mirroring i can click to open an app or a menu type on my phone via the laptop keyboard and that's not all i can also copy text from my laptop and paste it on the phone drag and drop files as well and yeah connect multiple phones at once and i like that these features are available for both android and ios now wormhole is available for windows mac iphones and android so check it out from the link below so there are a lot of audio recorder apps on the play store but i think this air dolby gonna rock their world by launching dolby on see dolby on is a brilliant audio recorder app and there are multiple reasons for that first off the ui is beautiful it's actually really cool now second it captures great audio because when you stop recording and roll beyond it applies things like noise reduction dynamic eq volume maximization stereo widening easy phase etc plus it has audio editing capabilities and with a recent update you can now even import other audio files or even video files for the app and edit the audio right here now the last reason why the app is brilliant is because it brings all of that for free so ratio has to be one of the most popular launches of 2020 but i think it's also one of the best launches launched in 2020. i mean this is ratio right here and it's clearly the most unique launcher i have used in a long long time it looks super minimal with its stark theme and it's well organized tabs and yes it does take time getting used to because this is a vastly different home screen than we're used to but i liked it once i got the hang of it plus ratio's newest feature is just amazing i mean i'm talking about the third tab here called the tree which combines all of your messages in a single place so my whatsapp instagram and my messenger text are right here on this page which honestly makes the whole texting process in different apps very seamless see ratio is a launcher that i feel has a lot of potential and well it deserves to be one of the best apps of 2820 okay so i'll be honest when photoshop camera first launched i was kind of skeptical i kind of discarded because i thought it was just another filters app well then i used it and turns out it is kind of a filters app but it's so good and super fun really i mean the filters here are called lenses but they are crazy i mean using photoshop camera you can turn your photos from say this to this or you can add steam to your food add planets in the sky so there are a lot of other cool lenses you can use and i love how well they work on basically any app photo to be honest the ai of the photoshop camera is what makes it one of the best apps of 2020 and i hope adobe keeps improving it in 2021 oxidizer 11 brought notification history to everyone but filter box is a notification history app that's way more powerful and that's the reason it makes it to this list first of all it brings you all the notifications in this really cool looking timeline and second it gives you so much control over notifications i mean you can search for any lost notifications you can restore a notification you dismissed and you can even add an undo button to notifications to make sure you don't accidentally dismiss a notification so all of that and an analytics feature showing you the total notifications of the day the apps that you've gotten the most notifications from so yeah filter box is something you should try see i'm generally very picky when it comes to wallpaper apps because some of them have bad ui some of them are full of ads but this year my favorite new wallpaper app is crispr so crispr is still in early access but i really like the ui it's really clean it's very minimal and everything just looks very modern overall plus i like what you can do with different wallpapers i mean the wallpaper source here is unsplash so there are some really cool wallpapers as well as illustrations but i like crispr because of the customization options it gives so say i open this wallpaper now i can just edit it and add some really cool effects as you can see there's emboss pixelates api etc but my favorite is zoom blur it just looks so cool on this photo overall this is the wallpaper app to try and do into any so don't kill my app is a new benchmark app that arrived in 2020 and you've probably heard of it and unlike cpu gpu benchmarks that don't give you an idea about the real world performance don't kill my app brings you exactly that i mean this benchmark app shows you if your phone is killing apps in the background or not because a lot of you guys do that to conserve battery life and it does ruin the experience see when i tested it i found stock android as well as oxygen os to do well but other skins like me ui one ui or real ui kill apps in the background frequently anyway the app also guides you on how you can stop your phone from killing apps in the background so yep it's great so let me make one thing clear one defined is an app that launched in 2019 but i discovered it this year and i think it's one of the best apps i have used it to annoy so it's simple one-to-five lets you find your lost earbuds or headphones or anything with roots really now i use this to find my wireless earbuds all the time because i always misplace them so here's how it works you just need to move around with the phone and if the distance score is increasing it means you are near the earbuds so when the score hits hundred percent it means your earbuds are very very near it's very cool and as you can see it shows the car bluetooth system as well as other people's headphones so i'm going to use this someday to maybe steal i mean borrow akshay's airpods pro one day so creating a new email id isn't something that crosses our mind anymore and it's also a big hassle but hey hey email is a new service that honestly makes me want to do it so here email is a new email service like i said it's not an email client and it's actually focused on bringing you less email which honestly i appreciate and i think a lot of you guys will appreciate it too see hey email basically lets you control who can reach you you get to screen first time email senders where you can just thumbs up or thumbs down i mean when you get a spam you can just do thumbs down and it's like the easiest way to get rid of spam apart from that i like the three tabs for inbox where you get the important email feed which shows you the newsletter and other things to read and paper trail which has all the receipts see hey email is kind of an ambitious and unique take on email and i think it deserves the attention even though yes changing your email seems like a big task okay so google socratic acquisition gave way to socratic by google this year and in a year when everyone's kind of studying from home this app makes a lot of sense i mean yes this app is very similar to say photo math or microsoft's math solver but it's google ai and along with math problems it can also solve questions in biology chemistry physics history and literature so this is like a good all-in-one learning app for anyone facing issues solving problems at home during this pan mix season so that was our list of the best apps of 2820 but if there's any other app that you think should have made this list make sure to comment down below so that everyone can know and yeah give this video
