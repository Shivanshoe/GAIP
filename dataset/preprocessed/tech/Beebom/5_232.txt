[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from v1.com and for the past few months i've been using my phone a lot and that means i've come across some really cool hidden android features tricks settings options basically everything and it's time to share i'll be telling you eight hidden android settings that you should be changing right away and you're gonna love it and i'm not just including stock android settings i'm including settings from me ui one ui oxygen os real me ui so yeah make sure to watch this video till the very end now before we begin you should probably start with a non android setting and that's hitting the bell icon you hit that to get notified every time we post an awesome new video shameless plug but hit the bell icon now let's begin now first up is a super cool android setting that i honestly did not even know that it existed i'm talking about an option that disables all of the sensors in your phone with just a single tap be the usual sensors like proximity or light sensor or the camera or the microphone so here's how to turn it on just enable developer options first and then in the developer options page look for quick settings developer tiles and here just enable sensors off now i can just go to quick settings and i can use this option to turn off all the sensors on the phone now say i open up the camera app here as you can see it's not working it shows an error here while on some phones there's just a black screen now let's try recording an audio well i'm speaking here and as you can see there's nothing on the audio front there's no audio being recorded so this whole senses off feature works and i think this is quite interesting because of two reasons one this can be good if you want to conserve your battery life and second it can be great if you're privacy focused and you don't want any of the apps and services to use these sensors so live caption is a feature that i remember google announcing with android 10 and i thought it was super cool but it was pixel 4 exclusive back then however it has started rolling out to more phones recently and i think it's an android setting that you must know so enabling it is pretty simple you can turn it on from the quick settings page or you'll find it in the settings page so make sure to search for live caption in settings now once you've enabled it just play any video in any app for example say you're scrolling on facebook you don't really need to turn up the volume because the live caption feature will automatically capture the audio and transcribe it into caption in real time and show it like this yeah this is quite an interesting feature anyway so far i've only seen the live caption feature in stock android one ui 2.5 oxygen os so phones with other skins will have to wait a bit but it should arrive soon so google recently started rolling out its airdrop like file transfer feature called nearby share to all android devices running android 6 marshmallow and above and yeah the boring name aside i think this is a great feature because you no longer need third-party apps to share files between your phones so to enable it all you need to do is go to quick settings edit the tiles and check if you have a nearby shared tile here if it's there just add it to the quick settings page and that's it now you can use it just tapping that brings up this prompt and you can just turn it on and you'll be visible to other devices now if you want to send a file using nearby share you'll find the nearby share option in the share sheet so just tap it after which it will look for devices with nearby share turned on now you can just select the device you want to send the file to and that's it it's sent and yeah it's super handy because if android finally has a native file transfer feature so voice typing in regional languages is not something new but it has to be one of the most underrated features in android g to be more specific i mean it's very handy for parents who don't like typing and you know they can just use their voice to type in the language see my parents generally send me voice messages but some things require typing so it's very simple all you need to do is add hindi as one of the languages in gboard now here's me voice typing in hindi and you can see it's so accurate and just like hindi videos subscribe trust me i've tried voice typing in english and it's not as good as this at least with the indian accent maybe plus what i like is there are so many other indian languages and there's support for offline voice typing too i find it really good because i taught this to my father and he really enjoys typing like this so one area where android kind of lags behind ios is on the whole ecosystem front and google has been trying to fix it via chrome and it makes sense because chrome is available everywhere be it windows or mac and it's a software that a lot of people use so thanks to chrome you can now copy and paste text between your android smartphone and your pc or laptop now first we'll have to enable the clipboard flags on chrome android and chrome windows well i'll mention the names of the flags in the description down below but you can just search for clipboard in chrome flags and enable everything you find now here's how it works so i can just copy a text in chrome and right click now as you can see the context menu shows copy to real me phone because i've been using the realme 7. now i can just use this and my phone will get a notification of the text copy and i can just go ahead and paste the text now this also works the other way i can just share a text on chrome on my phone to my laptop and then paste it on my macbook it's very seamless now those are some android specific options but i also have some cool android settings for me ui one ui and real me ui first let's start with miui so we recently did a video on me why bloatware and ads and how to remove them and if you haven't checked it out go ahead check it out and a lot of you were asking how did i get the google discover page on the redmi note 9 i was using i mean i get it the app world page isn't something that everyone finds handy and me ui users have been asking for the google page in miui launcher since forever well the good news is that the miui 12 update in india brings the google discover page in the miui launcher as you can see in the launcher settings of the note 9 and miui 12 there is a minus one screen option that you can use to switch to the google discover page from ab1 so make sure to use this setting whenever you update your phone to miui 12. now coming to real me ui when i was using the real me 7 and realme 7 pro i came across an option that is just super handy so i'm talking about the process manager feature which you can access by going to settings additional settings and yeah process manager so as you can see this lists you all of the apps running on your phone right now be third-party apps or system apps and it even shows the amount of ram it's using up now what's strange is i haven't used wear os by google in a long long time and it's still here running in the background so i can just end this process or freeze it it's a great option if you think an app is draining your phone's battery in the background or maybe an app is spying on so when you're gaming and you get a call and you get it in this pop-up like window up top on most phones but the problem is the moment you accept the call you go full screen with the phone app which is annoying because now you have to manually switch back to the game and only then the call ui will turn into a pop-up but this is where a one ui option is great in the phone settings you get this call display while using apps option here in the bottom there's a keep calls in pop-up option which makes sure that even when you answer a call say while gaming it will remain in the pop-up and not go full screen so how cool is that so we all know that google photos bring some really handy video editing tools like the option to stabilize trim rotate the video but there are times when you want to mute a video aka remove the audio from a video and send it to someone well google photos lets you do that as well pretty easily i must say so it's pretty simple just open up a video in google photos hit the edit button and now you can see the speaker icon here right just tap on it and that's it the audio from the video has been removed now you can just save the copy of the video and it will be without any sound and yeah you can send it to anyone you want how cool is that but those are some really cool hidden android settings that you should be definitely trying and i think this is a great list and if you think that too make sure to like this video
