[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is paige from bm.com and the brand new oppo renault 5 pro 5g is here and this is the phone right here now there are a number of exciting things about this phone first up this is the first dimension 3000 plus chipset phone in india so that's pretty exciting now second there are obviously a lot of cool camera features especially on the video shooting front so i'm excited about that as well and all of that in this beautiful design so yeah what are you waiting for let's take a look at the brand new open five pro 5g now i want to talk about what's in the box first since that's going to be very important this year anyway so in the rate of 5 pro 5g box you get the usual transparent silicon case and you get this 65 watt charging adapter with the usb a to usb c cable and surprise surprise you are even getting these usbc earphones now coming to the renault 5 pro this is a fantastic looking phone we've got the astral blue variant of the phone which has this subtle glow effect and it's stunning to look at i also like this cool looking design on the top which i think gives the phone more personality so this is a phone that's absolutely premium and it's just amazing to hold in the hands and i think there are two things to note really see first this here is a glass back and the back is matte with a certain texture to it thanks to a unique ag glass which makes it shiny and nice while being very very grippy to hold honestly you've got to hold it to believe it i also like that the camera bump isn't crazy now second thing about the design is that it's a very lightweight and compact phone i mean compared to most phones these days the in-hand feed of this phone is great it's very sleek in just 7.6 millimeter thickness and it's fairly light at 176 grams overall i love the design of this phone but there are a few other details that i think you should know there's no headphone jack no single speaker here and there's no micro sd slot but the base variant of this phone comes with 128 gb of storage so i think we can let that slide now moving on from the design the display is pretty good too first up here are the specs of the display so there's a 6.5 inch super amoled fhd plus 90 hertz display with a punch hole on the top left but specs aside trust me when i tell you that the display is top notch the colors look rich it's bright and sharp and there's a wide vine and one license so there seems to be no problem so far now i know it's the renault series you're probably expecting me to talk about the camera features but i want to talk about the mediatek demon 3000 plus chipset first i mean this is the first phone like i said in india to come with this chipset and it's great because in the past i've always kind of liked reno phones but they've also given me slight mixed feelings because they always came with mid-range chipsets well not this time the radar 5 pro comes with the mediatek demon city 1000 plus with 8gb ram and 128gb storage the new mediatek chipset is obviously the highlight because it has the powerful cortex a77 cores as well as the mali g77 gpu along with dual 5g support but the first thing i did is you know run a few benchmark tests so check out the scores here are the antutu geekbench 3d mark and ai benchmark scores of the dimension 3000 plus on the renault 5 pro and as you can see the scores are pretty good in all of these tests to give you a better idea here's the geekbench 5 score compared to the 765 g on the knot and yeah it's clear that the demand c3000 plus beats the 765g hands down here's a comparison in antutu and again it's a big big difference now compared to the snapdragon 865 here the scores and as you can see the 865 scores higher but it's not too far away so that's good when it comes to real world performance the no5 pro 5g has been very snappy and fast so far i mean i've only used the phone for a couple of days but so far everything has been very responsive and smooth there's been no lag and that's even while gaming i have been playing long c mobile sessions with graphics set to high and frame rate set to max and the performance has been very good also very important there's no heating which is something everyone is concerned about with mediatek but so far even after i've played cod mobile for like say an hour i haven't had any heating issues anyway let's move on to the camera features which is always an exciting thing about renault phones first the camera specs the nano 5 pro comes with a 64 megapixel main camera along with an 8 megapixel ultra wide angle lens and a couple of 2 megapixel lenses see like most render phones from the passive camera performance of the nano 5 pro seems good i've taken shots in daytime and low light and so far the 64 megapixel camera has done a pretty good job with the details and the colors it's not absolutely perfect in low light but it's been very good as with the ultra wide angle camera i think it's good with the colors and the hdr but the details kind of fall short sometimes now if you're wondering about the new features that come on the video front so in video mode there's this new ai button on the top that you can see this lets you enable oppo's new ai highlight video feature which automatically turns on its two algorithms depending on the light one is live hdr which enhances hdr in daytime videos second is ultra night mode which improves low light videos well i tried things out so here's a video side by side i shot during the day and just noticed the background now thanks for the delhi fog and smog the background isn't that visible but the video shot with ai highlight on has managed to get some buildings now here's a side-by-side comparison in low light so here you can see the ai highlight video feature brighten things up and it also ups the saturation and contrast a bit which i think makes the video slightly more appealing anyway i also like the fact that the new ai highlight feature is also available on the front camera which is i think is great because generally front camera videos especially in low light aren't that great so ai highlight is a pretty good addition to that apart from this there are all the other cool features that you've seen in previous open phones there are the cool portrait modes that we saw in reno 4 pro last year and there are different video features like ai color portrait video and the different color filters as well as for the other details around the reno 5 pro the software is coloros 11.1 based on android 11 and it's great that the phone is coming with the latest android platform onboard i also like that there's no unnecessary bloatware here the phone has google's phone and messages apps and there are oppo apps of course but there are no additional third-party apps now there is this hot apps folder which recommends apps but that's it welcomes the battery the nano 5 pro has a 4 350 image battery which i'm yet to truly test but i'm expecting decent battery performance from the phone as for the charging speed this 65 watt super work 2.0 charger charges the phone from 0 to 100 in just 30 minutes yeah that sounds crazy even now as for the concerns about battery health there is an optimized night charging feature which controls the charging speed at night and avoids overcharging the device so that's good lastly the connectivity so a lot of you guys are curious about 5g bands in newer phones so to let you know the renault 5 pro 5g comes with 9 5g bands which is nice and great so there's the n1 and three and seven and twenty eight and thirty eight and fourteen forty one and seventy seven and n seventy eight bands now another thing there's only 5g support in sim one of the nano five pro although demand city thousand plus supports dual 5g anyway if you want to know what n1 n3 or other 5g bands mean you can check out a detailed article from the link below so that was a good look at the brand new opel no 5 pro 5g and after using the phone for a couple of days there's one thing that comes to mind is that if the phone is priced at say around 30 to 35 000 price segment i think this could be like the first budget flagship of 20 to 81. see it's got a design that's very premium the display looks really good even though it's 90 hertz and not 120 or 144 hertz there's the new dimension 3000 plus chipset with 5g and powerful performance the camera and the new features seem good and there's crazy fast charging with a decent battery so all in all the open into 5 pro actually seems like a very good phone but these are just my first impressions and i think i'll wait for the price compared to other phones and then give my final verdict but what do you guys think of the new opening fight pro 5g tell us in
