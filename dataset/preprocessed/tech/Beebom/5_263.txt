[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys this is the patient vegan calm and awfully foods I've kind of become stale 64 mega pixel plus 7 30g Wario Miller pixels but 7 280 G 64 mega pixels 7 2 D it's nice like manufacturers are trying out different combinations to see just what works so when I heard that the V what x50 Pro is launching and I was kind of excited to check it out because you know I had seen the promos and it showed a new gimbal camera taking the phone which is new and something that we haven't seen before well this is the b4x 50 pro and while the look and feel the specs are pretty good what's really exciting is the gimbal camera take in this phone and yeah I've been using it playing it around and you know what it has surprised me in a good way spoiler alert beats the iPhone 11 Pro yeah watch the video till the very end anyway so this is the camera celebrat it get it has a periscope telephoto lens with 60 X zoom support two of these lenses including the 13 megapixel portrait lens and an 8 megapixel ultra wide-angle lens and then there's the big one on the top like literally the main camera here is of 48 megapixel Sony IMX 598 sensor that features the cool 5 axis gimbal like hardware around I mean you can see that the main camera is noticeably larger and it's built around a small gimbal system that's placed inside and it kind of makes it look like the cameras floating here's a teardown video of the camera sensor and well this is what it looks like yep this is cool and to be honest I did notice the camera moving just a bit when I was shaking the phone and even like I've said this is the first time a gimbal camera tech has kind of made its way into a smartphone so I've been testing it out thoroughly now which is the phone that comes to mind if you want the absolute best video recording capability obviously the iPhone 11 Pro so what I've been doing is I've been shooting videos from the X 50 Pro and the iPhone 11 through side-by-side in 4k 30fps and compare the stability it's gonna be interesting now before I show you the comparison videos do notice the vivo X 50 Pro has an ultra stable mode which I did not use whatsoever for these comparisons I did however calibrate the gimbal through the settings for better performance so first off I did a user walking test to get a feel of things and here's the comparison video I'm walking pretty swiftly here and I think both these four have captured very stable video if we look very closely the effort to put is slightly more stable when there's some job but it's not a big difference anyway I wanted to see a big difference so I decided to shoot a comparison video while running yup like this trust me I did not enjoy this so here the videos are short and in this you can see a big difference the V works with the pro video is way more stable and if you saw me running you'd know that even I wasn't stable okay coming to the iPhone video it has managed to minimize the up-and-down movement but the Gherkin is from the left to the right is just a bit too much in comparison you can see that the vivo x50 pros gimbal system has made sure that the sideways jerk is handled very well here's another running video I shot yep I gave my blood and sweat to this video again you can see that the X 50 pros gimbal camera system is way more stable it's a great difference and I know we're not comparing the video quality but it's pretty good I think yes the contrast is a bit on the higher side but I still like it the video quality is very good in fact I even did a running test with the Galaxy S 20 ultra now I know that the s20 ultra has a super steady mode but that only works in 1080p and our shooting videos in 4k 30fps so I took the comparison video with the usual modes okay so here is the video and here to the X 50 pros gimbal system is the winner the s20 ultra video just has a lot more shakiness in it and it's just impressive Wow the Vives 50 plus camera handles it so it's actually impressed with the vivo x 50 pros video performance and kind of done with the running but the video wants what it wants so I wanted to check how things are in loaded because generally when we shoot a video moving around in low-light videos are really shaky bloody so I want to check that and yes again I went for a run actually no first I shot this comparison video from the car from both the iPhone 11 Pro and Evo X 50 Pro and both the pros stayed well the expert the pro video is on the darker side a bit but the stability is spot-on next I did the running yeah so here's a video comparison and well quite unexpectedly now the VX 50 Pro again is just fantastic the iPhone 11 Pro video is just getting me dizzy or maybe it's because off all the running anyway it is super shaky compared to the vivo X 50 probe stability aside I did notice the x50 pros low-light videos are a bit too dark when compared to the iPhone Len Pro so maybe that's a compromise in the system but hopefully this can be fixed in the future overall I think the new gimbal camera system in the vivo x50 Pro works pretty well I mean it's not perfect because the video quality isn't as good as the iPhone 11 Pro especially in low-light where things are darker but when it comes to stability that gimbal camera system is impressive to be honest is just exciting to see a new phone with a new tech in 2020 because most of the phones I've used so far into an already have been generic with the usual standard specs see I just really hope that we get to see more and more innovative phones with new interesting technologies that actually get us excited well here's okay anyway what do you think of the new gimbal camera tech in the V Werks 50 Pro tell us in the comment section below and yeah I did not talk about the rest of the phone because I was focusing was the new tech so if you want to know all the specs all the details and check out this beautiful design go ahead check out a link from the description down below also
