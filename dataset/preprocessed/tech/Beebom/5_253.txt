starts from 6th august yeah note that date and trust me there are some great deals beat on premium smartphones budget smartphones or even mid ranges so yeah stick till the end to know all of the best smartphone deals well let's get started okay let's start with the premium category first and the first deal that i want to talk about is on the iphone 11. i mean the iphone 11 is a great iphone because it brings the latest a13 bionic chipset powerful dual cameras on the back including the very cool ultra wide angle lens and flagship features like ip68 rating wireless charging and more so the iphone 11 usually goes for rupees 68 300 but during the prime day sale it's getting an amazing discount of around 8 000 rupees bringing the price down to 59 triple nine yeah that's 60k i think that's a very good deal especially because a lot of people have always wanted to get a good deal on the iphone 11. the next phone on the list is the oneplus 7t which is one of the amazon specials devices i mean this is the phone that a lot of people have been interested in especially because the oneplus 8 has been priced higher and the 70 brings a lot of the features on the 8 including the 90 hertz amoled stereo speakers the powerful snapdragon 855 plus chipset and triple cameras that include ois and a telephoto lens in a very attractive looking design so usually the oneplus 7t 8gb 256gb variant goes for 37 triple night but during the prime day sale it will be getting a discount of 2000 rupees to bring the price down to 35 triple nine which is a good price but there's more if you exchange your phone you get another bonus of two thousand rupees bringing the price down to thirty three triple nine that's not all there'll be even discounts on hdfc bank cards and icsa bank cards so you can get the price even lower because the oneplus 7t will be available with a nine month no cost emi offer so say you get the price down to 33 triple nine and you take the nine month no cost ami well you don't have to pay any added interest and you only have to pay rupees 3700 monthly and if you think about it around rupees 120 per day so yeah no cost emi offers are great next up the oneplus 7t pro which is another great premium phone because it brings a truly bezel-less curved amoled display that's very very rare these days when most phones are going for the punch hole design anyway the oneplus 70 pro also has a premium design last year's flagship chipset the snapdragon 855 plus and the great oxygen os experience the 70 pro generally goes for 47 triple nine but it's getting a big discount of 4 000 rupees to bring it to a great 43 triple i plus there's also an exchange bonus of 3000 rupees so you can basically get it for 40 triple nine that's a great deal and there's the 12 month no cost emi offer as well to make things even better moving on another premium phone that's getting a deal is the galaxy s10 i know it's last year's flagship but it's still a very good premium looking phone i mean it does look beautiful right it has a beautiful dynamic amoled display and very good triple cameras and some good specs as well so the usual price of the s10 is rupees 49 990 but on the prime day sale it gets a discount of almost 5 000 rupees so you can buy it for 44 triple nine plus there's a nine month no cost emi offer so good deal on the s10 but those are the premium smartphones but a couple of mid ranges also getting a pretty good discount okay so first up there's the redmi k20 pro which is honestly more of a budget flagship than a mid-ranger but it's honestly a great phone to buy if you want a bezel-less ammo display great performance with the snapdragon 855 good cameras and solid battery life i mean it usually goes for the piece 24 25 000 for the 6gb 128gb variant and even at that price it's a good deal i think but thanks for the prime day you can get it for a discounted price of 22.99 that's even better i mean i know a lot of people that have been thinking buy the k20 pro and this is a great price for this phone another mid-ranger that's getting a deal is the vivo v17 this is the phone that's pretty good looking both from the front and the back and it has got pretty good specs like a quad camera setup a 4000 mah battery with 18 watt fast charging and the snapdragon 675 now the vivo v17 is priced at rs 24 990 and it's getting a discount of 3 000 rupees that's pretty great right so at the end of the day you can get the vivo v17 for 21 990 that's nice so the premium smartphones and the mid ranges but they also deal on a few budget smartphones first up on the budget smartphones is the galaxy m31 very popular and i know the m31s has arrived but the m31s is close to 20k and if you want an mcd's phone closer to 15k there's the m31 tm31 has an amoled display a
