it's pubg time [Music] hey guys this is from you.com and pubg is here in india now you're not watching an old video this is not about bgmi i'm talking about pubg new state the next gen battle royal game now this is a game that's all set to launch in india on 11th november but we got a close nice look at the game thanks to a early look at the cinematic trailer of the game along with some more videos so what's new in pubg news state how is it different to bgmi well i'm gonna answer all these questions but let's start with some action from the cinematic trailer that was cool right i mean i love the new futuristic sort of world that pubg new state brings see the game is set in a post-apocalyptic dystopian age in 2051 with new futuristic technology first of all new state comes with a new map called troy which is basically a destroyed urban city in america in 2051. it's an 8x8 map with all new places to explore but there are four locations that should be the popular landing spots there's exhibit hall which is like the heart of troy it'll probably be the pachinky of this map and it is a wide open air center with different vertical levels which will make it an interesting area for combat then there's the mall and it's a proper mall with escalators and everything this too has wide spaces and even an open roof for landing and i think the scout drones which i will talk about in a bit will come in really handy here it's also the laboratory with four levels of corridor which gives me school and military base vibes i also noticed the bulletproof glass here which i think should be part of more locations another cool location in troy is the trailer park which has all these trailers and it should be fun especially with this ramp which you can jump off to run away or you know do some cool stunts and yeah this ramp brings me to the vehicles in pubg new state i mean you saw this cool new motorcycle that's giving me harley vibes and this is called the vulture as you can see it looks really cool and this is a bike that starts off slow but it does seem to have a nice boost another new vehicle is the volta which is an electric car that's futuristic looking and pretty speedy as you can see in action another new electric car is nova which is also really cool looking and there's also this insane looking bike which is also electric and even the buggy now is ev and it's called evax apart from that is the usual uaz in a slightly modified design now coming to the guns they're the same so you still get the m4 dp m24 groza etc and you still get the good old pan now the new thing here is that you can customize the weapons you'll find the customization kits in care packages and with this you'll be able to say turn the m16a4 into a fully auto weapon you can also replace the barrel to increase the range of the gun in fact this super cool shot from the cinematic trailer makes me think that you'll be able to attach a grenade launcher to any assault rifle now this weapon customization feature sounds awesome but i'm pretty sure there'll be some compromises to this apart from the guns there's also a new vest called dyneema west along with the other usual west and this is interesting because this brings enhanced protection against five five six nine mil and 45 acp ammo now this sounds pretty insane but there is a trade-off this west is sort of weaker against 762 300 magnum and 12 gauge ammo so basically if you get an enemy with an ak or m762 you're done there's also the new drone store in new state you'll find these drone credits as normal drop loot and you can use these drone credits to buy ammo guns anything now i know there's a similar feature in bgmi but what's different here is that things you buy are delivered by a drone which is kind of fancy but also quite attention grabbing with this blue flare so enemies will spot you and they can even destroy the drones now apart from that the drone store has a new green flare gun which lets you revive your dead teammates plus there's even a surge drone in the drone store which lets you spot enemies from the air now another cool thing in new state is that apart from the fact that you can revive your teammates you can also revive enemies with this hand button and add them to your squad now that is interesting right anyway let me talk about the gameplay as well because i noticed some really cool changes there now first up when you have a gun in hand you see the ammo like this right next to the gun i also noticed footsteps and gunshots on the main screen and not just in the map which is something you can turn on or off apart from this you'll be able to switch between heating options like this which is something you can also enable and disable the graphics settings have changed a bit too you can set the graphics up to ultra and the frame rate up to max you can also choose the graphics api and i also notice a new role button in the controls so you'll be able to roll on the ground to move forward now lastly there are obviously new skins and characters in new state belonging to different factions like mayhem hunters etc it's all part of the storyline in new state now one big problem that pubg news state is solving for a lot of indian players is that you'll finally be able to play with players from across the globe see unlike bgmi which is limited to india pubg new state is a proper global game now i know you're wondering this is pubg pubg news state so wouldn't it get bad well it shouldn't be see pubg new state is developed by crafton and pubg studios there's no tencent here so it's all korean so yeah shouldn't get back anyway that's what's new with pubg new state and i think it looks fun i mean it is pubg so it's all the same controls and basics but i like the new futuristic map the weapon customization the new vehicles and from all the gameplay i've seen it seems like a more smoother more optimized game than bgmi but yeah that's something i'll have to test when the game arrives also i hope the new state has lesser hackers than vgmi well like i said at the start pubg news state is launching on both app store and play store on 11th november and it's up for pre-register so you can check it out from the links below also tell us how you like this new pubg game comment down below your thoughts also give this video like make sure to
