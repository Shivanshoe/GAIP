of late we have been hearing a lot about real me and why not it's lots of great smartphones it has become the fastest growing smartphone brand in India so yeah real me is killing it but is there's a big bug but first let me talk about really killing it and then I will get back to the but no puns intended Oh certainly arrived as an oppa sub brand in 2018 with the real me one in May and honestly I wasn't very impressed I mean it did not have a fingerprint scanner it wasn't really the most attractive looking phone and yeah it had its issues yeah we did not even make a video on it but then really started making some good phones really me to pro arrived in October 2018 and it was a great budget smartphone capable of taking on the very popular let me know if I Pro I mean this is what I said in a real v2 Pro review the real me to pro is a phone that I will recommend say if the really to pro was a good start and after that she'll be launched a ton of new smartphones in 2019 all with the aim of taking on Xiaomi the market leader in India see every time I read my phone launched a new real me phone arrived to take on that and you know what I loved it and before real mission we had kind of become the monopoly when it comes to budget smartphones in India anyone wanted to buy a new smartphone in the sub 10k of the sub 20k price segment I recommend a Xiaomi phone no doubts however in 2019 really made cha me sweat it not the really three Pro that X the Y pro the XT and recently the x2 all great budget smartphones with a simple aim taking on ready every single phone it really has launched has been aimed at Sharma when Xiaomi Lord the note 7 proved Snapdragon 675 he'll be not the three pro Snapdragon 710 and we all know how to find out when Xiaomi and out the noted proven 64 megapixel camera in China real nice grabbed through and launched the XT with the 64 megapixel camera in India first - yeah make sure they are forced these are just two examples but it's been clear the read miss plan has been to take on Xiaomi and when this plan worked Read Me went from three percent market share in q3 2018 to fourteen point three percent market share in q3 2019 that's an ear on your growth of almost 400 person more than 400 buses yeah as you can see that is some great success for a company that's just a little more than a year old and well it is very close to beating vivo and Samson plus a lot of reports this year suggests Shami won't be the smartphone leader in 2020 and we all know the reason for that real me yes real me is absolutely killing it but it's also killing its very own smartphones yeah let's talk about that but 10 second silence for all of these comments that we get see really strategy has been all about launching phones left right and center all with the aim of taking down Shaw me and well this plan has clearly worked however this plan has also become a little bit of a problem let me explain serenely has become popular with its great smartphones in the sub 20k price range now at the start or a 19 in April to be exact the company launched real meet three Pro which was a great budget smartphone but the company then went ahead and launched the real me X in July now I get it the readme egg surprise a little higher so that's kind of okay but then the company launched really fibro in August so basically gap two months between the real me three Pro and the D me five Pro anyway serene me fibro was a good phone too I'm sure a lot of people bought it only to feel upset we need him in order to deal me XT the very next month yeah September that is insane now the XT was the phone I thought was great and I was thinking this is the last budget phone from real me this year well I was wrong the company went ahead and not to read me x2 it's basically a gap for month between the X 2 and X T this is insane look when you buy a new smartphone in this day and age you kind of expect it to be new for at least six months right I mean I know a lot of people who are upset about real me out dating their phones in just a month or two it's like really does not have a plan and they're just launching phones to take on the competition even in the sub 10k segment the low-end segment there's a lot of confusion so into a 19 the company launched six low-end smartphones the readme c1 that he let me see to the real me three three me three I didn't mean five and remove 5s now all of these phones are still available out there yes you can buy every single one of them right now it is super confusing it's not like every other smartphone maker launches so many phones in here just look at Xiaomi so in 2019 Xiaomi launched two major smartphones in the sub to Nek price segment the redmi note seventh row and the redmi note 8 pro and that's pretty much it yes there was also the me three but that wasn't really competing with the real me phones but I just hope in 2020 readme has a more clear strategy of launching its phones phones that are priced differently for different price segments and foresters inspire a lot of trust in people that the reason before they're buying won't get outdated in a month or two and it's just the best phone out there so real me if you're listening make it happen well do you agree with us what do you think about will be launching so many phones in AF tell us in the comment section below also give this video a thumbs up if you agree with us and make sure to share it with your friends about the really three pro 5 pro or the xt make sure to share it lastly subscribe per channel for more amazing tech videos well that's me signing off thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one [Music]
